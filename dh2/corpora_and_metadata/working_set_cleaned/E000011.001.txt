an introduction to the principles of morals and legislation by jeremy bentham esq bencher of lincolns inn and late of queens college oxford m a with the last corrections by the author and additions from dumonts traités de legislation c b the first edition of this work was printed in the year    0 the work was first published in      i preface the following sheets were as the titlepage expresses printed so long ago as the year    0 the design in pursuance of which they were written was not so extensive as that announced by the present title they had at that time no other destination than that of serving as an introduction to a plan of a penal code in terminis designed to follow them in the same volume the body of the work had received its completion according to the then present extent of the authors views when in the investigation of some flaws he had discovered he found himself unexpectedly entangled in an unsuspected corner of the metaphysical maze a suspension at first not apprehended to be more than a temporary one necessarily ensued suspension brought on coolness and coolness aided by other concurrent causes ripened into disgust imperfections pervading the whole mass had already been pointed out by the sincerity of severe and discerning friends and conscience had certified the justness of their censure the inordinate length of some of the chapters the apparent inutility of others and the dry and metaphysical turn of the whole suggested an apprehension that if published in its present form the work would contend under great disadvantages for any chance it might on other accounts possess of being read and consequently of being of use but though in this manner the idea of completing the present work slid insensibly aside that was not by any means the case with the considerations which had led him to engage in it every opening which promised to afford the lights he stood in need of was still pursued as occasion arose the several departments connected with that in which he had at first engaged were successively explored insomuch that in one branch or other of the pursuit his researches have nearly embraced the whole field of legislation several causes have conspired at present to bring to light under this new title a work which under its original one had been imperceptibly but as it had seemed irrevocably doomed to oblivion in the course of eight years materials for various works corresponding to the different branches of the subject of legislation had been produced and some nearly reduced to shape and in every one of those works the principles exhibited in the present publication had been found so necessary that either to transcribe them piecemeal or to exhibit them somewhere where they could be referred to in the lump was found unavoidable the former course would have occasioned repetitions too bulky to be employed without necessity in the execution of a plan unavoidably so voluminous the latter was therefore indisputably the preferable one to publish the materials in the form in which they were already printed or to work them up into a new one was therefore the only alternative the latter had all along been his wish and had time and the requisite degree of alacrity been at command it would as certainly have been realized cogent considerations however concur with the irksomeness of the task in placing the accomplishment of it at present at an unfathomable distance another consideration is that the suppression of the present work had it been ever so decidedly wished is no longer altogether in his power in the course of so long an interval various incidents have introduced copies into various hands from some of which they have been transferred by deaths and other accidents into others that are unknown to him detached but considerable extracts have even been published without any dishonourable views for the name of the author was very honestly subjoined to them but without his privity and in publications undertaken without his knowledge it may perhaps be necessary to add to complete his excuse for offering to the public a work pervaded by blemishes which have not escaped even the authors partial eye that the censure so justly bestowed upon the form did not extend itself to the matter in sending it thus abroad into the world with all its imperfections upon its head he ii thinks it may be of assistance to the few readers he can expect to receive a short intimation of the chief particulars in respect of which it fails of corresponding with his maturer views it will thence be observed how in some respects it fails of quadrating with the design announced by its original title as in others it does with that announced by the one it bears at present an introduction to a work which takes for its subject the totality of any science ought to contain all such matters and such matters only as belong in common to every particular branch of that science or at least to more branches of it than one compared with its present title the present work fails in both ways of being conformable to that rule as an introduction to the principles of morals in addition to the analysis it contains of the extensive ideas signified by the terms pleasure pain motive and disposition it ought to have given a similar analysis of the not less extensive though much less determinate ideas annexed to the terms emotion passion appetite virtue vice and some others including the names of the particular virtues and vices but as the true and if he conceives right the only true groundwork for the development of the latter set of terms has been laid by the explanation of the former the completion of such a dictionary so to style it would in comparison of the commencement be little more than a mechanical operation again as an introduction to the principles of legislation in general it ought rather to have included matters belonging exclusively to the civil branch than matters more particularly applicable to the penal the latter being but a means of compassing the ends proposed by the former in preference therefore or at least in priority to the several chapters which will be found relative to punishment it ought to have exhibited a set of propositions which have since presented themselves to him as affording a standard for the operations performed by government in the creation and distribution of proprietary and other civil rights he means certain axioms of what may be termed mental pathology expressive of the connexion betwixt the feelings of the parties concerned and the several classes of incidents which either call for or are produced by operations of the nature above mentioned the consideration of the division of offences and every thing else that belongs to offences ought besides to have preceded the consideration of punishment for the idea of punishment presupposes the idea of offence punishment as such not being inflicted but in consideration of offence lastly the analytical discussions relative to the classification of offences would according to his present views be transferred to a separate treatise in which the system of legislation is considered solely in respect of its form in other words in respect of its method and terminology in these respects the performance fails of coming up to the authors own ideas of what should have been exhibited in a work bearing the title he has now given it viz that of an introduction to the principles of morals and legislation he knows however of no other that would be less unsuitable nor in particular would so adequate an intimation of its actual contents have been given by a title corresponding to the more limited design with which it was written viz that of serving as an introduction to a penal code yet more dry and tedious as a great part of the discussions it contains must unavoidably be found by the bulk of readers he knows not how to regret the having written them nor even the having made them public under every head the practical uses to which the discussions contained under that head appeared applicable are indicated nor is there he believes a single proposition that he has not found occasion to build upon in the penning of some article or other of those provisions of detail of which a body of law authoritative or unauthoritative must be composed he will venture to specify particularly in this view the several chapters shortly characterized by the words sensibility actions intentionality consciousness motives dispositions consequences even in the enormous chapter on the division of offences which notwithstanding the forced compression the plan has undergone in several of its parts in manner there mentioned occupies no fewer than one hundred and four closely printed quarto pages† the ten concluding ones are employed in a statement of the practical advantages that may be reaped from the plan of classification which it exhibits those in whose sight the defence of usury has been fortunate enough to find favour may reckon as one instance of those advantages the discovery of the principles iii developed in that little treatise in the preface to an anonymous tract published so long ago as in      he had hinted at the utility of a natural classification of offences in the character of a test for distinguishing genuine from spurious ones the case of usury is one among a number of instances of the truth of that observation a note at the end of sect xxxv chap xvi of the present publication may serve to show how the opinions developed in that tract owed their origin to the difficulty experienced in the attempt to find a place in his system for that imaginary offence to some readers as a means of helping them to support the fatigue of wading through an analysis of such enormous length he would almost recommend the beginning with those ten concluding pages one good at least may result from the present publication viz that the more he has trespassed on the patience of the reader on this occasion the less need he will have so to do on future ones so that this may do to those the office which is done by books of pure mathematics to books of mixed mathematics and natural philosophy the narrower the circle of readers is within which the present work may be condemned to confine itself the less limited may be the number of those to whom the fruits of his succeeding labours may be found accessible he may therefore in this respect find himself in the condition of those philosophers of antiquity who are represented as having held two bodies of doctrine a popular and an occult one but with this difference that in his instance the occult and the popular will he hopes be found as consistent as in those they were contradictory and that in his production whatever there is of occultness has been the pure result of sad necessity and in no respect of choice having in the course of this advertisement had such frequent occasion to allude to different arrangements as having been suggested by more extensive and maturer views it may perhaps contribute to the satisfaction of the reader to receive a short intimation of their nature the rather as without such explanation references made here and there to unpublished works might be productive of perplexity and mistake the following then are the titles of the works by the publication of which his present designs would be completed they are exhibited in the order which seemed to him best fitted for apprehension and in which they would stand disposed were the whole assemblage ready to come out at once but the order in which they will eventually appear may probably enough be influenced in some degree by collateral and temporary considerations part the  st—principles of legislation in matters of civil more distinctively termed private distributive or for shortness distributive law part the  d—principles of legislation in matters of penal law part the  d—principles of legislation in matters of procedure uniting in one view the criminal and civil branches between which no line can be drawn but a very indistinct one and that continually liable to variation part the  th—principles of legislation in matters of reward part the  th—principles of legislation in matters of public distributive more concisely as well as familiarly termed constitutional law part the  th—principles of legislation in matters of political tactics or of the art of maintaining order in the proceedings of political assemblies so as to direct them to the end of their institution viz by a system of rules which are to the constitutional branch in some respects what the law of procedure is to the civil and the penal part the  th—principles of legislation in matters betwixt nation and nation or to use a new though not inexpressive appellation in matters of international law part the  th—principles of legislation in matters of finance part the  th—principles of legislation in matters of political economy part the  0th—plan of a body of law complete in all its branches considered in respect of its form in other words in respect of its method and terminology including a view of the origination and connexion of the ideas expressed by the short list of terms the exposition of which contains all that can be said with propriety to belong to the head of universal jurisprudence† the use of the principles laid down under the above several heads is to prepare the way for the body of law itself exhibited in terminis and which to be complete with reference to any political state must consequently be calculated for the meridian and adapted to the circumstances of some one such state in particular had he an unlimited power of drawing upon time and every other condition necessary it would be his wish to postpone the publication of each part to the completion of the whole in particular the use of the ten parts which exhibit what appear to him the dictates of utility in every line being no other than to furnish reasons for the several corresponding provisions contained in the body of law itself the exact truth of the former can never be precisely ascertained till iv the provisions to which they are destined to apply are themselves ascertained and that in terminis but as the infirmity of human nature renders all plans precarious in the execution in proportion as they are extensive in the design and as he has already made considerable advances in several branches of the theory without having made correspondent advances in the practical applications he deems it more than probable that the eventual order of publication will not correspond exactly with that which had it been equally practicable would have appeared most eligible of this irregularity the unavoidable result will be a multitude of imperfections which if the execution of the body of law in terminis had kept pace with the development of the principles so that each part had been adjusted and corrected by the other might have been avoided his conduct however will be the less swayed by this inconvenience from his suspecting it to be of the number of those in which the personal vanity of the author is much more concerned than the instruction of the public since whatever amendments may be suggested in the detail of the principles by the literal fixation of the provisions to which they are relative may easily be made in a corrected edition of the former succeeding upon the publication of the latter in the course of the ensuing pages references will be found as already intimated some to the plan of a penal code to which this work was meant as an introduction some to other branches of the abovementioned general plan under titles somewhat different from those by which they have been mentioned here the giving this warning is all which it is in the authors power to do to save the reader from the perplexity of looking out for what has not as yet any existence the recollection of the change of plan will in like manner account for several similar incongruities not worth particularizing allusion was made at the outset of this advertisement to some unspecified difficulties as the causes of the original suspension and unfinished complexion of the present work ashamed of his defeat and unable to dissemble it he knows not how to refuse himself the benefit of such an apology as a slight sketch of the nature of those difficulties may afford the discovery of them was produced by the attempt to solve the questions that will be found at the conclusion of the volume wherein consisted the identity and completeness of a law what the distinction and where the separation between a penal and a civil law what the distinction and where the separation between the penal and other branches of the law to give a complete and correct answer to these questions it is but too evident that the relations and dependencies of every part of the legislative system with respect to every other must have been comprehended and ascertained but it is only upon a view of these parts themselves that such an operation could have been performed to the accuracy of such a survey one necessary condition would therefore be the complete existence of the fabric to be surveyed of the performance of this condition no example is as yet to be met with any where common law as it styles itself in england judiciary law as it might more aptly be styled every where that fictitious composition which has no known person for its author no known assemblage of words for its substance forms every where the main body of the legal fabric like that fancied ether which in default of sensible matter fills up the measure of the universe shreds and scraps of real law stuck on upon that imaginary ground compose the furniture of every national code what follows that he who for the purpose just mentioned or for any other wants an example of a complete body of law to refer to must begin with making one there is or rather there ought to be a logic of the will as well as of the understanding the operations of the former faculty are neither less susceptible nor less worthy than those of the latter of being delineated by rules of these two branches of that recondite art aristotle saw only the latter succeeding logicians treading in the steps of their great founder have concurred in seeing with no other eyes yet so far as a difference can be assigned between branches so intimately connected whatever difference there is in point of importance is in favour of the logic of the will since it is only by their capacity of directing the operations of this faculty that the operations of the understanding are of any consequence of this logic of the will the science of law considered in respect of its form is the most considerable branch—the most important application it is to the art of legislation what the science of anatomy is to the art of medicine with this difference that the subject of it is what the artist has to work with instead of being what he has to operate upon nor is the body politic less in danger from a want of acquaintance with the one science than the body natural from ignorance in the other one example amongst a thousand that might be adduced in proof of this assertion may be seen in the note which terminates this volume such then were the difficulties such the preliminaries—an unexampled work to achieve and then a new science to create a new branch to add to one of the most abstruse of sciences v yet more a body of proposed law how complete soever would be comparatively useless and uninstructive unless explained and justified and that in every tittle by a continued accompaniment a perpetual commentary of reasons which reasons that the comparative value of such as point in opposite directions may be estimated and the conjunct force of such as point in the same direction may be felt must be marshalled and put under subordination to such extensive and leading ones as are termed principles there must be therefore not one system only but two parallel and connected systems running on together the one of legislative provisions the other of political reasons each affording to the other correction and support are enterprises like these achievable he knows not this only he knows that they have been undertaken proceeded in and that some progress has been made in all of them he will venture to add if at all achievable never at least by one to whom the fatigue of attending to discussions as arid as those which occupy the ensuing pages would either appear useless or feel intolerable he will repeat it boldly for it has been said before him truths that form the basis of political and moral science are not to be discovered but by investigations as severe as mathematical ones and beyond all comparison more intricate and extensive the familiarity of the terms is a presumption but it is a most fallacious one of the facility of the matter truths in general have been called stubborn things the truths just mentioned are so in their own way they are not to be forced into detached and general propositions unincumbered with explanations and exceptions they will not compress themselves into epigrams they recoil from the tongue and the pen of the declaimer they flourish not in the same soil with sentiment they grow among thorns and are not to be plucked like daisies by infants as they run labour the inevitable lot of humanity is in no tract more inevitable than here in vain would an alexander bespeak a peculiar road for royal vanity or a ptolemy a smoother one for royal indolence there is no kings road no stadtholders gate to legislative any more than to mathematic science xiv   chapter i of the principle of utility nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters pain and pleasure it is for them alone to point out what we ought to do as well as to determine what we shall do on the one hand the standard of right and wrong on the other the chain of causes and effects are fastened to their throne they govern us in all we do in all we say in all we think every effort we can make to throw off our subjection will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it in words a man may pretend to abjure their empire but in reality he will remain subject to it all the while the principle of utility recognises this subjection and assumes it for the foundation of that system the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and of law systems which attempt to question it deal in sounds instead of sense in caprice instead of reason in darkness instead of light but enough of metaphor and declamation it is not by such means that moral science is to be improved ii the principle of utility is the foundation of the present work it will be proper therefore at the outset to give an explicit and determinate account of what is meant by it by the principle† of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question or what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness i say of every action whatsoever and therefore not only of every action of a private individual but of every measure of government iii by utility is meant that property in any object whereby it tends to produce benefit   advantage pleasure good or happiness all this in the present case comes to the same thing or what comes again to the same thing to prevent the happening of mischief pain evil or unhappiness to the party whose interest is considered if that party be the community in general then the happiness of the community if a particular individual then the happiness of that individual iv the interest of the community is one of the most general expressions that can occur in the phraseology of morals no wonder that the meaning of it is often lost when it has a meaning it is this the community is a fictitious body composed of the individual persons who are considered as constituting as it were its members the interest of the community then is what—the sum of the interests of the several members who compose it v it is in vain to talk of the interest of the community without understanding what is the interest of the individual a thing is said to promote the interest or to be for the interest of an individual when it tends to add to the sum total of his pleasures or what comes to the same thing to diminish the sum total of his pains vi an action then may be said to be conformable to the principle of utility or for shortness sake to utility meaning with respect to the community at large when the tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish it vii a measure of government which is but a particular kind of action performed by a particular person or persons may be said to be conformable to or dictated by the principle of utility when in like manner the tendency which it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any which it has to diminish it viii when an action or in particular a measure of government is supposed by a man to be conformable to the principle of utility it may be convenient for the purposes of discourse to imagine a kind of law or dictate called a law or dictate of utility and to speak of the action in question as being conformable to such law or dictate ix a man may be said to be a partizan of the principle of utility when the approbation or disapprobation he annexes to any action or to any measure is determined by and proportioned to the tendency which he conceives it to have to augment or to diminish the happiness of the community or in other words to its conformity or unconformity to the laws or dictates of utility x of an action that is conformable to the principle of utility one may always say either that it is one that ought to be done or at least that it is not one that ought not to be done one may say also that it is right it should be done at least that it is not wrong it should be done that it is a right action at least that it is not a wrong action when thus interpreted the words ought and right and wrong and others of that stamp have a meaning when otherwise they have none xi has the rectitude of this principle been ever formally contested it should seem that it had by those who have not known what they have been meaning is it susceptible of any direct proof it should seem not for that which is used to prove every thing else cannot itself be proved a chain of proofs must have their commencement somewhere to give such proof is as impossible as it is needless xii not that there is or ever has been that human creature breathing however stupid or perverse who has not on many perhaps on most occasions of his life deferred to it by the natural constitution of the human frame on most occasions of their lives men in general embrace this principle without thinking of it if not for the ordering of their own actions yet for the trying of their own actions as well as of those of other men there have been at the same time not many perhaps even of the most intelligent who have been disposed to embrace it purely and without reserve there are even few who have not taken some occasion or other to quarrel with it either on account of their not understanding always how to apply it or on account of some prejudice or other which they were afraid to examine into or could not bear to part with for such is the stuff that man is made of in principle and in practice in a right track and in a wrong one the rarest of all human qualities is consistency xiii when a man attempts to combat the principle of utility it is with reasons drawn without his being aware of it from that very principle itself† his arguments if they prove   any thing prove not that the principle is wrong but that according to the applications he supposes to be made of it it is misapplied is it possible for a man to move the earth yes but he must first find out another earth to stand upon xiv to disprove the propriety of it by arguments is impossible but from the causes that have been mentioned or from some confused or partial view of it a man may happen to be disposed not to relish it where this is the case if he thinks the settling of his opinions on such a subject worth the trouble let him take the following steps and at length perhaps he may come to reconcile himself to it   let him settle with himself whether he would wish to discard his principle altogether if so let him consider what it is that all his reasonings in matters of politics especially can amount to   if he would let him settle with himself whether he would judge and act without any principle or whether there is any other he would judge and act by   if there be let him examine and satisfy himself whether the principle he thinks he has found is really any separate intelligible principle or whether it be not a mere principle in words a kind of phrase which at bottom expresses neither more nor less than the mere averment of his own unfounded sentiments that is what in another person he might be apt to call caprice   if he is inclined to think that his own approbation or disapprobation annexed to the idea of an act without any regard to its consequences is a sufficient foundation for him to judge and act upon let him ask himself whether his sentiment is to be a standard of right and wrong with respect to every other man or whether every mans sentiment has the same privilege of being a standard to itself   in the first case let him ask himself whether his principle is not despotical and hostile to all the rest of human race   in the second case whether it is not anarchial and whether at this rate there are not as many different standards of right and wrong as there are men and whether even to the same man the same thing which is right today may not without the least change in its nature be wrong tomorrow and whether the same thing is not right and wrong in the same place at the same time and in either case whether all argument is not at an end and whether when two men have said i like this and i dont like it they can upon such a principle have any thing more to say   if he should have said to himself no for that the sentiment which he proposes as a standard must be grounded on reflection let him say on what particulars the reflection is to turn if on particulars having relation to the utility of the act then let him say whether this is not deserting his own principle and borrowing assistance from that   very one in opposition to which he sets it up or if not on those particulars on what other particulars   if he should be for compounding the matter and adopting his own principle in part and the principle of utility in part let him say how far he will adopt it   when he has settled with himself where he will stop then let him ask himself how he justifies to himself the adopting it so far and why he will not adopt it any farther  0 admitting any other principle than the principle of utility to be a right principle a principle that it is right for a man to pursue admitting what is not true that the word right can have a meaning without reference to utility let him say whether there is any such thing as a motive that a man can have to pursue the dictates of it if there is let him say what that motive is and how it is to be distinguished from those which enforce the dictates of utility if not then lastly let him say what it is this other principle can be good for chapter ii of principles adverse to that of utility i if the principle of utility be a right principle to be governed by and that in all cases it follows from what has been just observed that whatever principle differs from it in any case must necessarily be a wrong one to prove any other principle therefore to be a wrong one there needs no more than just to show it to be what it is a principle of which the dictates are in some point or other different from those of the principle of utility to state it is to confute it ii a principle may be different from that of utility in two ways   by being constantly opposed to it this is the case with a principle which may be termed the principle of asceticism   by being sometimes opposed to it and sometimes not as it may happen this is the case with another which may be termed the principle of sympathy and antipathy iii by the principle of asceticism i mean that principle which like the principle of utility approves or disapproves of any action according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question but in an inversive manner approving of actions in as far as they tend to diminish his happiness disapproving of them in as far as they tend to augment it iv it is evident that any one who reprobates any the least particle of pleasure as such from whatever source derived is pro tanto a partizan of the principle of asceticism it is only upon that principle and not from the principle of utility that the most abominable pleasure which the vilest of malefactors ever reaped from his crime would be to be reprobated if it stood alone the case is that it never does stand alone but is necessarily followed by such a quantity of pain or what comes to the same thing such a chance for a certain quantity of pain that the pleasure in comparison of it is as nothing and this is the true and sole but perfectly sufficient reason for making it a ground for punishment v there are two classes of men of very different complexions by whom the principle of asceticism appears to have been embraced the one a set of moralists the other a set of religionists different accordingly have been the motives which appear to have recommended it to the notice of these different parties hope that is the prospect of pleasure seems to have animated the former hope the aliment of philosophic pride the hope of honour and reputation at the hands of men fear that is the prospect of pain the latter fear the offspring of superstitious fancy the fear of future punishment at the hands of a splenetic and revengeful deity i say in this case fear for of the invisible future fear is more powerful than hope   these circumstances characterize the two different parties among the partizans of the principle of asceticism the parties and their motives different the principle the same vi the religious party however appear to have carried it farther than the philosophical they have acted more consistently and less wisely the philosophical party have scarcely gone farther than to reprobate pleasure the religious party have frequently gone so far as to make it a matter of merit and of duty to court pain the philosophical party have hardly gone farther than the making pain a matter of indifference it is no evil they have said they have not said it is a good they have not so much as reprobated all pleasure in the lump they have discarded only what they have called the gross that is such as are organical or of which the origin is easily traced up to such as are organical they have even cherished and magnified the refined yet this however not under the name of pleasure to cleanse itself from the sordes of its impure original it was necessary it should change its name the honourable the glorious the reputable the becoming the honestum the decorum it was to be called in short any thing but pleasure vii from these two sources have flowed the doctrines from which the sentiments of the bulk of mankind have all along received a tincture of this principle some from the philosophical some from the religious some from both men of education more frequently from the philosophical as more suited to the elevation of their sentiments the vulgar more frequently from the superstitious as more suited to the narrowness of their intellect undilated by knowledge and to the abjectness of their condition continually open to the attacks of fear the tinctures however derived from the two sources would naturally intermingle insomuch that a man would not always know by which of them he was most influenced and they would often serve to corroborate and enliven one another it was this conformity that made a kind of alliance between parties of a complexion otherwise so dissimilar and disposed them to unite upon various occasions against the common enemy the partizan of the principle of utility whom they joined in branding with the odious name of epicurean viii the principle of asceticism however with whatever warmth it may have been embraced by its partizans as a rule of private conduct seems not to have been carried to any considerable length when applied to the business of government in a few instances it has been carried a little way by the philosophical party witness the spartan regimen though then perhaps it may be considered as having been a measure of security and an application though a precipitate and perverse application of the principle of utility scarcely in any instances to any considerable length by the religious for the various monastic orders and the societies of the quakers dumplers moravians and other religionists have been free societies whose regimen no man has been astricted to without the intervention of his own consent whatever merit a man may have thought there would be in making himself miserable no such notion seems ever to have occurred to any of them that it may be a merit much less a duty to make others miserable although it should seem that if a certain quantity of misery were a thing so desirable it would not matter much whether it were brought by each man upon himself or by one man upon another it is true that from the same source from whence among the religionists the attachment to the principle of asceticism took its rise flowed other doctrines and practices from which misery in abundance was produced in one man by the instrumentality of another witness the holy wars and the persecutions for religion but the passion for producing misery in these cases proceeded upon some special ground the exercise of it was confined to persons of particular descriptions they were tormented not as men but as heretics and infidels to have inflicted the same miseries on their fellowbelievers and fellowsectaries would have been as blameable in the eyes even of these religionists as in those of a partizan of the principle of utility for a man to give himself a certain number of stripes was indeed meritorious but to give the same number of stripes to another man not consenting would have been a sin we read of saints who for the good of their souls and the mortification of their bodies have voluntarily yielded themselves a prey to vermin but though many persons of this class have wielded the reins of empire we read of none who have set themselves to work and made laws on purpose with a view of stocking the body politic with the breed of highwaymen housebreakers or incendiaries if at any time they have suffered the nation to be preyed upon by swarms of idle pensioners or useless placemen it has rather been from negligence and imbecility than from any settled plan for oppressing and plundering of the people if at any time they have sapped the sources of national wealth by cramping commerce and driving the inhabitants into emigration it has been with other views and in pursuit of other ends if they have declaimed against   the pursuit of pleasure and the use of wealth they have commonly stopped at declamation they have not like lycurgus made express ordinances for the purpose of banishing the precious metals if they have established idleness by a law it has been not because idleness the mother of vice and misery is itself a virtue but because idleness say they is the road to holiness if under the notion of fasting they have joined in the plan of confining their subjects to a diet thought by some to be of the most nourishing and prolific nature it has been not for the sake of making them tributaries to the nations by whom that diet was to be supplied but for the sake of manifesting their own power and exercising the obedience of the people if they have established or suffered to be established punishments for the breach of celibacy they have done no more than comply with the petitions of those deluded rigorists who dupes to the ambitious and deeplaid policy of their rulers first laid themselves under that idle obligation by a vow ix the principle of asceticism seems originally to have been the reverie of certain hasty speculators who having perceived or fancied that certain pleasures when reaped in certain circumstances have at the long run been attended with pains more than equivalent to them took occasion to quarrel with every thing that offered itself under the name of pleasure having then got thus far and having forgot the point which they set out from they pushed on and went so much further as to think it meritorious to fall in love with pain even this we see is at bottom but the principle of utility misapplied x the principle of utility is capable of being consistently pursued and it is but tautology to say that the more consistently it is pursued the better it must ever be for humankind the principle of asceticism never was nor ever can be consistently pursued by any living creature let but one tenth part of the inhabitants of this earth pursue it consistently and in a days time they will have turned it into a hell xi among principles adverse to that of utility that which at this day seems to have most influence in matters of government is what may be called the principle of sympathy   and antipathy by the principle of sympathy and antipathy i mean that principle which approves or disapproves of certain actions not on account of their tending to augment the happiness nor yet on account of their tending to diminish the happiness of   the party whose interest is in question but merely because a man finds himself disposed to approve or disapprove of them holding up that approbation or disapprobation as a sufficient reason for itself and disclaiming the necessity of looking out for any extrinsic ground thus far in the general department of morals and in the particular department of politics measuring out the quantum as well as determining the ground of punishment by the degree of the disapprobation xii it is manifest that this is rather a principle in name than in reality it is not a positive principle of itself so much as a term employed to signify the negation of all principle what one expects to find in a principle is something that points out some external consideration as a means of warranting and guiding the internal sentiments of approbation and disapprobation this expectation is but ill fulfilled by a proposition which does neither more nor less than hold up each of those sentiments as a ground and standard for itself xiii in looking over the catalogue of human actions says a partizan of this principle in order to determine which of them are to be marked with the seal of disapprobation you need but to take counsel of your own feelings whatever you find in yourself a propensity to condemn is wrong for that very reason for the same reason it is also meet for punishment in what proportion it is adverse to utility or whether it be adverse to utility at all is a matter that makes no difference in that same proportion also is it meet for punishment if you hate much punish much if you hate little punish little punish as you hate if you hate not at all punish not at all the fine feelings of the soul are not to be overborne and tyrannized by the harsh and rugged dictates of political utility xiv the various systems that have been formed concerning the standard of right and wrong may all be reduced to the principle of sympathy and antipathy one account may serve for all of them they consist all of them in so many contrivances for avoiding the obligation of appealing to any external standard and for prevailing upon the reader to accept of the authors sentiment or opinion as a reason and that a sufficient one for itself the phrases different but the principle the same   xv it is manifest that the dictates of this principle will frequently coincide with those of utility though perhaps without intending any such thing probably more frequently than not and hence it is that the business  0 of penal justice is carried on upon that tolerable sort of footing upon which we see it carried on in common at this day for what more natural or more general ground of hatred to a practice can there be than the mischievousness of such practice what all men are exposed to suffer by all men will be disposed to hate it is far yet however from being a constant ground for when a man suffers it is not always that he knows what it is he suffers by a man may suffer grievously for instance by a new tax without being able to trace up the cause of his sufferings to the injustice of some neighbour who has eluded the payment of an old one xvi the principle of sympathy and antipathy is most apt to err on the side of severity it is for applying punishment in many cases which deserve none in many cases which deserve some it is for applying more than they deserve there is no incident imaginable be it ever so trivial and so remote from mischief from which this principle may not extract a ground of punishment any difference in taste any difference in opinion upon one subject as well as upon another no disagreement so trifling which perseverance and altercation will not render serious each becomes in the others eyes an enemy and if laws permit a criminal this is one of the circumstances by which the human race is distinguished not much indeed to its advantage from the brute creation xvii it is not however by any means unexampled for this principle to err on the side of lenity a near and perceptible mischief moves antipathy a remote and imperceptible mischief though not less real has no effect instances in proof of this will occur in numbers in the course of the work† it would be breaking in upon the order of it to give them here xviii it may be wondered perhaps that in all this while no mention has been made of the theological principle meaning that principle which professes to recur for the standard of right and wrong to the will of god but the case is this is not in fact a distinct principle it is never any thing more or less than one or other of the three beforementioned principles presenting itself under another    shape the will of god here meant cannot be his revealed will as contained in the sacred writings for that is a system which nobody ever thinks of recurring to at this time of day for the details of political administration and even before it can be applied to the details of private conduct it is universally allowed by the most eminent divines of all persuasions to stand in need of pretty ample interpretations else to what use are the works of those divines and for the guidance of these interpretations it is also allowed that some other standard must be assumed the will then which is meant on this occasion is that which may be called the presumptive will that is to say that which is presumed to be his will on account of the conformity of its dictates to those of some other principle what then may be this other principle it must be one or other of the three mentioned above for there cannot as we have seen be any more it is plain therefore that setting revelation out of the question no light can ever be thrown upon the standard of right and wrong by any thing that can be said upon the question what is gods will we may be perfectly sure indeed that whatever is right is conformable to the will of god but so far is that from answering the purpose of showing us what is right that it is necessary to know first whether a thing is right in order to know from thence whether it be conformable to the will of god xix there are two things which are very apt to be confounded but which it imports us carefully to distinguish—the motive or cause which by operating on the mind of an individual is productive of any act and the ground or reason which warrants a legislator or other bystander in regarding that act with an eye of approbation when the act happens in the particular instance in question to be productive of effects which we approve of much more if we happen to observe that the same motive may frequently be productive in other instances of the like effects we are apt to transfer our approbation to the motive itself and to assume as the just ground for the approbation we bestow on the act the circumstance of its originating from that motive it is in this way that the sentiment of antipathy has often been considered as a just ground of action antipathy for instance in such or such a case is the cause of an action which is attended with good effects but this does not make it a right ground of action in that case any more than in any other still farther not only the effects are good but the agent sees beforehand that they will be so this may make the action indeed a perfectly right action but it does not make antipathy a right ground of action for the same sentiment of antipathy if implicitly deferred to may be and very frequently is productive of the very worst effects antipathy therefore can never be a right ground of action no more therefore can resentment which as will be seen more particularly hereafter is but a modification of antipathy the only right ground of action that can possibly subsist is after all the consideration of utility which if it is a right principle of action and of approbation in any one case is so in every other other principles in abundance that is other motives may be the reasons why such and such an act has been done that is the reasons or causes of its being done but it is this alone that can be the reason why it might or ought to have been done antipathy or resentment requires always to be regulated to prevent its doing mischief to be regulated by what always by the principle of utility the principle of utility neither requires nor admits of any other regulator than itself objections to the principle of utility answered† trifling scruples and trifling verbal difficulties may be raised in opposition to the principle of utility but no real and distinct objection can be opposed to it indeed how can it be combated if not by reasons drawn from the principle itself to say that it is    dangerous is to say that to consult utility is contrary to utility the difficulty in this question arises from the perversity of language virtue has been represented as opposed to utility virtue it has been said consists in the sacrifice of our interests to our duties in order to express these ideas clearly it is necessary to observe that there are interests of different orders and that different interests are in certain circumstances incompatible virtue is the sacrifice of a smaller to a greater interest—of a momentary to a permanent interest—of a doubtful to a certain interest every idea of virtue which is not derived from this notion is as obscure as the motive to it is precarious those who for the sake of peace seeking to distinguish politics and morals assign utility as the principle of the first and justice of the second only exhibit the confusion of their ideas the whole difference between politics and morals is this the one directs the operations of governments the other directs the proceedings of individuals their common object is happiness that which is politically good cannot be morally bad unless the rules of arithmetic which are true for great numbers are false as respects those which are small evil may be done whilst it is believed that the principle of utility is followed a feeble and limited mind may deceive itself by considering only a part of the good and evil a man under the influence of passion may deceive himself by setting an extreme value upon one advantage which hides from him the inconveniences attending upon it what constitutes a wicked man is the habit of seeking pleasures hurtful to others and even this supposes the absence of many kinds of pleasures but we ought not to charge upon this principle the faults which are opposed to it and which it alone can serve to remove if a man calculate badly it is not arithmetic which is in fault it is himself if the reproaches which are heaped upon machiavel are well founded his errors do not arise from his having made use of the principle of utility but from his having made false applications of it the author of antimachiavel has well understood this he has refuted the prince by shewing that its maxims are mischievous and that bad faith is bad policy those who after reading the offices of cicero and the platonic moralists have a confused notion of utility as opposed to honesty often quote the saying of aristides with regard to the project which themistocles had unfolded to him alone the project of themistocles is very advantageous said aristides to the assembled people but it is very unjust they think they see here a decided opposition between utility and justice but they deceive themselves there is only a comparison of good and evil injustice is a term which presents to the mind the collection of all the evils resulting from a situation in which men can no longer trust one another aristides should have said the project of themistocles would be useful for a moment and hurtful for ages what it would bestow is nothing in comparison with what it would take away this principle of utility it is said is only the renewal of epicurism and it is known what ravages this doctrine made in manners it was always the doctrine of the most corrupt men epicurus it is true is the only one among the ancients who has the merit of having known the true source of morality but to suppose that his doctrine leads to the consequences imputed to it is to suppose that happiness can be the enemy of happiness itself sic prasentibus utaris voluptatibus ut futuris non noceas seneca is here in accordance with epicurus and what more can be desired in morals than the cutting off of every pleasure hurtful to ones self or to others but is not this the principle of utility but it may be said every one will be constituting himself judge of this utility every obligation will cease when he no longer thinks he perceives in it his own interest every one will constitute himself judge of his own utility this is and this ought to be otherwise man would not be a reasonable being he who is not a judge of what is suitable for himself is less than an infant is a fool the obligation which binds men to their engagements is nothing but a feeling of an interest of a superior class which outweighs an inferior interest men are not always held by the particular utility of a certain engagement but in the case in which the engagement becomes burthensome to one of the parties they are still held by the general utility of engagements—by the confidence that each enlightened man wishes to have placed in his word that he may be considered as trustworthy and enjoy the advantages attached to probity and esteem it is not the engagement which constitutes the obligation by itself for there are some void engagements there are some unlawful why because they are considered as hurtful it is the utility of the contract which gives it force    the most exalted acts of virtue may be easily reduced to a calculation of good and evil this is neither to degrade nor to weaken them but to represent them as the effects of reason and to explain them in a simple and intelligible manner let us observe the circle in which we are compelled to move when the principle of utility is not recognized i ought to keep my promise why because my conscience prescribes it how do you know that your conscience prescribes it because i have an internal feeling of it why ought you to obey your conscience because god is the author of my nature and to obey my conscience is to obey god why ought you to obey god because it is my first duty how do you know this because my conscience tells me so—c such is the eternal round from which there is no exit such is the source of obstinate and invincible errors for if there is no where any judge but feeling there is no method of distinguishing between the injunctions of an enlightened and a blind conscience all persecutors have had the same title and all fanatics possess the same right if you would reject the principle of utility because it may be ill applied what would you substitute in its stead what rule have you found which cannot be abused—what infallible guide do you possess would you substitute some despotic principle which directs men to act in a certain manner without knowing why from pure obsequiousness would you substitute some anarchical and capricious principle founded solely upon internal and peculiar feelings in these cases what are the motives by which you would determine men to follow you would they be independent of their interest if they do not agree with you how will you reason with them—how will you attempt to conciliate them where would you cite all the sects all the opinions all the contradictions which overspread the earth if not to the tribunal of their common interest the most obstinate adversaries of the principle of utility are those who fix themselves upon what they call the religious principle they profess to take the will of god for the sole rule of good and evil it is the only rule they say which possesses all the requisite characters being infallible universal supreme c i reply that the religious principle is not a distinct principle that it is one or other of those of which we have already spoken presented under another aspect what is called the will of god can only be presumed to be his will except where god has explained himself to us by immediate and peculiar revelations but how shall a man presume upon the will of god according to his own will now his own will is always directed by one of the three beforementioned principles how do you know that god has willed a certain thing because it would be prejudicial to the happiness of men replies the partisan of utility because it includes a gross and sensual pleasure that god disapproves replies the ascetic because it wounds my conscience because it is contrary to my natural feelings and ought to be detested without examination is the language of antipathy but revelation it may be said is the direct expression of the will of god in it there is nothing arbitrary it is a guide which ought to govern all human reasoning i shall not indirectly reply that revelation is not universal that among christian nations there are many individuals who do not admit it and that some common principle of reasoning is required for all men but i say that revelation is not a system of politics or of morals that its precepts require to be explained modified limited the one by the other that taken in a literal sense they would overturn the world annihilate selfdefence industry commerce reciprocal attachments ecclesiastical history is one incontestible proof of the frightful evils which result from religious maxims ill understood how great the differences between protestant and catholic theologians between the moderns and the ancients the evangelical morality of paley is not the evangelical morality of st nicholas that of the jansenists is not the same as that of the jesuits the interpreters of the sacred writings divide them selves into three classes one class is guided by criticism the principle of utility another follows ascetism the other follows the confused impressions of sympathy and antipathy the first far from excluding pleasures offer them as a proof of the goodness of god the ascetics are the mortal enemies of pleasures if they allow them it is never for their own sake but as a means to a certain necessary end the last approve or condemn them according to their fancy without being determined by the consideration of their consequences revelation is not therefore a separate principle this title can only be given to what does not require proof and which may be employed to prove every thing else    chapter iii of the four sanctions or sources of pain and pleasure i it has been shown that the happiness of the individuals of whom a community is composed that is their pleasures and their security is the end and the sole end which the legislator ought to have in view the sole standard in conformity to which each individual ought as far as depends upon the legislator to be made to fashion his behaviour but whether it be this or any thing else that is to be done there is nothing by which a man can ultimately be made to do it but either pain or pleasure having taken a general view of these two grand objects viz pleasure and what comes to the same thing immunity from pain in the character of final causes it will be necessary to take a view of pleasure and pain itself in the character of efficient causes or means ii there are four distinguishable sources from which pleasure and pain are in use to flow considered separately they may be termed the physical the political the moral and the religious and inasmuch as the pleasures and pains belonging to each of them are capable of giving a binding force to any law or rule of conduct they may all of them be termed sanctions† iii if it be in the present life and from the ordinary course of nature not purposely modified by the interposition of the will of any human being nor by any extraordinary interposition of any superior invisible being that the pleasure or the pain takes place or is expected it may be said to issue from or to belong to the physical sanction iv if at the hands of a particular person or set of persons in the community who under names correspondent to that of judge are chosen for the particular purpose of dispensing it according to the will of the sovereign or supreme ruling power in the state it may be said to issue from the political sanction v if at the hands of such chance persons in the community as the party in question may happen in the course of his life to have concerns with according to each mans spontaneous disposition and not according to any settled or concerted rule it may be said to issue from the moral or popular sanction‡ vi if from the immediate hand of a superior invisible being either in the present life or in a future it may be said to issue from the religious sanction vii pleasures or pains which may be expected to issue from the physical political or moral sanctions must all of them be expected to be experienced if ever in the present life those which may be expected to issue from the religious sanction may be expected to be experienced either in the present life or in a future viii those which can be experienced in the present life can of course be no others than    such as human nature in the course of the present life is susceptible of and from each of these sources may flow all the pleasures or pains of which in the course of the present life human nature is susceptible with regard to these then with which alone we have in this place any concern those of them which belong to any one of those sanctions differ not ultimately in kind from those which belong to any one of the other three the only difference there is among them lies in the circumstances that accompany their production a suffering which befals a man in the natural and spontaneous course of things shall be styled for instance a calamity in which case if it be supposed to befal him through any imprudence of his it may be styled a punishment issuing from the physical sanction now this same suffering if inflicted by the law will be what is commonly called a punishment if incurred for want of any friendly assistance which the misconduct or supposed misconduct of the sufferer has occasioned to be withholden a punishment issuing from the moral sanction if through the immediate interposition of a particular providence a punishment issuing from the religious sanction ix a mans goods or his person are consumed by fire if this happened to him by what is called an accident it was a calamity if by reason of his own imprudence for instance from his neglecting to put his candle out it may be styled a punishment of the physical sanction if it happened to him by the sentence of the political magistrate a punishment belonging to the political sanction—that is what is commonly called a punishment if for want of any assistance which his neighbour withheld from him out of some dislike to his moral character a punishment of the moral sanction if by an immediate act of gods displeasure manifested on account of some sin committed by him or through any distraction of mind occasioned by the dread of such displeasure a punishment of the religious sanction x as to such of the pleasures and pains belonging to the religious sanction as regard a future life of what kind these may be we cannot know these lie not open to our observation during the present life they are matter only of expectation and whether that expectation be derived from natural or revealed religion the particular kind of pleasure or pain if it be different from all those which lie open to our observation is what we can have no idea of the best ideas we can obtain of such pains and pleasures are altogether unliquidated in point of quality in what other respects our ideas of them may be liquidated will be considered in another place† xi of these four sanctions the physical is altogether we may observe the groundwork of the political and the moral so is it also of the religious in as far as the latter bears relation to the present life it is included in each of those other three this may operate in any case that is any of the pains or pleasures belonging to it may operate independently of them none of them can operate but by means of this in a word the powers of nature may operate of themselves but neither the magistrate nor men at large can operate nor is god in the case in question supposed to operate but through the powers of nature xii for these four objects which in their nature have so much in common it seemed of use to find a common name it seemed of use in the first place for the convenience of giving a name to certain pleasures and pains for which a name equally characteristic could hardly otherwise have been found in the second place for the sake of holding up the efficacy of certain moral forces the influence of which is apt not to be sufficiently attended to does the political sanction exert an influence over the conduct of mankind the moral the religious sanctions do so too in every inch of his career are the operations of the political magistrate liable to be aided or impeded by these two foreign powers who one or other of them or both are sure to be either his rivals or his allies does it happen to him to leave them out in his calculations he will be sure almost to find himself mistaken in the result of all this we shall find abundant proofs in the sequel of this work it behoves him therefore to have them continually before his eyes and that under such a name as exhibits the relation they bear to his own purposes and designs chapter iv value of a lot of pleasure or pain how to be measured i pleasures then and the avoidance of pains are the ends which the legislator has in view it behoves him therefore to understand their value pleasures and pains are the instruments he has to work with it behoves him    therefore to understand their force which is again in another point of view their value ii to a person considered by himself the value of a pleasure or pain considered by itself will be greater or less according to the four following circumstances     its intensity     its duration     its certainty or uncertainty     its propinquity or remoteness iii these are the circumstances which are to be considered in estimating a pleasure or a pain considered each of them by itself but when the value of any pleasure or pain is considered for the purpose of estimating the tendency of any act by which it is produced there are two other circumstances to be taken into the account these are   its fecundity or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind that is pleasures if it be a pleasure pains if it be a pain   its purity or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind that is pains if it be a pleasure pleasures if it be a pain these two last however are in strictness scarcely to be deemed properties of the pleasure or the pain itself they are not therefore in strictness to be taken into the account of the value of that pleasure or that pain they are in strictness to be deemed properties only of the act or other event by which such pleasure or pain has been produced and accordingly are only to be taken into the account of the tendency of such act or such event iv to a number of persons with reference to each of whom the value of a pleasure or a pain is considered it will be greater or less according to seven circumstances to wit the six preceding ones viz     its intensity     its duration     its certainty or uncertainty     its propinquity or remoteness     its fecundity     its purity and one other to wit   its extent that is the number of persons to whom it extends or in other words who are affected by it v to take an exact account then of the general tendency of any act by which the interests of a community are affected proceed as follows begin with any one person of those whose interests seem most immediately to be affected by it and take an account   of the value of each distinguishable pleasure which appears to be produced by it in the first instance   of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it in the first instance   of the value of each pleasure which appears to be produced by it after the first this constitutes the fecundity of the first pleasure and the impurity of the first pain   of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it after the first this constitutes the fecundity of the first pain and the impurity of the first pleasure   sum up all the values of all the pleasures on the one side and those of all the pains on the other the balance if it be on the side of pleasure will give the good tendency of the act upon the whole with respect to the interests of that individual person if on the side of pain the bad tendency of it upon the whole   take an account of the number of persons whose interests appear to be concerned and repeat the above process with respect to each sum up the numbers expressive of the degrees of good tendency which the act has with respect to each individual in regard to whom the tendency of it is good upon the whole do this again with respect to each individual in regard to whom the tendency of it is good upon the whole do this again with respect to each individual in regard to whom the tendency of it is bad upon the whole take the balance which if on the side of pleasure will give the general good tendency of the act with respect to the total number or community of individuals concerned if on the side of pain the general evil tendency with respect to the same community vi it is not to be expected that this process should be strictly pursued previously to every moral judgment or to every legislative or judicial operation it may however be always kept in view and as near as the process actually pursued on these occasions approaches to it so near will such process approach to the character of an exact one vii the same process is alike applicable to    pleasure and pain in whatever shape they appear and by whatever denomination they are distinguished to pleasure whether it be called good which is properly the cause or instrument of pleasure or profit which is distant pleasure or the cause or instrument of distant pleasure or convenience or advantage benefit emolument happiness and so forth to pain whether it be called evil which corresponds to good or mischief or inconvenience or disadvantage or loss or unhappiness and so forth viii nor is this a novel and unwarranted any more than it is a useless theory in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest is perfectly conformable to an article of property an estate in land for instance is valuable on what account on account of the pleasures of all kinds which it enables a man to produce and what comes to the same thing the pains of all kinds which it enables him to avert but the value of such an article of property is universally understood to rise or fall according to the length or shortness of the time which a man has in it the certainty or uncertainty of its coming into possession and the nearness or remoteness of the time at which if at all it is to come into possession as to the intensity of the pleasures which a man may derive from it this is never thought of because it depends upon the use which each particular person may come to make of it which cannot be estimated till the particular pleasures he may come to derive from it or the particular pains he may come to exclude by means of it are brought to view for the same reason neither does he think of the fecundity or purity of those pleasures thus much for pleasure and pain happiness and unhappiness in general we come now to consider the several particular kinds of pain and pleasure chapter v pleasures and pains their kinds i having represented what belongs to all sorts of pleasures and pains alike we come now to exhibit each by itself the several sorts of pains and pleasures pains and pleasures may be called by one general word interesting perceptions interesting perceptions are either simple or complex the simple ones are those which cannot any one of them be resolved into more complex are those which are resolvable into divers simple ones a complex interesting perception may accordingly be composed either   of pleasures alone   of pains alone or   of a pleasure or pleasures and a pain or pains together what determines a lot of pleasure for example to be regarded as one complex pleasure rather than as divers simple ones is the nature of the exciting cause whatever pleasures are excited all at once by the action of the same cause are apt to be looked upon as constituting all together but one pleasure ii the several simple pleasures of which human nature is susceptible seem to be as follows   the pleasures of sense   the pleasures of wealth   the pleasures of skill   the pleasures of amity   the pleasures of a good name   the pleasures of power   the pleasures of piety   the pleasures of benevolence   the pleasures of malevolence  0 the pleasures of memory    the pleasures of imagination    the pleasures of expectation    the pleasures dependent on association    the pleasures of relief iii the several simple pains seem to be as follows   the pains of privation   the pains of the senses   the pains of awkwardness   the pains of enmity   the pains of an ill name   the pains of piety   the pains of benevolence   the pains of malevolence   the pains of the memory  0 the pains of the imagination    the pains of expectation    the pains dependent on association iv   the pleasures of sense seem to be as follows   the pleasures of the taste or palate including whatever pleasures are experienced in satisfying the appetites of hunger and thirst   the pleasure of intoxication   the pleasures of the organ of smelling   the pleasures of the touch   the simple pleasures of the ear independent of association   the simple pleasures of the eye independent of association   the pleasure of the sexual sense   the pleasure of health or the internal pleasurable feeling or flow of spirits as it is    called which accompanies a state of full health and vigour especially at times of moderate bodily exertion   the pleasures of novelty or the pleasures derived from the gratification of the appetite of curiosity by the application of new objects to any of the senses v   by the pleasures of wealth may be meant those pleasures which a man is apt to derive from the consciousness of possessing any article or articles which stand in the list of instruments of enjoyment or security and more particularly at the time of his first acquiring them at which time the pleasure may be styled a pleasure of gain or a pleasure of acquisition at other times a pleasure of possession   the pleasures of skill as exercised upon particular objects are those which accompany the application of such particular instruments of enjoyment to their uses as cannot be so applied without a greater or less share of difficulty or exertion† vi   the pleasures of amity or selfrecommendation are the pleasures that may accompany the persuasion of a mans being in the acquisition or the possession of the goodwill of such or such assignable person or persons in particular or as the phrase is of being upon good terms with him or them and as a fruit of it of his being in a way to have the benefit of their spontaneous and gratuitous services vii   the pleasures of a good name are the pleasures that accompany the persuasion of a mans being in the acquisition or the possession of the goodwill of the world about him that is of such members of society as he is likely to have concerns with and as a means of it either their love or their esteem or both and as a fruit of it of his being in the way to have the benefit of their spontaneous and gratuitous services these may likewise be called the pleasures of good repute the pleasures of honour or the pleasures of the moral sanction‡ viii   the pleasures of power are the pleasures that accompany the persuasion of a mans being in a condition to dispose people by means of their hopes and fears to give him the benefit of their services that is by the hope of some service or by the fear of some disservice that he may be in the way to render them ix   the pleasures of piety are the pleasures that accompany the belief of a mans being in the acquisition or in possession of the goodwill or favour of the supreme being and as a fruit of it of his being in a way of enjoying pleasures to be received by gods special appointment either in this life or in a life to come these may also be called the pleasures of religion the pleasures of a religious disposition or the pleasures of the religious sanction∥ x   the pleasures of benevolence are the pleasures resulting from the view of any pleasures supposed to be possessed by the beings who may be the objects of benevolence to wit the sensitive beings we are acquainted with under which are commonly included   the supreme being   human beings   other animals these may also be called the pleasures of goodwill the pleasures of sympathy or the pleasures of the benevolent or social affections xi   the pleasures of malevolence are the pleasures resulting from the view of any pain supposed to be suffered by the beings who may become the objects of malevolence to wit   human beings   other animals these may also be styled the pleasures of illwill the pleasures of the irascible appetite the pleasures of antipahy or the pleasures of the malevolent or dissocial affections xii  0 the pleasures of the memory are the pleasures which after having enjoyed such and such pleasures or even in some cases after having suffered such and such pains a man will now and then experience at recollecting them exactly in the order and in the circumstances in which they were actually enjoyed or suffered these derivative pleasures may of course be distinguished into as many species as there are of original perceptions from whence they may be copied they may also be styled pleasures of simple recollection xiii    the pleasures of the imagination are the pleasures which may be derived from the contemplation of any such pleasures as may happen to be suggested by the memory but in a different order and accompanied by different groups of circumstances these may accordingly be referred to any one of the three cardinal points of time present past or future it is evident they may admit of as many distinctions as those of the former class    xiv    the pleasures of expectation are the pleasures that result from the contemplation of any sort of pleasure referred to time future and accompanied with the sentiment of belief these also may admit of the same distinctions xv    the pleasures of association are the pleasures which certain objects or incidents may happen to afford not of themselves but merely in virtue of some association they have contracted in the mind with certain objects or incidents which are in themselves pleasurable such is the case for instance with the pleasure of skill when afforded by such a set of incidents as compose a game of chess this derives its pleasurable quality from its association partly with the pleasures of skill as exercised in the production of incidents pleasurable of themselves partly from its association with the pleasures of power such is the case also with the pleasure of good luck when afforded by such incidents as compose the game of hazard or any other game of chance when played at for nothing this derives its pleasurable quality from its association with one of the pleasures of wealth to wit with the pleasure of acquiring it xvi    farther on we shall see pains grounded upon pleasures in like manner may we now see pleasures grounded upon pains to the catalogue of pleasures may accordingly be added the pleasures of relief or the pleasures which a man experiences when after he has been enduring a pain of any kind for a certain time it comes to cease or to abate these may of course be distinguished into as many species as there are of pains and may give rise to so many pleasures of memory of imagination and of expectation xvii   pains of privation are the pains that may result from the thought of not possessing in the time present any of the several kinds of pleasures pains of privation may accordingly be resolved into as many kinds as there are of pleasures to which they may correspond and from the absence whereof they may be derived xviii there are three sorts of pains which are only so many modifications of the several pains of privation when the enjoyment of any particular pleasure happens to be particularly desired but without any expectation approaching to assurance the pain of privation which thereupon results takes a particular name and is called the pain of desire or of unsatisfied desire xix where the enjoyment happens to have been looked for with a degree of expectation approaching to assurance and that expectation is made suddenly to cease it is called a pain of disappointment xx a pain of privation takes the name of a pain of regret in two cases   where it is grounded on the memory of a pleasure which having been once enjoyed appears not likely to be enjoyed again   where it is grounded on the idea of a pleasure which was never actually enjoyed nor perhaps so much as expected but which might have been enjoyed it is supposed had such or such a contingency happened which in fact did not happen xxi   the several pains of the senses seem to be as follows   the pains of hunger and thirst or the disagreeable sensations produced by the want of suitable substances which need at times to be applied to the alimentary canal   the pains of the taste or the disagreeable sensations produced by the application of various substances to the palate and other superior parts of the same canal   the pains of the organ of smell or the disagreeable sensations produced by the effluvia of various substances when applied to that organ   the pains of the touch or the disagreeable sensations produced by the application of various substances to the skin   the simple pains of the hearing or the disagreeable sensations excited in the organ of that sense by various kinds of sounds independently as before of association   the simple pains of the sight or the disagreeable sensations if any such there be that may be excited in the organ of that sense by visible images independent of the principle of association  † the pains resulting from excessive heat or cold unless these be referable to the touch   the pains of disease or the acute and uneasy sensations resulting from the several diseases and indispositions to which human nature is liable   the pain of exertion whether bodily or mental or the uneasy sensation which is apt to accompany any intense effort whether of mind or body xxii  ‡ the pains of awkwardness are the pains  0 which sometimes result from the unsuccessful endeavour to apply any particular instruments of enjoyment or security to their uses or from the difficulty a man experiences in applying them xxiii   the pains of enmity are the pains that may accompany the persuasion of a mans being obnoxious to the illwill of such or such an assignable person or persons in particular or as the phrase is of being upon ill terms with him or them and in consequence of being obnoxious to certain pains of some sort or other of which he may be the cause xxiv   the pains of an illname are the pains that accompany the persuasion of a mans being obnoxious or in a way to be obnoxious to the illwill of the world about him these may likewise be called the pains of illrepute the pains of dishonour or the pains of the moral sanction† xxv  ‡ the pains of piety are the pains that accompany the belief of a mans being obnoxious to the displeasure of the supreme being and in consequence to certain pains to be inflicted by his especial appointment either in this life or in a life to come these may also be called the pains of religion the pains of a religious disposition or the pains of the religious sanction when the belief is looked upon as wellgrounded these pains are commonly called religious terrors when looked upon as illgrounded superstitious terrors∥ xxvi   the pains of benevolence are the pains resulting from the view of any pains supposed to be endured by other beings these may also be called the pains of goodwill of sympathy or the pains of the benevolent or social affections xxvii   the pains of malevolence are the pains resulting from the view of any pleasures supposed to be enjoyed by any beings who happen to be the objects of a mans displeasure these may also be styled the pains of illwill of antipathy or the pains of the malevolent or dissocial affections xxviii   the pains of the memory may be grounded on every one of the above kinds as well of pains of privation as of positive pains these correspond exactly to the pleasures of the memory xxix  0 the pains of the imagination may also be grounded on any one of the above kinds as well of pains of privation as of positive pains in other respects they correspond exactly to the pleasures of the imagination xxx    the pains of expectation may be grounded on each one of the above kinds as well of pains of privation as of positive pains these may be also termed pains of apprehension§ xxxi    the pains of association correspond exactly to the pleasures of association xxxii of the above list there are certain pleasures and pains which suppose the existence of some pleasure or pain of some other person to which the pleasure or pain of the person in question has regard such pleasures and pains may be termed extraregarding    others do not suppose any such thing these may be termed selfregarding the only pleasures and pains of the extraregarding class are those of benevolence and those of malevolence all the rest are selfregarding† xxxiii of all these several sorts of pleasures and pains there is scarce any one which is not liable on more accounts than one to come under the consideration of the law is an offence committed it is the tendency which it has to destroy in such or such persons some of these pleasures or to produce some of these pains that constitutes the mischief of it and the ground for punishing it it is the prospect of some of these pleasures or of security from some of these pains that constitutes the motive or temptation it is the attainment of them that constitutes the profit of the offence is the offender to be punished it can be only by the production of one or more of these pains that the punishment can be inflicted‡ chapter vi of circumstances influencing sensibility i pain and pleasure are produced in mens minds by the action of certain causes but the quantity of pleasure and pain runs not uniformly in proportion to the cause in other words to the quantity of force exerted by such cause the truth of this observation rests not upon any metaphysical nicety in the import given to the terms cause quantity and force it will be equally true in whatsoever manner such force be measured ii the disposition which any one has to feel such or such a quantity of pleasure or pain upon the application of a cause of given force is what we term the degree or quantum of his sensibility this may be either general referring to the sum of the causes that act upon him during a given period or particular referring to the action of any one particular cause or sort of cause iii but in the same mind such and such causes of pain or pleasure will produce more pain or pleasure than such or such other causes of pain or pleasure and this proportion will in different minds be different the disposition which any one has to have the proportion in which he is affected by two such causes different from that in which another man is affected by the same two causes may be termed the quality or bias of his sensibility one man for instance may be most affected by the pleasures of the taste another by those of the ear so also if there be a difference in the nature or proportion of two pains or pleasures which they respectively experience from the same cause a case not so frequent as the former from the same injury for instance one man may feel the same quantity of grief and resentment together as another man but one of them shall feel a greater share of grief than of resentment the other a greater share of resentment than of grief    iv any incident which serves as a cause either of pleasure or of pain may be termed an exciting cause if of pleasure a pleasurable cause if of pain a painful afflictive or dolorific cause v now the quantity of pleasure or of pain which a man is liable to experience upon the application of an exciting cause since they will not depend altogether upon that cause will depend in some measure upon some other circumstance or circumstances these circumstances whatsoever they be may be termed circumstances influencing sensibility† vi these circumstances will apply differently to different exciting causes insomuch that to a certain exciting cause a certain circumstance shall not apply at all which shall apply with great force to another exciting cause but without entering for the present into these distinctions it may be of use to sum up all the circumstances which can be found to influence the effect of any exciting cause these as on a former occasion it may be as well first to sum up together in the concisest manner possible and afterwards to allot a few words to the separate explanation of each article they seem to be as follows   health   strength   hardiness   bodily imperfection   quantity and quality of knowledge   strength of intellectual powers   firmness of mind   steadiness of mind   bent of inclination  0 moral sensibility    moral biases    religious sensibility    religious biases    sympathetic sensibility    sympathetic biases    antipathetic sensibility    antipathetic biases    insanity    habitual occupations  0 pecuniary circumstances    connexions in the way of sympathy    connexions in the way of antipathy    radical frame of body    radical frame of mind    sex    age    rank    education    climate  0 lineage    government    religious profession‡ vii   health is the absence of disease and consequently of all those kinds of pain which are among the symptoms of disease a man may be said to be in a state of health when he is not conscious of any uneasy sensations the primary seat of which can be perceived to be any where in his body∥ in point of general sensibility a man who is under the pressure of any bodily indisposition or as the    phrase is is in an ill state of health is less sensible to the influence of any pleasurable cause and more so to that of any afflictive one than if he were well viii   the circumstance of strength though in point of causality closely connected with that of health is perfectly distinguishable from it the same man will indeed generally be stronger in a good state of health than in a bad one but one man even in a bad state of health may be stronger than another even in a good one weakness is a common concomitant of disease but in consequence of his radical frame of body a man may be weak all his life long without experiencing any disease health as we have observed is principally a negative circumstance strength a positive one the degree of a mans strength can be measured with tolerable accuracy ix   hardiness is a circumstance which though closely connected with that of strength is distinguishable from it hardiness is the absence of irritability irritability respects either pain resulting from the action of mechanical causes or disease resulting from the action of causes purely physiological irritability in the former sense is the disposition to undergo a greater or less degree of pain upon the application of a mechanical cause such as are most of those applications by which simple afflictive punishments are inflicted as whipping beating and the like in the latter sense it is the disposition to contract disease with greater or less facility upon the application of any instrument acting on the body by its physiological properties as in the case of fevers or of colds or other inflammatory diseases produced by the application of damp air or to experience immediate uneasiness as in the case of relaxation or chilliness produced by an over or under proportion of the matter of heat hardiness even in the sense in which it is opposed to the action of mechanical causes is distinguishable from strength the external indications of strength are the abundance and firmness of the muscular fibres those of hardiness in this sense are the firmness of the muscular fibres and the callosity of the skin strength is more peculiarly the gift of nature hardiness of education of two persons who have had the one the education of a gentleman the other that of a common sailor the first may be the stronger at the same time that the other is the hardier x   by bodily imperfection may be understood that condition which a person is in who either stands distinguished by any remarkable deformity or wants any of those parts or faculties which the ordinary run of persons of the same sex and age are furnished with who for instance has a harelip is deaf or has lost a hand this circumstance like that of ill health tends in general to diminish more or less the effect of any pleasurable circumstance and to increase that of any afflictive one the effect of this circumstance however admits of great variety inasmuch as there are a great variety of ways in which a man may suffer in his personal appearance and in his bodily organs and faculties all which difference will be taken notice of in their proper places† xi   so much for circumstances belonging to the condition of the body we come now to those which concern the condition of the mind the use of mentioning these will be seen hereafter in the first place may be reckoned the quantity and quality of the knowledge the person in question happens to possess that is of the ideas which he has actually in store ready upon occasion to call to mind meaning such ideas as are in some way or other of an interesting nature that is of a nature in some way or other to influence his happiness or that of other men when these ideas are many and of importance a man is said to be a man of knowledge when few or not of importance ignorant xii   by strength of intellectual powers may be understood the degree of facility which a man experiences in his endeavours to call to mind as well such ideas as have been already aggregated to his stock of knowledge as any others which upon any occasion that may happen he may conceive a desire to place there it seems to be on some such occasion    as this that the words parts and talents are commonly employed to this head may be referred the several qualities of readiness of apprehension accuracy and tenacity of memory strength of attention clearness of discernment amplitude of comprehension vividity and rapidity of imagination strength of intellectual powers in general seems to correspond pretty exactly to general strength of body as any of these qualities in particular does to particular strength xiii   firmness of mind on the one hand and irritability on the other regard the proportion between the degrees of efficacy with which a man is acted upon by an exciting cause of which the value lies chiefly in magnitude and one of which the value lies chiefly in propinquity a man may be said to be of a firm mind when small pleasures or pains which are present or near do not affect him in a greater proportion to their value than greater pleasures or pains which are uncertain or remote† of an irritable mind when the contrary is the case xiv   steadiness regards the time during which a given exciting cause of a given value continues to affect a man in nearly the same manner and degree as at first no assignable external event or change of circumstances intervening to make an alteration in its force‡ xv   by the bent of a mans inclinations may be understood the propensity he has to expect pleasure or pain from certain objects rather than from others a mans inclinations may be said to have such or such a bent when amongst the several sorts of objects which afford pleasure in some degree to all men he is apt to expect more pleasure from one particular sort than from another particular sort or more from any given particular sort than another man would expect from that sort or when amongst the several sorts of objects which to one man afford pleasure whilst to another they afford none he is apt to expect or not to expect pleasure from an object of such or such a sort so also with regard to pains this circumstance though intimately connected with that of the bias of a mans sensibility is not undistinguishable from it the quantity of pleasure or pain which on any given occasion a man may experience from an application of any sort may be greatly influenced by the expectations he has been used to entertain of pleasure or pain from that quarter but it will not be absolutely determined by them for pleasure or pain may come upon him from a quarter from which he was not accustomed to expect it xvi  0 the circumstances of moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic sensibility when closely considered will appear to be included in some sort under that of bent of inclination on account of their particular importance they may however be worth mentioning apart a mans moral sensibility may be said to be strong when the pains and pleasures of the moral sanction show greater in his eyes in comparison with other pleasures and pains and consequently exert a stronger influence than in the eyes of the persons he is compared with in other words when he is acted on with more than ordinary efficacy by the sense of honour it may be said to be weak when the contrary is the case xvii    moral sensibility seems to regard the average effect or influence of the pains and pleasures of the moral sanction upon all sorts of occasions to which it is applicable or happens to be applied it regards the average force or quantity of the impulses the mind receives from that source during a given period moral bias regards the particular acts on which upon so many particular occasions the force of that sanction is looked upon as attaching it regards the quality or direction of those impulses it admits of as many varieties therefore as there are dictates which the moral sanction may be conceived to issue forth a man may be said to have such or such a moral bias or to have a moral bias in favour of such or such an action when he looks upon it as being of the number of those of which the performance is dictated by the moral sanction xviii    what has been said with regard to moral sensibility may be applied mutatis mutandis to religious xix    what has been said with regard to moral biases may also be applied mutatis mutandis to religious biases xx    by sympathetic sensibility is to be    understood the propensity that a man has to derive pleasure from the happiness and pain from the unhappiness of other sensitive beings it is the stronger the greater the ratio of the pleasure or pain he feels on their account is to that of the pleasure or pain which according to what appears to him they feel for themselves xxi    sympathetic bias regards the description of the parties who are the objects of a mans sympathy and of the acts or other circumstances of or belonging to those persons by which the sympathy is excited these parties may be   certain individuals   any subordinate class of individuals   the whole nation   human kind in general   the whole sensitive creation according as these objects of sympathy are more numerous the affection by which the man is biased may be said to be the more enlarged xxii       antipathetic sensibility and antipathetic biases are just the reverse of sympathetic sensibility and sympathetic biases by antipathetic sensibility is to be understood the propensity that a man has to derive pain from the happiness and pleasure from the unhappiness of other sensitive beings xxiii    the circumstance of insanity of mind corresponds to that of bodily imperfection it admits however of much less variety inasmuch as the soul is for aught we can perceive one indivisible thing not distinguishable like the body into parts what lesser degrees of imperfection the mind may be susceptible of seem to be comprisable under the alreadymentioned heads of ignorance weakness of mind irritability or unsteadiness or under such others as are reducible to them those which are here in view are those extraordinary species and degrees of mental imperfection which wherever they take place are as conspicuous and as unquestionable as lameness or blindness in the body operating partly it should seem by inducing an extraordinary degree of the imperfections above mentioned partly by giving an extraordinary and preposterous bent to the inclinations xxiv    under the head of a mans habitual occupations are to be understood on this occasion as well those which he pursues for the sake of profit as those which he pursues for the sake of present pleasure the consideration of the profit itself belongs to the head of a mans pecuniary circumstances it is evident that if by any means a punishment or any other exciting cause has the effect of putting it out of his power to continue in the pursuit of any such occupation it must on that account be so much the more distressing a mans habitual occupations though intimately connected in point of causality with the bent of his inclinations are not to be looked upon as precisely the same circumstance an amusement or channel of profit may be the object of a mans inclinations which has never been the subject of his habitual occupations for it may be that though he wished to betake himself to it he never did it not being in his power a circumstance which may make a good deal of difference in the effect of any incident by which he happens to be debarred from it xxv  0 under the head of pecuniary circumstances i mean to bring to view the proportion which a mans means bear to his wants the sum total of his means of every kind to the sum total of his wants of every kind a mans means depend upon three circumstances   his property   the profit of his labour   his connexions in the way of support his wants seem to depend upon four circumstances   his habits of expense   his connexions in the way of burthen   any present casual demand he may have   the strength of his expectation by a mans property is to be understood whatever he has in store independent of his labour by the profit of his labour is to be understood the growing profit as to labour it may be either of the body principally or of the mind principally or of both indifferently nor does it matter in what manner nor on what subject it be applied so it produce a profit by a mans connexions in the way of support are to be understood the pecuniary assistances of whatever kind which he is in a way of receiving from any persons who on whatever account and in whatever proportion he has reason to expect should contribute gratis to his maintenance such as his parents patrons and relations it seems manifest that a man can have no other means than these what he uses he must have either of his own or from other people if from other people either gratis or for a price as to habits of expense it is well known that a mans desires are governed in a great degree by his habits many are the cases in which desire and consequently the pain of privation connected with it would not even subsist at all but for previous enjoyment by a mans connexions in the way of burthen are to be understood whatever expense he has reason to look upon himself as bound to be at in the support of those who by law or the customs of the world are warranted in looking up to him for assistance such as children poor relations superannuated servants and any other dependents whatsoever as to present casual demand it is manifest that there are    occasions on which a given sum will be worth infinitely more to a man than the same sum would at another time where for example in a case of extremity a man stands in need of extraordinary medical assistance or wants money to carry on a lawsuit on which his all depends or has got a livelihood waiting for him in a distant country and wants money for the charges of conveyance in such cases any piece of good or ill fortune in the pecuniary way might have a very different effect from what it would have at any other time with regard to strength of expectation when one man expects to gain or to keep a thing which another does not it is plain the circumstance of not having it will affect the former very differently from the latter who indeed commonly will not be affected by it at all xxvi    under the head of a mans connexions in the way of sympathy i would bring to view the number and description of the persons in whose welfare he takes such a concern as that the idea of their happiness should be productive of pleasure and that of their unhappiness of pain to him for instance a mans wife his children his parents his near relations and intimate friends this class of persons it is obvious will for the most part include the two classes by which his pecuniary circumstances are affected those to wit from whose means he may expect support and those whose wants operate on him as a burthen but it is obvious that besides these it may very well include others with whom he has no such pecuniary connexion and even with regard to these it is evident that the pecuniary dependence and the union of affections are circumstances perfectly distinguishable accordingly the connexions here in question independently of any influence they may have on a mans pecuniary circumstances have an influence on the effect of any exciting causes whatsoever the tendency of them is to increase a mans general sensibility to increase on the one hand the pleasure produced by all pleasurable causes on the other the pain produced by all afflictive ones when any pleasurable incident happens to a man he naturally in the first moment thinks of the pleasure it will afford immediately to himself presently afterwards however except in a few cases which it is not worth while here to insist on he begins to think of the pleasure which his friends will feel upon their coming to know of it and this secondary pleasure is commonly no mean addition to the primary one first comes the selfregarding pleasure then comes the idea of the pleasure of sympathy which you suppose that pleasure of yours will give birth to in the bosom of your friend and this idea excites again in yours a new pleasure of sympathy grounded upon his the first pleasure issuing from your own bosom as it were from a radiant point illuminates the bosom of your friend reverberated from thence it is reflected with augmented warmth to the point from whence it first proceeded and so it is with pains nor does this effect depend wholly upon affection among near relations although there should be no kindness the pleasures and pains of the moral sanction are quickly propagated by a peculiar kind of sympathy no article either of honour or disgrace can well fall upon a man without extending to a certain distance within the circle of his family what reflects honour upon the father reflects honour upon the son what reflects disgrace disgrace the cause of this singular and seemingly unreasonable circumstance that is its analogy to the rest of the phenomena of the human mind belongs not to the present purpose it is sufficient if the effect be beyond dispute xxvii    of a mans connexions in the way of antipathy there needs not any thing very particular to be observed happily there is no primæval and constant source of antipathy in human nature as there is of sympathy there are no permanent sets of persons who are naturally and of course the objects of antipathy to a man as there are who are the objects of the contrary affection sources however but too many of antipathy are apt to spring up upon various occasions during the course of a mans life and whenever they do this circumstance may have a very considerable influence on the effects of various exciting causes as on the one hand a punishment for instance which tends to separate a man from those with whom he is connected in the way of sympathy so on the other hand one which tends to force him into the company of those with whom he is connected in the way of antipathy will on that account be so much the more distressing it is to be observed that sympathy itself multiplies the sources of antipathy sympathy for your friend gives birth to antipathy on your part against all those who are objects of antipathy as well as to sympathy for those who are objects of sympathy to him in the same manner does antipathy multiply the sources of sympathy though commonly perhaps with rather a less    degree of efficacy antipathy against your enemy is apt to give birth to sympathy on your part towards those who are objects of antipathy as well as to antipathy against those who are objects of sympathy to him xxviii    thus much for the circumstances by which the effect of any exciting cause may be influenced when applied upon any given occasion at any given period but besides these supervening incidents there are other circumstances relative to a man that may have their influence and which are coeval to his birth in the first place it seems to be universally agreed that in the original frame or texture of every mans body there is a something which independently of all subsequently intervening circumstances renders him liable to be affected by causes producing bodily pleasure or pain in a manner different from that in which another man would be affected by the same causes to the catalogue of circumstances influencing a mans sensibility we may therefore add his original or radical frame texture constitution or temperament of body xxix    in the next place it seems to be pretty well agreed that there is something also in the original frame or texture of every mans mind which independently of all exterior and subsequently intervening circumstances and even of his radical frame of body makes him liable to be differently affected by the same exciting causes from what another man would be to the catalogue of circumstances influencing a mans sensibility we may therefore further add his original or radical frame texture constitution or temperament of mind xxx it seems pretty certain all this while that a mans sensibility to causes producing pleasure or pain even of mind may depend in a considerable degree upon his original and acquired frame of body but we have no reason to think that it can depend altogether upon that frame since on the one hand we see persons whose frame of body is as much alike as can be conceived differing very considerably in respect of their mental frame and on the other hand persons whose frame of mind is as much alike as can be conceived differing very conspicuously in regard to their bodily frame† xxxi it seems indisputable also that the different sets of external occurrences that may befal a man in the course of his life will make great differences in the subsequent texture of his mind at any given period yet still those differences are not solely to be attributed to such occurrences equally far from the truth seems that opinion to be if any such be maintained which attributes all to nature and that which attributes all to education the two circumstances will therefore still remain distinct as well from one another as from all others xxxii distinct however as they are it is manifest that at no period in the active part of a mans life can they either of them make their appearance by themselves all they do is to constitute the latent groundwork which the other supervening circumstances have to work upon and whatever influence those original principles may have is so changed and modified and covered over as it were by those other circumstances as never to be separately discernible the effects of the one influence are indistinguishably blended with those of the other xxxiii the emotions of the body are received and with reason as probable indications of the temperature of the mind but they are far enough from conclusive a man may exhibit for instance the exterior appearances of grief without really grieving at all or at least in any thing near the proportion in which he appears to grieve oliver cromwell whose conduct indicated a heart more than ordinarily callous was as remarkably profuse in tears‡ many men can command the external appearances of sensibility with very little real feeling∥ the female sex    commonly with greater facility than the male hence the proverbial expression of a womans tears to have this kind of command over ones self was the characteristic excellence of the orator of ancient times and is still that of the player in our own xxxiv the remaining circumstances may with reference to those already mentioned be termed secondary influencing circumstances these have an influence it is true on the quantum or bias of a mans sensibility but it is only by means of the other primary ones the manner in which these two sets of circumstances are concerned is such that the primary ones do the business while the secondary ones lie most open to observation the secondary ones therefore are those which are most heard of on which account it will be necessary to take notice of them at the same time that it is only by means of the primary ones that their influence can be explained whereas the influence of the primary ones will be apparent enough without any mention of the secondary ones xxxv    among such of the primitive modifications of the corporeal frame as may appear to influence the quantum and bias of sensibility the most obvious and conspicuous are those which constitute the sex in point of quantity the sensibility of the female sex appears in general to be greater than that of the male the health of the female is more delicate than that of the male in point of strength and hardiness of body in point of quantity and quality of knowledge in point of strength of intellectual powers and firmness of mind she is commonly inferior moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic sensibility are commonly stronger in her than in the male the quality of her knowledge and the bent of her inclinations are commonly in many respects different her moral biases are also in certain respects remarkably different chastity modesty and delicacy for instance are prized more than courage in a woman courage more than any of those qualities in a man the religious biases in the two sexes are not apt to be remarkably different except that the female is rather more inclined than the male to superstition that is to observances not dictated by the principle of utility a difference that may be pretty well accounted for by some of the beforementioned circumstances her sympathetic biases are in many respects different for her own offspring all their lives long and for children in general while young her affection is commonly stronger than that of the male her affections are apt to be less enlarged seldom expanding themselves so much as to take in the welfare of her country in general much less that of mankind or the whole sensitive creation seldom embracing any extensive class or division even of her own countrymen unless it be in virtue of her sympathy for some particular individuals that belong to it in general her antipathetic as well as sympathetic biases are apt to be less conformable to the principle of utility than those of the male owing chiefly to some deficiency in point of knowledge discernment and comprehension her habitual occupations of the amusing kind are apt to be in many respects different from those of the male with regard to her connexions in the way of sympathy there can be no difference in point of pecuniary circumstances according to the customs of perhaps all countries she is in general less independent xxxvi    age is of course divided into divers periods of which the number and limits are by no means uniformly ascertained one might distinguish it for the present purpose into   infancy   adolescence   youth   maturity   decline   decrepitude it were lost time to stop on the present occasion to examine it at each period and to observe the indications it gives with respect to the several primary circumstances just reviewed infancy and decrepitude are commonly inferior to the other periods in point of health strength hardiness and so forth in infancy on the part of the female the imperfections of that sex are enhanced on the part of the male imperfections take place mostly similar in quality but greater in quantity to those attending the states of    adolescence youth and maturity in the female in the stage of decrepitude both sexes relapse into many of the imperfections of infancy the generality of these observations may easily be corrected upon a particular review xxxvii    station or rank in life is a circumstance that among a civilized people will commonly undergo a multiplicity of variations cæteris paribus the quantum of sensibility appears to be greater in the higher ranks of men than in the lower the primary circumstances in respect of which this secondary circumstance is apt to induce or indicate a difference seem principally to be as follows   quantity and quality of knowledge   strength of mind   bent of inclination   moral sensibility   moral biases   religious sensibility   religious biases   sympathetic sensibility   sympathetic biases  0 antipathetic sensibility    antipathetic biases    habitual occupations    nature and productiveness of a mans means of livelihood    connexions importing profit    habit of expense    connexions importing burthen a man of a certain rank will frequently have a number of dependents besides those whose dependency is the result of natural relationship as to health strength and hardiness if rank has any influence on these circumstances it is but in a remote way chiefly by the influence it may have on his habitual occupations xxxviii    the influence of education is still more extensive education stands upon a footing somewhat different from that of the circumstances of age sex and rank these words though the influence of the circumstances they respectively denote exerts itself principally if not entirely through the medium of certain of the primary circumstances before mentioned present however each of them a circumstance which has a separate existence of itself this is not the case with the word education which means nothing any farther than as it serves to call up to view some one or more of those primary circumstances education may be distinguished into physical and mental the education of the body and that of the mind mental again into intellectual and moral the culture of the understanding and the culture of the affections the education a man receives is given to him partly by others partly by himself by education then nothing more can be expressed than the condition a man is in in respect of those primary circumstances as resulting partly from the management and contrivance of others principally of those who in the early periods of his life have had dominion over him partly from his own to the physical part of his education belong the circumstances of health strength and hardiness sometimes by accident that of bodily imperfection as where by intemperance or negligence an irreparable mischief happens to his person to the intellectual parts those of quantity and quality of knowledge and in some measure perhaps those of firmness of mind and steadiness to the moral part the bent of his inclinations the quantity and quality of his moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic sensibility to all three branches indiscriminately but under the superior control of external occurrences his habitual recreations his property his means of livelihood his connexions in the way of profit and of burthen and his habits of expense with respect indeed to all these points the influence of education is modified in a manner more or less apparent by that of exterior occurrences and in a manner scarcely at all apparent and altogether out of the reach of calculation by the original texture and constitution as well of his body as of his mind xxxix    among the external circumstances by which the influence of education is modified the principal are those which come under the head of climate this circumstance places  0 itself in front and demands a separate denomination not merely on account of the magnitude of its influence but also on account of its being conspicuous to every body and of its applying indiscriminately to great numbers at a time this circumstance depends for its essence upon the situation of that part of the earth which is in question with respect to the course taken by the whole planet in its revolution round the sun but for its influence it depends upon the condition of the bodies which compose the earths surface at that part principally upon the quantities of sensible heat at different periods and upon the density and purity and dryness or moisture of the circumambient air of the so often mentioned primary circumstances there are few of which the production is not influenced by this secondary one partly by its manifest effects upon the body partly by its less perceptible effects upon the mind in hot climates mens health is apt to be more precarious than in cold their strength and hardiness less their vigour firmness and steadiness of mind less and thence indirectly their quantity of knowledge the bent of their inclinations different most remarkably so in respect of their superior propensity to sexual enjoyments and in respect of the earliness of the period at which that propensity begins to manifest itself their sensibilities of all kinds more intense their habitual occupations savouring more of sloth than of activity their radical frame of body less strong probably and less hardy their radical frame of mind less vigorous less firm less steady xl  0 another article in the catalogue of secondary circumstances is that of race or lineage the national race or lineage a man issues from this circumstance independently of that of climate will commonly make some difference in point of radical frame of mind and body a man of negro race born in france or england is a very different being in many respects from a man of french or english race a man of spanish race born in mexico or peru is at the hour of his birth a different sort of being in many respects from a man of the original mexican or peruvian race this circumstance as far as it is distinct from climate rank and education and from the two just mentioned operates chiefly through the medium of moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic biases xli    the last circumstance but one is that of government the government a man lives under at the time in question or rather that under which he has been accustomed most to live this circumstance operates principally through the medium of education the magistrate operating in the character of a tutor upon all the members of the state by the direction he gives to their hopes and to their fears indeed under a solicitous and attentive government the ordinary preceptor nay even the parent himself is but a deputy as it were to the magistrate whose controlling influence different in this respect from that of the ordinary preceptor dwells with a man to his lifes end the effects of the peculiar power of the magistrate are seen more particularly in the influence it exerts over the quantum and bias of mens moral religious sympathetic and antipapathetic sensibilities under a wellconstituted or even under a welladministered though illconstituted government mens moral sensibility is commonly stronger and their moral biases more conformable to the dictates of utility their religious sensibility frequently weaker but their religious biases less unconformable to the dictates of utility their sympathetic affections more enlarged directed to the magistrate more than to small parties or to individuals and more to the whole community than to either their antipathetic sensibilities less violent as being more obsequious to the influence of welldirected moral biases and less apt to be excited by that of illdirected religious ones their antipathetic biases more conformable to welldirected moral ones more apt in proportion to be grounded on enlarged and sympathetic than on narrow and selfregarding affections and accordingly upon the whole more conformable to the dictates of utility xlii    the last circumstance is that of religious profession the religious profession a man is of the religious fraternity of which he is a member this circumstance operates principally through the medium of religious sensibility and religious biases it operates however as an indication more or less conclusive with respect to several other circumstances with respect to some scarcely but through the medium of the two just mentioned this is the case with regard to the quantum and bias of a mans moral sympathetic and antipathetic sensibility perhaps    in some cases with regard to quantity and quality of knowledge strength of intellectual powers and bent of inclination with respect to others it may operate immediately of itself this seems to be the case with regard to a mans habitual occupations pecuniary circumstances and connexions in the way of sympathy and antipathy a man who pays very little inward regard to the dictates of the religion which he finds it necessary to profess may find it difficult to avoid joining in the ceremonies of it and bearing a part in the pecuniary burthens it imposes by the force of habit and example he may even be led to entertain a partiality for persons of the same profession and a proportionable antipathy against those of a rival one in particular the antipathy against persons of different persuasions is one of the last points of religion which men part with lastly it is obvious that the religious profession a man is of cannot but have a considerable influence on his education but considering the import of the term education to say this is perhaps no more than saying in other words what has been said already xliii these circumstances all or many of them will need to be attended to as often as upon any occasion any account is taken of any quantity of pain or pleasure as resulting from any cause has any person sustained an injury they will need to be considered in estimating the mischief of the offence is satisfaction to be made to him they will need to be attended to in adjusting the quantum of that satisfaction is the injurer to be punished they will need to be attended to in estimating the force of the impression that will be made on him by any given punishment xliv it is to be observed that though they seem all of them on some account or other to merit a place in the catalogue they are not all of equal use in practice different articles among them are applicable to different exciting causes of those that may influence the effect of the same exciting cause some apply indiscriminately to whole classes of persons together being applicable to all without any remarkable difference in degree these may be directly and pretty fully provided for by the legislator this is the case for instance with the primary circumstances of bodily imperfection and insanity with the secondary circumstance of sex perhaps with that of age at any rate with those of rank of climate of lineage and of religious profession others however they may apply to whole classes of persons yet in their application to different individuals are susceptible of perhaps an indefinite variety of degrees these cannot be fully provided for by the legislator but as the existence of them in every sort of case is capable of being ascertained and the degree in which they take place is capable of being measured provision may be made for them by the judge or other executive magistrate to whom the several individuals that happen to be concerned may be made known this is the case   with the circumstance of health   in some sort with that of strength   scarcely with that of hardiness still less with those of quantity and quality of knowledge strength of intellectual powers firmness or steadiness of mind except in as far as a mans condition in respect of those circumstances may be indicated by the secondary circumstances of sex age or rank hardly with that of bent of inclination except in as far as that latent circumstance is indicated by the more manifest one of habitual occupations hardly with that of a mans moral sensibility or biases except in as far as they may be indicated by his sex age rank and education not at all with his religious sensibility and religious biases except in as far as they may be indicated by the religious profession he belongs to not at all with the quantity or quality of his sympathetic or antipathetic sensibilities except in as far as they may be presumed from his sex age rank education lineage or religious profession it is the case however with his habitual occupations with his pecuniary circumstances and with his connexions in the way of sympathy of others again either the existence cannot be ascertained or the degree cannot be measured these therefore cannot be taken into account either by the legislator or the executive magistrate accordingly they would have no claim to be taken notice of were it not for those secondary circumstances by which they are indicated and whose influence could not well be understood without them what these are has been already mentioned xlv it has already been observed that different articles in this list of circumstances apply to different exciting causes the circumstance of bodily strength for instance has scarcely any influence of itself whatever it may have in a roundabout way and by accident on the    effect of an incident which should increase or diminish the quantum of a mans property it remains to be considered what the exciting causes are with which the legislator has to do these may by some accident or other be any whatsoever but those with which he has principally to do are those of the painful or afflictive kind with pleasurable ones he has little to do except now and then by accident the reasons of which may be easily enough perceived at the same time that it would take up too much room to unfold them here the exciting causes with which he has principally to do are on the one hand the mischievous acts which it is his business to prevent on the other hand the punishments by the terror of which it is his endeavour to prevent them now of these two sets of exciting causes the latter only is of his production being produced partly by his own special appointment partly in conformity to his general appointment by the special appointment of the judge for the legislator therefore as well as for the judge it is necessary if they would know what it is they are doing when they are appointing punishment to have an eye to all these circumstances for the legislator lest meaning to apply a certain quantity of punishment to all persons who shall put themselves in a given predicament he should unawares apply to some of those persons much more or much less than he himself intended for the judge lest in applying to a particular person a particular measure of punishment he should apply much more or much less than was intended perhaps by himself and at any rate by the legislator they ought each of them therefore to have before him on the one hand a list of the several circumstances by which sensibility may be influenced on the other hand a list of the several species and degrees of punishment which they purpose to make use of and then by making a comparison between the two to form a detailed estimate of the influence of each of the circumstances in question upon the effect of each species and degree of punishment there are two plans or orders of distribution either of which might be pursued in the drawing up this estimate the one is to make the name of the circumstance take the lead and under it to represent the different influences it exerts over the effects of the several modes of punishment the other is to make the name of the punishment take the lead and under it to represent the different influences which are exerted over the effects of it by the several circumstances above mentioned now of these two sorts of objects the punishment is that to which the intention of the legislator is directed in the first instance this is of his own creation and will be whatsoever he thinks fit to make it the influencing circumstance exists independently of him and is what it is whether he will or no what he has occasion to do is to establish a certain species and degree of punishment and it is only with reference to that punishment that he has occasion to make any inquiry concerning any of the circumstances here in question the latter of the two plans therefore is that which appears by far the most useful and commodious but neither upon the one or the other plan can any such estimate be delivered here xlvi of the several circumstances contained in this catalogue it may be of use to give some sort of analytic view in order that it may be the more easily discovered if any which ought to have been inserted are omitted and that with regard to those which are inserted it may be seen how they differ and agree in the first place they may be distinguished into primary and secondary those may be termed primary which operate immediately of themselves those secondary which operate not but by the medium of the former to this latter head belong the circumstances of sex age station in life education climate lineage government and religious profession the rest are primary these again are either connate or adventitious those which are connate are radical frame of body and radical frame of mind those which are adventitious are either personal or exterior the personal again concern either a mans dispositions or his actions those which concern his dispositions concern either his body or his mind those which concern his body are health strength hardiness and bodily imperfection those which concern his mind again concern either his understanding or his affections to the former head belong the circumstances of quantity and quality of knowledge strength of understanding and insanity to the latter belong the circumstances of firmness of mind steadiness bent    of inclination moral sensibility moral biases religious sensibility religious biases sympathetic sensibility sympathetic biases antipathetic sensibility and antipathetic biases those which regard his actions are his habitual occupations those which are exterior to him regard either the things or the persons which he is concerned with under the former head come his pecuniary circumstances under the latter his connexions in the way of sympathy and antipathy uses of the preceding observations† as it is not possible to calculate the movement of a vessel without knowing the circumstances which influence its speed such as the force of the winds the resistance of the water the shape of the vessel the weight of its burden c in the same manner one cannot work with certainty in matters of legislation without considering all the circumstances which influence sensibility i shall limit myself here to what concerns the penal code it requires in all its parts a scrupulous attention to this diversity   in estimating the evil of an offence in effect the same nominal offence is not the same real offence when the sensibility of the individual injured is not the same a certain action for example would be a serious insult to a woman whilst it is indifferent to a man a certain corporal injury if done to a sick person would endanger his life but would be of no consequence to a person in good health an imputation which would ruin the fortune or the honour of a certain individual would do no injury to another individual   in giving a suitable satisfaction to an injured person the same nominal satisfaction is not the same real satisfaction when the sensibility materially differs a pecuniary satisfaction for an affront may be agreeable or offensive according to the rank the fortune or the prejudices of a person am i insulted a pardon publicly asked would be a sufficient satisfaction on the part of my superior or my equal but not on that of my inferior   in estimating the force and impression of punishment upon delinquents the same nominal punishment is not the same real punishment when the sensibility is essentially different banishment would be a very unequable punishment in the case of a young and an old man of a bachelor and the father of a family for a workman who has not the means of subsistence out of his own country and a rich man who need only change the scene of his pleasures imprisonment would be an unequable punishment for a man and a woman for a sick person and a person in health for a rich man whose family would not suffer by his absence and for a man who lives by his labour and who would leave his family in poverty   in transplanting a law from one country to another the same law verbally would not be the same law really when the sensibility of the two people is essentially different a certain law in europe produces the happiness of families transported into asia it would become the scourge of society women in europe are accustomed to enjoy their liberty and even to govern the house women in asia are prepared by their education for the seclusion of the seraglio and even for slavery marriage in europe and the east is not a contract of the same kind if it were sought to subject it to the same rules it would evidently cause unhappiness to all the parties interested the same punishments for the same offences is often said this adage has an appearance of justice and impartiality which seduces superficial minds to give it a reasonable meaning it would be necessary to determine beforehand what is meant by the same punishments and the same offences an inflexible law—a law which should regard neither sex nor age nor fortune nor rank nor education nor the moral nor religious prejudices of individuals—would be doubly vicious as inefficacious or as tyrannical too severe for some too lenient for others always sinning by excess or defect under an appearance of equality it would hide the most monstrous inequality when a man of large fortune and a man of moderate fortune are condemned to the same fine is the punishment the same do they suffer the same evil the manifest inequality of such treatment is it not rendered more hateful by the derisory equality is not the design of the law missed since the one may lose the means of his existence    whilst the other escapes with triumph when a strong young man and a feeble old man are both condemned to be loaded with fetters for the same number of years a sophist skilful in darkening the most evident truths might contend for the equality of the punishment but the unsophisticated populace faithful to nature and just feeling would murmur internally at beholding such injustice and their indignation changing its object would pass from the criminal to the judge and from the judge to the legislature i am aware that specious objections may be urged it may be asked how is it possible to take an account of all the circumstances which influence sensibility how can internal and hidden dispositions be appreciated such as strength of mind degree of knowledge inclinations sympathies how can the different qualities of all beings be measured a father of a family may consult these internal dispositions these diversities of character in the treatment of his children but a public instructor charged with a limited number of pupils could not the legislator who has in view a whole people is by much stronger reason obliged to confine himself to general laws and must fear lest he should render them complicated by descending to particular cases if he leave to the judge the right of varying the application of the laws according to this infinite diversity of circumstances and characters there will be no limits to the arbitrariness of his judgments under pretence of seizing the true spirit of the legislator the judges will make the laws the instruments of their whims and fancies sed aliter leges aliter philosophi tollunt astutias leges quatenus manu tenere possunt philosophi quatenus ratione et intelligentia—de off      it is not necessary to answer but to explain all such observations exhibit a difficulty rather than an objection the principle is not denied it is only its application which is deemed impossible   it is allowed that the greater part of these differences of sensibility are inappreciable that it is impossible to prove their existence in individual cases or to measure their force or degree but fortunately these interior and hidden dispositions if it may be so said have external and manifest indications these are the circumstances which have been called secondary sex age rank race climate government education religious profession circumstances evident and palpable which represent the interior dispositions here then the legislator is relieved from a part of his difficulty he does not stop at metaphysical and moral qualities he lays hold only of ostensible circumstances he directs for example the modification of a certain punishment not on account of the greater sensibility of the individual or on account of his steadiness strength of mind or knowledge but on account of his sex or age it is true that presumption drawn from these circumstances are liable to be defective it may happen that a youth of fifteen years old is more enlightened than a man of thirty it may happen that a certain woman has more courage and less modesty than a certain man but these presumptions will have in general all the justice necessary to prevent the laws being tyrannical and above all to conciliate to the legislator the suffrages of public opinion   these secondary circumstances are not only easily seized they are few in number they form general classes grounds of justification of extenuation or of aggravation with regard to the different offences may be drawn from them thus complexity disappears and simplicity is easily restored throughout   there is nothing arbitrary it is not the judge it is the law itself which modifies a certain punishment according to the sex the age the religious profession c as to other circumstances which must absolutely be left to the examination of the judge as the greater or less derangement in the mind the greater or less in point of strength the greater or less in point of fortune the legislator who can pronounce nothing as to individual cases directs the tribunals by general rules and leaves them a certain latitude that they may proportion their judgment to the particular nature of the circumstance what is recommended here is not an utopian idea there never was a legislator so barbarous or so stupid as to neglect all the circumstances influencing sensibility they have had a regard to them more or less confused which has guided them in the establishment of civil and political rights they have shown more or less regard to circumstances in the institution of punishments hence arises the admitted differences with regard to women children freemen slaves soldiers ecclesiastics c draco appears alone to have rejected all these considerations at least in penal matters all offences appeared to him equal because they were all violations of the law he condemned all offenders to death without distinction he confounded he overturned all the principles of human sensibility his horrid work did not long endure and it is doubtful if his laws were ever literally obeyed without falling into this extreme how many faults have not been committed of the same kind there would be no end of citing examples there have been sovereigns who have chosen to lose whole provinces and to    shed floods of human blood rather than to respect a particular sensibility of a people or tolerate a custom indifferent in itself or respect an ancient prejudice a certain dress a certain form of prayers a prince of our own times active enlightened animated by the desire of glory and the happiness of his subjects undertook to reform every thing in his states and caused them all to revolt against him at the approach of death recollecting all the vexations of his life he desired that there should be engraven upon his tomb that he had been unhappy in all his enterprises he ought also to have had engraved there for the instruction of posterity that he had always been ignorant of the art of managing the desires the inclinations and the sensibilities of men when legislators shall study the human heart when they shall show their attention to the different degrees and different kinds of sensibility by limitations and modifications these condescensions on the part of power will charm like paternal endearments conduct of this kind is the foundation of the approbation which is sometimes bestowed upon the laws under the vague terms of humanity equity suitableness moderation and wisdom in this respect there is a striking analogy between the art of the legislator and that of the physician the catalogue of circumstances influencing sensibility is necessary in both their sciences what distinguishes the physician from the empiric is the attention which the first pays to every thing which constitutes the particular state of the individual but it is especially in diseases which affect the mind in those which concern morality when hurtful habits are to be surmounted and new ones formed that it is necessary to study every thing which affects the dispositions of the invalid since a single error in this respect may change all the results and increase the evil instead of remedying it chapter vii of human actions in general i the business of government is to promote the happiness of the society by punishing and rewarding that part of its business which consists in punishing is more particularly the subject of penal law in proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious will be the demand it creates for punishment what happiness consists of we have already seen enjoyment of pleasures security from pains ii the general tendency of an act is more or less pernicious according to the sum total of its consequences that is according to the difference between the sum of such as are good and the sum of such as are evil iii it is to be observed that here as well as henceforward wherever consequences are spoken of such only are meant as are material of the consequences of any act the multitude and variety must needs be infinite but such of them only as are material are worth regarding now among the consequences of an act be they what they may such only by one who views them in the capacity of a legislator can be said to be material† as either consist of pain or pleasure or have an influence in the production of pain or pleasure‡ iv it is also to be observed that into the account of the consequences of the act are to be taken not such only as might have ensued were intention out of the question but such also as depend upon the connexion there may be between these firstmentioned consequences and the intention the connexion there is between the intention and certain consequences is as we shall see hereafter∥ a means of producing other consequences in this lies the difference between rational agency and irrational v now the intention with regard to the consequences of an act will depend upon two things   the state of the will or intention with respect to the act itself and   the state of the understanding or perceptive faculties with regard to the circumstances which it is or may appear to be accompanied with now with respect to these circumstances the perceptive faculty is susceptible of three states consciousness unconsciousness and false consciousness consciousness when the party believes precisely those circumstances and no others to subsist which really do subsist unconsciousness    when he fails of perceiving certain circumstances to subsist which however do subsist false consciousness when he believes or imagines certain circumstances to subsist which in truth do not subsist vi in every transaction therefore which is examined with a view to punishment there are four articles to be considered   the act itself which is done   the circumstances in which it is done   the intentionality that may have accompanied it   the consciousness unconsciousness or false consciousness that may have accompanied it what regards the act and the circumstances will be the subject of the present chapter what regards intention and consciousness that of the two succeeding vii there are also two other articles on which the general tendency of an act depends and on that as well as on other accounts the demand which it creates for punishment these are   the particular motive or motives which gave birth to it   the general disposition which it indicates these articles will be the subject of two other chapters viii acts may be distinguished in several ways for several purposes they may be distinguished in the first place into positive and negative by positive are meant such as consist in motion or exertion by negative such as consist in keeping at rest that is in forbearing to move or exert ones self in such and such circumstances thus to strike is a positive act not to strike on a certain occasion a negative one positive acts are styled also acts of commission negative acts of omission or forbearance ix such acts again as are negative may either be absolutely so or relatively absolutely when they import the negation of all positive agency whatsoever for instance not to strike at all relatively when they import the negation of such or such a particular mode of agency for instance not to strike such a person or such a thing or in such a direction x it is to be observed that the nature of the act whether positive or negative is not to be determined immediately by the form of the discourse made use of to express it an act which is positive in its nature may be characterized by a negative expression thus not to be at rest is as much as to say to move so also an act which is negative in its nature may be characterized by a positive expression thus to forbear or omit to bring food to a person in certain circumstances is signified by the single and positive term to starve xi in the second place acts may be distinguished into external and internal by external are meant corporal acts acts of the body by internal mental acts acts of the mind thus to strike is an external or exterior† act to intend to strike an internal or interior one xii acts of discourse are a sort of mixture of the two external acts which are no ways material nor attended with any consequences any farther than as they serve to express the existence of internal ones to speak to another to strike to write to him to strike to make signs to him to strike are all so many acts of discourse xiii third acts that are external may be distinguished into transitive and intransitive acts may be called transitive when the motion is communicated from the person of the agent to some foreign body that is to such a foreign body on which the effects of it are considered as being material as where a man runs against you or throws water in your face acts may be called intransitive when the motion is communicated to no other body on which the effects of it are regarded as material than some part of the same person in whom it originated as where a man runs or washes himself‡    xiv an act of the transitive kind may be said to be in its commencement or in the first stage of its progress while the motion is confined to the person of the agent and has not yet been communicated to any foreign body on which the effects of it can be material it may be said to be in its termination or to be in the last stage of its progress as soon as the motion or impulse has been communicated to some such foreign body it may be said to be in the middle or intermediate stage or stages of its progress while the motion having passed from the person of the agent has not yet been communicated to any such foreign body thus as soon as a man has lifted up his hand to strike the act he performs in striking you is in its commencement as soon as his hand has reached you it is in its termination if the act be the motion of a body which is separated from the person of the agent before it reaches the object it may be said during that interval to be in its intermediate progress or in gradu mediativo as in the case where a man throws a stone or fires a bullet at you xv an act of the intransitive kind may be said to be in its commencement when the motion or impulse is as yet confined to the member or organ in which it originated and has not yet been communicated to any member or organ that is distinguishable from the former it may be said to be in its termination as soon as it has been applied to any other part of the same person thus where a man poisons himself while he is lifting up the poison to his mouth the act is in its commencement as soon as it has reached his lips it is in its termination† xvi in the third place acts may be distinguished into transient and continued thus to strike is a transient act to lean a continued one to buy a transient act to keep in ones possession a continued one xvii in strictness of speech there is a difference between a continued act and a repetition of acts it is a repetition of acts when there are intervals filled up by acts of different natures a continued act when there are no such intervals thus to lean is one continued act to keep striking a repetition of acts xviii there is a difference again between a repetition of acts and a habit or practice the term repetition of acts may be employed let the acts in question be separated by ever such short intervals and let the sum total of them occupy ever so short a space of time the term habit is not employed but when the acts in question are supposed to be separated by longcontinued intervals and the sum total of them to occupy a considerable space of time it is not for instance the drinking ever so many times nor ever so much at a time in the course of the same sitting that will constitute a habit of drunkenness it is necessary that such sittings themselves be frequently repeated every habit is a repetition of acts or to speak more strictly when a man has frequently repeated such and such acts after considerable intervals he is said to have persevered in or contracted a habit but every repetition of acts is not a habit‡ xix fourth acts may be distinguished into indivisible and divisible indivisible acts are merely imaginary they may be easily conceived but can never be known to be exemplified such as are divisible may be so with regard either to matter or to motion an act indivisible with regard to matter is the motion or rest of one single atom of matter an act indivisible with regard to motion is the motion of any body from one single atom of space to the next to it fifth acts may be distinguished into simple and complex simple such as the act of striking the act of leaning or the act of drinking above instanced complex consisting each of a multitude of simple acts which though numerous and heterogeneous derive a sort of unity from the relation they bear to some common design or end such as the act of giving a dinner the act of maintaining a child the act of exhibiting a triumph the act of bearing arms the act of holding a court and so forth xx it has been every now and then made a    question what it is in such a case that constitutes one act where one act has ended and another act has begun whether what has happened has been one act or many these questions it is now evident may frequently be answered with equal propriety in opposite ways and if there be any occasions on which they can be answered only in one way the answer will depend upon the nature of the occasion and the purpose for which the question is proposed a man is wounded in two fingers at one stroke—is it one wound or several a man is beaten at    oclock and again at   minutes after   —is it one beating or several you beat one man and instantly in the same breath you beat another—is this one beating or several in any of these cases it may be one perhaps as to some purposes and several as to others these examples are given that men may be aware of the ambiguity of language and neither harass themselves with unsolvable doubts nor one another with interminable disputes xxi so much with regard to acts considered in themselves we come now to speak of the circumstances with which they may have been accompanied these must necessarily be taken into the account before any thing can be determined relative to the consequences what the consequences of an act may be upon the whole can never otherwise be ascertained it can never be known whether it is beneficial or indifferent or mischievous in some circumstances even to kill a man may be a beneficial act in others to set food before him may be a pernicious one xxii now the circumstances of an act are what any objects† whatsoever take any act whatsoever there is nothing in the nature of things that excludes any imaginable object from being a circumstance to it any given object may be a circumstance to any other‡ xxiii we have already had occasion to make mention for a moment of the consequences of an act these were distinguished into material and immaterial in like manner may the circumstances of it be distinguished now materiality is a relative term applied to the consequences of an act it bore relation to pain and pleasure applied to the circumstances it bears relation to the consequences a circumstance may be said to be material when it bears a visible relation in point of causality to the consequences immaterial when it bears no such visible relation xxiv the consequences of an act are events∥ a circumstance may be related to an event in point of causality in any one of four ways   in the way of causation or production   in the way of derivation   in the way of collateral connexion   in the way of conjunct influence it may be said to be related to the event in the way of causation when it is of the number of those that contribute to the production of such event in the way of derivation when it is of the number of the events to the production of which that in question has been contributory in the way of collateral connexion where the circumstance in question and the event in question without being either of them instrumental in the production of the other are related each of them to some common object which has been concerned in the production of them both in the way of conjunct influence when whether related in any other way or not they have both of them concurred in the production of some common consequence xxv an example may be of use in the year      villiers duke of buckingham favourite and minister of charles i of england received a wound and died the man who gave it him was one felton who exasperated at the maladministration of which that minister was accused went down from london to portsmouth where buckingham happened then to be made his way into his antichamber and finding him busily engaged in conversation with a number of people round him got close to him drew a knife and stabbed him in the effort the assassins hat fell off which was found soon after and upon searching him the bloody knife in the crown of the hat were found scraps of paper with sentences expressive of the purpose he was come upon here then suppose the event in question is the wound received by buckingham feltons drawing out his knife his making his way into the chamber    his going down to portsmouth his conceiving an indignation at the idea of buckinghams administration that administration itself charless appointing such a minister and so on higher and higher without end are so many circumstances related to the event of buckinghams receiving the wound in the way of causation or production the bloodiness of the knife a circumstance related to the same event in the way of derivation the finding of the hat upon the ground the finding the sentences in the hat and the writing them so many circumstances related to it in the way of collateral connexion and the situation and conversations of the people about buckingham were circumstances related to the circumstances of feltons making his way into the room going down to portsmouth and so forth in the way of conjunct influence inasmuch as they contributed in common to the event of buckinghams receiving the wound by preventing him from putting himself upon his guard upon the first appearance of the intruder xxvi these several relations do not all of them attach upon an event with equal certainty in the first place it is plain indeed that every event must have some circumstance or other and in truth an indefinite multitude of circumstances related to it in the way of production it must of course have a still greater multitude of circumstances related to it in the way of collateral connexion but it does not appear necessary that every event should have circumstances related to it in the way of derivation nor therefore that it should have any related to it in the way of conjunct influence but of the circumstances of all kinds which actually do attach upon an event it is only a very small number that can be discovered by the utmost exertion of the human faculties it is a still smaller number that ever actually do attract our notice when occasion happens more or fewer of them will be discovered by a man in proportion to the strength partly of his intellectual powers partly of his inclination† it appears therefore that the multitude and description of such of the circumstances belonging to an act as may appear to be material will be determined by two considerations   by the nature of things themselves   by the strength or weakness of the faculties of those who happen to consider them xxvii thus much it seemed necessary to premise in general concerning acts and their circumstances previously to the consideration of the particular sorts of acts with their particular circumstances with which we shall have to do in the body of the work an act of some sort or other is necessarily included in the notion of every offence together with this act under the notion of the same offence are included certain circumstances which circumstances enter into the essence of the offence contribute by their conjunct influence to the production of its consequences and in conjunction with the act are brought into view by the name by which it stands distinguished these we shall have occasion to distinguish hereafter by the name of criminative circumstances‡ other circumstances again entering into combination with the act and the former set of circumstances are productive of still farther consequences these additional consequences if they are of the beneficial kind bestow according to the value they bear in that capacity upon the circumstances to which they  0 owe their birth the appellation of exculpative or extenuative circumstances† if of the mischievous kind they bestow on them the appellation of aggravative circumstances‡ of all these different sets of circumstances the criminative are connected with the consequences of the original offence in the way of production with the act and with one another in the way of conjunct influence the consequences of the original offence with them and with the act respectively in the way of derivation the consequences of the modified offence with the criminative exculpative and extenuative circumstances respectively in the way also of derivation these different sets of circumstances with the consequences of the modified act or offence in the way of production and with one another in respect of the consequences of the modified act or offence in the way of conjunct influence lastly whatever circumstances can be seen to be connected with the consequences of the offence whether directly in the way of derivation or obliquely in the way of collateral affinity to wit in virtue of its being connected in the way of derivation with some of the circumstances with which they stand connected in the same manner bear a material relation to the offence in the way of evidence they may accordingly be styled evidentiary circumstances and may become of use by being held forth upon occasion as so many proofs indications or evidences of its having been committed∥§ chapter viii of intentionality i so much with regard to the two first of the articles upon which the evil tendency of an action may depend viz the act itself and the general assemblage of the circumstances with which it may have been accompanied we come now to consider the ways in which the particular circumstance of intention may be concerned in it ii first then the intention or will may regard either of two objects   the act itself or   its consequences of these objects that which the intention regards may be styled intentional if it regards the act then the act may be said to be intentional¶ if the consequences so also then may the consequences if it regards both the act and the consequences the whole action may be said to be intentional whichever of those articles is not the object of the intention may of course be said to be unintentional iii the act may very easily be intentional without the consequences and often is so thus you may intend to touch a man without intending to hurt him and yet as the consequences turn out you may chance to hurt him iv the consequences of an act may also be intentional without the acts being intentional throughout that is without its being intentional in every stage of it but this is not so frequent a case as the former you intend to hurt a man suppose by running against him and pushing him down and you run towards him accordingly but a second man coming in on a sudden between you and the first man before you can stop yourself you run against the second man and by him push down the first v but the consequences of an act cannot be intentional without the acts being itself intentional in at least the first stage if the act be not intentional in the first stage it is no act of yours there is accordingly no intention on your part to produce the consequences that is to say the individual consequences all there can have been on your part is a distant intention to produce other consequences of the same nature by some act of yours at a future time or else without any intention a bare wish to see such event take place the second man suppose    runs of his own accord against the first and pushes him down you had intentions of doing a thing of the same nature viz to run against him and push him down yourself but you had done nothing in pursuance of those intentions the individual consequences therefore of the act which the second man performed in pushing down the first cannot be said to have been on your part intentional vi second a consequence when it is intentional may either be directly so or only obliquely it may be said to be directly or lineally intentional when the prospect of producing it constituted one of the links in the chain of causes by which the person was determined to do the act it may be said to be obliquely or collaterally intentional when although the consequence was in contemplation and appeared likely to ensue in case of the acts being performed yet the prospect of producing such consequence did not constitute a link in the aforesaid chain vii third an incident which is directly intentional may either be ultimately so or only mediately it may be said to be ultimately intentional when it stands last of all exterior events in the aforesaid chain of motives insomuch that the prospect of the production of such incident could there be a certainty of its taking place would be sufficient to determine the will without the prospect of its producing any other it may be said to be mediately intentional and no more when there is some other incident the prospect of producing which forms a subsequent link in the same chain insomuch that the prospect of producing the former would not have operated as a motive but for the tendency which it seemed to have towards the production of the latter viii fourth when an incident is directly intentional it may either be exclusively so or inexclusively it may be said to be exclusively intentional when no other but that very individual incident would have answered the purpose insomuch that no other incident had any share in determining the will to the act in question it may be said to have been inexclusively† intentional when there was some other incident the prospect of which was acting upon the will at the same time ix fifth when an incident is inexclusively intentional it may be either conjunctively so disjunctively or indiscriminately it may be said to be conjunctively intentional with regard to such other incident when the intention is to produce both disjunctively when the intention is to produce either the one or the other indifferently but not both indiscriminately when the intention is indifferently to produce either the one or the other or both as it may happen x sixth when two incidents are disjunctively intentional they may be so with or without preference they may be said to be so with preference when the intention is that one of them in particular should happen rather than the other without preference when the intention is equally fulfilled whichever of them happens‡    xi one example will make all this clear william ii king of england being out a staghunting received from sir walter tyrrel a wound of which he died let us take this case and diversify it with a variety of suppositions correspondent to the distinctions just laid down   first then tyrrel did not so much as entertain a thought of the kings death or if he did looked upon it as an event of which there was no danger in either of these cases the incident of his killing the king was altogether unintentional   he saw a stag running that way and he saw the king riding that way at the same time what he aimed at was to kill the stag he did not wish to kill the king at the same time he saw that if he shot it was as likely he should kill the king as the stag yet for all that he shot and killed the king accordingly in this case the incident of his killing the king was intentional but obliquely so   he killed the king on account of the hatred he bore him and for no other reason than the pleasure of destroying him in this case the incident of the kings death was not only directly but ultimately intentional   he killed the king intending fully so to do not for any hatred he bore him but for the sake of plundering him when dead in this case the incident of the kings death was directly intentional but not ultimately it was mediately intentional   he intended neither more nor less than to kill the king he had no other aim nor wish in this case it was exclusively as well as directly intentional exclusively to wit with regard to every other material incident   sir walter shot the king in the right leg as he was plucking a thorn out of it with his left hand his intention was by shooting the arrow into his leg through his hand to cripple him in both those limbs at the same time in this case the incident of the kings being shot in the leg was intentional and that conjunctively with another which did not happen viz his being shot in the hand   the intention of tyrrel was to shoot the king either in the hand or in the leg but not in both and rather in the hand than in the leg in this case the intention of shooting in the hand was disjunctively concurrent with regard to the other incident and that with preference   his intention was to shoot the king either in the leg or the hand whichever might happen but not in both in this case the intention was inexclusive but disjunctively so yet that however without preference   his intention was to shoot the king either in the leg or the hand or in both as it might happen in this case the intention was indiscriminately concurrent with respect to the two incidents xii it is to be observed that an act may be unintentional in any stage or stages of it though intentional in the preceding and on the other hand it may be intentional in any stage or stages of it and yet unintentional in the succeeding† but whether it be intentional or no in any preceding stage is immaterial with respect to the consequences so it be unintentional in the last the only point with respect to which it is material is the proof the more stages the act is unintentional in the more apparent it will commonly be that it was unintentional with respect to the last if a man intending to strike you on the cheek strikes you in the eye and puts it out it will probably be difficult for him to prove that it was not his intention to strike you in the eye it will probably be easier if his intention was really not to strike you or even not to strike at all xiii it is frequent to hear men speak of a good intention of a bad intention of the goodness and badness of a mans intention a circumstance on which great stress is generally laid it is indeed of no small importance when properly understood but the import of it is to the last degree ambiguous and obscure strictly speaking nothing can be said to be good or bad but either in itself which is the case only with pain or pleasure or on account of its effects which is the case only with things that are the causes or preventives of pain and pleasure but in a figurative and less proper way of speech a thing may also be styled good or bad in consideration of its cause now the effects of an intention to do such or such an act are the same objects which we have been speaking of under the appellation of its consequences and the causes of intention are called motives a mans intention then on any occasion may be styled good or bad with reference either to the consequences of the act or with reference to his motives if it be deemed good or bad in any sense it must be either because it is deemed to be productive of good or of bad consequences or because it is deemed to originate from a good or from a bad motive    but the goodness or badness of the consequences depend upon the circumstances now the circumstances are no objects of the intention a man intends the act and by his intention produces the act but as to the circumstances he does not intend them he does not inasmuch as they are circumstances of it produce them if by accident there be a few which he has been instrumental in producing it has been by former intentions directed to former acts productive of those circumstances as the consequences at the time in question he takes them as he finds them acts with their consequences are objects of the will as well as of the understanding circumstances as such are objects of the understanding only all he can do with these as such is to know or not to know them in other words to be conscious of them or not conscious to the title of consciousness belongs what is to be said of the goodness or badness of a mans intention as resulting from the consequences of the act and to the head of motives what is to be said of his intention as resulting from the motive chapter ix of consciousness i so far with regard to the ways in which the will or intention may be concerned in the production of any incident we come now to consider the part which the understanding or perceptive faculty may have borne with relation to such incident ii a certain act has been done and that intentionally that act was attended with certain circumstances upon these circumstances depended certain of its consequences and amongst the rest all those which were of a nature purely physical now then take any one of these circumstances it is plain that a man at the time of doing the act from whence such consequences ensued may have been either conscious with respect to this circumstance or unconscious in other words he may either have been aware of the circumstance or not aware it may either have been present to his mind or not present in the first case the act may be said to have been an advised act with respect to that circumstance in the other case an unadvised one iii there are two points with regard to which an act may have been advised or unadvised   the existence of the circumstance itself   the materiality of it iv it is manifest that with reference to the time of the act such circumstance may have been either present past or future v an act which is unadvised is either heedless or not heedless it is termed heedless when the case is thought to be such that a person of ordinary prudence† if prompted by an ordinary share of benevolence would have been likely to have bestowed such and so much attention and reflection upon the material circumstances as would have effectually disposed him to prevent the mischievous incident from taking place not heedless when the case is not thought to be such as above mentioned‡ vi again whether a man did or did not suppose the existence or materiality of a given circumstance it may be that he did suppose the existence and materiality of some circumstance which either did not exist or which though existing was not material in such case the act may be said to be misadvised with respect to such imagined circumstance and it may be said that there has been an erroneous supposition or a missupposal in the case vii now a circumstance the existence of which is thus erroneously supposed may be material either   in the way of prevention or   in that of compensation it may be said to be material in the way of prevention when its effect or tendency had it existed would have been to prevent the obnoxious consequences in the way of compensation when that effect or tendency would have been to produce other consequences the beneficialness of which would have outweighed the mischievousness of the others viii it is manifest that with reference to the time of the act such imaginary circumstance may in either case have been supposed either to be present past or future ix to return to the example exhibited in the preceding chapter  0 tyrrel intended to shoot in the direction in which he shot but he did not know that the king was riding so near that way in this case the act he performed in shooting the act of shooting was unadvised with respect to the existence of the circumstance of the kings being so near riding that way    he knew that the king was riding that way but at the distance at which the king was he knew not of the probability there was that the arrow would reach him in    this case the act was unadvised with respect to the materiality of the circumstance    somebody had dipped the arrow in poison without tyrrels knowing of it in this case the act was unadvised with respect to the existence of a past circumstance    at the very instant that tyrrel drew the bow the king being screened from his view by the foliage of some bushes was riding furiously in such manner as to meet the arrow in a direct line which circumstance was also more than tyrrel knew of in this case the act was unadvised with respect to the existence of a present circumstance    the king being at a distance from court could get nobody to dress his wound till the next day of which circumstance tyrrel was not aware in this case the act was unadvised with respect to what was then a future circumstance    tyrrel knew of the kings being riding that way of his being so near and so forth but being deceived by the foliage of the bushes he thought he saw a bank between the spot from which he shot and that to which the king was riding in this case the act was misadvised proceeding on the missupposal of a preventive circumstance    tyrrel knew that every thing was as above nor was he deceived by the supposition of any preventive circumstance but he believed the king to be an usurper and supposed he was coming up to attack a person whom tyrrel believed to be the rightful king and who was riding by tyrrels side in this case the act was also misadvised but proceeded on the missupposal of a compensative circumstance x let us observe the connexion there is between intentionality and consciousness when the act itself is intentional and with respect to the existence of all the circumstances advised as also with respect to the materiality of those circumstances in relation to a given consequence and there is no missupposal with regard to any preventive circumstance that consequence must also be intentional in other words advisedness with respect to the circumstances if clear from the missupposal of any preventive circumstance extends the intentionality from the act to the consequences those consequences may be either directly intentional or only obliquely so but at any rate they cannot but be intentional xi to go on with the example if tyrrel intended to shoot in the direction in which the king was riding up and knew that the king was coming to meet the arrow and knew the probability there was of his being shot in that same part in which he was shot or in another as dangerous and with that same degree of force and so forth and was not misled by the erroneous supposition of a circumstance by which the shot would have been prevented from taking place or any such other preventive circumstance it is plain he could not but have intended the kings death perhaps he did not positively wish it but for all that in a certain sense he intended it xii what heedlessness is in the case of an unadvised act rashness is in the case of a misadvised one a misadvised act then may be either rash or not rash it may be termed rash when the case is thought to be such that a person of ordinary prudence if prompted by an ordinary share of benevolence would have employed such and so much attention and reflection to the imagined circumstance as by discovering to him the nonexistence improbability or immateriality of it would have effectually disposed him to prevent the mischievous incident from taking place xiii in ordinary discourse when a man does an act of which the consequences prove mischievous it is a common thing to speak of him as having acted with a good intention or with a bad intention of his intention being a good one or a bad one the epithets good and bad are all this while applied we see to the intention but the application of them is most commonly governed by a supposition formed with regard to the nature of the motive the act though eventually it prove mischievous is said to be done with a good intention when it is supposed to issue from a motive which is looked upon as a good motive with a bad intention when it is supposed to be the result of a motive which is looked upon as a bad motive but the nature of the consequences intended and the nature of the motive which gave birth to the intention are objects which though intimately connected are perfectly distinguishable the intention might therefore with perfect propriety be styled a good one whatever were the motive it might be styled a good one when not only the consequences of the act prove mischievous but the motive which gave birth to it was what is called a bad one to warrant the speaking of the intention as being a good one it is sufficient if the consequences of the act had they proved what to the agent they seemed likely to be would have been of a beneficial nature and in the same manner the intention may be bad when not only the consequences of the act prove beneficial but the motive which gave birth to it was a good one xiv now when a man has a mind to speak of your intention as being good or bad with reference to the consequences if he speaks of it at all he must use the word intention for there is no other but if a man means to    speak of the motive from which your intention originated as being a good or a bad one he is certainly not obliged to use the word intention it is at least as well to use the word motive by the supposition he means the motive and very likely he may not mean the intention for what is true of the one is very often not true of the other the motive may be good when the intention is bad the intention may be good when the motive is bad whether they are both good or both bad or the one good and the other bad makes as we shall see hereafter a very essential difference with regard to the consequences it is therefore much better when motive is meant never to say intention xv an example will make this clear out of malice a man prosecutes you for a crime of which he believes you to be guilty but of which in fact you are not guilty here the consequences of his conduct are mischievous for they are mischievous to you at any rate in virtue of the shame and anxiety which you are made to suffer while the prosecution is depending to which is to be added in case of your being convicted the evil of the punishment to you therefore they are mischievous nor is there any one to whom they are beneficial the mans motive was also what is called a bad one for malice will be allowed by every body to be a bad motive however the consequences of his conduct had they proved such as he believed them likely to be would have been good for in them would have been included the punishment of a criminal which is a benefit to all who are exposed to suffer by a crime of the like nature the intention therefore in this case though not in a common way of speaking the motive might be styled a good one but of motives more particularly in the next chapter xvi in the same sense the intention whether it be positively good or no so long as it is not bad may be termed innocent accordingly let the consequences have proved mischievous and let the motive have been what it will the intention may be termed innocent in either of two cases   in the case of unadvisedness with respect to any of the circumstances on which the mischievousness of the consequences depended   in the case of misadvisedness with respect to any circumstance which had it been what it appeared to be would have served either to prevent or to outweigh the mischief xvii a few words for the purpose of applying what has been said to the roman law unintentionality and innocence of intention seem both to be included in the case of infortunium where there is neither dolus nor culpa unadvisedness coupled with heedlessness and misadvisedness coupled with rashness correspond to the culpa sine dolo direct intentionality corresponds to dolus oblique intentionality seems hardly to have been distinguished from direct were it to occur it would probably be deemed also to correspond to dolus the division into culpa lata levis and levissima is such as nothing certain can correspond to what is it that it expresses a distinction not in the case itself but only in the sentiments which any person a judge for instance may find himself disposed to entertain with relation to it supposing it already distinguished into three subordinate cases by other means the word dolus seems ill enough contrived the word culpa as indifferently dolus upon any other occasion would be understood to imply deceit concealment† clandestinity‡ but here it is extended to open force culpa upon any other occasion would be understood to extend to blame of every kind it would therefore include dolus∥ xviii the abovementioned definitions and distinctions    are far from being mere matters of speculation they are capable of the most extensive and constant application as well to moral discourse as to legislative practice upon the degree and bias of a mans intention upon the absence or presence of consciousness or missupposal depend a great part of the good and bad more especially of the bad consequences of an act and on this as well as other grounds a great part of the demand for punishment the presence of intention with regard to such or such a consequence and of consciousness with regard to such or such a circumstance of the act will form so many criminative circumstances† or essential ingredients in the composition of this or that offence applied to other circumstances consciousness will form a ground of aggravation annexable to the like offence‡ in almost all cases the absence of intention with regard to certain consequences and the absence of consciousness or the presence of missupposal with regard to certain circumstances will constitute so many grounds of extenuation§ chapter x of motives §   different senses of the word motive∥ i it is an acknowledged truth that every kind of act whatever and consequently every kind of offence is apt to assume a different character and be attended with different effects according to the nature of the motive which gives birth to it this makes it requisite to take a view of the several motives by which human conduct is liable to be influenced ii by a motive in the most extensive sense in which the word is ever used with reference to a thinking being is meant any thing that can contribute to give birth to or even to prevent any kind of action now the action of a thinking being is the act either of the body or only of the mind and an act of the mind is an act either of the intellectual faculty or of the will acts of the intellectual faculty will sometimes rest in the understanding merely without exerting any influence in the production of any acts of the will motives which are not of a nature to influence any other acts than those may be styled purely speculative motives or motives resting in speculation but as to these acts neither do they exercise any influence over external acts or over their consequences nor consequently over any pain or any pleasure that may be in the number of such consequences now it is only on acount of their tendency to produce either pain or pleasure that any acts can be material with acts therefore that rest purely in the understanding we have not here any concern nor therefore with any object if any such there be which in the character of a motive can have no influence on any other acts than those iii the motives with which alone we have any concern are such as are of a nature to act upon the will by a motive then in this sense of the word is to be understood any thing whatsoever which by influencing the will of a sensitive being is supposed to serve as a means of determining him to act or voluntarily to forbear to act¶ upon any occasion motives of this sort in contradistinction to the former may be styled practical motives or motives applying to practice iv owing to the poverty and unsettled state of language the word motive is employed indiscriminately to denote two kinds of objects which for the better understanding of the subject it is necessary should be distinguished on some occasions it is employed to denote any of those really existing incidents from whence the act in question is supposed to take its rise the sense it bears on these occasions may be styled its literal or unfigurative sense on other occasions it is employed to denote a certain fictitious entity a passion an affection of the mind an ideal being which upon the happening of any such incident is considered as operating upon    the mind and prompting it to take that course towards which it is impelled by the influence of such incident motives of this class are avarice indolence benevolence and so forth as we shall see more particularly farther on this latter may be styled the figurative sense of the term motive v as to the real incidents to which the name of motive is also given these too are of two very different kinds they may be either   the internal perception of any individual lot of pleasure or pain the expectation of which is looked upon as calculated to determine you to act in such or such a manner as the pleasure of acquiring such a sum of money the pain of exerting yourself on such an occasion and so forth or   any external event the happening whereof is regarded as having a tendency to bring about the perception of such pleasure or such pain for instance the coming up of a lottery ticket by which the possession of the money devolves to you or the breaking out of a fire in the house you are in which makes it necessary for you to quit it the former kind of motives may be termed interior or internal the latter exterior or external vi two other senses of the term motive need also to be distinguished motive refers necessarily to action it is a pleasure pain or other event that prompts to action motive then in one sense of the word must be previous to such event but for a man to be governed by any motive he must in every case look beyond that event which is called his action he must look to the consequences of it and it is only in this way that the idea of pleasure of pain or of any other event can give birth to it he must look therefore in every case to some event posterior to the act in contemplation an event which as yet exists not but stands only in prospect now as it is in all cases difficult and in most cases unnecessary to distinguish between objects so intimately connected as the posterior possible object which is thus looked forward to and the present existing object or event which takes place upon a mans looking forward to the other they are both of them spoken of under the same appellation motive to distinguish them the one first mentioned may be termed a motive in prospect the other a motive in esse and under each of these denominations will come as well exterior as internal motives a fire breaks out in your neighbours house you are under apprehension of its extending to your own you are apprehensive that if you stay in it you will be burnt you accordingly run out of it this then is the act the others are all motives to it the event of the fires breaking out in your neighbours house is an external motive and that in esse the idea or belief of the probability of the fires extending to your own house that of your being burnt if you continue and the pain you feel at the thought of such a catastrophe are all so many internal events but still in esse the event of the fires actually extending to your own house and that of your being actually burnt by it external motives in prospect the pain you would feel at seeing your house aburning and the pain you would feel while you yourself were burning internal motives in prospect which events according as the matter turns out may come to be in esse but then of course they will cease to act as motives vii of all these motives which stand nearest to the act to the production of which they all contribute is that internal motive in esse which consists in the expectation of the internal motive in prospect the pain or uneasiness you feel at the thoughts of being burnt all other motives are more or less remote the motives in prospect in proportion as the period at which they are expected to happen is more distant from the period at which the act takes place and consequently later in point of time the motives in esse in proportion as they also are more distant from that period and consequently earlier in point of time† viii it has already been observed that with motives of which the influence terminates altogether in the understanding we have nothing here to do if then amongst objects that are spoken of as motives with reference to the understanding there be any which concern us here it is only in as far as such objects may through the medium of the understanding    exercise an influence over the will it is in this way and in this way only that any objects in virtue of any tendency they may have to influence the sentiment of belief may in a practical sense act in the character of motives any objects by tending to induce a belief concerning the existence actual or probable of a practical motive that is concerning the probability of a motive in prospect or the existence of a motive in esse may exercise an influence on the will and rank with those other motives that have been placed under the name of practical the pointing out of motives such as these is what we frequently mean when we talk of giving reasons your neighbours house is on fire as before i observe to you that at the lower part of your neighbours house is some woodwork which joins on to yours that the flames have caught this woodwork and so forth which i do in order to dispose you to believe as i believe that if you stay in your house much longer you will be burnt in doing this then i suggest motives to your understanding which motives by the tendency they have to give birth to or strengthen a pain which operates upon you in the character of an internal motive in esse join their force and act as motives upon the will §   no motives either constantly good or constantly bad ix in all this chain of motives the principal or original link seems to be the last internal motive in prospect it is to this that all the other motives in prospect owe their materiality and the immediately acting motive its existence this motive in prospect we see is always some pleasure or some pain some pleasure which the act in question is expected to be a means of continuing or producing some pain which it is expected to be a means of discontinuing or preventing a motive is substantially nothing more than pleasure or pain operating in a certain manner x now pleasure is in itself a good nay even setting aside immunity from pain the only good pain is in itself an evil and indeed without exception the only evil or else the words good and evil have no meaning and this is alike true of every sort of pain and of every sort of pleasure it follows therefore immediately and incontestibly that there is no such thing as any sort of motive that is in itself a bad one xi it is common however to speak of actions as proceeding from good or bad motives in which case the motives meant are such as are internal the expression is far from being an accurate one and as it is apt to occur in the consideration of almost every kind of offence it will be requisite to settle the precise meaning of it and observe how far it quadrates with the truth of things xii with respect to goodness and badness as it is with every thing else that is not itself either pain or pleasure so is it with motives if they are good or bad it is only on account of their effects good on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or avert pain bad on account of their tendency to produce pain or avert pleasure now the case is that from one and the same motive and from every kind of motive may proceed actions that are good others that are bad and others that are indifferent this we shall proceed to shew with respect to all the different kinds of motives as determined by the various kinds of pleasures and pains xiii such an analysis useful as it is will be found to be a matter of no small difficulty owing in great measure to a certain perversity of structure which prevails more or less throughout all languages to speak of motives as of any thing else one must call them by their names but the misfortune is that it is rare to meet with a motive of which the name expresses that and nothing more commonly along with the very name of the motive is tacitly involved a proposition imputing to it a certain quality a quality which in many cases will appear to include that very goodness or badness concerning which we are here inquiring whether properly speaking it be or be not imputable to motives to use the common phrase in most cases the name of the motive is a word which is employed either only in a good sense or else only in a bad sense now when a word is spoken of as being used in a good sense all that is necessarily meant is this that in conjunction with the idea of the object it is put to signify it conveys an idea of approbation that is of a pleasure or satisfaction entertained by the person who employs the term at the thoughts of such object in like manner when a word is spoken of as being used in a bad sense all that is necessarily meant is this that in conjunction with the idea of the object it is put to signify it conveys an idea of disapprobation    that is of a displeasure entertained by the person who employs the term at the thoughts of such object now the circumstance on which such approbation is grounded will as naturally as any other be the opinion of the goodness of the object in question as above explained such at least it must be upon the principle of utility so on the other hand the circumstance on which any such disapprobation is grounded will as naturally as any other be the opinion of the badness of the object such at least it must be in as far as the principle of utility is taken for the standard now there are certain motives which unless in a few particular cases have scarcely any other name to be expressed by but such a word as is used only in a good sense this is the case for example with the motives of piety and honour the consequence of this is that if in speaking of such a motive a man should have occasion to apply the epithet bad to any actions which he mentions as apt to result from it he must appear to be guilty of a contradiction in terms but the names of motives which have scarcely any other name to be expressed by but such a word as is used only in a bad sense are many more this is the case for example with the motives of lust and avarice and accordingly if in speaking of any such motive a man should have occasion to apply the epithets good on indifferent to any actions which he mentions as apt to result from it he must here also appear to be guilty of a similar contradiction† this perverse association of ideas cannot it is evident but throw great difficulties in the way of the inquiry now before us confining himself to the language most in use a man can scarce avoid running in appearance into perpetual contradictions his propositions will appear on the one hand repugnant to truth and on the other hand adverse to utility as paradoxes they will excite contempt as mischievous paradoxes indignation for the truths he labours to convey however important and however salutary his reader is never the better and he himself is much the worse to obviate this inconvenience completely he has but this one unpleasant remedy to lay aside the old phraseology and invent a new one happy the man whose language is ductile enough to permit him this resource to palliate the inconvenience where that method of obviating it is impracticable he has nothing left for it but to enter into a long discussion to state the whole matter at large to confess that for the sake of promoting the purposes he has violated the established laws of language and to throw himself upon the mercy of his readers‡ §   catalogue of motives corresponding to that of pleasures and pains xiv from the pleasures of the senses considered in the gross results the motive which in a neutral sense may be termed physical desire in a bad sense it is termed sensuality name used in a good sense it has none of this nothing can be determined till it be considered separately with reference to the several species of pleasures to which it corresponds xv in particular then to the pleasures of the taste or palate corresponds a motive which in a neutral sense having received no name that can serve to express it in all cases can only be termed by circumlocution the love of the pleasures of the palate in particular cases it is styled hunger in others thirst∥  0 the love of good cheer expresses this motive but seems to go beyond intimating that the pleasure is to be partaken of in company and involving a kind of sympathy in a bad sense it is styled in some cases greediness voraciousness gluttony in others principally when applied to children lickerishness it may in some cases also be represented by the word daintiness name used in a good sense it has none   a boy who does not want for victuals steals a cake out of a pastrycooks shop and eats it in this case his motive will be universally deemed a bad one and if it be asked what it is it may be answered perhaps lickerishness   a boy buys a cake out of a pastrycooks shop and eats it in this case his motive can scarcely be looked upon as either good or bad unless his master should be out of humour with him and then perhaps he may call it lickerishness as before in both cases however his motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the motive corresponding to the pleasures of the palate xvi to the pleasures of the sexual sense corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense may be termed sexual desire in a bad sense it is spoken of under the name of lasciviousness and a variety of other names of reprobation name used in a good sense it has none†   a man ravishes a virgin in this case the motive is without scruple termed by the name of lust lasciviousness and so forth and is universally looked upon as a bad one   the same man at another time exercises the rights of marriage with his wife in this case the motive is accounted perhaps a good one or at least indifferent and here people would scruple to call it by any of those names in both cases however the motive may be precisely the same in both cases it may be neither more nor less than sexual desire xvii to the pleasures of curiosity corresponds the motive known by the same name and which may be otherwise called the love of novelty or the love of experiment and on particular occasions sport and sometimes play   a boy in order to divert himself reads an improving book the motive is accounted perhaps a good one at any rate not a bad one   he sets his top aspinning the motive is deemed at any rate not a bad one   he sets loose a mad ox among a crowd his motive is now perhaps termed an abominable one yet in all three cases the motive may be the very same it may be neither more nor less than curiosity xviii as to the other pleasures of sense they are of too little cousequence to have given any separate denominations to the corresponding motives xix to the pleasures of wealth corresponds the sort of motive which in a neutral sense may be termed pecuniary interest in a bad sense it is termed in some cases avarice covetousness rapacity or lucre in other cases niggardliness in a good sense but only in particular cases economy and frugality and in some cases the word industry may be applied to it in a sense nearly indifferent but rather bad than otherwise it is styled though only in particular cases parsimony   for money you gratify a mans hatred by putting his adversary to death   for money you plough his field for him in the first case your motive is termed lucre and is accounted corrupt and abominable and in the second for want of a proper appellation it is styled industry and is looked upon as innocent at least if not meritorious yet the motive is in both cases precisely the same it is neither more nor less than pecuniary interest xx the pleasures of skill are neither distinct enough nor of consequence enough to have given any name to the corresponding motive xxi to the pleasures of amity corresponds a motive which in a neutral sense may be termed the desire of ingratiating ones self in a bad sense it is in certain cases styled servility in a good sense it has no name that is peculiar to it in the cases in which it has been looked on with a favourable eye it has seldom been distinguished from the motive of sympathy or benevolence with which in such cases it is commonly associated   to acquire the affections of a woman before marriage to preserve them afterwards you do every thing that is consistent with other duties to make her happy in this case your motive is looked upon as laudable though there is no name for it   for the    same purpose you poison a woman with whom she is at enmity in this case your motive is looked upon as abominable though still there is no name for it   to acquire or preserve the favour of a man who is richer or more powerful than yourself you make yourself subservient to his pleasures let them even be lawful pleasures if people choose to attribute your behaviour to this motive you will not get them to find any other name for it than servility yet in all three cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the desire of ingratiating yourself xxii to the pleasures of the moral sanction or as they may otherwise be called the pleasures of a good name corresponds a motive which in a neutral sense has scarcely yet obtained any adequate appellative it may be styled the love of reputation it is nearly related to the motive last preceding being neither more nor less than the desire of ingratiating ones self with or as in this case we should rather say of recommending ones self to the world at large in a good sense it is termed honour or the sense of honour or rather the word honour is introduced somehow or other upon the occasion of its being brought to view for in strictness the word honour is put rather to signify that imaginary object which a man is spoken of as possessing upon the occasion of his obtaining a conspicuous share of the pleasures that are in question in particular cases it is styled the love of glory in a bad sense it is styled in some cases false honour in others pride in others vanity in a sense not decidedly bad but rather bad than otherwise ambition in an indifferent sense in some cases the love of fame in others the sense of shame and as the pleasures belonging to the moral sanction run undistinguishably into the pains derived from the same source it may also be styled in some cases the fear of dishonour the fear of disgrace the fear of infamy the fear of ignominy or the fear of shame   you have received an affront from a man according to the custom of the country in order on the one hand to save yourself from the shame of being thought to bear it patiently† on the other hand to obtain the reputation of courage you challenge him to fight with mortal weapons in this case your motive will by some people be accounted laudable and styled honour by others it will be accounted blameable and these if they call it honour will prefix an epithet of improbation to it and call it false honour   in order to obtain a post of rank and dignity and thereby to increase the respect paid you by the public you bribe the electors who are to confer it or the judge before whom the title to it is in dispute in this case your motive is commonly accounted corrupt and abominable and is styled perhaps by some such name as dishonest or corrupt ambition as there is no single name for it   in order to obtain the goodwill of the public you bestow a large sum in works of private charity or public utility in this case people will be apt not to agree about your motive your enemies will put a bad colour    upon it and call it ostentation your friends to save you from this reproach will choose to impute your conduct not to this motive but to some other such as that of charity the denomination in this case given to private sympathy or that of public spirit   a king for the sake of gaining the admiration annexed to the name of conqueror we will suppose power and resentment out of the question engages his kingdom in a bloody war his motive by the multitude whose sympathy for millions is easily overborne by the pleasure which their imagination finds in gaping at any novelty they observe in the conduct of a single person is deemed an admirable one men of feeling and reflection who disapprove of the dominion exercised by this motive on this occasion without always perceiving that it is the same motive which in other instances meets with their approbation deem it an abominable one and because the multitude who are the manufacturers of language have not given them a simple name to call it by they will call it by some such compound name as the love of false glory or false ambition yet in all four cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the love of reputation xxiii to the pleasures of power corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense may be termed the love of power people who are out of humour with it sometimes call it the lust of power in a good sense it is scarcely provided with a name in certain cases this motive as well as the love of reputation are confounded under the same name ambition this is not to be wondered at considering the intimate connexion there is between the two motives in many cases since it commonly happens that the same object which affords the one sort of pleasure affords the other sort at the same time for instance offices which are at once posts of honour and places of trust and since at any rate reputation is the road to power   if in order to gain a place in administration you poison the man who occupies it   if in the same view you propose a salutary plan for the advancement of the public welfare your motive is in both cases the same yet in the first case it is accounted criminal and abominable in the second case allowable and even laudable xxiv to the pleasures as well as to the pains of the religious sanction corresponds a motive which has strictly speaking no perfectly neutral name applicable to all cases unless the word religion be admitted in this character though the word religion strictly speaking seems to mean not so much the motive itself as a kind of fictitious personage by whom the motive is supposed to be created or an assemblage of acts supposed to be dictated by that personage nor does it seem to be completely settled into a neutral sense in the same sense it is also in some cases styled religious zeal in other cases the fear of god the love of god though commonly contrasted with the fear of god does not come strictly under this head it coincides properly with a motive of a different denomination viz a kind of sympathy or goodwill which has the deity for its object in a good sense it is styled devotion piety and pious zeal in a bad sense it is styled in some cases superstition or superstitious zeal in other cases fanaticism or fanatic zeal in a sense not decidedly bad because not appropriated to this motive enthusiasm or enthusiastic zeal   in order to obtain the favour of the supreme being a man assassinates his lawful sovereign in this case the motive is now almost universally looked upon as abominable and is termed fanaticism formerly it was by great numbers accounted laudable and was by them called pious zeal   in the same view a man lashes himself with thongs in this case in yonder house the motive is accounted laudable and is called pious zeal in the next house it is deemed contemptible and called superstition   in the same view a man eats a piece of bread or at least what to external appearance is a piece of bread with certain ceremonies in this case in yonder house his motive is looked upon as laudable and is styled piety and devotion in the next house it is deemed abominable and styled superstition as before perhaps even it is absurdly styled impiety   in the same view a man holds a cow by the tail while he is dying on the thames the motive would in this case be deemed contemptible and called superstition on the ganges it is deemed meritorious and called piety   in the same view a man bestows a large sum in works of charity or public utility in this case the motive is styled laudable by those at least to whom the works in question appear to come under this description and by these at least it would be styled piety yet in all these cases the motive is precisely the same it is neither more nor less than the motive belonging to the religious sanction xxv to the pleasures of sympathy corresponds    the motive which in a neutral sense is termed goodwill the word sympathy may also be used on this occasion though the sense of it seems to be rather more extensive in a good sense it is styled benevolence and in certain cases philanthropy and in a figurative way brotherly love in others humanity in others charity in others pity and compassion in others mercy in others gratitude in others tenderness in others patriotism in others public spirit love is also employed in this as in so many other senses in a bad sense it has no name applicable to it in all cases in particular cases it is styled partiality the word zeal with certain epithets prefixed to it might also be employed sometimes on this occasion though the sense of it be more extensive applying sometimes to ill as well as to good will it is thus we speak of party zeal national zeal and public zeal the word attachment is also used with the like epithets we also say familyattachment the french expression esprit de corps for which as yet there seems to be scarcely any name in english might be rendered in some cases though rather inadequately by the terms corporationspirit corporationattachment or corporationzeal   a man who has set a town on fire is apprehended and committed out of regard or compassion for him you help him to break prison in this case the generality of people will probably scarcely know whether to condemn your motive or to applaud it those who condemn your conduct will be disposed rather to impute it to some other motive if they style it benevolence or compassion they will be for prefixing an epithet and calling it false benevolence or false compassion   the man is taken again and is put upon his trial to save him you swear falsely in his favour people who would not call your motive a bad one before will perhaps call it so now   a man is at law with you about an estate he has no right to it the judge knows this yet having an esteem or affection for your adversary adjudges it to him in this case the motive is by every body deemed abominable and is termed injustice and partiality   you detect a statesman in receiving bribes out of regard to the public interest you give information of it and prosecute him in this case by all who acknowledge your conduct to have originated from this motive your motive will be deemed a laudable one and styled public spirit but his friends and adherents will not choose to account for your conduct in any such manner they will rather attribute it to party enmity   you find a man on the point of starving you relieve him and save his life in this case your motive will by every body be accounted laudable and it will be termed compassion pity charity benevolence yet in all these cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the motive of goodwill xxvi to the pleasures of malevolence or antipathy corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense is termed antipathy or displeasure and in particular cases dislike aversion abhorrence and indignation in a neutral sense or perhaps a sense leaning a little to the bad side illwill and in particular cases anger wrath and enmity in a bad sense it is styled in different cases wrath spleen illhumour animosity hatred malice rancour rage fury cruelty tyranny envy jealousy revenge misanthropy and by other names which it is hardly worth while to endeavour to collect† like goodwill it is used with epithets expressive of the persons who are the objects of the affection hence we hear of party enmity party rage and so forth in a good sense there seems to be no single name for it in compound expressions it may be spoken of in such a sense by epithets such as just and laudable prefixed to words that are used in a neutral or nearly neutral sense   you rob a man he prosecutes you and gets you punished out of resentment you set upon him and hang him with your own hands in this case your motive will universally be deemed detestable and will be called malice cruelty revenge and so forth   a man has stolen a little money from you out of resentment you prosecute him and get him hanged by course of law in this case people will probably be a little divided    in their opinions about your motive your friends will deem it a laudable one and call it a just or laudable resentment your enemies will perhaps be disposed to deem it blameable and call it cruelty malice revenge and so forth to obviate which your friends will try perhaps to change the motive and call it public spirit   a man has murdered your father out of resentment you prosecute him and get him put to death in course of law in this case your motive will be universally deemed a laudable one and styled as before a just or laudable resentment and your friends in order to bring forward the more amiable principle from which the malevolent one which was your immediate motive took it srise will be for keeping the latter out of sight speaking of the former only under some such name as filial piety yet in all these cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the motive of illwill xxvii to the several sorts of pains or at least to all such of them as are conceived to subsist in an intense degree and to death which as far as we can perceive is the termination of all the pleasures as well as all the pains we are acquainted with corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense is styled in general selfpreservation the desire of preserving ones self from the pain or evil in question now in many instances the desire of pleasure and the sense of pain run into one another undistinguishably selfpreservation therefore where the degree of the pain which it corresponds to is but slight will scarcely be distinguishable by any precise line from the motives corresponding to the several sorts of pleasures thus in the case of the pains of hunger and thirst physical want will in many cases be scarcely distinguishable from physical desire in some cases it is styled still in a neutral sense selfdefence between the pleasures and the pains of the moral and religious sanctions and consequently of the motives that correspond to them as likewise between the pleasures of amity and the pains of enmity this want of boundaries has already been taken notice of the case is the same between the pleasures of wealth and the pains of privation corresponding to those pleasures there are many cases therefore in which it will be difficult to distinguish the motive of selfpreservation from pecuniary interest from the desire of ingratiating ones self from the love of reputation and from religious hope in which cases those more specific and explicit names will naturally be preferred to this general and inexplicit one there are also a multitude of compound names which either are already in use or might be devised to distinguish the specific branches of the motive of selfpreservation from those several motives of a pleasurable origin such as the fear of poverty the fear of losing such or such a mans regard the fear of shame and the fear of god moreover to the evil of death corresponds in a neutral sense the love of life in a bad sense cowardice which corresponds also to the pains of the senses at least when considered as subsisting in an acute degree there seems to be no name for the love of life that has a good sense unless it be the vague and general name of prudence   to save yourself from being hanged pilloried imprisoned or fined you poison the only person who can give evidence against you in this case your motive will universally be styled abominable but as the term selfpreservation has no bad sense people will not care to make this use of it they will be apt rather to change the motive and call it malice   a woman having been just delivered of an illegitimate child in order to save herself from shame destroys the child or abandons it in this case also people will call the motive a bad one and not caring to speak of it under a neutral name they will be apt to change the motive and to call it by some such name as cruelty   to save the expense of a halfpenny you suffer a man whom you could preserve at that expense to perish with want before your eyes in this case your motive will be universally deemed an abominable one and to avoid calling it by so indulgent a name as selfpreservation people will be apt to call it avarice and niggardliness with which indeed in this case it indistinguishably coincides for the sake of finding a more reproachful appellation they will be apt likewise to change the motive and term it cruelty   to put an end to the pain of hunger you steal a loaf of bread in this case your motive will scarcely perhaps be deemed a very bad one and in to order express more indulgence for it people will be apt to find a stronger name for it than selfpreservation terming it necessity   to save yourself from drowning you beat off an innocent man who has got hold of the same plank in this case your motive will in general be deemed neither good nor bad and it will be termed selfpreservation or necessity or the love of life   to save your life from a gang of robbers you kill them in the conflict in this case the motive may perhaps be deemed rather laudable than otherwise and besides selfpreservation is styled also selfdefence   a soldier is sent out upon a party against a weaker party of the enemy before he gets up with them to save his life he runs away in this case the motive    will universally be deemed a contemptible one and will be called cowardice yet in all these various cases the motive is still the same it is neither more nor less than selfpreservation xxviii in particular to the pains of exertion corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense may be termed the love of ease or by a longer circumlocution the desire of avoiding trouble in a bad sense it is termed indolence it seems to have no name that carries with it a good sense   to save the trouble of taking care of it a parent leaves his child to perish in this case the motive will be deemed an abominable one and because indolence will seem too mild a name for it the motive will perhaps be changed and spoken of under some such term as cruelty   to save yourself from an illegal slavery you make your escape in this case the motive will be deemed certainly not a bad one and because indolence or even the love of ease will be thought too unfavourable a name for it it will perhaps be styled the love of liberty   a mechanic in order to save his labour makes an improvement in his machinery in this case people will look upon his motive as a good one and finding no name for it that carries a good sense they will be disposed to keep the motive out of sight they will speak rather of his ingenuity than of the motive which was the means of his manifesting that quality yet in all these cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the love of ease xxix it appears then that there is no such thing as any sort of motive which is a bad one in itself nor consequently any such thing as a sort of motive which in itself is exclusively a good one and as to their effects it appears too that these are sometimes bad at other times either indifferent or good and this appears to be the case with every sort of motive if any sort of motive then is either good or bad on the score of its effects this is the case only on individual occasions and with individual motives and this is the case with one sort of motive as well as with another if any sort of motive then can in consideration of its effects be termed with any propriety a bad one it can only be with reference to the balance of all the effects it may have had of both kinds within a given period that is of its most usual tendency xxx what then it will be said are not lust cruelty avarice bad motives is there so much as any one individual occasion in which motives like these can be otherwise than bad no certainly and yet the proposition that there is no one sort of motive but what will on many occasions be a good one is nevertheless true the fact is that these are names which if properly applied are never applied but in the cases where the motives they signify happen to be bad the names of these motives considered apart from their effects are sexual desire displeasure and pecuniary interest to sexual desire when the effects of it are looked upon as bad is given the name of lust now lust is always a bad motive why because if the case be such that the effects of the motive are not bad it does not go or at least ought not to go by the name of lust the case is then that when i say lust is a bad motive it is a proposition that merely concerns the import of the word lust and which would be false if transferred to the other word used for the same motive sexual desire hence we see the emptiness of all those rhapsodies of commonplace morality which consist in the taking of such names as lust cruelty and avarice and branding them with marks of reprobation applied to the thing they are false applied to the name they are true indeed but nugatory would you do a real service to mankind show them the cases in which sexual desire merits the name of lust displeasure that of cruelty and pecuniary interest that of avarice xxxi if it were necessary to apply such denominations as good bad and indifferent to motives they might be classed in the following manner in consideration of the most frequent complexion of their effects in the class of good motives might be placed the articles of   goodwill   love of reputation   desire of amity and   religion in the class of bad motives   displeasure in the class of neutral or indifferent motives   physical desire   pecuniary interest   love of power   selfpreservation as including the fear of the pains of the senses the love of ease and the love of life xxxii this method of arrangement however cannot but be imperfect and the nomenclature belonging to it is in danger of being fallacious for by what method of investigation can a man be assured that with regard to the motives ranked under the name of good the good effects they have had from the beginning of the world have in each of the four species comprised under this name been superior to the bad still more difficulty would a man find in assuring himself that with regard to those which are ranked under the name of neutral or indifferent the effects    they have had have exactly balanced each other the value of the good being neither greater nor less than that of the bad it is to be considered that the interests of the person himself can no more be left out of the estimate than those of the rest of the community for what would become of the species if it were not for the motives of hunger and thirst sexual desire the fear of pain and the love of life nor in the actual constitution of human nature is the motive of displeasure less necessary perhaps than any of the others although a system in which the business of life might be carried on without it might possibly be conceived it seems therefore that they could scarcely without great danger of mistakes be distinguished in this manner even with reference to each other xxxiii the only way it should seem in which a motive can with safety and propriety be styled good or bad is with reference to its effects in each individual instance and principally from the intention it gives birth to from which arise as will be shown hereafter the most material part of its effects a motive is good when the intention it gives birth to is a good one bad when the intention is a bad one and an intention is good or bad according to the material consequences that are the objects of it so far is it from the goodness of the intentions being to be known only from the species of the motive but from one and the same motive as we have seen may result intentions of every sort of complexion whatsoever this circumstance therefore can afford no clue for the arrangement of the several sorts of motives xxxiv a more commodious method therefore it should seem would be to distribute them according to the influence which they appear to have on the interests of the other members of the community laying those of the party himself out of the question to wit according to the tendency which they appear to have to unite or disunite his interests and theirs on this plan they may be distinguished into social dissocial and selfregarding in the social class may be reckoned   goodwill   love of reputation   desire of amity   religion in the dissocial may be placed   displeasure in the selfregarding class   physical desire   pecuniary interest   love of power   selfpreservation as including the fear of the pains of the senses the love of ease and the love of life xxxv with respect to the motives that have been termed social if any farther distinction should be of use to that of goodwill alone may be applied the epithet of purelysocial while the love of reputation the desire of amity and the motive of religion may together be comprised under the division of semisocial the social tendency being much more constant and unequivocal in the former than in any of the three latter indeed these last social as they may be termed are selfregarding at the same time §   order of preeminence among motives xxxvi of all these sorts of motives goodwill is that of which the dictates† taken in a general view are surest of coinciding with those of the principle of utility for the dictates of utility are neither more nor less than the dictates of the most extensive‡ and enlightened that is welladvised∥ benevolence the dictates of the other motives may be conformable to those of utility or repugnant as it may happen xxxvii in this however it is taken for granted that in the case in question the dictates of benevolence are not contradicted by those of a more extensive that is enlarged benevolence now when the dictates of benevolence as respecting the interests of a certain set of persons are repugnant to the dictates of the same motive as respecting the more important§ interests of another set of persons the former dictates it is evident are repealed as it were by the latter and a man were he to be governed by the former could scarcely with propriety be said to be governed by the dictates of benevolence on this account were the motives on both sides sure to be alike present to a mans mind the case of such a repugnancy would hardly be worth distinguishing since the partial benevolence might be considered as swallowed up in the more extensive if the former prevailed and governed the action it must be considered as not owing its birth to benevolence but to some other motive if the latter prevailed the former might be considered as having no effect but the case is that a partial benevolence may govern the action without entering into any direct competition with the more extensive benevolence which would forbid it because the interests of the less numerous assemblage of persons    may be present to a mans mind at a time when those of the more numerous are either not present or if present make no impression it is in this way that the dictates of this motive may be repugnant to utility yet still be the dictates of benevolence what makes those of private benevolence conformable upon the whole to the principle of utility is that in general they stand unopposed by those of public if they are repugnant to them it is only by accident what makes them the more conformable is that in a civilized society in most of the cases in which they would of themselves be apt to run counter to those of public benevolence they find themselves opposed by stronger motives of the selfregarding class which are played off against them by the laws and that it is only in cases where they stand unopposed by the other more salutary dictates that they are left free an act of injustice or cruelty committed by a man for the sake of his father or his son is punished and with reason as much as if it were committed for his own xxxviii after goodwill the motive of which the dictates seem to have the next best chance for coinciding with those of utility is that of the love of reputation there is but one circumstance which prevents the dictates of this motive from coinciding in all cases with those of the former this is that men in their likings and dislikings in the dispositions they manifest to annex to any mode of conduct their approbation or their disapprobation and in consequence to the person who appears to practise it their good or their ill will do not govern themselves exclusively by the principle of utility sometimes it is the principle of asceticism they are guided by sometimes the principle of sympathy and antipathy there is another circumstance which diminishes not their conformity to the principle of utility but only their efficacy in comparison with the dictates of the motive of benevolence the dictates of this motive will operate as strongly in secret as in public whether it appears likely that the conduct which they recommend will be known or not those of the love of reputation will coincide with those of benevolence only in proportion as a mans conduct seems likely to be known this circumstance however does not make so much difference as at first sight might appear acts in proportion as they are material are apt to become known and in point of reputation the slightest suspicion often serves for proof besides if an act be a disreputable one it is not any assurance a man can have of the secrecy of the particular act in question that will of course surmount the objections he may have against engaging in it though the act in question should remain secret it will go towards forming a habit which may give birth to other acts that may not meet with the same good fortune there is no human being perhaps who is at years of discretion on whom considerations of this sort have not some weight and they have the more weight upon a man in proportion to the strength of his intellectual powers and the firmness of his mind† add to this the influence which habit itself when once formed has in restraining a man from acts towards which from the view of the disrepute annexed to them as well as from any other cause he has contracted an aversion the influence of habit in such cases is a matter of fact which though not readily accounted for is acknowledged and indubitable‡ xxxix after the dictates of the love of reputation come as it should seem those of the desire of amity the former are disposed to coincide with those of utility inasmuch as they are disposed to coincide with those of benevolence now those of the desire of amity are apt also to coincide in a certain sort with those of benevolence but the sort of benevolence with the dictates of which the love of reputation coincides is the more extensive that with which those of the desire of amity coincide the less extensive those of the love of amity have still however the advantage of those of the selfregarding motives the former at one period or other of his life dispose a man to contribute to the happiness of a considerable number of persons the latter from the beginning of life to the end of it confine themselves to the care of that single individual the dictates of the desire of amity it is plain will approach nearer to a coincidence with those of the love of reputation and thence with those of utility in proportion cæteris paribus to the number of the persons whose amity a man has occasion to desire and hence it is for example that an english member of parliament with all his own weaknesses and all the follies of the people whose amity he has to cultivate is probably in general a better character than the secretary of a vizier at constantinople or of a naib in indostan    xl the dictates of religion are under the infinite diversity of religions so extremely variable that it is difficult to know what general account to give of them or in what rank to place the motive they belong to upon the mention of religion peoples first thoughts turn naturally to the religion they themselves profess this is a great source of miscalculation and has a tendency to place this sort of motive in a higher rank than it deserves the dictates of religion would coincide in all cases with those of utility were the being who is the object of religion universally supposed to be as benevolent as he is supposed to be wise and powerful and were the notions entertained of his benevolence at the same time as correct as those which are entertained of his wisdom and his power unhappily however neither of these is the case he is universally supposed to be allpowerful for by the deity what else does any man mean than the being whatever he be by whom every thing is done and as to knowledge by the same rule that he should know one thing he should know another these notions seem to be as correct for all material purposes as they are universal but among the votaries of religion of which number the multifarious fraternity of christians is but a small part there seem to be but few i will not say how few who are real believers in his benevolence they call him benevolent in words but they do not mean that he is so in reality they do not mean that he is benevolent as man is conceived to be benevolent they do not mean that he is benevolent in the only sense in which benevolence has a meaning for if they did they would recognise that the dictates of religion could be neither more nor less than the dictates of utility not a tittle different not a tittle less or more but the case is that on a thousand occasions they turn their backs on the principle of utility they go astray after the strange principles its antagonists sometimes it is the principle of asceticism sometimes the principle of sympathy and antipathy accordingly the idea they bear in their minds on such occasions is but too often the idea of malevolence to which idea stripping it of its own proper name they bestow the specious appellation of the social motive† the dictates of religion in short are no other than the dictates of that principle which has been already mentioned under the name of the theological principle‡ these as has been observed are just as it may happen according to the biases of the person in question copies of the dictates of one or other of the three original principles sometimes indeed of the dictates of utility but frequently of those of asceticism or those of sympathy and antipathy in this respect they are only on a par with the dictates of the love of reputation in another they are below it the dictates of religion are in all places intermixed more or less with dictates unconformable to those of utility deduced from texts well or ill interpreted of the writings held for sacred by each sect unconformable by imposing practices sometimes inconvenient to a mans self sometimes pernicious to the rest of the community the sufferings of uncalled martyrs the calamities of holy wars and religious persecutions the mischiefs of intolerant laws objects which can here only be glanced at not detailed are so many additional mischiefs over and above the number of those which were ever brought into the world by the love of reputation on the other hand it is manifest that with respect to the power of operating in secret the dictates of religion have the same advantage over those of the love of reputation and the desire of amity as is possessed by the dictates of benevolence xli happily the dictates of religion seem to approach nearer and nearer to a coincidence with those of utility every day but why because the dictates of the moral sanction do so and those coincide with or are influenced by these men of the worst religions influenced by the voice and practice of the surrounding world borrow continually a new and a new leaf out of the book of utility and with these in order not to break with their religion they endeavour sometimes with violence enough to patch together and adorn the repositories of their faith xlii as to the selfregarding and dissocial motives the order that takes place among these and the preceding one in point of extraregarding influence is too evident to need insisting on as to the order that takes place among the motives of the selfregarding class    considered in comparison with one another there seems to be no difference which on this occasion would be worth mentioning with respect to the dissocial motive it makes a difference with regard to its extraregarding effects from which of two sources it originates whether from selfregarding or from social considerations the displeasure you conceive against a man may be founded either on some act which offends you in the first instance or on an act which offends you no otherwise than because you look upon it as being prejudicial to some other party on whose behalf you interest yourself which other party may be of course either a determinate individual or any assemblage of individuals determinate or indeterminate it is obvious enough that a motive though in itself dissocial may by issuing from a social origin possess a social tendency and that its tendency in this case is likely to be the more social the more enlarged the description is of the persons whose interests you espouse displeasure venting itself against a man on account of a mischief supposed to be done by him to the public may be more social in its effects than any goodwill the exertions of which are confined to an individual† §   conflict among motives xliii when a man has it in contemplation to engage in any action he is frequently acted upon at the same time by the force of divers motives one motive or set of motives acting in one direction another motive or set of motives acting as it were in an opposite direction the motives on one side disposing him to engage in the action those on the other disposing him not to engage in it now any motive the influence of which tends to dispose him to engage in the action in question may be termed an impelling motive any motive the influence of which tends to dispose him not to engage in it a restraining motive but these appellations may of course be interchanged according as the act is of the positive kind or the negative‡ xliv it has been shown that there is no sort of motive but may give birth to any sort of action it follows therefore that there are no two motives but may come to be opposed to one another where the tendency of the act is bad the most common case is for it to have been dictated by a motive either of the selfregarding or of the dissocial class in such case the motive of benevolence has commonly been acting though ineffectually in the character of a restraining motive xlv an example may be of use to show the variety of contending motives by which a man may be acted upon at the same time crillon a catholic at a time when it was generally thought meritorious among catholics to extirpate protestants was ordered by his king charles ix of france to fall privately upon coligny a protestant and assassinate him his answer was excuse me sire but ill fight him with all my heart∥ here then were all the three forces above mentioned including that of the political sanction acting upon him at once by the political sanction or at least so much of the force of it as such a mandate from such a sovereign issued on such an occasion might be supposed to carry with it he was enjoined to put coligny to death in the way of assassination by the religious sanction that is by the dictates of religious zeal he was enjoined to put him to death in any way by the moral sanction or in other words by the dictates of honour that is of the love of reputation he was permitted which permission when coupled with the mandates of his sovereign operated he conceived as an injunction to fight the adversary upon equal terms by the dictates of enlarged benevolence supposing the mandate to be unjustifiable he was enjoined not to attempt his life in any way but to remain at peace with him supposing the mandate to be unjustifiable by the dictates of private benevolence he was enjoined not to meddle with him at any rate among this confusion of repugnant dictates crillon it seems gave the preference in the first place to those of honour in the next place to those of benevolence he would have fought had his offer been accepted as it was not he remained at peace here a multitude of questions might arise supposing the dictates of the political sanction to follow the mandate of the sovereign of what kind were the motives which they afforded him for compliance the answer is of the selfregarding kind at any rate inasmuch as by the supposition it was in the power of the sovereign to punish him for noncompliance or reward him for compliance did they afford him the motive of religion i mean independently of the circumstance of heresy above mentioned the answer is yes if his notion was that it was gods pleasure he should comply with them no if it was not did they afford him the motive of the love of reputation yes if it was his notion that the world would expect and require that he should comply with them no if it was not did they afford him that of benevolence yes if it was his notion  0 that the community would upon the whole be the better for his complying with them no if it was not but did the dictates of the political sanction in the case in question actually follow the mandates of the sovereign in other words was such a mandate legal this we see is a mere question of local jurisprudence altogether foreign to the present purpose xlvi what is here said about the goodness and badness of motives is far from being a mere matter of words there will be occasion to make use of it hereafter for various important purposes i shall have need of it for the sake of dissipating various prejudices which are of disservice to the community sometimes by cherishing the flame of civil dissensions at other times by obstructing the course of justice it will be shown that in the case of many offences† the consideration of the motive is a most material one for that in the first place it makes a very material difference in the magnitude of the mischief‡ in the next place that it is easy to be ascertained and thence may be made a ground for a difference in the demand for punishment but that in other cases it is altogether incapable of being ascertained and that were it capable of being ever so well ascertained good or bad it could make no difference in the demand for punishment that in all cases the motive that may happen to govern a prosecutor is a consideration totally immaterial whence may be seen the mischievousness of the prejudice that is so apt to be entertained against informers and the consequence it is of that the judge in particular should be proof against the influence of such delusions lastly the subject of motives is one with which it is necessary to be acquainted in order to pass a judgment on any means that may be proposed for combating offences in their source∥ but before the theoretical foundation for these practical observations can be completely laid it is necessary we should say something on the subject of disposition which accordingly will furnish matter for the ensuing chapter chapter xi of human dispositions in general i in the foregoing chapter it has been shown at large that goodness or badness cannot with any propriety be predicated of motives is there nothing then about a man that can properly be termed good or bad when on such or such an occasion he suffers himself to be governed by such or such a motive yes certainly his disposition now disposition is a kind of fictitious entity feigned for the convenience of discourse in order to express what there is supposed to be permanent in a mans frame of mind where on such or such an occasion he has been influenced by such or such a motive to engage in an act which as it appeared to him was of such or such a tendency ii it is with disposition as with every thing else it will be good or bad according to its effects according to the effects it has in augmenting or diminishing the happiness of the community a mans disposition may accordingly be considered in two points of view according to the influence it has either   on his own happiness or   on the happiness of others viewed in both these lights together or in either of them indiscriminately it may be termed on the one hand good on the other bad or in flagrant cases depraved§ viewed in the former of these lights it has scarcely any peculiar name which has as yet been appropriated to it it might be termed though but inexpressively frail or infirm on the one hand sound or firm on the other viewed in the other light it might be termed beneficent or meritorious on the one hand pernicious or mischievous on the other now of that branch of a mans disposition the effects of which regard in the first instance only himself there needs not much to be said here to reform it when bad is the business rather of the moralist than the legislator nor is it susceptible of those various modifications which make so material a difference in the effects of the other again with respect to that part of it the effects whereof regard others in the first instance it is only in as far as it is of a mischievous nature that the penal branch of law has any immediate concern with it in as far    as it may be of a beneficent nature it belongs to a hitherto but little cultivated and as yet unnamed branch of law which might be styled the remuneratory iii a man then is said to be of a mischievous disposition when by the influence of no matter what motives he is presumed to be more apt to engage or form intentions of engaging in acts which are apparently of a pernicious tendency than in such as are apparently of a beneficial tendency of a meritorious or beneficent disposition in the opposite case iv i say presumed for by the supposition all that appears is one single action attended with one single train of circumstances but from that degree of consistency and uniformity which experience has shown to be observable in the different actions of the same person the probable existence past or future of a number of acts of a similar nature is naturally and justly inferred from the observation of one single one under such circumstances such as the motive proves to be in one instance such is the disposition to be presumed to be in others v i say apparently mischievous that is apparently with regard to him such as to him appear to possess that tendency for from the mere event independent of what to him it appears beforehand likely to be nothing can be inferred on either side if to him it appears likely to be mischievous in such case though in the upshot it should prove innocent or even beneficial it makes no difference there is not the less reason for presuming his disposition to be a bad one if to him to appears likely to be beneficial or innocent in such case though in the upshot it should prove pernicious there is not the more reason on that account for presuming his disposition to be a good one and here we see the importance of the circumstances of intentionality consciousness† unconsciousness† and missupposal† vi the truth of these positions depends upon two others both of them sufficiently verified by experience the one is that in the ordinary course of things the consequences of actions commonly turn out conformable to intentions a man who sets up a butchers shop and deals in beef when he intends to knock down an ox commonly does knock down an ox though by some unlucky accident he may chance to miss his blow and knock down a man he who sets up a grocers shop and deals in sugar when he intends to sell sugar commonly does sell sugar though by some unlucky accident he may chance to sell arsenic in the room of it vii the other is that a man who entertains intentions of doing mischief at one time is apt to entertain the like intentions at another‡ viii there are two circumstances upon which the nature of the disposition as indicated by any act is liable to depend   the apparent tendency of the act   the nature of the motive which gave birth to it this dependency is subject to different rules according to the nature of the motive in stating them i suppose all along the apparent tendency of the act to be as it commonly is the same as the real ix   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive is of the selfregarding kind in this case the motive affords no inference on either side it affords no indication of a good disposition but neither does it afford any indication of a bad one a baker sells his bread to a hungry man who asks for it this we see is one of those acts of which in ordinary cases the tendency is unquestionably good the bakers motive is the ordinary commercial motive of pecuniary interest it is plain that there is nothing in the transaction thus stated that can afford the least ground for presuming that the baker is a better or a worse man than any of his neighbours x   where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive as before is of the selfregarding kind in this case the disposition indicated is a mischievous one a man steals bread out of a bakers shop this is one of those acts of which the tendency will readily be acknowledged to be bad why and in what respects it is so will be stated farther on∥ his motive we will say is that of pecuniary interest the desire of getting the value of the bread for nothing his disposition accordingly appears to be a bad one for every one will allow a thievish disposition to be a bad one    xi   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive is the purely social one of goodwill in this case the disposition indicated is a beneficent one a baker gives a poor man a loaf of bread his motive is compassion a name given to the motive of benevolence in particular cases of its operation the disposition indicated by the baker in this case is such as every man will be ready enough to acknowledge to be a good one xii   where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive is the purely social one of goodwill even in this case the disposition which the motive indicates is dubious it may be a mischievous or a meritorious one as it happens according as the mischievousness of the act is more or less apparent xiii it may be thought that a case of this sort cannot exist and that to suppose it is a contradiction in terms for the act is one which by the supposition the agent knows to be a mischievous one how then can it be that goodwill that is the desire of doing good could have been the motive that led him into it to reconcile this we must advert to the distinction between enlarged benevolence and confined the motive that led him into it was that of confined benevolence had he followed the dictates of enlarged benevolence he would not have done what he did now although he followed the dictates of that branch of benevolence which in any single instance of its exertion is mischievous when opposed to the other yet as the cases which call for the exertion of the former are beyond comparison more numerous than those which call for the exertion of the latter the disposition indicated by him in following the impulse of the former will often be such as in a man of the common run of men may be allowed to be a good one upon the whole xiv a man with a numerous family of children on the point of starving goes into a bakers shop steals a loaf divides it all among the children reserving none of it for himself it will be hard to infer that that mans disposition is a mischievous one upon the whole alter the case give him but one child and that hungry perhaps but in no imminent danger of starving and now let the man set fire to a house full of people for the sake of stealing money out of it to buy the bread with the disposition here indicated will hardly be looked upon as a good one xv another case will appear more difficult to decide than either ravaillac assassinated one of the best and wisest of sovereigns at a time when a good and wise sovereign a blessing at all times so valuable to a state was particularly precious and that to the inhabitants of a populous and extensive empire he is taken and doomed to the most excruciating tortures his son well persuaded of his being a sincere penitent and that mankind in case of his being at large would have nothing more to fear from him effectuates his escape is this then a sign of a good disposition in the son or of a bad one perhaps some will answer of a bad one for besides the interest which the nation has in the sufferings of such a criminal on the score of the example the future good behaviour of such a criminal is more than any one can have sufficient ground to be persuaded of xvi well then let ravaillac the son not facilitate his fathers escape but content himself with conveying poison to him that at the price of an easier death he may escape his torments the decision will now perhaps be more difficult the act is a wrong one let it be allowed and such as ought by all means to be punished but is the disposition manifested by it a bad one because the young man breaks the laws in this one instance is it probable that if let alone he would break the laws in ordinary instances for the satisfaction of any inordidate desires of his own the answer of most men would probably be in the negative xvii   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive is a semisocial one the love of reputation in this case the disposition indicated is a good one in a time of scarcity a baker for the sake of gaining the esteem of the neighbourhood distributes bread gratis among the industrious poor let this be taken for granted and let it be allowed to be a matter of uncertainty whether he had any real feeling for the sufferings of those whom he has relieved or no his disposition for all that cannot with any pretence of reason be termed otherwise than a good and beneficent one it can only be in consequence of some very idle prejudice if it receives a different name†    xviii   where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive as before is a semisocial one the love of reputation in this case the disposition which it indicates is more or less good or bad in the first place according as the tendency of the act is more or less mischievous in the next place according as the dictates of the moral sanction in the society in question approach more or less to a coincidence with those of utility it does not seem probable that in any nation which is in a state of tolerable civilization in short in any nation in which such rules as these can come to be consulted the dictates of the moral sanction will so far recede from a coincidence with those of utility that is of enlightened benevolence that the disposition indicated in this case can be otherwise than a good one upon the whole xix an indian receives an injury real or imaginary from an indian of another tribe he revenges it upon the person of his antagonist with the most excruciating torments the case being that cruelties inflicted on such an occasion gain him reputation in his own tribe the disposition manifested in such a case can never be deemed a good one among a people ever so few degrees advanced in point of civilization above the indians xx a nobleman to come back to europe contracts a debt with a poor tradesman the same nobleman presently afterwards contracts a debt to the same amount to another nobleman at play he is unable to pay both he pays the whole debt to the companion of his amusements and no part of it to the tradesman the disposition manifested in this case can scarcely be termed otherwise than a bad one it is certainly however not so bad as if he had paid neither the principle of love of reputation or as it is called in the case of this partial application of it honour is here opposed to the worthier principle of benevolence and gets the better of it but it gets the better also of the selfregarding principle of pecuniary interest the disposition therefore which it indicates although not so good a one as that in which the principle of benevolence predominates is better than one in which the principle of selfinterest predominates he would be the better for having more benevolence but would he be the better for having no honour this seems to admit of great dispute xxi   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive is the semisocial one of religion in this case the disposition indicated by it considered with respect to the influence of it on the mans conduct towards others is manifestly a beneficent and meritorious one a baker distributes bread gratis among the industrious poor it is not that he feels for their distresses nor is it for the sake of gaining reputation among his neighbours it is for the sake of gaining the favour of the deity to whom he takes for granted such conduct will be acceptable the disposition manifested by such conduct is plainly what every man would call a good one xxii   where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive is that of religion as before in this case the disposition is dubious it is good or bad and more or less good or bad in the first place as the tendency of the act is more or less mischievous in the next place according as the religious tenets of the person in question approach more or less to a coincidence with the dictates of utility xxiii it should seem from history that even in nations in a tolerable state of civilization in other respects the dictates of religion have been found so far to recede from a coincidence with those of utility in other words from those of enlightened benevolence that the disposition indicated in this case may even be a bad one upon the whole this however is no objection to the inference which it affords of a good disposition in those countries such as perhaps are most of the countries of europe at present in which its dictates respecting the conduct of a man towards other men approach very nearly to a coincidence with those of utility the dictates of religion in their application to the conduct of a man in what concerns himself alone seem in most european nations to savour a good    deal of the ascetic principle but the obedience to such mistaken dictates indicates not any such disposition as is likely to break out into acts of pernicious tendency with respect to others instances in which the dictates of religion lead a man into acts which are pernicious in this latter view seem at present to be but rare unless it be acts of persecution or impolitic measures on the part of government where the law itself is either the principal actor or an accomplice in the mischief ravaillac instigated by no other motive than this gave his country one of the most fatal stabs that a country ever received from a single hand but happily the ravaillacs are but rare they have been more frequent however in france than in any other country during the same period and it is remarkable that in every instance it is this motive that has produced them when they do appear however nobody i suppose but such as themselves will be for terming a disposition such as they manifest a good one it seems hardly to be denied but that they are just so much the worse for their notions of religion and that had they been left to the sole guidance of benevolence and the love of reputation without any religion at all it would have been but so much the better for mankind one may say nearly the same thing perhaps of those persons who without any particular obligation have taken an active part in the execution of laws made for the punishment of those who have the misfortune to differ with the magistrate in matters of religion much more of the legislator himself who has put it in their power if louis xiv had had no religion france would not have lost  00000 of its most valuable subjects the same thing may be said of the authors of the wars called holy ones whether waged against persons called infidels or persons branded with the still more odious name of heretics in denmark not a great many years ago a a sect is said to have arisen who by a strange perversion of reason took it into their heads that by leading to repentance murder or any other horrid crime might be made the road to heaven it should all along however be observed that instances of this latter kind were always rare and that in almost all the countries of europe instances of the former kind though once abundantly frequent have for some time ceased in certain countries however persecution at home or what produces a degree of restraint which is one part of the mischiefs of persecution i mean the disposition to persecute whensoever occasion happens is not yet at an end insomuch that if there is no actual persecution it is only because there are no heretics and if there are no heretics it is only because there are no thinkers xxiv   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive as before is the dissocial one of illwill in this case the motive seems not to afford any indication on either side it is no indication of a good disposition but neither is it any indication of a bad one you have detected a baker in selling short weight you prosecute him for the cheat it is not for the sake of gain that you engaged in the prosecution for there is nothing to be got by it it is not from public spirit it is not for the sake of reputation for there is no reputation to be got by it it is not in the view of pleasing the deity it is merely on account of a quarrel you have with the man you prosecute from the transaction as thus stated there does not seem to be any thing to be said either in favour of your disposition or against it the tendency of the act is good but you would not have engaged in it had it not been from a motive which there seems no particular reason to conclude will ever prompt you to engage in an act of the same kind again your motive is of that sort which may with least impropriety be termed a bad one but the act is of that sort which were it engaged in ever so often could never have any evil tendency nor indeed any other tendency than a good one by the supposition the motive it happened to be dictated by was that of illwill but the act itself is of such a nature as to have wanted nothing but sufficient discernment on your part in order to have been dictated by the most enlarged benevolence now from a mans having suffered himself to be induced to gratify his resentment by means of an act of which the tendency is good it by no means follows that he would be ready on another occasion through the influence of the same sort of motive to engage in any act of which the tendency is a bad one the motive that impelled you was a dissocial one but what social motive could there have been to restrain you none but what might have been outweighed by a more enlarged motive of the same kind now because the dissocial motive prevailed when it stood alone it by no means follows that it would prevail when it had a social one to combat it xxv  0 where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive is the dissocial one of malevolence in this case the disposition it indicates is of course a mischievous one the man who stole the bread from the baker as before did it with no other view than merely to impoverish and afflict him accordingly when he had got the bread he did not eat or sell it but destroyed it that the disposition evidenced by such a transaction is a bad one is what every body must perceive immediately    xxvi thus much with respect to the circumstances from which the mischievousness or meritoriousness of a mans disposition is to be inferred in the gross we come now to the measure of that mischievousness or meritoriousness as resulting from those circumstances now with meritorious acts and dispositions we have no direct concern in the present work all that penal law is concerned to do is to measure the depravity of the disposition where the act is mischievous to this object therefore we shall here confine ourselves xxvii it is evident that the nature of a mans disposition must depend upon the nature of the motives he is apt to be influenced by in other words upon the degree of his sensibility to the force of such and such motives for his disposition is as it were the sum of his intentions the disposition he is of during a certain period the sum or result of his intentions during that period if of the acts he has been intending to engage in during the supposed period those which are apparently of a mischievous tendency bear a large proportion to those which appear to him to be of the contrary tendency his disposition will be of the mischievous cast if but a small proportion of the innocent or upright xxviii now intentions like every thing else are produced by the things that are their causes and the causes of intentions are motives if on any occasion a man forms either a good or a bad intention it must be by the influence of some motive xxix when the act which a motive prompts a man to engage in is of a mischievous nature it may for distinctions sake be termed a seducing or corrupting motive in which case also any motive which in opposition to the former acts in the character of a restraining motive may be styled a tutelary conservatory preservatory or preserving motive xxx tutelary motives may again be distinguished into standing or constant and occasional by standing tutelary motives i mean such as act with more or less force in all or at least in most cases tending to restrain a man from any mischievous acts he may be prompted to engage in and that with a force which depends upon the general nature of the act rather than upon any accidental circumstance with which any individual act of that sort may happen to be accompanied by occasional tutelary motives i mean such motives as may chance to act in this direction or not according to the nature of the act and of the particular occasion on which the engaging in it is brought into contemplation xxxi now it has been shown that there is no sort of motive by which a man may not be prompted to engage in acts that are of a mischievous nature that is which may not come to act in the capacity of a seducing motive it has been shown on the other hand that there are some motives which are remarkably less likely to operate in this way than others it has also been shown that the least likely of all is that of benevolence or goodwill the most common tendency of which it has been shown is to act in the character of a tutelary motive it has also been shown that even when by accident it acts in one way in the character of a seducing motive still in another way it acts in the opposite character of a tutelary one the motive of goodwill in as far as it respects the interests of one set of persons may prompt a man to engage in acts which are productive of mischief to another and more extensive set but this is only because his goodwill is imperfect and confined not taking into contemplation the interests of all the persons whose interests are at stake the same motive were the affection it issued from more enlarged would operate effectually in the character of a constraining motive against that very act to which by the supposition it gives birth this same sort of motive may therefore without any real contradiction or deviation from truth be ranked in the number of standing tutelary motives notwithstanding the occasions in which it may act at the same time in the character of a seducing one xxxii the same observation nearly may be applied to the semisocial motive of love of reputation the force of this like that of the former is liable to be divided against itself as in the case of goodwill the interests of some of the persons who may be the objects of that sentiment are liable to be at variance with those of others so in the case of love of reputation the sentiments of some of the persons whose good opinion is desired may be at variance with the sentiments of other persons of that number now in the case of an act which is really of a mischievous nature it can scarcely happen that there shall be no persons whatever who will look upon it with an eye of disapprobation it can scarcely ever happen therefore that an act really mischievous shall not have some part at least if not the whole of the force of this motive to oppose it nor therefore that this motive should not act with some degree of force in the character of a tutelary motive    this therefore may be set down as another article in the catalogue of standing tutelary motives xxxiii the same observation may be applied to the desire of amity though not in altogether equal measure for notwithstanding the mischievousness of an act it may happen without much difficulty that all the persons for whose amity a man entertains any particular present desire which is accompanied with expectation may concur in regarding it with an eye rather of approbation than the contrary this is but too apt to be the case among such fraternities as those of thieves smugglers and many other denominations of offenders this however is not constantly nor indeed most commonly the case insomuch that the desire of amity may still be regarded upon the whole as a tutelary motive were it only from the closeness of its connexion with the love of reputation and it may be ranked among standing tutelary motives since where it does apply the force with which it acts depends not upon the occasional circumstances of the act which it opposes but upon principles as general as those upon which depend the action of the other semisocial motives xxxiv the motive of religion is not altogether in the same case with the three former the force of it is not like theirs liable to be divided against itself i mean in the civilized nations of modern times among whom the notion of the unity of the godhead is universal in times of classical antiquity it was otherwise if a man got venus on his side pallas was on the other if æolus was for him neptune was against him æneas with all his piety had but a partial interest at the court of heaven that matter stands upon a different footing nowadays in any given person the force of religion whatever it be is now all of it on one side it may balance indeed on which side it shall declare itself and it may declare itself as we have seen already in but too many instances on the wrong as well as on the right it has been at least till lately perhaps is still accustomed so much to declare itself on the wrong side and that in such material instances that on that account it seemed not proper to place it in point of social tendency on a level altogether with the motive of benevolence where it does act however as it does in by far the greatest number of cases in opposition to the ordinary seducing motives it acts like the motive of benevolence in an uniform manner not depending upon the particular circumstances that may attend the commission of the act but tending to oppose it merely on account of its mischievousness and therefore with equal force in whatsoever circumstances it may be proposed to be committed this therefore may also be added to the catalogue of standing tutelary motives xxxv as to the motives which may operate occasionally in the character of tutelary motives these it has been already intimated are of various sorts and various degrees of strength in various offences depending not only upon the nature of the offence but upon the accidental circumstances in which the idea of engaging in it may come in contemplation nor is there any sort of motive which may not come to operate in this chaacter as may be easily conceived a thief for instance may be prevented from engaging in a projected scheme of housebreaking by sitting too long over his bottle by a visit from his doxy by the occasion he may have to go elsewhere in order to receive his dividend of a former booty† and so on xxxvi there are some motives however which seem more apt to act in this character than others especially as things are now constituted now that the law has every where opposed to the force of the principal seducing motives artificial tutelary motives of its own creation of the motives here meant it will be necessary to take a general view they seem to be reducible to two heads viz   the love of ease a motive put into action by the prospect of the trouble of the attempt that is the trouble which it may be necessary to bestow in overcoming the physical difficulties that may accompany it   selfpreservation as opposed to the dangers to which a man may be exposed in the prosecution of it xxxvii these dangers may be either   of a purely physical nature or   dangers resulting from moral agency in other words from the conduct of any such persons to whom the act if known may be expected to prove obnoxious but moral agency supposes knowledge with respect to the circumstances that are to have the effect of external motives in giving birth to it now the obtaining such knowledge with respect to the commission of any obnoxious act on the part of any persons who may be disposed to make the agent suffer for it is called detection and the agent concerning whom such knowledge is obtained is said to be detected the dangers therefore which may threaten an offender from this quarter depend whatever they be on the event of his detection and may therefore be all of them comprised under the article of the danger of detection    xxxviii the danger depending upon detection may be divided again into two branches   that which may result from any opposition that may be made to the enterprise by persons on the spot that is at the very time the enterprise is carrying on   that which respects the legal punishment or other suffering that may await at a distance upon the issue of the enterprise xxxix it may be worth calling to mind on this occasion that among the tutelary motives which have been styled constant ones there are two of which the force depends though not so entirely as the force of the occasional ones which have been just mentioned yet in a great measure upon the circumstance of detection these it may be remembered are the love of reputation and the desire of amity in proportion therefore as the chance of being detected appears greater these motives will apply with the greater force with the less force as it appears less this is not the case with the two other standing tutelary motives that of benevolence and that of religion xl we are now in a condition to determine with some degree of precision what is to be understood by the strength of a temptation and what indication it may give of the degree of mischievousness in a mans disposition in the case of any offence when a man is prompted to engage in any mischievous act we will say for shortness in an offence the strength of the temptation depends upon the ratio between the force of the seducing motives on the one hand and such of the occasional tutelary ones as the circumstances of the case call forth into action on the other the temptation then may be said to be strong when the pleasure or advantage to be got from the crime is such as in the eyes of the offender must appear great in comparison of the trouble and danger that appear to him to accompany the enterprise slight or weak when that pleasure or advantage is such as must appear small in comparison of such trouble and such danger it is plain the strength of the temptation depends not upon the force of the impelling that is of the seducing motives altogether for let the opportunity be more favourable that is let the trouble or any branch of the danger be made less than before it will be acknowledged that the temptation is made so much the stronger and on the other hand let the opportunity become less favourable or in other words let the trouble or any branch of the danger be made greater than before the temptation will be so much the weaker now after taking account of such tutelary motives as have been styled occasional the only tutelary motives that can remain are those which have been termed standing ones but those which have been termed the standing tutelary motives are the same that we have been styling social it follows therefore that the strength of the temptation in any case after deducting the force of the social motives is as the sum of the forces of the seducing to the sum of the forces of the occasional tutelary motives xli it remains to be inquired what indication concerning the mischievousness or depravity of a mans disposition is afforded by the strength of the temptation in the case where any offence happens to have been committed it appears then that the weaker the temptation is by which a man has been overcome the more depraved and mischievous it shows his disposition to have been for the goodness of his disposition is measured by the degree of his sensibility to the action of the social motives in other words by the strength of the influence which those motives have over him now the less considerable the force is by which their influence on him has been overcome the more convincing is the proof that has been given of the weakness of that influence again the degree of a mans sensibility to the force of the social motives being given it is plain that the force with which those motives tend to restrain him from engaging in any mischievous enterprise will be as the apparent mischievousness of such enterprise that is as the degree of mischief with which it appears to him likely to be attended in other words the less mischievous the offence appears to him to be the less averse he will be as far as he is guided by social considerations to engage in it the more mischievous the more averse if then the nature of the offence is such as must appear to him highly mischievous and yet he engages in it notwithstanding it shows that the degree of his sensibility to the force of the social motives is but slight and consequently that his disposition is proportionably depraved moreover the less the strength of the temptation was the more pernicious and depraved does it show his disposition to have been for the less the strength of the temptation was the less was the force which the influence of those motives had to overcome the clearer therefore is the proof that has been given of the weakness of that influence xlii from what has been said it seems that for judging of the indication that is afforded concerning the depravity of a mans disposition by the strength of the temptation compared with the mischievousness of the enterprise the following rules may be laid down    rule   the strength of the temptation being given the mischievousness of the disposition manifested by the enterprise is as the apparent mischievousness of the act thus it would show a more depraved disposition to murder a man for a reward of a guinea or falsely to charge him with a robbery for the same reward than to obtain the same sum from him by simple theft the trouble he would have to take and the risk he would have to run being supposed to stand on the same footing in the one case as in the other rule   the apparent mischievousness of the act being given a mans disposition is the more depraved the slighter the temptation is by which he has been overcome thus it shows a more depraved and dangerous disposition if a man kill another out of mere sport as the emperor of morocco muley mahomet is said to have done great numbers than out of revenge as sylla and marius did thousands or in the view of selfpreservation as augustus killed many or even for lucre as the same emperor is said to have killed some and the effects of such a depravity on that part of the public which is apprized of it run in the same proportion from augustus some persons only had to fear under some particular circumstances from muley mahomet every man had to fear at all times rule   the apparent mischievousness of the act being given the evidence which it affords of the depravity of a mans disposition is the less conclusive the stronger the temptation is by which he has been overcome thus if a poor man who is ready to die with hunger steal a loaf of bread it is a less explicit sign of depravity than if a rich man were to commit a theft to the same amount it will be observed that in this rule all that is said is that the evidence of depravity is in this case the less conclusive it is not said that the depravity is positively the less for in this case it is possible for any thing that appears to the contrary that the theft might have been committed even had the temptation been not so strong in this case the alleviating circumstance is only a matter of presumption in the former the aggravating circumstance is a matter of certainty rule   where the motive is of the dissocial kind the apparent mischievousness of the act and the strength of the temptation being given the depravity is as the degree of deliberation with which it is accompanied for in every man be his disposition ever so depraved the social motives are those which wherever the selfregarding ones stand neuter regulate and determine the general tenor of his life if the dissocial motives are put in action it is only in particular circumstances and on particular occasions the gentle but constant force of the social motives being for a while subdued the general and standing bias of every mans nature is therefore towards that side to which the force of the social motives would determine him to adhere this being the case the force of the social motives tends continually to put an end to that of the dissocial ones as in natural bodies the force of friction tends to put an end to that which is generated by impulse time then which wears away the force of the dissocial motives adds to that of the social the longer therefore a man continues on a given occasion under the dominion of the dissocial motives the more convincing is the proof that has been given of his insensibility to the force of the social ones thus it shows a worse disposition where a man lays a deliberate plan for beating his antagonist and beats him accordingly than if he were to beat him upon the spot in consequence of a sudden quarrel and worse again if after having had him a long while together in his power he beats him at intervals and at his leisure xliii the depravity of disposition indicated by an act is a material consideration in several respects any mark of extraordinary depravity by adding to the terror already inspired by the crime and by holding up the offender as a person from whom there may be more mischief to be apprehended in future adds in that way to the demand for punishment by indicating a general want of sensibility on the part of the offender it may add in another way also to the demand for punishment the article of disposition is of the more importance inasmuch as in measuring out the quantum of punishment the principle of sympathy and antipathy is apt to look at nothing else a man who punishes because he hates and only because he hates such a man when he does not find any thing odious in the disposition is not for punishing at all and when he does he is not for carrying the punishment further than his hatred carries him hence the aversion we find so frequently expressed against the maxim that the punishment must rise with the strength of the temptation a maxim the contrary of which as we shall see would be as cruel to offenders themselves as it would be subversive of the purposes of punishment    chapter xii of the consequences of a mischievous act §   shapes in which the mischief of an act may show itself i hitherto we have been speaking of the various articles or objects on which the consequences or tendency of an act may depend of the bare act itself of the circumstances it may have been or may have been supposed to be accompanied with of the consciousness a man may have had with respect to any such circumstances of the intentions that may have preceded the act of the motives that may have given birth to those intentions and of the disposition that may have been indicated by the connexion between such intentions and such motives we now come to speak of consequences or tendency an article which forms the concluding link in all this chain of causes and effects involving in it the materiality of the whole now such part of this tendency as is of a mischievous nature is all that we have any direct concern with to that therefore we shall here confine ourselves ii the tendency of an act is mischievous when the consequences of it are mischievous that is to say either the certain consequences or the probable the consequences how many and whatsoever they may be of an act of which the tendency is mischievous may such of them as are mischievous be conceived to constitute one aggregate body which may be termed the mischief of the act iii this mischief may frequently be distinguished as it were into two shares or parcels the one containing what may be called the primary mischief the other what may be called the secondary that share may be termed the primary which is sustained by an assignable individual or a multitude of assignable individuals that share may be termed the secondary which taking its origin from the former extends itself either over the whole community or over some other multitude of unassignable individuals iv the primary mischief of an act may again be distinguished into two branches   the original and   the derivative by the original branch i mean that which alights upon and is confined to any person who is a sufferer in the first instance and on his own account the person for instance who is beaten robbed or murdered by the derivative branch i mean any share of mischief which may befal any other assignable persons in consequence of his being a sufferer and no otherwise these persons must of course be persons who in some way or other are connected with him now the ways in which one person may be connected with another have been already seen they may be connected in the way of interest meaning selfregarding interest or merely in the way of sympathy and again persons connected with a given person in the way of interest may be connected with him either by affording support to him or by deriving it from him v the secondary mischief again may frequently be seen to consist of two other shares or parcels the first consisting of pain the other of danger the pain which it produces is a pain of apprehension a pain grounded on the apprehension of suffering such mischiefs or inconveniences whatever they may be as it is the nature of the primary mischief to produce it may be styled in one word the alarm the danger is the chance whatever it may be which the multitude it concerns may in consequence of the primary mischief stand exposed to of suffering such mischiefs or inconveniences for danger is nothing but the chance of pain or what comes to the same thing of loss of pleasure vi an example may serve to make this clear a man attacks you on the road and robs you you suffer a pain on the occasion of losing so much money† you also suffered a pain at the thoughts of the personal illtreatment you apprehended he might give you in case of your not happening to satisfy his demands‡ these together constitute the original branch of the primary mischief resulting from the act of robbery a creditor of yours who expected you to pay him with part of that money and a son of yours who expected you to have given him another part are in consequence disappointed you are obliged to have recourse to the bounty of your father to make good part of the deficiency these mischiefs together make up the derivative branch the report of this robbery circulates from hand to hand and spreads itself in the neighbourhood it finds its way into the newspapers and is propagated over the whole country various people on this occasion call to mind the danger which they and their friends as it appears from this example stand exposed to in travelling especially such as may have occasion to travel the same road on this occasion they naturally feel a certain degree of pain slighter  0 or heavier according to the degree of illtreatment they may understand you to have received the frequency of the occasion each person may have to travel in that same road or its neighbourhood the vicinity of each person to the spot his personal courage the quantity of money he may have occasion to carry about with him and a variety of other circumstances this constitutes the first part of the secondary mischief resulting from the act of robbery viz the alarm but people of one description or other not only are disposed to conceive themselves to incur a chance of being robbed in consequence of the robbery committed upon you but as will be shown presently they do really incur such a chance and it is this chance which constitutes the remaining part of the secondary mischief of the act of robbery viz the danger vii let us see what this chance amounts to and whence it comes how is it for instance that one robbery can contribute to produce another in the first place it is certain that it cannot create any direct motive a motive must be the prospect of some pleasure or other advantage to be enjoyed in future but the robbery in question is past nor would it furnish any such prospect were it to come for it is not one robbery that will furnish pleasure to him who may be about to commit another robbery the consideration that is to operate upon a man as a motive or inducement to commit a robbery must be the idea of the pleasure he expects to derive from the fruits of that very robbery but this pleasure exists independently of any other robbery viii the means then by which one robbery tends as it should seem to produce another robbery are two   by suggesting to a person exposed to the temptation the idea of committing such another robbery accompanied perhaps with the belief of its facility in this case the influence it exerts applies itself in the first place to the understanding   by weakening the force of the tutelary motives which tend to restrain him from such an action and thereby adding to the strength of the temptation in this case the influence applies itself to the will these forces are   the motive of benevolence which acts as a branch of the physical sanction†   the motive of selfpreservation as against the punishment that may stand provided by the political sanction   the fear of shame a motive belonging to the moral sanction   the fear of the divine displeasure a motive belonging to the religious sanction on the first and last of these forces it has perhaps no influence worth insisting on but it has on the other two ix the way in which a past robbery may weaken the force with which the political sanction tends to prevent a future robbery may be thus conceived the way in which this sanction tends to prevent a robbery is by denouncing some particular kind of punishment against any who shall be guilty of it the real value of which punishment will of course be diminished by the real uncertainty as also if there be any difference the apparent value by the apparent uncertainty now this uncertainty is proportionably increased by every instance in which a man is known to commit the offence without undergoing the punishment this of course will be the case with every offence for a certain time in short until the punishment allotted to it takes place if punishment takes place at last this branch of the mischief of the offence is then at last but not till then put a stop to x the way in which a past robbery may weaken the force with which the moral sanction tends to prevent a future robbery may be thus conceived the way in which the moral sanction tends to prevent a robbery is by holding forth the indignation of mankind as ready to fall upon him who shall be guilty of it now this indignation will be the more formidable according to the number of those who join in it it will be the less so the fewer they are who join in it but there cannot be a stronger way of showing that a man does not join in whatever indignation may be entertained against a practice than the engaging in it himself it shows not only that he himself feels no indignation against it but that it seems to him there is no sufficient reason for apprehending what indignation may be felt against it by others accordingly where robberies are frequent and unpunished robberies are committed without shame it was thus amongst the grecians formerly‡ it is thus among the arabs still xi in whichever way then a past offence tends to pave the way for the commission of a future offence whether by suggesting the idea of committing it or by adding to the strength of the temptation in both cases it    may be said to operate by the force or influence of example xii the two branches of the secondary mischief of an act the alarm and the danger must not be confounded though intimately connected they are perfectly distinct either may subsist without the other the neighbourhood may be alarmed with the report of a robbery when in fact no robbery either has been committed or is in a way to be committed a neighbourhood may be on the point of being disturbed by robberies without knowing any thing of the matter accordingly we shall soon perceive that some acts produce alarm without danger others danger without alarm xiii as well the danger as the alarm may again be divided each of them into two branches the first consisting of so much of the alarm or danger as may be apt to result from the future behaviour of the same agent the second consisting of so much as may be apt to result from the behaviour of other persons such others to wit as may come to engage in acts of the same sort and tendency xiv the distinction between the primary and the secondary consequences of an act must be carefully attended to it is so just that the latter may often be of a directly opposite nature to the former in some cases where the primary consequences of the act are attended with a mischief the secondary consequences may be beneficial and that to such a degree as even greatly to outweigh the mischief of the primary this is the case for instance with all acts of punishment when properly applied of these the primary mischief being never intended to fall but upon such persons as may happen to have committed some act which it is expedient to prevent the secondary mischief that is the alarm and the danger extends no farther than to such persons as are under temptation to commit it in which case in as far as it tends to restrain them from committing such acts it is of a beneficial nature xv thus much with regard to acts that produce positive pain and that immediately this case by reason of its simplicity seemed the fittest to take the lead but acts may preduce mischief in various other ways which together with those already specified may all be comprised by the following abridged analysis mischief may admit of a division in any one of three points of view   according to its own nature   according to its cause   according to the person or other party who is the object of it† with regard to its nature it may be either simple or complex‡ when simple it may either be positive or negative positive consisting of actual pain negative consisting of the loss of pleasure whether simple or complex and whether positive or negative it may be either certain or contingent when it is negative it consists of the loss of some benefit or advantage this benefit may be material in both or either of two ways   by affording actual pleasure or   by averting pain or danger which is the chance of pain that is by affording security in as far then as the benefit which a mischief tends to avert is productive of security the tendency of such mischief is to produce insecurity   with regard to its cause mischief may be produced either by one single action or not without the concurrence of other actions if not without the concurrence of other actions these others may be the actions either of the same person or of other persons in either case they may be either acts of the same kind as that in question or of other kinds   lastly with regard to the party who is the object of the mischief or in other words who is in a way to be affected by it such party may be either an assignable∥ individual or assemblage of individuals or else a multitude of unassignable individuals when the object is an assignable individual this individual may either be the person himself who is the author of the mischief or some other person when the individuals who are the objects of it are an unassignable multitude this multitude may be either the whole political community or state or some subordinate division of it now when the object of the mischief is the author himself it may be styled selfregarding when any other party is the object extraregarding when such other party is an individual it may be styled private when a subordinate branch of the community semipublic when the whole community public here for the present we must stop to pursue the subject through its inferior distinctions will be the business    of the chapter which exhibits the division of offences the cases which have been already illustrated are those in which the primary mischief is not necessarily otherwise than a simple one and that positive present and therefore certain producible by a single action without any necessity of the concurrence of any other action either on the part of the same agent or of others and having for its object an assignable individual or by accident an assemblage of assignable individuals extraregarding therefore and private this primary mischief is accompanied by a secondary the first branch of which is sometimes contingent and sometimes certain the other never otherwise than contingent both extraregarding and semipublic in other respects pretty much upon a par with the primary mischief except that the first branch viz the alarm though inferior in magnitude to the primary is in point of extent and therefore upon the whole in point of magnitude much superior xvi two instances more will be sufficient to illustrate the most material of the modifications above exhibited a man drinks a certain quantity of liquor and intoxicates himself the intoxication in this particular instance does him no sort of harm or what comes to the same thing none that is perceptible but it is probable and indeed next to certain that a given number of acts of the same kind would do him a very considerable degree of harm more or less according to his constitution and other circumstances for this is no more than what experience manifests every day it is also certain that one act of this sort by one means or other tends considerably to increase the disposition a man may be in to practise other acts of the same sort for this also is verified by experience this therefore is one instance where the mischief producible by the act is contingent in other words in which the tendency of the act is no otherwise mischievous than in virtue of its producing a chance of mischief this chance depends upon the concurrence of other acts of the same kind and those such as must be practised by the same person the object of the mischief is that very person himself who is the author of it and he only unless by accident the mischief is therefore private and selfregarding as to its secondary mischief alarm it produces none it produces indeed a certain quantity of danger by the influence of example but it is not often that this danger will amount to a quantity worth regarding xvii again a man omits paying his share to a public tax this we see is an act of the negative kind is this then to be placed upon the list of mischievous acts yes certainly upon what grounds upon the following to defend the community against its external as well as its internal adversaries are tasks not to mention others of a less indispensable nature which cannot be fulfilled but at a considerable expense but whence is the money for defraying this expense to come it can be obtained in no other manner than by contributions to be collected from individuals in a word by taxes the produce then of these taxes is to be looked upon as a kind of benefit which it is necessary the governing part of the community should receive for the use of the whole this produce before it can be applied to its destination requires that there should be certain persons commissioned to receive and to apply it now if these persons had they received it would have applied it to its proper destination it would have been a benefit the not putting them in a way to receive it is then a mischief but it is possible that if received it might not have been applied to its proper destination or that the services in consideration of which it was bestowed might not have been performed it is possible that the underofficer who collected the produce of the tax might not have paid it over to his principal it is possible that the principal might not have forwarded it on according to its farther destination to the judge for instance who is to protect the community against its clandestine enemies from within or the soldier who is to protect it against its open enemies from without it is possible that the judge or the soldier had they received it would not however been induced by it to fulfil their respective duties it is possible that the judge would not have sat for the punishment of criminals and the decision of controversies it is possible that the soldier would not have drawn his sword in the defence of the community these together with an infinity of other intermediate acts which for the sake of brevity i pass over form a connected chain of duties the discharge of which is necessary to the preservation of the community they must every one of them be discharged ere the benefit to which they are contributory can be produced if they are all discharged in that case the benefit subsists and any act by tending to intercept that benefit may produce a mischief but if any of them are not the benefit fails it fails of itself it would not have subsisted although the act in question the act of nonpayment had not been committed    the benefit is therefore contingent and accordingly upon a certain supposition the act which consists in the averting of it is not a mischievous one but this supposition in any tolerablyordered government will rarely indeed be verified in the very worstordered government that exists the greatest part of the duties that are levied are paid over according to their destination and with regard to any particular sum that is attempted to be levied upon any particular person upon any particular occasion it is therefore manifest that unless it be certain that it will not be so disposed of the act of withholding it is a mischievous one the act of payment when referable to any particular sum especially if it be a small one might also have failed of proving beneficial on another ground and consequently the act of nonpayment of proving mischievous it is possible that the same services precisely might have been rendered without the money as with it if then speaking of any small limited sum such as the greatest which any one person is called upon to pay at a time a man were to say that the nonpayment of it would be attended with mischievous consequences this would be far from certain but what comes to the same thing as if it were it is perfectly certain when applied to the whole it is certain that if all of a sudden the payment of all taxes was to cease there would no longer be any thing effectual done either for the maintenance of justice or for the defence of the community against its foreign adversaries that therefore the weak would presently be oppressed and injured in all manner of ways by the strong at home and both together overwhelmed by oppressors from abroad upon the whole therefore it is manifest that in this case though the mischief is remote and contingent though in its first appearance it consists of nothing more than the interception of a benefit and though the individuals in whose favour that benefit would have been reduced into the explicit form of pleasure or security are altogether unassignable yet the mischievous tendency of the act is not on all these accounts the less indisputable the mischief in point of intensity and duration is indeed unknown it is uncertain it is remote but in point of extent it is immense and in point of fecundity pregnant to a degree that baffles calculation xviii it may now be time to observe that it is only in the case where the mischief is extraregarding and has an assignable person or persons for its object that so much of the secondary branch of it as consists in alarm can have place when the individuals it affects are uncertain and altogether out of sight no alarm can be produced as there is nobody whose sufferings you can see there is nobody whose sufferings you can be alarmed at no alarm for instance is produced by nonpayment to a tax if at any distant and uncertain period of time such offence should chance to be productive of any kind of alarm it would appear to proceed as indeed immediately it would proceed from a very different cause it might be immediately referable for example to the act of a legislator who should deem it necessary to lay on a new tax in order to make up for the deficiency occasioned in the produce of the old one or it might be referable to the act of an enemy who under favour of a deficiency thus created in the fund allotted for defence might invade the country and exact from it much heavier contributions than those which had been thus withholden from the sovereign as to any alarm which such an offence might raise among the few who might chance to regard the matter with the eyes of statesmen it is of too slight and uncertain a nature to be worth taking into the account §   how intentionality c may influence the mischief of an act xix we have seen the nature of the secondary mischief which is apt to be reflected as it were from the primary in the cases where the individuals who are the objects of the mischief are assignable it is now time to examine into the circumstances upon which the production of such secondary mischief depends these circumstances are no others than the four articles which have formed the subjects of the four last preceding chapters viz   the intentionality   the consciousness   the motive   the disposition it is to be observed all along that it is only the danger that is immediately governed by the real state of the mind in respect to those articles it is by the apparent state of it that    the alarm is governed it is governed by the real only in as far as the apparent happens as in most cases it may be expected to do to quadrate with the real the different influences of the articles of intentionality and consciousness may be represented in the several cases following xx case   where the act is so completely unintentional as to be altogether involuntary in this case it is attended with no secondary mischief at all a bricklayer is at work upon a house a passenger is walking in the street below a fellowworkman comes and gives the bricklayer a violent push in consequence of which he falls upon the passenger and hurts him it is plain there is nothing in this event that can give other people who may happen to be in the street the least reason to apprehend any thing in future on the part of the man who fell whatever there may be with regard to the man who pushed him xxi case   where the act though not unintentional is unadvised insomuch that the mischievous part of the consequences is unintentional but the unadvisedness is attended with heedlessness in this case the act is attended with some small degree of secondary mischief in proportion to the degree of heedlessness a groom being on horseback and riding through a frequented street turns a corner at full pace and rides over a passenger who happens to be going by it is plain by this behaviour of the groom some degree of alarm may be produced less or greater according to the degree of heedlessness betrayed by him according to the quickness of his pace the fulness of the street and so forth he has done mischief it may be said by his carelessness already who knows but that on other occasions the like cause may produce the like effect xxii case   where the act is misadvised with respect to a circumstance which had it existed would fully have excluded or what comes to the same thing outweighed the primary mischief and there is no rashness in the case in this case the act is attended with no secondary mischief at all it is needless to multiply examples any farther xxiii case   where the act is misadvised with respect to a circumstance which would have excluded or counterbalanced the primary mischief in part but not entirely and still there is no rashness in this case the act is attended with some degree of secondary mischief in proportion to that part of the primary which remains unexcluded or uncounterbalanced xxiv case   where the act is misadvised with respect to a circumstance which had it existed would have excluded or counterbalanced the primary mischief entirely or in part and there is a degree of rashness in the supposal in this case the act is also attended with a farther degree of secondary mischief in proportion to the degree of rashness xxv case   where the consequences are completely intentional and there is no missupposal in the case in this case the secondary mischief is at the highest xxvi thus much with regard to intentionality and consciousness we now come to consider in what manner the secondary mischief is affected by the nature of the motive where an act is pernicious in its primary consequences the secondary mischief is not obliterated by the goodness of the motive though the motive be of the best kind for notwithstanding the goodness of the motive an act of which the primary consequences are pernicious is produced by it in the instance in question by the supposition it may therefore in other instances although this is not so likely to happen from a good motive as from a bad one xxvii an act which though pernicious in its primary consequences is rendered in other respects beneficial upon the whole by virtue of its secondary consequences is not changed back again and rendered pernicious upon the whole by the badness of the motive although the motive be of the worst kind†    xxviii but when not only the primary consequences of an act are pernicious but in other respects the secondary likewise the secondary mischief may be aggravated by the nature of the motive so much of that mischief to wit as respects the future behaviour of the same person xxix it is not from the worst kind of motive however that the secondary mischief of an act receives its greatest aggravation xxx the aggravation which the secondary mischief of an act in as far as it respects the future behaviour of the same person receives from the nature of a motive in an individual case is as the tendency of the motive to produce on the part of the same person acts of the like bad tendency with that of the act in question xxxi the tendency of a motive to produce acts of the like kind on the part of any given person is as the strength and constancy of its influence on that person as applied to the production of such effects xxxii the tendency of a species of motive to give birth to acts of any kind among persons in general is as the strength constancy and extensiveness of its influence as applied to the production of such effects xxxiii now the motives whereof the influence is at once most powerful most constant and most extensive are the motives of physical desire the love of wealth the love of ease the love of life and the fear of pain all of them selfregarding motives the motive of displeasure whatever it may be in point of strength and extensiveness is not near so constant in its influence the case of mere antipathy excepted as any of the other three a pernicious act therefore when committed through vengeance or otherwise through displeasure is not nearly so mischievous as the same pernicious act when committed by force of any one of those other motives† xxxiv as to the motive of religion whatever it may sometimes prove to be in point of strength and constancy it is not in point of extent so universal especially in its application to acts of a mischievous nature as any of the three preceding motives it may however be as universal in a particular state or in a particular district of a particular state it is liable indeed to be very irregular in its operations it is apt however to be frequently as powerful as the motive of vengeance or indeed any other motive whatsoever it will sometimes even be more powerful than any other motive it is at any rate much more constant‡ a pernicious act therefore when    committed through the motive of religion is more mischievous than when committed through the motive of illwill xxxv lastly the secondary mischief to wit so much of it as hath respect to the future behaviour of the same person is aggravated or lessened by the apparent depravity or beneficence of his disposition and that in the proportion of such apparent depravity or beneficence xxxvi the consequences we have hitherto been speaking of are the natural consequences of which the act and the other articles we have been considering are the causes consequences that result from the behaviour of the individual who is the offending agent without the interference of political authority we now come to speak of punishment which in the sense in which it is here considered is an artificial consequence annexed by political authority to an offensive act in one instance in the view of putting a stop to the production of events similar to the obnoxious part of its natural consequences in other instances chapter xiii of circumstances influencing the degree of alarm i the situation of the offender there are some offences which all the world can commit there are others the commission of which depends upon a particular situation that is to say it is this particular situation which gives the individual the opportunity of offending what is the effect of this circumstance upon alarm it tends generally to diminish it by restricting its sphere a theft produces a general alarm an act of peculation by a guardian against his ward produces hardly any some alarm is inspired by an act of extortion on the part of an officer of police a contribution levied by robbers upon the highway would inspire much more why is this it is because it is well known that the most determined extortioner in office has some bridle and some restraint he requires opportunities and pretexts for abusing his power whilst the highway robbers menace all the world at all times and are not at all restrained by public opinion this circumstance operates in the same manner upon other classes of offences such as seduction adultery c the first woman who is met cannot be seduced in the same manner as she may be robbed such an enterprise requires a continued acquaintance a certain association of rank and fortune in a word the advantages of a particular position of two murders the one committed in order to succeed to an estate the other in a course of robbery the first exhibits the most atrocious character but the second excites the most alarm the man who believes himself secure from the evil designs of his heirs experiences no sensible alarm from the first event but what security can he have against robbers add to this that the miscreant who would commit murder that he might succeed to an inheritance will not transform himself into a murderer on the highway he would risk much for an estate which he would not risk for a few shillings this observation extends to all offences implying violation of trust and abuse of confidence or power public or private such offences cause so much the less alarm inasmuch as the situation of the offender is the more particular that there are a smaller number of persons in a similar situation and hence that the sphere of the offence is more restricted an important exception is found in those cases in which the individual is clothed with great powers when he can extend the sphere of his actions over a great number of persons though his situation be particular it increases the alarm instead of restricting it when the object of a judge is to pillage to murder to tyrannize when the object of a military officer is to steal to vex to shed blood the alarm which they excite is proportioned to the extent of their powers and may surpass that of the most atrocious robberies in these elevated situations it is not necessary to be criminal a simple fault free from evil intention may cause a lively alarm is an innocent person sentenced to death by an upright but ignorant judge as soon as the fault is known public confidence is wounded the shock makes itself felt and the alarm produced rises to a high degree happily this species of alarm may be at once arrested by displacing the incapable subject of it ii the ease or difficulty of preventing the crime the mind at once is led to compare the means of attack and defence and accordingly as the crime is considered more or less easy of commission the alarm is more or less lively this is one of the reasons which raise the mischief of an act of robbery so far above the mischief of a simple theft force can accomplish many things which would be    beyond the reach of cunning with respect to robbery that which attacks the dwellinghouse is more alarming than that which takes place upon the highway that which is committed at night than that which is executed in open day that which is combined with incendiarism than that which is limited to the ordinary methods on the other hand the greater the apparent ease of opposing a crime the less alarming it appears the alarm will not be so lively when the offence cannot be completed without the consent of the party suffering it is easy to apply this principle to fraudulent acquisition seduction duels selfregarding offences and particularly to suicide the rigour of the laws against domestic theft has been founded without doubt upon the difficulty of opposing this offence but the aggravation which results from this circumstance is not equal to the effect of another circumstance which tends to diminish the alarm namely the peculiarity of the situation which furnishes the opportunity for the theft the domestic thief once discovered is no longer dangerous he requires my consent in order to rob me i must introduce him into my house and give him my confidence with so much facility for securing myself he can only inspire me with a very feeble alarm iii the greater or less facility with which the offender can be concealed the alarm is greater when by the nature or the circumstances of the crime it is more difficult to discover or to recognise its author if the delinquent remain unknown the success of his crime is an encouragement to him and to others no limits can be discovered to those crimes which remain unknown whilst the party injured loses all hope of indemnification there are some crimes which admit of precautions particularly adapted for concealment such as the disguising of the person the choice of night for the period of action the sending of anonymous threatening letters for the purpose of extorting undue concessions there are also separate crimes to which recourse may be had in order to render the discovery of other offences more difficult an individual may be confined or conveyed away or destroyed in order that the criminal may free himself from the danger to be apprehended from his testimony in those cases where from the nature of the crime the criminal is necessarily known the alarm is considerably diminished hence personal injuries resulting from a momentary transport of passion excited by the presence of an adversary inspire less alarm than a theft which affects concealment although the evil of the first class may be greater or may chance to be so in the first case iv the character of the offender the character of an offender is judged of from the nature of his offence and especially from the extent of its mischief from the evil of the first class which is the part most apparent in it but his character may be also judged of from circumstances from the particulars of his conduct whilst committing the crime itself thus the character of a man will appear more or less dangerous according as the tutelary motives appear to have more or less influence over him when compared with the force of the seductive motives character ought on two accounts to be regarded in the choice of and the quantity of a punishment first because it either increases or diminishes the alarm secondly because it furnishes an indication of the sensibility of the subject it is not necessary to employ such strong measures to repress a weak but naturally good character as are required for an opposite temperament let us examine the grounds of aggravation which may be drawn from this source   the less the party injured was in a condition to defend himself the more strongly the sentiment of natural compassion ought to act the laws of honour come to the support of this instinct of pity and make it an imperious duty to succour the weak and to spare him who is no longer able to resist first indication of a dangerous character—weakness oppressed   if weakness alone ought to awaken compassion the appearance of a suffering individual ought to act in this direction with a double force the simple refusal of relief to the distressed raises a presumption little favourable to the character of an individual but what must his character be who seizes the moment of calamity for the purpose of increasing the anxiety of an afflicted mind the moment of disgrace in order to render it more bitter by a new affront the moment of indigence for the purpose of entirely stripping its victims second indication of a dangerous character—distress aggravated   it is an essential branch of moral policy that those who have been accustomed to reflection and who may be presumed to possess wisdom and experience should be treated with respect by those who have not acquired the same habits or possessed the same advantages of education this species of superiority is generally received by the more elevated ranks from those below them by old persons from younger persons of the same    rank and by certain professions set apart for the public instruction there exists among the mass of the people certain sentiments of deference and respect in relation to these distinctions and this respect greatly useful in repressing without effort the seductive passions is one of the best foundations for manners and laws third indication of a dangerous character—respect towards superiors disregarded   when the motives which have led to the commission of an offence have been comparatively light and frivolous the sentiments of honour and benevolence must have had but little force if the man who is urged by an imperious desire of vengeance to transgress the laws of humanity is esteemed dangerous what should be thought of him who gives way to acts of ferocity from a simple motive of curiosity of imitation or of amusement fourth indication of a dangerous character—gratuitous cruelty   time is particularly favourable to the development of the tutelary motives during the first assault of passion as under a thunderstroke the sentiments of virtue may yield for a moment but if the heart is not perverted reflection will soon restore them to their first force and establish their triumph if a sufficiently long time elapse between the conception of a crime and its accomplishment it is an unequivocal proof of matured and consolidated wickedness fifth indication of a dangerous character—premeditation   the number of accomplices is another mark of depravity concert supposes reflection the union of many persons against a single innocent person also displays a cruel cowardice sixth indication of a dangerous character—conspiracy to these causes of aggravation may be added two other causes not so easily classed falsehood and violation of confidence falsehood stamps a character with a deep and degrading stain which even the most brilliant qualities cannot efface public opinion is right in this respect truth is one of the first wants of man it is one of the elements of our existence necessary as the light of the day to us at every moment of our lives we are obliged to build our judgments and to direct our conduct upon the knowledge of facts of which there are only a few that can pass under our own observation hence there follows the most absolute necessity for our trusting to the reports of others if falsehood is mingled with these reports our judgments become erroneous our progress faulty our hopes deceived we live in a state of unquiet distrust and know not where to seek for security in a word falsehood includes the principle of every evil since it would bring in its train the dissolution of human society the importance of truth is so great that the least violation of its laws even in trifling matters always draws after it a certain danger the slightest wandering is an attack upon the respect due to it the first transgression facilitates the second by familiarizing the odious idea of a lie if the evil of falsehood is so great in things which are unimportant in themselves what will it be in those greater occasions when it serves as an instrument of crime falsehood is sometimes an essential circumstance in a crime sometimes simply an accessory it is necessarily comprised in perjury in fraudulent acquisition and all its modifications in other offences it is only collateral and accidental it is only by relation to these last that it can furnish a separate cause of aggravation violation of confidence refers to a particular position to a power confided which imposes on the delinquent an obligation which he has violated it may sometimes be considered as the principal offence sometimes only as an accessory offence it is not necessary here to consider the details we may here make one general observation with respect to all these sources of aggravation although they all furnish unfavourable indications as to the character of the offender this is not a reason for proportionably augmenting his punishment it is sufficient if a certain modification be given to it which shall have some analogy with this accessory offence and which shall serve to waken in the minds of the citizens a salutary antipathy against this aggravating circumstance this will become more clear when we treat of the methods of rendering punishments characteristic†    we proceed however to the extenuations which may be drawn from this same source and which have the effect of more or less diminishing the demand for punishment i call those circumstances which tend to diminish alarm extenuations because they furnish a favourable indication with regard to the character of the individual they may be reduced to nine—     absence of evil intention     selfpreservation     previous provocation     preservation of dear connections     overstepping the bounds of necessary defence     submission to threats     submission to authority     intoxication     infancy one point common to these circumstances except the two last is that the offence has not had its source in the will of the offender the first cause is the act of another a foreign will or some physical accident apart from this event he would have remained as innocent to the end of his life as he had been till then and even should he not be punished his future conduct would be as good as if he had not committed the offence in question each of these circumstances requires details and explanations i confine myself here to observing that it will be necessary to leave great latitude to the judge for appreciating these different sources of extenuation their validity and extent with respect to a provocation received for example this provocation should have been recently given in order to merit indulgence it ought to have been received in the course of the same quarrel but what constitutes the same quarrel what ought to be considered a recent injury it is necessary to trace these lines of demarcation let not the sun go down upon your wrath is the precept of the scriptures sleep ought to calm the transport of the passions the fever of the senses and prepare the mind for the influence of the tutelary motives this natural period might serve in the case of homicide to separate that which is premeditated from that which is not in the case of intoxication it is necessary to examine whether the intention to commit the offence did not exist beforehand whether the intoxication has not been feigned whether it had not for its object to embolden the individual in the commission of the crime a relapse ought perhaps to destroy the excuse which might be drawn from this source he who knows by experience that wine renders him dangerous does not deserve any indulgence for those excesses into which it may lead him the english law does not admit intoxication as a ground of excuse this would be it is said to excuse one crime by another this morality appears hard and unthinking it is derived from the principle of asceticism whilst as to infancy this does not refer to that age at which the offender does not know that he is responsible for what he does and where punishments would be inefficacious to what good purpose punish judicially for the crime of incendiarism an infant of four years old within what limits ought this source of extenuation to be confined it seems that a reasonable limit is the period when a man is considered to have arrived at such maturity as no longer to require a guardian and he becomes his own master before this period it is not expected that he has sufficient reason for the management of his own affairs it is not said that with respect to every crime committed before mature age the ordinary punishment ought necessarily to be diminished this diminution ought to depend upon the whole circumstances but what is intended to be said is that this period being passed punishment ought no longer to be diminished on this account on account of minority in age infamous punishments are principally remitted he who has no hope of reviving honour is with difficulty again incited to virtue when i speak of majority i do not mean the roman majority fixed at twentyfive years because there is injustice and folly in restraining the liberty of the man for so long a time and keeping him in the bonds of infancy after the full development of his faculties the period which i have in view is the english period of twentyone years before this age pompey had conquered provinces and pliny the younger had sustained with honour the interests of his fellowcitizens at the bar great britain was governed by a minister who managed the complicated system of her finances with eclât before the  0 age at which in the other parts of europe he would have been allowed to sell an acre of land case in which there is no alarm the alarm is absolutely null in the case in which the only persons exposed to the danger if there are any are unsusceptible of fear this circumstance explains the insensibility of many nations with respect to infanticide that is to say homicide committed upon a newborn child with the consent of its father and mother i say their consent for without this the alarm would be nearly the same as if it respected an adult the less infants are susceptible of fear for themselves the more the tenderness of parents is apt to be alarmed for them i pretend not to justify these nations they are so much the more barbarous inasmuch as they have given to the father the right of disposing of the new born babe without the consent of the mother who after all the dangers of maternity finds herself deprived of its reward and reduced by this unworthy slavery to the same condition with those inferior creatures whose fecundity is a burthen to us infanticide such as i have defined it to be cannot be punished as a principal offence since it produces no evil of the first or second class but it ought to be punished as a step towards other crimes furnishing an indication against the characters of its authors the sentiments of respect for humanity cannot be too strongly fortified nor can too great a repugnance be inspired against every thing which leads to habits of cruelty infanticide ought therefore to be punished by attaching to it some disgrace the fear of shame is commonly its cause it requires therefore a greater stigma to repress it but at the same time the occasions for punishment should be rendered rare by requiring clear proof of its commission the laws against this offence upon pretence of humanity have been most manifest violations of it compare the crime and the punishment what is the crime the death of an infant which has ceased to exist before it has known existence an event which cannot excite the slightest uneasiness in the imagination of the most fearful and which can leave no regrets but with those who from a feeling of shame and of pity have refused to prolong its days commenced under such unhappy auspices and what is the punishment a barbarous punishment an ignominious death inflicted upon an unhappy mother whose crime itself proves her excessive sensibility on a woman led astray by despair who has injured herself alone by refusing to yield to the sweetest instinct of nature she is devoted to infamy because she too deeply dreaded shame and the existence of her friends who survive her is poisoned by opprobrium and ignominy but if the legislator himself has been the first cause of the evil if he can be considered as the true murderer of these innocent creatures how much more odious would this rigour appear it is however he alone who by acting harshly against her frailty has excited this direful combat in the heart of a mother between tenderness and shame of the cases in which the danger is greater than the alarm although alarm in general corresponds with danger there are some cases in which this proportion is not exact the danger may be greater than the alarm this happens in those mixed offences which include a private evil and a danger which is proper to them in their character of public offences it might happen in a state that a prince should be robbed by unfaithful officers and the public oppressed by the vexations of his subordinates the accomplices in these disorders might compose a threatening phalanx allowing nothing to approach the throne but mercenary eulogiums insomuch that truth should become the greatest of all crimes timidity under the mask of prudence would soon form the national character if during this universal abasement of courage a virtuous citizen should venture to denounce the offenders and should become the victim of his zeal his loss would excite but little alarm his magnanimity would only be considered as an act of folly and each one promising to himself that he would not act like him would behold without emotion a misfortune which he would see that he had the means of avoiding but the alarm in thus subsiding would make way for a more considerable mischief this mischief consists in the danger of impunity for all public offences in the cessation of all voluntary services to justice in the profound indifference of individuals to every thing which does not personally affect them it is said that in certain of the italian states those who have given evidence against thieves and robbers have been exposed to the vengeance of their accomplices and obliged to seek in flight that security which the laws could not give them it being more dangerous for individuals to lend their services to justice than to arm themselves against it a witness running more danger than an assassin the alarm which results from this state of things is weak because no one need expose himself to this mischief but the danger is increased in the same proportion    chapter xiv reasons for considering certain actions as crimes we have made an analysis of evil this analysis shows that there are certain actions from which there results more evil than good it is actions of this kind or at least those which have been reputed such that legislators have prohibited a prohibited action is what is called a crime to make these prohibitions respected it has been necessary to institute punishments but is it proper to consider certain actions as crimes or in other terms is it proper to subject them to legal punishments what a question is not all the world agreed upon it is it necessary to prove a recognised truth a truth so well established in the minds of men all the world may be agreed but upon what is this agreement founded ask each one his reasons you will find a strange diversity of sentiments and principles you will find it not only among the people but among the philosophers is it lost time to seek for an uniform base of agreement upon so essential an object the agreement which exists is only founded upon prejudices and those prejudices vary according to times and places according to opinions and customs i have always been told that such an action was a crime and i think that it is a crime such is the guide of the people and even of the legislator but if custom has considered innocent actions as crimes if it have considered small offences as great ones and great offences as small ones if it vary every where it is clear that it ought to be subjected to a rule and not be taken as the rule itself we appeal then here to the principle of utility it confirms the decisions of prejudice wherever they are just it annuls them wherever they are pernicious i suppose myself a stranger to all our present denominations of vice or virtue i am called to consider human actions only with relation to their good or evil effects i open two accounts i place on the side of pure profit all pleasures i place on the side of loss all pains i faithfully weigh the interests of all parties the man whom prejudice brands as vicious he who is accounted virtuous are for the moment equal before me i wish to judge the prejudice itself and to weigh in this new balance all actions with the intention of forming a catalogue of those which ought to be permitted and of those which ought to be prohibited the operation which at first appears so complicated becomes easy by means of the distinction which we have made between the evil of the first the second and the third order have i to examine an act attacking the security of an individual i compare all the pleasure or in other terms all the profit which arises from this act to its author with all the evil or all the loss which results from it to the party injured i see at once that the evil of the first order surpasses the good of the first order but i do not stop there this action is followed by danger and alarm to society the evil which was confined at first to a single person spreads itself over all in the shape of fear the pleasure resulting from the action is only for one the pain is for a thousand for ten thousand for all the disproportion already prodigious appears almost infinite if i pass on to the evil of the third order by considering that if the act in question were not repressed there would result from it an universal and durable discouragement a cessation of labour and at last the dissolution of society i shall consider the strongest desires those the satisfaction of which is accompanied with the greatest pleasures and it will be seen that their satisfaction when it is obtained at the expense of security is much more fruitful of evil than of good   let us first take enmity it is the most fruitful cause of attacks upon honour and the person i have conceived it matters not on what account enmity against you passion leads me astray i insult you i degrade you i wound you the spectacle of your suffering gives me at least for a time a feeling of pleasure but even for this time can it be believed that the pleasure i feel is equal to the pain you suffer if even each atom of your pain could be painted in my mind is it probable that each atom of pleasure which corresponds to it would appear to me to have the same intensity and yet there are only some scattered atoms of your sufferings which present themselves to my distracted and troubled imagination as to you not one of them can be lost as to me the greater part is always dissipated in pure loss but this pleasure such as it is is not slow in letting its natural impurity break out humanity a principle which nothing perhaps can stifle in the most atrocious minds awakens a secret remorse in mine fears of all kinds fear of vengeance either on your part or on the part of those connected with you fear of the public voice religious fears if there remain any spark of religion in me all these fears will soon arise to trouble my security and corrupt my triumph the passion has faded the pleasure is destroyed internal reproach succeeds it but on your side the    suffering still endures and may have a long duration it is thus with slight wounds that time can heal what will it be in those cases in which from the nature of the injury the wound is incurable when the limbs have been cut off the features disfigured or the faculties destroyed weigh these evils their intensity their duration their consequences measure all their dimensions and see how in all senses the pleasure is inferior to the pain let us pass on to the effects of the second order the news of your misfortune spreads over all minds the poison of fear every man who has an enemy or who may have an enemy thinks with dread on every thing which can inspire the passion of hatred among feeble beings who have so many things for which to envy one another about which to dispute whom a thousand little rivalries place without ceasing in opposition to one another the spirit of revenge announces a train of endless evils hence every act of cruelty produced by a passion of which the principle is in all hearts and by which every body may suffer causes an alarm which will continue until the punishment of the guilty has removed the danger to the side of injustice and enmity this is a suffering common to all and we ought not to forget another pain which results from it that pain of sympathy which is felt by generous minds on beholding crimes of this nature   if we secondly examine those actions which may arise from that imperious motive from that desire to which nature has confided the perpetuity of the species and so large a portion of mans happiness we shall see that when it injures personal security or the domestic condition the good which results from its satisfaction bears no comparison with the evil to which it gives rise i speak here only of that attack which manifestly compromises the security of the person—rape it is not proper by a gross and puerile joke to deny the existence of this crime and to diminish the horror of it notwithstanding all that may be said in this respect even those women who are most prodigal of their favours would not like that a brutal fury should ravish them but here the magnitude of the alarm renders useless all discussion respecting the primitive evil whatever may be the case with the actual crime the possibility of its perpetration will always be an object of dread the more universal the desire which gives birth to this crime the greater its alarm and its force in those times when the laws had not sufficient power to repress it or manners were not sufficiently regulated to disgrace it it gave rise to revenges of which history has preserved some recollection whole nations have interested themselves in the quarrel and hatred has been transmitted from fathers to their sons it seems that the severe confinement of the greek women unknown in the time of homer owed its origin to a period of trouble and revolution in which the feebleness of the laws had multiplied disorders of this kind and disseminated a general terror   with regard to the motive of cupidity if we compare the pleasure of acquiring by usurpation with the pain of losing the one will not be found an equivalent for the other but there are cases in which if it were possible to restrain their effects to evils of the first order the good would have an incontestible preponderance over the evil in considering such crimes in this point of view only no good reason can be assigned for the rigour of the laws every thing turns upon the evils of the second order it is these which give to the action the character of a crime it is these which render punishment necessary suppose for example the physical desire has for its object the satisfying of hunger that a poor man pressed with want steals a loaf in the house of a rich man which perhaps may save his life can the good which he has done to himself and the evil he has done to the rich man be considered equal the same observation may be applied to less striking examples suppose that a man pillages the public funds he enriches himself and impoverishes nobody the wrong he does to individuals reduces itself to impalpable portions it is not therefore on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to consider these actions as crimes it is on account of the evils of the second order if the pleasures attached to the satisfaction of desires so powerful as enmity lust and hunger in opposition to the will of the parties interested is far from equalling the evils which arise from such satisfaction the disproportion will appear much greater with regard to less active and powerful motives the desire of selfpreservation is the only one which still demands a separate consideration suppose this desire regards an evil which the laws themselves would impose upon an individual it is necessary that this should be for some very pressing reason such as the necessity of putting in execution the punishments directed by the tribunals punishments without which there would be no security no government now if the desire to escape from this punishment is satisfied the law is found in this respect struck with impotence the evil which results from this satisfaction is then that which results from the impotence of the laws or which amounts to the same thing the nonexistence of all law but the evil which results from the nonexistence of laws is in effect the assemblage of the different evils which laws are established to prevent that is to say of all the evils that    men are liable to experience from men a single triumph of this kind on the part of an individual over the laws is not sufficient to strike the whole system with impotence nevertheless every example of this kind is a symptom of weakness a step towards destruction there results from it an evil of the second order an alarm a danger at least and if the laws connive at this evasion they are in contradiction with their proper ends for the purpose of avoiding a small evil they admit another much more than its equivalent there remains the case in which an individual repels an evil to which the laws do not wish to expose him but since they do not wish that he should submit to this evil they wish that he should not submit to it to avert this evil is in itself a good it is possible that in endeavouring to preserve himself the individual may cause an evil more than equivalent to this good the evil which he has caused in his selfdefence is it confined to what was necessary for this object or has it exceeded it what relation does the evil done bear to the evil averted is it equal is it greater is it less would the evil averted have been susceptible of indemnification if instead of being prevented by such costly proceedings the party had temporarily submitted to it these are so many questions of fact which the law ought to take into consideration in establishing regulations in detail with regard to selfdefence it is a subject which belongs to the penal code in the examination of the means of justification or extenuation with regard to offences it is enough to observe here that in all cases whatever may be the evil of the first order all the evil that an individual can do in selfdefence does not produce any alarm any danger if the individual be not attacked and his security compromised other persons have nothing to fear from him chapter xv §   general view of cases unmeet for punishment i the general object which all laws have or ought to have in common is to augment the total happiness of the community and therefore in the first place to exclude as far as may be every thing that tends to subtract from that happiness in other words to exclude mischief ii but all punishment is mischief all punishment in itself is evil upon the principle of utility if it ought at all to be admitted it ought only to be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater evil iii it is plain therefore that in the following cases punishment ought not to be inflicted   where it is groundless where there is no mischief for it to prevent the act not being mischievous upon the whole   where it must be inefficacious where it cannot act so as to prevent the mischief   where it is unprofitable or too expensive where the mischief it would produce would be greater than what it would prevent      where it is needless where the mischief may be prevented or cease of itself without it that is at a cheaper rate §   cases in which punishment is groundless iv these are   where there has never been any mischief where no mischief has been produced to any body by the act in question of this number are those in which the act was such as might on some occasions be mischievous or disagreeable but the person whose interest it concerns gave his consent to the performance of it this consent provided it be free and fairly obtained is the best proof that can be produced that to the person who gives it no mischief at least no immediate mischief upon the whole is done for no man can be so good a judge as the man himself what it is gives him pleasure or displeasure v   where the mischief was outweighed although a mischief was produced by that act yet the same act was necessary to the production of a benefit which was of greater value† than the mischief this may be the case with any thing that is done in the way of precaution against instant calamity as also with any thing that is done in the exercise of the several sorts of powers necessary to be established in every community to wit domestic judicial military and supreme vi   where there is a certainty of an adequate compensation and that in all cases where the offence can be committed this supposes two things   that the offence is such as admits of an adequate compensation   that such a compensation is sure to be forthcoming of these suppositions the latter will be found to be a merely ideal one a supposition that cannot in the universality here given to it be verified by fact it cannot therefore in practice be numbered amongst the grounds of absolute impunity it may however be admitted as a ground for an abatement of that punishment which other considerations standing by themselves would seem to dictate‡ §   cases in which punishment must be inefficacious vii these are   where the penal provision is not established until after the act is done such are the cases   of an expost facto law where the legislator himself appoints not a punishment till after the act is done   of a sentence beyond the law where the judge of his own authority appoints a punishment which the legislator had not appointed viii   where the penal provision though established is not conveyed to the notice of the person on whom it seems intended that it should operate such is the case where the law has omitted to employ any of the expedients which are necessary to make sure that every person whatsoever who is within the reach of the law be apprized of all the cases whatsoever in which being in the station of life he is in he can be subjected to the penalties of the law∥ ix   where the penal provision though it were conveyed to a mans notice could produce no effect on him with respect to the preventing him from engaging in any act of the sort in question such is the case   in extreme infancy where a man has not yet attained that state or disposition of mind in which the prospect of evils so distant as those which are held forth by the law has the effect of influencing his conduct   in insanity where the person if he has attained to that disposition has since been deprived of it through the influence of some permanent though unseen cause   in intoxication where he has been deprived of it by the transient influence of a visible cause such as the use of wine or opium or other drugs that act in this manner on the nervous system which condition is indeed neither more nor less than a temporary insanity produced by an assignable cause§    x   where the penal provision although being conveyed to the partys notice it might very well prevent his engaging in acts of the sort in question provided he knew that it related to those acts could not have this effect with regard to the individual act he is about to engage in to wit because he knows not that it is of the number of those to which the penal provision relates this may happen   in the case of unintentionality where he intends not to engage and thereby knows not that he is about to engage in the act in which eventually he is about to engage   in the case of unconsciousness where although he may know that he is about to engage in the act itself yet from not knowing all the material circumstances attending it he knows not of the tendency it has to produce that mischief in contemplation of which it has been made penal in most instances   in the case of missupposal where although he may know of the tendency the act has to produce that degree of mischief he supposes it though mistakenly to be attended with some circumstance or set of circumstances which if it had been attended with it would either not have been productive of that mischief or have been productive of such a greater degree of good as has determined the legislator in such a case not to make it penal† xi   where though the penal clause might exercise a full and prevailing influence were it to act alone yet by the predominant influence of some opposite cause upon the will it must necessarily be ineffectual because the evil which he sets himself about to undergo in the case of his not engaging in the act is so great that the evil denounced by the penal clause in case of his engaging in it cannot appear greater this may happen   in the case of physical danger where the evil is such as appears likely to be brought about by the unassisted powers of nature   in the case of a threatened mischief where it is such as appears likely to be brought about through the intentional and conscious agency of man‡ xii   where though the penal clause may exert a full and prevailing influence over the will of the party yet his physical faculties owing to the predominant influence of some physical cause are not in a condition to follow the determination of the will insomuch that the act is absolutely involuntary such is the case of physical compulsion or restraint by whatever means brought about where the mans hand for instance is pushed against some object which his will disposes him not to touch or tied down from touching some object which his will disposes him to touch §   cases where punishment is unprofitable xiii these are   where on the one hand the nature of the offence on the other hand that of the punishment are in the ordinary state of things such that when compared together the evil of the latter will turn out to be greater than that of the former xiv now the evil of the punishment divides itself into four branches by which so many different sets of persons are affected   the evil of coercion or restraint or the pain which it gives a man not to be able to do the act whatever it be which by the apprehension of the punishment he is deterred from doing this is felt by those by whom the law is observed   the evil of apprehension or the pain which a man who has exposed himself to punishment feels at the thoughts of undergoing it this is felt by those by whom the law has been broken and who feel themselves in danger of its being executed upon them   the evil of sufferance∥ or the pain which a man feels in virtue of the punishment itself from the time when he begins to undergo it this is felt by those by whom the law is broken and upon whom it comes actually to be executed   the pain of sympathy and the other derivative evils resulting to the persons who are in connection with the several classes of original sufferers just mentioned§ now of these four lots of evil the first will be greater or less    according to the nature of the act from which the party is restrained the second and third according to the nature of the punishment which stands annexed to that offence xv on the other hand as to the evil of the offence this will also of course be greater or less according to the nature of each offence the proportion between the one evil and the other will therefore be different in the case of each particular offence the cases therefore where punishment is unprofitable on this ground can by no other means be discovered than by an examination of each particular offence which is what will be the business of the body of the work xvi   where although in the ordinary state of things the evil resulting from the punishment is not greater than the benefit which is likely to result from the force with which it operates during the same space of time towards the excluding the evil of the offence yet it may have been rendered so by the influence of some occasional circumstances in the number of these circumstances may be   the multitude of delinquents at a particular juncture being such as would increase beyond the ordinary measure the quantum of the second and third lots and thereby also of a part of the fourth lot in the evil of the punishment   the extraordinary value of the services of some one delinquent in the case where the effect of the punishment would be to deprive the community of the benefit of those services   the displeasure of the people that is of an indefinite number of the members of the same community in cases where owing to the influence of some occasional incident they happen to conceive that the offence or the offender ought not to be punished at all or at least ought not to be punished in the way in question   the displeasure of foreign powers that is of the governing body or a considerable number of the members of some foreign community or communities with which the community in question is connected §   cases where punishment is needless xvii these are   where the purpose of putting an end to the practice may be attained as effectually at a cheaper rate by instruction for instance as well as by terror by informing the understanding as well as by exercising an immediate influence on the will this seems to be the case with respect to all those offences which consist in the disseminating pernicious principles in matters of duty of whatever kind the duty be whether political or moral or religious and this whether such principles be disseminated under or even without a sincere persuasion of their being beneficial i say even without for though in such a case it is not instruction that can prevent the writer from endeavouring to inculcate his principles yet it may the readers from adopting them without which his endeavouring to inculcate them will do no harm in such a case the sovereign will commonly have little need to take an active part if it be the interest of one individual to inculcate principles that are pernicious it will as surely be the interest of other individuals to expose them but if the sovereign must needs take a part in the controversy the pen is the proper weapon to combat error with not the sword chapter xvi of the proportion between punishments and offences i we have seen that the general object of all laws is to prevent mischief that is to say when it is worth while but that where there are no other means of doing this than punishment there are four cases in which it is not worth while ii when it is worth while there are four subordinate designs or objects which in the course of his endeavours to compass as far as may be that one general object a legislator whose views are governed by the principle of utility comes naturally to propose to himself iii   his first most extensive and most eligible object is to prevent in as far as it is possible and worth while all sorts of offences whatsoever in other words so to manage that no offence whatsoever may be committed iv   but if a man must needs commit an offence of some kind or other the next object is to induce him to commit an offence less mischievous rather than one more mischievous in other words to choose always the least mischievous of two offences that will either of them suit his purpose v   when a man has resolved upon a particular offence the next object is to dispose him to do no more mischief than is necessary to his purpose in other words to do as little mischief as is consistent with the benefit he has in view vi   the last object is whatever the mischief be which it is proposed to prevent to prevent it at as cheap a rate as possible    vii subservient to these four objects or purposes must be the rules or canons by which the proportion of punishments to offences is to be governed viii rule  —  the first object it has been seen is to prevent in as far as it is worth while all sorts of offences therefore the value of the punishment must not be less in any case than what is sufficient to outweigh that of the profit† of the offence‡ if it be the offence unless some other considerations independent of the punishment should intervene and operate efficaciously in the character of tutelary motives∥ will be sure to be committed not withstanding§ the whole lot of punishment will be thrown away it will be altogether inefficatious ix the above rule has been often objected to on account of its seeming harshness but this can only have happened for want of its being properly understood the strength of the temptation cæteris paribus is as the profit of the offence the quantum of the punishment must rise with the profit of the offence cæteris paribus it must therefore rise with the strength of the temptation this there is no disputing true it is that the stronger the temptation the less conclusive is the indication which the act of delinquency affords of the depravity of the offenders disposition† so far then as the absence of any aggravation arising from extraordinary depravity of disposition may operate or at the utmost so far as the presence of a ground of extenuation resulting from the innocence or beneficence of the offenders disposition can operate the strength of the temptation may operate in abatement of the demand for punishment but it can never operate so far as to indicate the propriety of making the punishment ineffectual which it is sure to be when brought below the level of the apparent profit of the offence the partial benevolence which should prevail for the reduction of it below this level would counteract as well those purposes which such a motive would actually have in view as those more extensive purposes which benevolence ought to have in view it would be cruelty not only to the public but to the very persons in whose behalf it pleads in its effects i mean however opposite in its intention cruelty to the public that is cruelty to the    innocent by suffering them for want of an adequate protection to lie exposed to the mischief of the offence cruelty even to the offender himself by punishing him to no purpose and without the chance of compassing that beneficial end by which alone the introduction of the evil of punishment is to be justified x rule   but whether a given offence shall be prevented in a given degree by a given quantity of punishment is never any thing better than a chance for the purchasing of which whatever punishment is employed is so much expended in advance however for the sake of giving it the better chance of outweighing the profit of the offence the greater the mischief of the offence the greater is the expense which it may be worth while to be at in the way of punishment xi rule   the next object is to induce a man to choose always the least mischievous of two offences therefore where two offences come in competition the punishment for the greater offence must be sufficient to induce a man to prefer the less† xii rule   when a man has resolved upon a particular offence the next object is to induce him to do no more mischief than what is necessary for his purpose therefore the punishment should be adjusted in such manner to each particular offence that for every part of the mischief there may be a motive to restrain the offender from giving birth to it‡ xiii rule   the last object is whatever mischief is guarded against to guard against it at as cheap a rate as possible therefore the punishment ought in no case to be more than what is necessary to bring it into conformity with the rules here given xiv rule   it is further to be observed that owing to the different manners and degrees in which persons under different circumstances are affected by the same exciting cause a punishment which is the same in name will not always either really produce or even so much as appear to others to produce in two different persons the same degree of pain therefore that the quantity actually inflicted on each individual offender may correspond to the quantity intended for similar offenders in general the several circumstances influencing sensibility ought always to be taken into account∥ xv of the above rules of proportion the four first we may perceive serve to mark out the limits on the side of diminution the limits below which a punishment ought not to be diminished the fifth the limits on the side of increase the limits above which it ought not to be increased the five first are calculated to serve as guides to the legislator the sixth is calculated in some measure indeed for the same purpose but principally for guiding the judge in his endeavours to conform on both sides to the intentions of the legislator xvi let us look back a little the first rule in order to render it more conveniently applicable to practice may need perhaps to be a little more particularly unfolded it is to be observed then that for the sake of accuracy it was necessary instead of the word quantity to make use of the less perspicuous term value for the word quantity will not properly include the circumstances either of certainty or proximity circumstances which in estimating the value of a lot of pain or pleasure must always be taken into the account§ now on the one hand a lot of punishment is a lot of pain on the other hand the profit of an offence is a lot of pleasure or what is equivalent to it but the profit of the offence is commonly more certain than the punishment or what comes to the same thing appears so at least to the offender it is at any rate commonly more immediate it follows therefore that in order to maintain its superiority over the profit of the offence the punishment must have its value made up in some other way in proportion to that whereby it falls short in the two points of certainty and proximity    now there is no other way in which it can receive any addition to its value but by receiving an addition in point of magnitude wherever then the value of the punishment falls short either in point of certainty or of proximity of that of the profit of the offence it must receive a proportionable addition in point of magnitude xvii yet farther to make sure of giving the value of the punishment the superiority over that of the offence it may be necessary in some cases to take into the account the profit not only of the individual offence to which the punishment is to be annexed but also of such other offences of the same sort as the offender is likely to have already committed without detection this random mode of calculation severe as it is it will be impossible to avoid having recourse to in certain cases in such to wit in which the profit is pecuniary the chance of detection very small and the obnoxious act of such a nature as indicates a habit for example in the case of frauds against the com if it be not recurred to the practice of committing the offence will be sure to be upon the balance of the account a gainful practice that being the case the legislator will be absolutely sure of not being able to suppress it and the whole punishment that is bestowed upon it will be thrown away in a word to keep to the same expressions we set out with that whole quantity of punishment will be inefficacious xviii rule   these things being considered the three following rules may be laid down by way of supplement and explanation to rule   to enable the value of the punishment to outweigh that of the profit of the offence it must be increased in point of magnitude in proportion as it falls short in point of certainty xix rule   punishment must be further increased in point of magnitude in proportion as it falls short in point of proximity xx rule   where the act is conclusively indicative of a habit such an increase must be given to the punishment as may enable it to outweigh the profit not only of the individual offence but of such other like offences as are likely to have been committed with impunity by the same offender xxi there may be a few other circumstances or considerations which may influence in some small degree the demand for punishment but as the propriety of these is either not so demonstrable or not so constant or the application of them not so determinate as that of the foregoing it may be doubted whether they be worth putting on a level with the others xxii rule  0 when a punishment which in point of quality is particularly well calculated to answer its intention cannot exist in less than a certain quantity it may sometimes be of use for the sake of employing it to stretch a little beyond that quantity which on other accounts would be strictly necessary xxiii rule    in particular this may sometimes be the case where the punishment proposed is of such a nature as to be particularly well calculated to answer the purpose of a moral lesson† xxiv rule    the tendency of the above considerations is to dictate an augmentation in the punishment the following rule operates in the way of diminution there are certain cases it has been seen‡ in which by the influence of accidental circumstances punishment may be rendered unprofitable in the whole in the same cases it may chance to be rendered unprofitable as to a part only accordingly in adjusting the quantum of punishment the circumstances by which all punishment may be rendered unprofitable ought to be attended to xxv rule    it is to be observed that the more various and minute any set of provisions are the greater the chance is that any given article in them will not be borne in mind without which no benefit can ensue from it distinctions which are more complex than what the conceptions of those whose conduct it is designed to influence can take in will even be worse than useless the whole system will present a confused appearance and thus the effect not only of the proportions established by the articles in question but of whatever is connected with them will be  0 destroyed to draw a precise line of direction in such case seems impossible however by way of memento it may be of some use to subjoin the following rule among provisions designed to perfect the proportion between punishments and offences if any occur which by their own particular good effects would not make up for the harm they would do by adding to the intricacy of the code they should be omitted† xxvi it may be remembered that the political sanction being that to which the sort of punishment belongs which in this chapter is all along in view is but one of four sanctions which may all of them contribute their share towards producing the same effects it may be expected therefore that in adjusting the quantity of political punishment allowance should be made for the assistance it may meet with from those other controuling powers true it is that from each of these several sources a very powerful assistance may sometimes be derived but the case is that setting aside the moral sanction in the case where the force of it is expressly adopted into and modified by the political‡ the force of those other powers is never determinate enough to be depended upon it can never be reduced like political punishment into exact lots nor meted out in number quantity and value the legislator is therefore obliged to provide the full complement of punishment as if he were sure of not receiving any assistance whatever from any of those quarters if he does so much the better but lest he should not it is necessary he should at all events make that provision which depends upon himself xxvii it may be of use in this place to recapitulate the several circumstances which in establishing the proportion betwixt punishments and offences are to be attended to these seem to be as follows— i on the part of the offence     the profit of the offence     the mischief of the offence     the profit and mischief of other greater or lesser offences of different sorts which the offender may have to choose out of     the profit and mischief of other offences of the same sort which the same offender may probably have been guilty of already ii on the part of the punishment     the magnitude of the punishment composed of its intensity and duration     the deficiency of the punishment in point of certainty     the deficiency of the punishment in point of proximity     the quality of the punishment     the accidental advantage in point of quality of a punishment not strictly needed in point of quantity    0 the use of a punishment of a particular quality in the character of a moral lesson iii on the part of the offender      the responsibility of the class of persons in a way to offend      the sensibility of each particular offender      the particular merits or useful qualities of any particular offender in case of a punishment which might deprive the community of the benefit of them      the multitude of offenders on any particular occasion iv on the part of the public at any particular conjuncture      the inclinations of the people for or against any quantity or mode of punishment      the inclinations of foreign powers v on the part of the law that is of the public for a continuance      the necessity of making small sacrifices in point of proportionality for the sake of simplicity xxviii there are some perhaps who at first sight may look upon the nicety employed in the adjustment of such rules as so much labour lost for gross ignorance they will say never troubles itself about laws and passion does not calculate but the evil of ignorance admits of cure∥ and as to the proposition that passion does not calculate this like most of these very general and oracular propositions is not true when matters of such importance as pain and pleasure are at stake and these in the highest degree the only matters in short that can be of importance who is there that does not calculate men calculate some with less exactness indeed some with more but all men calculate i would not say that even a madman does not calculate§ passion calculates more or less in every man in different men according to the warmth or coolness of    their dispositions according to the firmness or irritability of their minds according to the nature of the motives by which they are acted upon happily of all passions that is the most given to calculation from the excesses of which by reason of its strength constancy and universality society has most to apprehend i mean that which corresponds to the motive of pecuniary interest so that these niceties if such they are to be called have the best chance of being efficacious where efficacy is of the most importance chapter xvii of the properties to be given to a lot of punishment i it has been shown what the rules are which ought to be observed in adjusting the proportion between the punishment and the offence the properties to be given to a lot of punishment in every instance will of course be such as it stands in need of in order to be capable of being applied in conformity to those rules the quality will be regulated by the quantity ii the first of those rules we may remember was that the quantity of punishment must not be less in any case than what is sufficient to outweigh the profit of the offence since as often as it is less the whole lot unless by accident the deficiency should be supplied from some of the other sanctions is thrown away it is inefficacious the fifth was that the punishment ought in no case to be more than what is required by the several other rules since if it be all that is above that quantity is needless the fourth was that the punishment should be adjusted in such manner to each individual offence that every part of the mischief of that offence may have a penalty that is a tutelary motive to encounter it otherwise with respect to so much of the offence as has not a penalty to correspond to it it is as if there were no punishment in the case now to none of those rules can a lot of punishment be conformable unless for every variation in point of quantity in the mischief of the species of offence to which it is annexed such lot of punishment admits of a correspondent variation to prove this let the profit of the offence admit of a multitude of degrees suppose it then at any one of these degrees if the punishment be less than what is suitable to that degree it will be inefficacious it will be so much thrown away if it be more as far as the difference extends it will be needless it will therefore be thrown away also in that case the first property therefore that ought to be given to a lot of punishment is that of being variable in point of quantity in conformity to every variation which can take place in either the profit or mischief of the offence this property might perhaps be termed in a single word variability iii a second property intimately connected with the former may be styled equability it will avail but little that a mode of punishment proper in all other respects has been established by the legislator and that capable of being screwed up or let down to any degree that can be required if after all whatever degree of it be pitched upon that same degree shall be liable according to circumstances to produce a very heavy degree of pain or a very slight one or even none at all in this case as in the former if circumstances happen one way there will be a great deal of pain produced which will be needless if the other way there will be no pain at all applied or none that will be efficacious a punishment when liable to this irregularity may be styled an unequable one when free from it an equable one the quantity of pain produced by the punishment will it is true depend in a considerable degree upon circumstances distinct from the nature of the punishment itself upon the condition which the offender is in with respect to the circumstances by which a mans sensibility is liable to be influenced but the influence of these very circumstances will in many cases be reciprocally influenced by the nature of the punishment in other words the pain which is produced by any mode of punishment will be the joint effect of the punishment which is applied to him and the circumstances in which he is exposed to it now there are some punishments of which the effect may be liable to undergo a greater alteration by the influence of such foreign circumstances than the effect of other punishments is liable to undergo so far then as this is the case equability or unequability may be regarded as properties belonging to the punishment itself iv an example of a mode of punishment which is apt to be unequable is that of banishment when the locus a quo or place the party is banished from is some determinate place appointed by the law which perhaps the offender cares not whether he ever see or no this is also the case with pecuniary or quasipecuniary punishment when it respects some particular species of property which the offender may have been possessed of or not as it may happen all these punishments may be split down into parcels and measured out with the utmost nicety being divisible by time at least if by nothing else they are not therefore any of them defective in point of variability and yet in many cases this defect in    point of equability may make them as unfit for use as if they were v the third rule of proportion was that where two offences come in competition the punishment for the greater offence must be sufficient to induce a man to prefer the less now to be sufficient for this purpose it must be evidently and uniformly greater greater not in the eyes of some men only but of all men who are liable to be in a situation to take their choice between the two offences that is in effect of all mankind in other words the two punishments must be perfectly commensurable hence arises a third property which may be termed commensurability to wit with reference to other punishments† vi but punishments of different kinds are in very few instances uniformly greater one than another especially when the lowest degrees of that which is ordinarily the greater are compared with the highest degrees of that which is ordinarily the less in other words punishments of different kinds are in few instances uniformly commensurable the only certain and universal means of making two lots of punishment perfectly commensurable is by making the lesser an ingredient in the composition of the greater this may be done in either of two ways   by adding to the lesser punishment another quantity of punishment of the same kind   by adding to it another quantity of a different kind the latter mode is not less certain than the former for though one cannot always be absolutely sure that to the same person a given punishment will appear greater than another given punishment yet one may be always absolutely sure that any given punishment so as it does but come into contemplation will appear greater than none at all vii again punishment cannot act any farther than in as far as the idea of it and of its connection with the offence is present in the mind the idea of it if not present cannot act at all and then the punishment itself must be inefficacious now to be present it must be remembered and to be remembered it must have been learnt but of all punishments that can be imagined there are none of which the connection with the offence is either so easily learnt or so efficaciously remembered as those of which the idea is already in part associated with some part of the idea of the offence which is the case when the one and the other have some circumstance that belongs to them in common when this is the case with a punishment and an offence the punishment is said to bear an analogy to or to be characteristic of the offence‡ characteristicalness is therefore a fourth property which on this account ought to be given whenever it can conveniently be given to a lot of punishment viii it is obvious that the effect of this contrivance will be the greater as the analogy is the closer the analogy will be the closer the more material∥ that circumstance is which is in common now the most material circumstance that can belong to an offence and a punishment in common is the hurt or damage which they produce the closest analogy therefore that can subsist between an offence and the punishment annexed to it is that which subsists between them when the hurt or damage they produce is of the same nature in other words that which is constituted by the circumstance of identity in point of damage§ accordingly the mode of punishment which of all others bears the closest analogy to the offence is that which in the proper and exact sense of the word is termed retaliation retaliation therefore in the few cases in which it is practicable and not too expensive will have one great advantage over every other mode of punishment ix again it is the idea only of the punishment or in other words the apparent punishment that really acts upon the mind the punishment itself the real punishment acts not any farther than as giving rise to that idea it is the apparent punishment therefore that does all the service i mean in the way of example which is the principal object¶ it is the real punishment that does all    the mischief now the ordinary and obvious way of increasing the magnitude of the apparent punishment is by increasing the magnitude of the real the apparent magnitude however may to a certain degree be increased by other less expensive means whenever therefore at the same time that these less expensive means would have answered that purpose an additional real punishment is employed this additional real punishment is needless as to these less expensive means they consist   in the choice of a particular mode of punishment a punishment of a particular quality independent of the quantity†   in a particular set of solemnities distinct from the punishment itself and accompanying the execution of it‡ x a mode of punishment according as the appearance of it bears a greater proportion to the reality may be said to be the more exemplary now as to what concerns the choice of the punishment itself there is not any means by which a given quantity of punishment can be rendered more exemplary than by choosing it of such a sort as shall bear an analogy to the offence hence another reason for rendering the punishment analogous to or in other words characteristic of the offence xi punishment it is still to be remembered is in itself an expense it is in itself an evil∥ accordingly the fifth rule of proportion is not to produce more of it than what is demanded by the other rules but this is the case as often as any particle of pain is produced which contributes nothing to the effect proposed now if any mode of punishment is more apt than another to produce any such superfluous and needless pain it may be styled unfrugal if less it may be styled fiugal frugality therefore is a sixth property to be wished for in a mode of punishment xii the perfection of frugality in a mode of punishment is where not only no superfluous pain is produced on the part of the person punished but even that same operation by which he is subjected to pain is made to answer the purpose of producing pleasure on the part of some other person understand a profit or stock of pleasure of the selfregarding kind for a pleasure of the dissocial kind is produced almost of course on the part of all persons in whose breasts the offence has excited the sentiment of illwill now this is the case with pecuniary punishment as also with such punishments of the quasipecuniary kind as consist in the subtraction of such a species of possession as is tranferable from one party to another the pleasure indeed produced by such an operation is not in general equal to the pain§ it may however be so in particular circumstances as where he from whom the thing is taken is very rich and he to whom it is given very poor and be it what it will it is always so much more than can be produced by any other mode of punishment xiii the properties of exemplarity and frugality seem to pursue the same immediate end though by different courses both are occupied in diminishing the ratio of the real suffering to the apparent but exemplarity tends to increase the apparent frugality to reduce the real xiv thus much concerning the properties to be given to punishments in general to whatsoever offences they are to be applied those which follow are of less importance either as referring only to certain offences in particular or depending upon the influence of transitory and local circumstances in the first place the four distinct ends into which the main and general end of punishment is divisible§ may give rise to so many distinct properties according as any particular mode of punishment appears to be more particularly adapted to the compassing of one or of another of those ends to that of example as being the principal one a particular property has already been adapted there remain the three inferior ones of reformation disablement and compensation xv a seventh property therefore to be wished for in a mode of punishment is that of subserviency to reformation or reforming tendency now any punishment is subservient to reformation in proportion to its quantity since the greater the punishment a man has experienced the stronger is the tendency it has to create in him an aversion towards the offence which was the cause of it and that with respect to all offences alike but there are certain punishments which with regard to certain offences have a particular tendency to produce that effect by reason of their quality and where this is the case the punishments in question as applied to the offences in question will pro tanto have the advantage over all others this influence will depend upon the nature of the motive which is the cause of the offence the punishment most subservient to reformation will be the sort of punishment that is best calculated to invalidate the force of that motive xvi thus in offences originating from the motive    of illwill that punishment has the strongest reforming tendency which is best calculated to weaken the force of the irascible affections and more particularly in that sort of offence which consists in an obstinate refusal on the part of the offender to do something which is lawfully required of him† and in which the obstinacy is in great measure kept up by his resentment against those who have an interest in forcing him to compliance the most efficacious punishment seems to be that of confinement to spare diet xvii thus also in offences which owe their birth to the joint influence of indolence and pecuniary interest that punishment seems to possess the strongest reforming tendency which is best calculated to weaken the force of the former of those dispositions and more particularly in the cases of theft embezzlement and every species of defraudment the mode of punishment best adapted to this purpose seems in most cases to be that of penal labour xviii an eighth property to be given to a lot of punishment in certain cases is that of efficacy with respect to disablement or as it might be styled more briefly disabling efficacy this is a property which may be given in perfection to a lot of punishment and that with much greater certainty than the property of subserviency to reformation the inconvenience is that this property is apt in general to run counter to that of frugality there being in most cases no certain way of disabling a man from doing mischief without at the same time disabling him in a great measure from doing good either to himself or others the mischief therefore of the offence must be so great as to demand a very considerable lot of punishment for the purpose of example before it can warrant the application of a punishment equal to that which is necessary for the purpose of disablement xix the punishment of which the efficacy in this way is the greatest is evidently that of death in this case the efficacy of it is certain this accordingly is the punishment peculiarly adapted to those cases in which the name of the offender so long as he lives may be sufficient to keep a whole nation in a flame this will now and then be the case with competitors for the sovereignty and leaders of the factions in civil wars though when applied to offences of so questionable a nature in which the question concerning criminality turns more upon success than any thing else an infliction of this sort may seem to savour more of hostility than punishment at the same time this punishment it is evident is in an eminent degree unfrugal which forms one among the many objections there are against the use of it in any but very extraordinary cases‡ xx in ordinary cases the purpose may be sufficiently answered by one or other of the various kinds of confinement and banishment of which imprisonment is the most strict and efficacious for when an offence is so circumstanced that it cannot be committed but in a certain place as is the case for the most part with offences against the person all the law has to do in order to disable the offender from committing it is to prevent his being in that place in any of the offences which consist in the breach or the abuse of any kind of trust the purpose may be compassed at a still cheaper rate merely by forfeiture of the trust and in general in any of those offences which can only be committed under favour of some relation in which the offender stands with reference to any person or sets of persons merely by forfeiture of that relation that is of the right of continuing to reap the advantages belonging to it this is the case for instance with any of those offences which consist in an abuse of the privileges of marriage or of the liberty of carrying on any lucrative or other occupation xxi the ninth property is that of subserviency to compensation this property of punishment if it be vindictive compensation that is in view will with little variation be in proportion to the quantity if lucrative it is the peculiar and characteristic property of pecuniary punishment xxii in the rear of all these properties may be introduced that of popularity a very fleeting and indeterminate kind of property which may belong to a lot of punishment one moment and be lost by it the next by popularity is meant the property of being acceptable or rather not unacceptable to the bulk of the people among whom it is proposed to be established in strictness of speech it should rather be called absence of unpopularity for it cannot be expected in regard to such a matter as punishment that any species or lot of it should be positively acceptable and grateful to the people it is sufficient for the most part if they have no decided aversion to the thoughts of it now the property of characteristicalness above noticed seems to go as far towards conciliating the approbation of the people to a mode of punishment as any insomuch that popularity may be regarded as a kind of secondary quality depending upon that of characteristicalness∥    the use of inserting this property in the catalogue is chiefly to make it serve by way of memento to the legislator not to introduce without a cogent necessity any mode or lot of punishment towards which he happens to perceive any violent aversion entertained by the body of the people xxiii the effects of unpopularity in a mode of punishment are analogous to those of unfrugality the unnecessary pain which denominates a punishment unfrugal is most apt to be that which is produced on the part of the offender a portion of superfluous pain is in like manner produced when the punishment is unpopular but in this case it is produced on the part of persons altogether innocent the people at large this is already one mischief and another is the weakness which it is apt to introduce into the law when the people are satisfied with the law they voluntarily lend their assistance in the execution when they are dissatisfied they will naturally withhold that assistance it is well if they do not take a positive part in raising impediments this contributes greatly to the uncertainty of the punishment by which in the first instance the frequency of the offence receives an increase in process of time that deficiency as usual is apt to draw on an increase in magnitude an addition of a certain quantity which otherwise would be needless xxiv this property it is to be observed necessarily supposes on the part of the people some prejudice or other which it is the business of the legislator to endeavour to correct for if the aversion to the punishment in question were grounded on the principle of utility the punishment would be such as on other accounts ought not to be employed in which case its popularity or unpopularity would never be worth drawing into question it is properly therefore a property not so much of the punishment as of the people a disposition to entertain an unreasonable dislike against an object which merits their approbation it is the sign also of another property to wit indolence or weakness on the part of the legislator in suffering the people for the want of some instruction which ought to be and might be given them to quarrel with their own interest be this as it may so long as any such dissatisfaction subsists it behoves the legislator to have an eye to it as much as if it were ever so well grounded every nation is liable to have its prejudices and its caprices which it is the business of the legislator to look out for to study and to cure† xxv the eleventh and last of all the properties that seem to be requisite in a lot of punishment is that of remissibility‡ the general presumption is that when punishment is applied punishment is needful that it ought to be applied and therefore cannot want to be remitted but in very particular and those always very deplorable cases it may by accident happen otherwise it may happen that punishment shall have been inflicted where according to the intention of the law itself it ought not to have been inflicted that is where the sufferer is innocent of the offence at the time of the sentence passed he appeared guilty but since then accident has brought his innocence to light this being the case so much of the destined punishment as he has suffered already there is no help for the business is then to free him from as much as is yet to come but is there any yet to come there is very little chance of their being any unless it be so much as consists of chronical punishment such as imprisonment banishment penal labour and the like so much as consists in acute punishment to wit where the penal process itself is over presently however permanent the punishment may be in its effects may be considered as irremissible this is the case for example with whipping branding mutilation and capital punishment the most perfectly irremissible of any is capital punishment for though other punishments cannot when they are over be remitted they may be compensated for and although the unfortunate victim cannot be put into the same condition yet possibly means may be found of putting him into as good a condition as he would have been in if he had never suffered this may in general be done very effectually where the punishment has been no other than pecuniary there is another case in which the property of remissibility may appear to be of use this is where although the offender has been justly punished yet on account of some good behaviour of his displayed at a time subsequent to that of the commencement of the punishment it may seem expedient to remit a part of it but this it can scarcely be if the proportion of the punishment is in other respects what it ought to be the purpose of example is the more important object in comparison of that of reformation∥ it is not    very likely that less punishment should be required for the former purpose than for the latter for it must be rather an extraordinary case if a punishment which is sufficient to deter a man who has only thought of it for a few moments should not be sufficient to deter a man who has been feeling it all the time whatever then is required for the purpose of example must abide at all events it is not any reformation on the part of the offender that can warrant the remitting of any part of it if it could a man would have nothing to do but to reform immediately and so free himself from the greatest part of that punishment which was deemed necessary in order then to warrant the remitting of any part of a punishment upon this ground it must first be supposed that the punishment at first appointed was more than was necessary for the purpose of example and consequently that a part of it was needless upon the whole this indeed is apt enough to be the case under the imperfect systems that are as yet on foot and therefore during the continuance of those systems the property of remissibility may on this second ground likewise as well as on the former be deemed a useful one but this would not be the case in any newconstructed system in which the rules of proportion above laid down should be observed in such a system therefore the utility of this property would rest solely on the former ground xxvi upon taking a survey of the various possible modes of punishment it will appear evidently that there is not any one of them that possesses all the above properties in perfection to do the best that can be done in the way of punishment it will therefore be necessary upon most occasions to compound them and make them into complex lots each consisting of a number of different modes of punishment put together the nature and proportions of the constituent parts of each lot being different according to the nature of the offence which it is designed to combat xxvii it may not be amiss to bring together and exhibit in one view the eleven properties above established they are as follows— two of them are concerned in establishing a proper proportion between a single offence and its punishment viz     variability     equability one in establishing a proportion between more offences than one and more punishments than one viz     commensurability a fourth contributes to place the punishment in that situation in which alone it can be efficacious and at the same time to be bestowing on it the two farther properties of exemplarity and popularity viz     characteristicalness two others are concerned in excluding all useless punishment the one indirectly by heightening the efficacy of what is useful the other in a direct way viz     exemplarity     frugality three others contribute severally to the three inferior ends of punishment viz     subserviency to reformation     efficacy in disabling     subserviency to compensation another property tends to exclude a collateral mischief which a particular mode of punishment is liable accidentally to produce viz    0 popularity the remaining property tends to palliate a mischief which all punishment as such is liable accidentally to produce viz      remissibility the properties of commensurability characteristicalness exemplarity subserviency to reformation and efficacy in disabling are more particularly calculated to augment the profit which is to be made by punishment trugality subserviency to compensation popularity and remissibility to diminish the expense variability and equability are alike subservient to both those purposes xxviii we now come to take a general survey of the system of offences that is of such acts to which on account of the mischievous consequences they have a natural tendency to produce and in the view of putting a stop to those consequences it may be proper to annex a certain artificial consequence consisting of punishment to be inflicted on the authors of such acts according to the principles just established chapter xviii §   classes of offences i it is necessary at the outset to make a distinction between such acts as are or may be and such as ought to be offences any act    may be an offence which they whom the community are in the habit of obeying shall be pleased to make one that is any act which they shall be pleased to prohibit or to punish but upon the principle of utility such acts alone ought to be made offences as the good of the community requires should be made so ii the good of the community cannot require that any act should be made an offence which is not liable in some way or other to be detrimental to the community for in the case of such an act all punishment is groundless iii but if the whole assemblage of any number of individuals be considered as constituting an imaginary compound body a community or political state any act that is detrimental to any one or more of those members is as to so much of its effects detrimental to the state iv an act cannot be detrimental to a state but by being detrimental to some one or more of the individuals that compose it but these individuals may either be assignable† or unassignable v when there is any assignable individual to whom an offence is detrimental that person may either be a person other than the offender or the offender himself vi offences that are detrimental in the first instance to assignable persons other than the offender may be termed by one common name offences against individuals and of these may be composed the  st class of offences to contrast them with offences of the  d and  th classes it may also sometimes be convenient to style them private offences to contrast them at the same time with offences of the  d class they may be styled private extraregarding offences vii when it appears in general that there are persons to whom the act in question may be detrimental but such persons cannot be individually assigned the circle within which it appears that they may be found is either of less extent than that which comprises the whole community or not if of less the persons comprised within this lesser circle may be considered for this purpose as composing a body of themselves comprised within but distinguishable from the greater body of the whole community the circumstance that constitutes the union between the members of this lesser body may be either their residence within a particular place or in short any other less explicit principle of union which may serve to distinguish them from the remaining members of the community in the first case the act may be styled an offence against a neighbourhood in the second an offence against a particular class of persons in the community offences then against a class or neighbourhood may together constitute the  d class of offences‡ to    contrast them with private offences on the one hand and public on the other they may also be styled semipublic offences viii offences which in the first instance are detrimental to the offender himself and to no one else unless it be by their being detrimental to himself may serve to compose a third class to contrast them the better with offences of the first second and fourth classes all which are of a transitive nature they might be styled intransitive offences but still better selfregarding ix the fourth class may be composed of such acts as ought to be made offences on account of the distant mischief which they threaten to bring upon an unassignable indefinite multitude of the whole number of individuals of which the community is composed although no particular individual should appear more likely to be a sufferer by them than another these may be called public offences or offences against the state x a fifth class or appendix may be composed of such acts as according to the circumstances in which they are committed and more particularly according to the purposes to which they are applied may be detrimental in any one of the ways in which the act of one man can be detrimental to another these may be termed multiform or heterogeneous offences† offences that are in this case may be reduced to two great heads   offences by falsehood and   offences against trust    §   divisions and subdivisions xi let us see by what method these classes may be farther subdivided first then with regard to offences against individuals in the present period of existence a mans being and well being his happiness and his security in a word his pleasures and his immunity from pains are all dependant more or less in the first place upon his own person in the next place upon the exterior objects that surround him these objects are either things or other persons under one or other of these classes must evidently be comprised every sort of exterior object by means of which his interest can be affected if then by means of any offence a man should on any occasion become a sufferer it must be in one or other of two ways   absolutely to wit immediately in his own person in which case the offence may be said to be an offence against his person or   relatively by reason of some material relation which the beforementioned exterior objects may happen to bear in the way of causality see ch vii actions par    to his happiness now in as far as a man is in a way to derive either happiness or security from any object which belongs to the class of things such thing is said to be his property or at least he is said to have a property or an interest therein an offence therefore which tends to lessen the facility he might otherwise have of deriving happiness or security from an object which belongs to the class of things may be styled an offence against his property with regard to persons in as far as from objects of this class a man is in a way to derive happiness or security it is in virtue of their services in virtue of some services which by one sort of inducement or another they may be disposed to render him‡ now then take any man by way of example and the disposition whatever it may be which he may be in to render you service either has no other connection to give birth or support to it than the general one which binds him to the whole species or it has some other connection more particular in the latter case such a connection may be spoken of as constituting in your favour a kind of fictitious or incorporeal object of property which is styled your condition an offence therefore the tendency of which is to lessen the facility you might otherwise have of deriving happiness from the services of a person thus specially connected with you may be styled an offence against your condition in life or simply against your condition conditions in life must evidently be as various as the relations by which they are constituted this will be seen more particularly farther on in the mean time those of husband wife parent child master servant citizen of such or such a city naturalborn subject of such or such a country may answer the purpose of examples where there is no such particular connection or what comes to the same thing where the disposition whatever it may be which a man is in to render you service is not considered as depending upon such connection but simply upon the goodwill he bears to you in such case in order to express what chance you have of deriving a benefit from his services a kind of fictitious object of property is spoken of as being constituted in your favour and is called your reputation an offence therefore the tendency of which is to lessen the facility you might otherwise have had of deriving happiness or security from the services of persons at large whether connected with you or not by any special tie may be styled an offence against your reputation it appears therefore that if by any offence an individual becomes a sufferer it must be in one or other of the four points above mentioned viz his person his property his condition in life or his reputation these sources of distinction  00 then may serve to form so many subordinate divisions if any offences should be found to affect a person in more than one of these points at the same time such offences may respectively be put under so many separate divisions and such compound divisions may be subjoined to the preceding simple ones the several divisions simple and compound together which are hereinafter established stand as follows   offences against person   offences against reputation   offences against property   offences against condition   offences against person and property together   offences against person and reputation together xii next with regard to semipublic offences pain considered with reference to the time of the act from which it is liable to issue must it is evident be either present past or future in as far as it is either present or past it cannot be the result of any act which comes under the description of a semipublic offence for if it be present or past the individuals who experience or who have experienced it are assignable† there remains that sort of mischief which if it ever come to exist at all is as yet but future mischief thus circumstanced takes the name of danger‡ now then when by means of the act of any person a whole neighbourhood or other class of persons are exposed to danger this danger must either be intentional on his part or unintentional∥ if unintentional such danger when it is converted into actual mischief takes the name of a calamity offences productive of such danger may be styled semipublic offences operating through calamity or more briefly offences through calamity if the danger be intentional insomuch that it might be produced and might convert itself into actual mischief without the concurrence of any calamity it may be said to originate in mere delinquency offences then which without the concurrence of any calamity tend to produce such danger as disturbs the security of a local or other subordinate class of persons may be styled semipublic offences operating merely by delinquency or more briefly offences of mere delinquency xiii with regard to any farther subdivisions offences against calamity will depend upon the nature of the several calamities to which man and the several things that are of use to him stand exposed these will be considered in another place§ xiv semipublic offences of mere delinquency will follow the method of division applied to offences against individuals it will easily be conceived that whatever pain or inconvenience any given individual may be made to suffer to the danger of that pain or inconvenience may any number of individuals assignable or not assignable be exposed now there are four points or articles as we have seen in respect to which an individual may be made to suffer pain or inconvenience if then with respect to any one of them the connection of causes and effects is such that to the danger of suffering in that article a number of persons who individually are not assignable may by the delinquency of one person be exposed such article will form a ground of distinction on which a particular subdivision of semipublic offences may be established if with respect to any such article no such effect can take place that ground of distinction will lie for the present unoccupied ready however upon any change of circumstances or in the manner of viewing the subject to receive a correspondent subdivision of offences if ever it should seem necessary that any such offences should be created xv we come next to selfregarding offences or more properly to acts productive in the first instance of no other than a selfregarding mischief acts which if in any instance it be thought fit to constitute them offences will come under the denomination of offences against ones self this class will not for the present give us much trouble for it is evident that in whatever points a man is vulnerable by the hand of another in the same points may he be conceived to be vulnerable by his own whatever divisions therefore will serve for the first class the same will serve for this as to the questions what acts are productive of a mischief of this stamp and among such as are which it may and which it may not be worth while¶ to treat  0  upon the footing of offences these are points the latter of which at least is too unsettled and too open to controversy to be laid down with that degree of confidence which is implied in the exhibition of properties which are made use of as the groundwork of an arrangement properties for this purpose ought to be such as show themselves at first glance and appear to belong to the subject beyond dispute xvi public offences may be distributed under eleven divisions   offences against external security   offences against justice   offences against the preventive branch of the police   offences against the public force   offences against the positive increase of the national felicity   offences against the public wealth   offences against population   offences against the national wealth   offences against the sovereignty  0 offences against religion    offences against the national interest in general the way in which these several sorts of offences connect with one another and with the interest of the public that is of an unassignable multitude of the individuals of which that body is composed may be thus conceived xvii mischief by which the interest of the public as above defined may be affected must if produced at all be produced either by means of an influence exerted on the operations of government or by other means without the exertion of such influence† to begin with the latter case mischief be it what it will and let it happen to whom it will must be produced either by the unassisted powers of the agent in question or by the instrumentality of some other agents in the latter case these agents will be either persons or things persons again must be either not members of the community in question or members mischief produced by the instrumentality of persons may accordingly be produced by the instrumentality either of external or of internal adversaries now when it is produced by the agents own unassisted powers or by the instrumentality of internal adversaries or only by the instrumentality of things it is seldom that it can show itself in any other shape setting aside any influence it may exert on the operations of government than either that of an offence against assignable individuals or that of an offence against a local or other subordinate class of persons if there should be a way in which mischief can be produced by any of these means to individuals altogether unassignable it will scarcely be found conspicuous or important enough to occupy a title by itself it may accordingly be referred to the miscellaneous head of offences against the national interest in general‡ the only mischief of any considerable account which can be made to impend indiscriminately over the whole number of members in the community is that complex kind of mischief which results from a state of war and is produced by the instrumentality of external adversaries by their being provoked for instance or invited or encouraged to invasion in this way may a man very well bring down a mischief and that a very heavy one upon the whole community in general and that without taking a part in any of the injuries which came in consequence to be offered to particular individuals next with regard to the mischief which  0  an offence may bring upon the public by its influence on the operations of the government this it may occasion either   in a more immediate way by its influence on those operations themselves   in a more remote way by its influence on the instruments by or by the help of which those operations should be performed or   in a more remote way still by its influence on the sources from whence such instruments are to be derived first then as to the operations of government the tendency of these in as far as it is conformable to what on the principle of utility it ought to be is in every case either to avert mischief from the community or to make an addition to the sum of positive good now mischief we have seen must come either from external adversaries from internal adversaries or from calamities with regard to mischief from external adversaries there requires no further division as to mischief from internal adversaries the expedients employed for averting it may be distinguished into such as may be applied before the discovery of any mischievous design in particular and such as can not be employed but in consequence of the discovery of some such design the former of these are commonly referred to a branch which may be styled the preventive branch of the police the latter to that of justice† second as to the instruments which government whether in the averting of evil or in the producing of positive good can have to work with these must be either persons or things those which are destined to the particular function of guarding against mischief from adversaries in general but more particularly from external adversaries‡ may be distinguished from the rest under the collective appellation of the public military force and for conciseness sake the military force the rest may be characterised by the collective appellation of the public wealth thirdly with regard to the sources or funds from whence these instruments howsoever applied must be derived such of them as come under the denomination of persons must be taken out of the whole number of persons that are in the community that is out of the total population of the state so that the greater the population the greater may cæteris paribus be this branch of the public wealth and the less the less in like manner such as come under the denomination of things may be and most of them commonly are taken out of the sum total of those things which are the separate properties of the several members of the community the sum of which properties may be termed the national wealth∥ so that the  0  greater the national wealth the greater cæteris paribus may be this remaining branch of the public wealth and the less the less it is here to be observed that if the influence exerted on any occasion by an individual over the operations of the government be pernicious it must be in one or other of two ways   by causing or tending to cause operations not to be performed which ought to be performed in other words by impeding the operations of government or   by causing operations to be performed which ought not to be performed in other words by misdirecting them last to the total assemblage of the persons by whom the several political operations above mentioned come to be performed we set out with applying the collective appellation of the government among these persons there commonly is some one person or body of persons whose office it is to assign and distribute to the rest their several departments to determine the conduct to be pursued by each in the performance of the particular set of operations that belongs to him and even upon occasion to exercise his function in his stead where there is any such person or body of persons he or it may according as the turn of the phrase requires be termed the sovereign or the sovereignty now it is evident that to impede or misdirect the operations of the sovereign as here described may be to impede or misdirect the operations of the several departments of government as described above from this analysis by which the connection between the several abovementioned heads of offences is exhibited we may now collect a definition for each article by offences against external security we may understand such offences whereof the tendency is to bring upon the public a mischief resulting from the hostilities of foreign adversaries by offences against justices such offences whereof the tendency is to impede or misdirect the operations of that power which is employed in the business of guarding the public against the mischiefs resulting from the delinquency of internal adversaries as far as it is to be done by expedients which do not come to be applied in any case till after the discovery of some particular design of the sort of those which they are calculated to prevent by offences against the preventive branch of the police such offences whereof the tendency is to impede or misdirect the operations of that power which is employed in guarding against mischiefs resulting from the delinquency of internal adversaries by expedients that come to be applied beforehand or of that which is employed in guarding against the mischiefs that might be occasioned by physical calamities by offences against the public force such offences whereof the tendency is to impede or misdirect the operations of that power which is destined to guard the public from the mischiefs which may result from the hostility of foreign adversaries and in case of necessity in the capacity of ministers of justice from mischiefs of the number of those which result from the delinquency of internal adversaries by offences against the increase of the national felicity such offences whereof the tendency is to impede or misapply the operations of those powers that are employed in the conducting of various establishments which are calculated to make in so many different ways a positive addition to the stock of public happiness by offences against the public wealth such offences whereof the tendency is to diminish the amount or misdirect the application of the money and other articles of wealth which the government reserves as a fund out of which the stock of instruments employed in the service above mentioned may be kept up by offences against population such offences whereof the tendency is to diminish the numbers or impair the political value of the sum total of the members of the community by offences against the national wealth such offences whereof the tendency is to diminish the quantity or impair the value of the things which compose the separate properties or estates of the several members of the community xviii in this deduction it may be asked what place is left for religion this we shall see presently for combating the various kinds of offences above enumerated that is for combating all the offences those not excepted which we are now about considering which it is in mans nature to commit the state has two great engines punishment and reward punishment to be applied to all and upon all ordinary occasions reward to be applied to a few for particular purposes and upon extraordinary occasions but whether or no a man has done the act which renders him an object meet for punishment or reward the eyes of those whosoever they be to whom the management of these engines is entrusted cannot always see nor where it is punishment that is to be administered can their hands be always sure to reach him to supply these deficiencies in point of power it is thought necessary or at  0  least useful without which the truth of the doctrine would be nothing to the purpose to inculcate into the minds of the people the belief of the existence of a power applicable to the same purposes and not liable to the same deficiencies the power of a supreme invisible being to whom a disposition of contributing to the same ends to which the several institutions already mentioned are calculated to contribute must for this purpose be ascribed it is of course expected that this power will at one time or other be employed in the promoting of those ends and to keep up and strengthen this expectation among men is spoken of as being the employment of a kind of allegorical personage feigned as before for convenience of discourse and styled religion to diminish then or misapply the influence of religion is pro tanto to diminish or misapply what power the state has of combating with effect any of the before enumerated kinds of offences that is all kinds of offences whatsoever acts that appear to have this tendency may be styled offences against religion of these then may be composed the tenth division of the class of offences against the state† xix if there be any acts which appear liable to affect the state in any one or more of the above ways by operating in prejudice of the external security of the state or of its internal security of the public force of the increase of the national felicity of the public wealth of the national population of the national wealth of the sovereignty or of religion at the same time that it is not clear in which of all these ways they will affect it most nor but that according to contingencies they may affect it in one of these ways only or in another such acts may be collected together under a miscellaneous division by themselves and styled offences against the national interest in general of these then may be composed the eleventh and last division of the class of offences against the state xx we come now to class the fifth consisting of multiform offences these as has been already intimated are either offences by falsehood or offences concerning trust under the head of offences by falsehood may be comprehended   simple falsehoods   forgery   personation   perjury‡ let us observe in what particulars these four kinds of falsehood agree and in what they differ xxi offences by falsehood however diversified in other particulars have this in common that they consist in some abuse of the faculty of discourse or rather as we shall see hereafter of the faculty of influencing the sentiment of belief in other men∥ whether by discourse or otherwise the use of discourse is to influence belief and that in such manner as to give other men to understand that things are as they are really falsehoods of whatever kind they be agree in this that they give men to understand that things are otherwise than as in reality they are xxii personation forgery and perjury are each of them distinguished from other modes of uttering falsehood by certain special circumstances  0  when a falsehood is not accompanied by any of those circumstances it may be styled simple falsehood these circumstances are   the form in which the falsehood is uttered   the circumstance of its relating or not to the identity of the person of him who utters it   the solemnity of the occasion on which it is uttered the particular application of these distinctive characters may more commodiously be reserved for another place† xxiii we come now to the subdivisions of offences by falsehood these will bring us back into the regular track of analysis pursued without deviation through the four preceding classes by whatever means a mischief is brought about whether falsehood be or be not of the number the individuals liable to be affected by it must either be assignable or unassignable if assignable there are but four material articles in respect to which they can be affected to wit their persons their properties their reputations and their conditions in life the case is the same if though unassignable they are comprisable in any class subordinate to that which is composed of the whole number of members of the state if the falsehood tend to the detriment of the whole state it can only be by operating in one or other of the characters which every act that is an offence against the state must assume viz that of an offence against external security against justice against the preventive branch of the police against the public force against the increase of the national felicity against the public wealth against the national population against the national wealth against the sovereignty of the state or against its religion xxiv it is the common property then of the offences that belong to this division to run over the same ground that is occupied by those of the preceding classes but some of them as we shall see are apt on various occasions to drop or change the names which bring them under this division this is chiefly the case with regard to simple falsehoods others retain their names unchanged and even thereby supersede the names which would otherwise belong to the offences which they denominate this is chiefly the case with regard to personation forgery and perjury when this circumstance then the circumstance of falsehood intervenes in some cases the name which takes the lead is that which indicates the offence by its effect in other cases it is that which indicates the expedient or instrument as it were by the help of which the offence is committed falsehood take it by itself consider it as not being accompanied by any other material circumstances nor therefore productive of any material effects can never upon the principle of utility constitute any offence at all combined with other circumstances there is scarce any sort of pernicious effect which it may not be instrumental in producing it is therefore rather in compliance with the laws of language than in consideration of the nature of the things themselves that falsehoods are made separate mention of under the name and in the character of distinct offences all this would appear plain enough if it were now a time for entering into particulars but that is what cannot be done consistently with any principle of order or convenience until the inferior divisions of those other classes shall have been previously exhibited xxv we come now to offences against trust a trust is where there is any particular act which one party in the exercise of some power or some right‡ which is conferred on  0  him is bound to perform for the benefit of another or more fully thus a party is said to be invested with a trust when being invested with a power or with a right there is a certain behaviour which in the exercise of that power or of that right he is bound to maintain for the benefit of some other party in such case the party first mentioned is styled a trustee for the other party no name has ever yet been found for want of a name there seems to be no other resource than to give a new and more extensive sense to the word beneficiary or to say at length the party to be benefited  0  the trustee is also said to have a trust conferred or imposed upon him to be invested with a trust to have had a trust given him to execute to perform to discharge or to fulfil the party to be benefited is said to have a trust established or created in his favour and so on through a variety of other phrases xxvi now it may occur that a trust is oftentimes spoken of as a species of condition that a trust is also spoken of as a species of property and that a condition itself is also spoken of in the same light it may be thought therefore that in the first class the division of offences against condition should have been included under that of the offences against property and that at any rate so much of the fifth class now before us as contains offences against trust should have been included under one or other of those two divisions of the first class but upon examination it will appear that no one of these divisions could with convenience nor even perhaps with propriety have been included under either of the other two it will appear at the same time that there is an intimate connection subsisting amongst them all insomuch that of the lists of the offences to which they are respectively exposed any one may serve in great measure as a model for any other there are certain offences to which all trusts as such are exposed to all these offences every sort of condition will be found exposed at the same time that particular species of the offences against trust will upon their application to particular conditions receive different particular denominations it will appear also that of the two groups of offences into which the list of those against trust will be found naturally to divide itself there is one and but one to which property taken in its proper and more confined sense stands exposed and that these in their application to the subject of property will be found susceptible of distinct modifications to which the usage of language and the occasion there is for distinguishing them in point of treatment make it necessary to find names in the first place as there are or at least may be as we shall see conditions which are not trusts† so there are trusts of which the idea would not be readily and naturally understood to be included under the word condition add to which that of those conditions which do include a trust the greater number include other ingredients along with it so that the idea of a condition if on the one hand it stretches beyond the idea of a trust does on the other hand fall short of it of the several sorts of trusts by far the most important are those in which it is the public that stands in the relation of beneficiary now these trusts it should seem would hardly present themselves at first view upon the mention of the word condition at any rate what is more material the most important of the offences against these kinds of trust would not seem to be included under the denomination of offences against condition the offences which by this latter appellation would be brought to view would be such only as seemed to affect the interests of an individual of him for example who is considered as being invested with that condition but in offences against public trust it is the influence they have on the interests of the public that constitutes by much the most material part of their pernicious tendency the influence they have on the interests of any individual the only part of their influence which would be readily brought to view by the appellation of offences against condition is comparatively as nothing the word trust directs the attention at once to the interests of that party for whom the person in question is trustee which party upon the addition of the epithet public is immediately understood to be the body composed of the whole assemblage or an indefinite portion of the whole assemblage of the members of the state the idea presented by the words public trust is clear and unambiguous it is but an obscure and ambiguous garb that that idea could be expressed in by the words public  0  condition it appears therefore that the principal part of the offences included under the denomination of offences against trust could not commodiously at least have been included under the head of offences against condition it is evident enough that for the same reasons neither could they have been included under the head of offences against property it would have appeared preposterous and would have argued a total inattention to the leading principle of the whole work the principle of utility to have taken the most mischievous and alarming part of the offences to which the public stands exposed and forced them into the list of offences against the property of an individual of that individual to wit who in that case would be considered as having in him the property of that public trust which by the offences in question is affected nor would it have been less improper to have included conditions all of them under the head of property and thereby the whole catalogue of offences against condition under the catalogue of offences against property true it is that there are offences against condition which perhaps with equal propriety and without any change in their nature might be considered in the light of offences against property so extensive and so vague are the ideas that are wont to be annexed to both these objects but there are other offences which though with unquestionable propriety they might be referred to the head of offences against condition could not without the utmost violence done to language be forced under the appellation of offences against property property considered with respect to the proprietor implies invariably a benent and nothing else whatever obligations or burthens may by accident stand annexed to it yet in itself it can never be otherwise than beneficial on the part of the proprietor it is created not by any commands that are laid on him but by his being left free to do with such or such an article as he likes the obligations it is created by are in every instance laid upon other people on the other hand as to conditions there are several which are of a mixed nature importing as well a burthen to him who stands invested with them as a benefit which indeed is the case with those conditions which we hear most of under that name and which make the greatest figure there are even conditions which import nothing but burthen without any spark of benefit accordingly when between two parties there is such a relation that one of them stands in the place of an object of property with respect to the other the word property is applied only on one side but the word condition is applied alike to both it is but one of them that is said on that account to be possessed of a property but both of them are alike spoken of as being possessed of or being invested with a condition it is the master alone that is considered as possessing a property of which the servant in virtue of the services he is bound to render is the object but the servant not less than the master is spoken of as possessing or being invested with a condition the case is that if a mans condition is ever spoken of as constituting an article of his property it is in the same loose and indefinite sense of the word in which almost every other offence that could be imagined might be reckoned into the list of offences against property if the language indeed were in every instance in which it made use of the phrase object of property perspicuous enough to point out under that appellation the material and really existent body the person or the thing in which those acts terminate by the performance of which the property is said to be enjoyed if in short in the import given to the phrase object of property it made no other use of it than the putting it to signify what is now called a corporeal object this difficulty and this confusion would not have occurred but the import of the phrase object of property and in consequence the import of the word property has been made to take a much wider range in almost every case in which the law does any thing for a mans benefit or advantage men are apt to speak of it on some occasion or other as conferring on him a sort of property at the same time for one reason or other it has in several cases been not practicable or not agreeable to bring to view under the appellation of the object of his property the thing in which the acts by the performance of which the property is said to be enjoyed have their termination or the person in whom they have their commencement yet something which could be spoken of under that appellation was absolutely requisite†  0  the expedient then has been to create as it were on every occasion an ideal being and to assign to a man this ideal being for the object of his property and these are the sort of objects to which men of science in taking a view of the operations of the law in this behalf came in process of time to give the name of incorporeal now of these incorporeal objects of property the variety is prodigious fictitious entities of this kind have been fabricated almost out of every thing not conditions only that of a trustee included but even reputation have been of the number even liberty has been considered in this same point of view and though on so many occasions it is contrasted with property yet on other occasions being reckoned into the catalogue of possessions it seems to have been considered as a branch of property some of these applications of the words property object of property the last for instance are looked upon indeed as more figurative and less proper than the rest but since the truth is that where the immediate object is incorporeal they are all of them improper it is scarce practicable any where to draw the line notwithstanding all this latitude yet among the relations in virtue of which you are said to be possessed of a condition there is one at least which can scarcely by the most forced construction be said to render any other man or any other thing the object of your property this is the right of persevering in a certain course of action for instance in the exercising of a certain trade now to confer on you this right in a certain degree at least the law has nothing more to do than barely to abstain from forbidding you to exercise it were it to go farther and for the sake of enabling you to exercise your trade to the greater advantage prohibit others from exercising the like then indeed persons might be found who in a certain sense and by a construction rather forced than otherwise might be spoken of as being the objects of your property viz by being made to render you that sort of negative service which consists in the forbearing to do those acts which would lessen the profits of your trade but the ordinary right of exercising any such trade or profession as is not the object of a monopoly imports no such thing and yet by possessing this right a man is said to possess a condition and by forfeiting it to forfeit his condition after all it will be seen that there must be cases in which according to the usage of language the same offence may with more or less appearance of propriety be referred to the head of offences against condition or that of offences against property indifferently in such cases the following rule may serve for drawing the line wherever in virtue of your possessing a property or being the object of a property possessed by another you are characterized according to the usage of language by a particular name such as master servant husband wife steward agent attorney or the like there the word condition may be employed in exclusion of the word property and an offence in which in virtue of your bearing such relation you are concerned either in the capacity of an offender or in that of a party injured may be referred to the head of offences against condition and not to that of offences against property to give an example being bound in the capacity of landsteward to a certain person to oversee the repairing of a certain bridge you forbear to do so in this case as the services you are bound to render are of the number of those which give occasion to the party from whom they are due to be spoken of under a certain generical name viz that of land steward the offence of withholding them may be referred to the class of offences against condition but suppose that without being engaged in that general and miscellaneous course of service which with reference to a particular person would denominate you his landsteward you were bound whether by usage or by contract to render him that single sort of service which consists in the providing by yourself or by others for the repairing of that bridge in this case as there is not any such current denomination to which in virtue of your being bound to render this service you stand aggregated for that of architect mason or the like is not here in question the offence you commit by withholding such service cannot with propriety be referred to the class of offences against condition it can only therefore be referred to the class of offences against property by way of further distinction it may be   0 remarked that where a man in virtue of his being bound to render or of others being bound to render him certain services is spoken of as possessing a condition the assemblage of services is generally so considerable in point of duration as to constitute a course of considerable length so as on a variety of occasions to come to be varied and repeated and in most cases when the condition is not of a domestic nature sometimes for the benefit of one person sometimes for that of another services which come to be rendered to a particular person on a particular occasion especially if they be of short duration have seldom the effect of occasioning either party to be spoken of as being invested with a condition the particular occasional services which one man may come by contract or otherwise to be bound to render to another are innumerably various but the number of conditions which have names may be counted and are comparatively but few if after all notwithstanding the rule here given for separating conditions from articles of property any object should present itself which should appear to be referable with equal propriety to either head the inconvenience would not be material since in such cases as will be seen a little farther on whichever appellation were adopted the list of the offences to which the object stands exposed would be substantially the same these difficulties being cleared up we now proceed to exhibit an analytical view of the several possible offences against trust xxvii offences against trust may be distinguished in the first place into such as concern the existence of the trust in the hands of such or such a person and such as concern the exercise of the functions that belong to it first then with regard to such as relate to its existence an offence of this description like one of any other description if an offence it ought to be must to some person or other import a prejudice this prejudice may be distinguished into two branches   that which may fall on such persons as are or should be invested with the trust   that which may fall on the persons for whose sake it is or should be instituted or on other persons at large to begin with the former of these branches let any trust be conceived the consequences which it is in the nature of it to be productive of to the possessor must in in as far as they are material† be either of an advantageous or of a disadvantageous nature in as far as they are advantageous the trust may be considered as a benefit or privilege in as far as they are disadvantageous it may be considered as a burthen‡ to consider it then upon the footing of a benefit the trust either is of the number of those which ought by law to subsist∥ that is which the     legislator meant should be established or is not if it is the possession which at any time you may be deprived of with respect to it must at that time be either present or to come if to come in which case it may be regarded either as certain or as contingent the investitive event or event from whence your possession of it should have taken its commencement was either an event in the production of which the will of the offender should have been instrumental or any other event at large in the former case the offence may be termed wrongful noninvestment of trust in the latter case wrongful interception of trust if at the time of the offence whereby you are deprived of it you were already in possession of it the offence may be styled wrongful divestment of trust in any of these cases the effect of the offence is either to put somebody else into the trust or not if not it is wrongful divestment wrongful interception or wrongful divestment and nothing more if it be the person put in possession is either the wrong doer himself in which case it may be styled usurpation of trust or some other person in which case it may be styled wrongful investment or attribution of trust if the trust in question is not of the number of those which ought to subsist it depends upon the manner in which one man deprives another of it whether such deprivation shall or shall not be an offence and accordingly whether noninvestment interception or divestment shall or shall not be wrongful but the putting any body into it must at any rate be an offence and this offence may be either usurpation or wrongful investment as before in the next place to consider it upon the footing of a burthen in this point of view if no other interest than that of the persons liable to be invested with it were considered it is what ought not upon the principle of utility to subsist if it ought it can only be for the sake of the persons in whose favour it is established if then it ought not on any account to subsist neither noninvestment interception nor divestment can be wrongful with relation to the persons first mentioned whatever they may be on any other account in respect of the manner in which they happen to be performed for usurpation though not likely to be committed there is the same room as before so likewise is there for wrongful investment which in as far as the trust is considered as a burthen may be styled wrongful imposition of trust if the trust being still of the burthensome kind is of the number of those which ought to subsist any offence that can be committed with relation to the existence of it must consist either in causing a person to be in possession of it who ought not to be or in causing a person not to be in possession of it who ought to be in the former case it must be either usurpation or wrongful divestment as before in the latter case the person who is caused to be not in possession is either the wrong doer himself or some other if the wrong doer himself either at the time of the offence he was in possession of it or he was not if he was it may be termed wrongful abdication of trust if not wrongful detrectation† or nonassumption     if the person whom the offence causes not to be in the trust is any other person the offence must be either wrongful divestment wrongful noninvestment or wrongful interception as before in any of which cases to consider the trust in the light of a burthen it might also be styled wrongful exemption from trust lastly with regard to the prejudice which the persons for whose benefit the trust is instituted or any other persons whose interests may come to be affected by its existing or not existing in such or such hands are liable to sustain upon examination it will appear that by every sort of offence whereby the persons who are or should be in possession of it are liable in that respect to sustain a prejudice the persons now in question are also liable to sustain a prejudice the prejudice in this case is evidently of a very different nature from what it was of in the other but the same general names will be applicable in this case as in that if the beneficiaries or persons whose interests are at stake upon the exercise of the trust or any of them are liable to sustain a prejudice resulting from the quality of the person by whom it may be filled such prejudice must result from the one or the other of two causes   from a persons having the possession of it who ought not to have it or   from a persons not having it who ought whether it be a benefit or burthen to the possessor is a circumstance that to this purpose makes no difference in the first of these cases the offences from which the prejudice takes its rise are those of usurpation of trust wrongful attribution of trust and wrongful imposition of trust in the latter wrongful noninvestment of trust wrongful interception of trust wrongful divestment of trust wrongful abdication of trust and wrongful detrectation of trust so much for the offences which concern the existence or possession of a trust those which concern the exercise of the functions that belong to it may be thus conceived you are in possession of a trust the time then for your acting in it must on any given occasion neglecting for simplicitys sake the then present instant be either past or yet to come if past your conduct on that occasion must have been either conformable to the purposes for which the trust was instituted or unconformable if conformable there has been no mischief in the case if unconformable the fault has been either in yourself alone or in some other person or in both in as far as it has lain in yourself it has consisted either in your not doing something which you ought to do in which case it may be styled negative breach of trust or in your doing something which you ought not to do if in the doing something which you ought not to do the party to whom the prejudice has accrued is either the same for whose benefit the trust was instituted or some other party at large in the former of these cases the offence may be styled positive breach of trust in the other abuse of trust in as far as the fault lies in another person the offence on his part may be styled disturbance of trust supposing the time for your acting in the trust to be yet to come the effect of any act which tends to render your conduct unconformable to the purposes of the trust may be either to render it actually and eventually unconformable or to produce a chance of its being so in the former of these cases it can do no otherwise than take one or other of the shapes that have just been mentioned in the latter case the blame must lie either in yourself alone or in some other person or in both together as before if in another person the acts whereby he may tend to render your conduct unconformable must be exercised either on yourself or on other objects at large if exercised on yourself the influence they possess must either be such as operates immediately on your body or such as operates immediately on your mind in the latter case again the tendency of them must be to deprive you either of the knowledge or of the power or of the inclination† which would be necessary to your maintaining such a conduct as shall be conformable to the purposes in question if they be such of which the tendency is to deprive you of the inclination in question it must be by applying to your will the force of some seducing motive‡     lastly this motive must be either of the coercive or of the alluring kind in other words it must present itself either in the shape of a mischief or of an advantage now in none of all the cases that have been mentioned except the last does the offence receive any new denomination according to the event it is either a disturbance of trust or an abortive attempt to be guilty of that offence in this last it is termed bribery and it is that particular species of it which may be termed active bribery or bribegiving in this case to consider the matter on your part either you accept of the bribe or you do not if not and you do not afterwards commit or go about to commit either a breach or an abuse of trust there is no offence on your part in the case if you do accept it whether you eventually do or do not commit the breach or the abuse which it is the bribegivers intention you should commit you at any rate commit an offence which is also termed bribery and which for distinction sake may be termed passive bribery or bribetaking as to any farther distinctions they will depend upon the nature of the particular sort of trust in question and therefore belong not to the present place and thus we have thirteen subdivisions of offences against trust viz   wrongful noninvestment of trust   wrongful interception of trust   wrongful divestment of trust   usurpation of trust   wrongful investment or attribution of trust   wrongful abdication of trust   wrongful detrectation of trust   wrongful imposition of trust   negative breach of trust  0 positive breach of trust    abuse of trust    disturbance of trust    bribery xxviii from what has been said it appears that there cannot be any other offences on the part of a trustee by which a beneficiary can receive on any particular occasion any assignable specific prejudice one sort of acts however there are by which a trustee may be put in some danger of receiving a prejudice although neither the nature of the prejudice nor the occasion on which he is in danger of receiving it should be assignable these can be no other than such acts whatever they may be as dispose the trustee to be acted upon by a given bribe with greater effect than any with which he could otherwise be acted upon or in other words which place him in such circumstances as have a tendency to increase the quantum of his sensibility to the action of any motive of the sort in question† of these acts there seem to be no others that will admit of a description applicable to all places and times alike than acts of prodigality on the part of the trustee but in acts of this nature the prejudice to the beneficiary is contingent only and unliquidated while the prejudice to the trustee himself is certain and liquidated if therefore on any occasion it should be found advisable to treat it on the footing of an offence it will find its place more naturally in the class of selfregarding ones xxix as to the subdivisions of offences against trust these are perfectly analogous to those of offences by falsehood the trust may be private semipublic or public it may concern property person reputation or condition or any two or more of those articles at a time as will be more particularly explained in another place here too the offence in running over the ground occupied by the three prior classes will in some instances change its name while in others it will not xxx lastly if it be asked what sort of relation there subsists between falsehoods on one hand and offences concerning trust on the other hand the answer is they are altogether disparate falsehood is a circumstance that may enter into the composition of any sort of offence those concerning trust as well as any other in some as an accidental in others as an essential instrument breach or abuse of trust are circumstances which in the character of accidental concomitants may enter into the composition of any other offences those against falsehood included besides those to which they respectively give name genera of class i xxxi returning now to class the first let us pursue the distribution a step farther and branch out the several divisions of that class as above exhibited into their respective genera that is into such minuter divisions as are capable of being characterized by denominations of which a great part are already current among the people‡ in this place     the analysis must stop to apply it in the same regular form to any of the other classes seems scarcely practicable to semipublic as also to public offences on account of the interference of local circumstances to selfregarding ones on account of the necessity it would create of deciding prematurely upon points which may appear liable to controversy to offences by falsehood and offences against trust on account of the dependence there is between this class and the three former what remains to be done in this way with reference to these four classes will require discussion and will therefore be introduced with more propriety in the body of the work than in a preliminary part of which the business is only to draw outlines xxxii an act by which the happiness of an individual is disturbed is either simple in its effects or complex it may be styled simple in its effects when it affects him in one only of the articles or points in which his interest as we have seen is liable to be affected complex when it affects him in several of those points at once such as are simple in their effects must of course be first considered xxxiii in a simple way that is in one way at a time a mans happiness is liable to be disturbed either   by actions referring to his own person itself or   by actions referring to such external objects on which his happiness is more or less dependent as to his own person it is composed of two different parts or reputed parts his body and his mind acts which exert a pernicious influence on his person whether it be on the corporeal or on the mental part of it will operate thereon either immediately and without affecting his will or mediately through the intervention of that faculty viz by means of the influence which they cause his will to exercise over his body if with the intervention of his will it must be by mental coercion that is by causing him to will to maintain and thence actually to maintain a certain conduct which it is disagreeable or in any other way pernicious to him to maintain this conduct may either be positive or negative when positive the coercion is styled compulsion or constraint when negative restraint now the way in which the coercion is disagreeable to him may be by producing either pain of body or only pain of mind if pain of body is produced by it the offence will come as well under this as under other denominations which we shall come to presently moreover the conduct which a man by means of the coercion is forced to maintain will be determined either specifically and originally by the determination of the particular acts themselves which he is forced to perform or to abstain from or generally and incidentally by means of his being forced to be or not to be in such or such a place but if he is prevented from being in one place he is confined thereby to another for the whole surface of the earth like the surface of any greater or lesser body may be conceived to be divided into two as well as into any other number of parts or spots if the spot then which he is confined to be smaller than the spot which he is excluded from his condition may be called confinement if larger banishment† whether an act the effect of which is to exert a pernicious influence on the person of him who suffers by it operates with or without the intervention of an act of his will the mischief it produces will either be mortal or not mortal if not mortal it will either be reparable that is temporary or irreparable that is perpetual if reparable the mischievous act may be termed a simple corporal injury if irreparable an irreparable corporal injury lastly a pain that a man experiences in his mind will either be a pain of actual sufferance or a pain of apprehension if a pain of apprehension either the offender himself is represented as intending to bear a part in the production of it or he is not in the former case the offence may be styled menacement in the latter case as also where the pain is a pain of actual sufferance a simple mental injury and thus we have nine genera or kinds of personal injuries which when ranged in the order most commodious for examination will stand as follows viz   simple corporal injuries   irreparable corporal injuries   simple injurious restrainment   simple injurious compulsion‡   wrongful confinement   wrongful banishment   wrongful homicide       wrongful menacement   simple mental injuries† xxxiv we come now to offences against reputation merely these require but few distinctions in point of reputation there is but one way of suffering which is by losing a portion of the goodwill of others now in respect of the goodwill which others bear you you may be a loser in either of two ways   by the manner in which you are thought to behave yourself and   by the manner in which others behave or are thought to behave towards you to cause people to think that you yourself have so behaved as to have been guilty of any of those acts which cause a man to possess less than he did before of the goodwill of the community is what may be styled defamation but such is the constitution of human nature and such the force of prejudice that a man merely by manifesting his own want of goodwill towards you though ever so unjust in itself and ever so unlawfully expressed may in a manner force others to withdraw from you a part of theirs when he does this by words or by such actions as have no other effect than in as far as they stand in the place of words the offence may     be styled vilification when it is done by such actions as besides their having this effect are injuries to the person the offence may be styled a personal insult if it has got the length of reaching the body a corporal insult if it stopt short before it reached that length it may be styled insulting menacement and thus we have two genera or kinds of offences against reputation merely to wit   defamation and   vilification or revilement as to corporal insults and insulting menacement they belong to the compound title of offences against person and reputation both together xxxv if the property of one man suffers by the delinquency of another such property either was in trust with the offender or it was not if it was in trust the offence is a breach of trust and of whatever nature it may be in other respects may be styled dissipation in breach of trust or dissipation of property in trust this is a particular case the opposite one is the more common in such case the several ways in which property may by possibility become the object of an offence may be thus conceived offences against property of whatever kind it be may be distinguished as hath been already intimated† into such as concern the legal possession of it or right to it and such as concern only the enjoyment of it or what is the same thing the exercise of that right under the former of these heads come as hath been already intimated† the several offences of wrongful noncollation or noninvestment wrongful interception wrongful ablation or divestment usurpation and wrongful attribution when in the commission of any of these offences a falsehood has served as an instrument and that as it is commonly called a wilful or as it might more properly be termed an advised‡ one the epithet fraudulent may be prefixed to the name of the offence or substituted in the room of the word wrongful the circumstance of fraudulency then may serve to characterize a particular species comprisable under each of those generic heads in like manner the circumstance of force of which more a little farther on may serve to characterize another with respect to wrongful interception in particular the collative event by which the title to the thing in question should have accrued to you and for want of which such title is through the delinquency of the offender as it were intercepted is either an act of his own expressing it as his will that you should be considered by the law as the person who is legally in possession of it or it is any other event at large in the former case if the thing of which you should have been put into possession is a sum of money to a certain amount the offence is that which has received the name of insolvency which branch of delinquency in consideration of the importance and extent of it may be treated on the footing of a distinct genus of itself∥     next with regard to such of the offences against property as concern only the enjoys ment of the object in question this object must be either a service or set of services which should have been rendered by some person or else an article belonging to the class of things in the former case the offence may be styled wrongful withholding of services† in the latter case it may admit of farther modifications which may be thus conceived when any object which you have had the physical occupation or enjoyment of ceases in any degree in consequence of the act of another man and without any change made in so much of that power as depends upon the intrinsic physical condition of your person to be subject to that power this cessation is either owing to change in the intrinsic condition of the thing itself or in its exterior situation with respect to you that is to its being situated out of your reach in the former case the nature of the change is either such as to put it out of your power to make any use of it at all in which case the thing is said to be destroyed and the offence whereby it is so treated may be termed wrongful destruction or such only as to render the uses it is capable of being put to of less value than before in which case it is said to be damaged or to have sustained damage and the offence may be termed wrongful endamagement moreover in as far as the value which a thing is of to you is considered as being liable to be in some degree impaired by any act on the part of any other person exercised upon that thing although on a given occasion no perceptible damage should ensue the exercise of any such act is commonly treated on the footing of an offence which may be termed wrongful using or occupation if the cause of the things failing in its capacity of being of use to you lies in the exterior situation of it with relation to you the offence may be styled wrongful detainment or detention‡ wrongful detainment during any given period of time may either be accompanied with the intention of detaining the thing for ever that is for an indefinite time or not if it be and if it be accompanied at the same time with the intention of not being amenable to law for what is done it seems to answer to the idea commonly annexed to the word embezzlement an offence which is commonly accompanied with breach of trust∥ in the case of wrongful occupation the physical faculty of occupying may have been obtained with or without the assistance or consent of the proprietor or other person appearing to have a right to afford such assistance or consent if without such assistance or consent and the occupation be accompanied with the intention of detaining the thing for ever together with the intention of not being amenable to law for what is done the offence seems to answer to the idea commonly annexed to the word theft or stealing if in the same circumstances a force is put upon the body of any person who uses or appears to be disposed to use any endeavours to prevent the act this seems to be one of the cases in which the offence is generally understood to come under the name of robbery if the physical faculty in question was obtained with the assistance or consent of a     proprietor or other person above spoken of and still the occupation of the thing is an offence it may have been either because the assistance or consent was not fairly or because it was not freely obtained if not fairly obtained it was obtained by falsehood which if advised is in such a case termed fraud and the offence if accompanied with the intention of not being amenable to law may be termed fraudulent obtainment or defraudment if not freely obtained it was obtained by force to wit either by a force put upon the body which has been already mentioned or by a force put upon the mind if by a force put upon the mind or in other words by the application of coercive motives† it must be by producing the apprehension of some evil which evil if the act is an offence must be some evil to which on the occasion in question the one person has no right to expose the other this is one case in which if the offence be accompanied with the intention of detaining the thing for ever whether it be or be not accompanied with the intention of not being amenable to law it seems to agree with the idea of what is commonly meant by extortion now the part a man takes in exposing another to the evil in question must be either a positive or a negative part in the former case again the evil must either be present or distant in the case then where the assistance or consent is obtained by a force put upon the body or where if by a force put upon the mind the part taken in the exposing a man to the apprehension of the evil is positive the evil present and the object of it his person and if at any rate the extortion thus applied be accompanied with the intention of not being amenable to law it seems to agree with the remaining case of what goes under the name of robbery as to dissipation in breach of trust this when productive of a pecuniary profit to the trustee seems to be one species of what is commonly meant by peculation another and the only remaining one seems to consist in acts of occupation exercised by the trustee upon the things which are the objects of the fiduciary property for his own benefit and to the damage of the beneficiary as to robbery this offence by the manner in which the assistance or consent is obtained becomes an offence against property and person at the same time dissipation in breach of trust and peculation may perhaps be more commodiously treated of under the head of offences against trust‡ after these exceptions we have eighteen genera or principal kinds of offences against property which when ranged in the order most commodious for examination may stand as follows viz   wrongful noninvestment of property   wrongful interception of property   wrongful divestment of property   usurpation of property   wrongful investment of property   wrongful withholding of services   wrongful destruction or endamagement   insolvency   wrongful obtainment of services  0 wrongful imposition of expense    wrongful imposition of services    wrongful occupation    wrongful detention    wrongful disturbance of proprietary rights    theft    embezzlement    defraudment    extortion∥ we proceed now to consider offences which are complex in their effects regularly indeed we should come to offences against condition but it will be more convenient to speak first of offences by which a mans interest is affected in two of the preceding points at once xxxvi first then with regard to offences which affect person and reputation together when any man by a mode of treatment which affects the person injures the reputation of another his end and purpose must have been either his own immediate pleasure or that sort of reflected pleasure which in certain circumstances may be reaped from the suffering of another now the only immediate pleasure worth regarding which any one can reap from the person of another and which at the same time is capable of affecting the reputation of the latter is the pleasure of the sexual appetite§ this pleasure then if reaped at all     must have been reaped either against the consent of the party or with consent if with consent the consent must have been obtained either freely and fairly both or freely but not fairly or else not even freely in which case the fairness is out of the question if the consent be altogether wanting the offence is called rape if not fairly obtained seduction simply if not freely it may be called forcible seduction in any case either the offence has gone the length of consummation or has stopt short of that period if it has gone that length it takes one or other of the names just mentioned if not it may be included alike in all cases under the denomination of a simple lascivious injury lastly to take the case where a man injuring you in your reputation by proceedings that regard your person does it for the sake of that sort of pleasure which will sometimes result from the contemplation of anothers pain under these circumstances either the offence has actually gone the length of a corporal injury or it has rested in menacement in the first case it may be styled a corporal insult in the other it may come under the name of insulting menacement and thus we have six genera or kinds of offences against person and reputation together which when ranged in the order most commodious for consideration will stand thus   corporal insults   insulting menacement   seduction   rape   forcible seduction   simple lascivious injuries xxxvii secondly with respect to those which affect person and property together that a force put upon the person of a man may be among the means by which the title to property may be unlawfully taken away or acquired has been already stated† a force of this sort then is a circumstance which may accompany the offences of wrongful interception wrongful divestment usurpation and wrongful investment but in these cases the intervention of this circumstance does not happen to have given any new denomination to the offence‡ in all or any of these cases however by prefixing the epithet forcible we may have so many names of offences which may either be considered as constituting so many species of the genera belonging to the division of offences against property or as so many genera belonging to the division now before us among the offences that concern the enjoyment of the thing the case is the same with wrongful destruction and wrongful endamagement as also with wrongful occupation and wrongful detainment as to the offence of wrongful occupation it is only in the case where the thing occupied belongs to the class of immoveables that when accompanied by the kind of force in question has obtained a particular name which is in common use in this case it is called forcible entry forcible detainment as applied also to immoveables but only to immoveables has obtained among lawyers at least the name of forcible detainer∥ and thus we may distinguish ten genera or kinds of offences against person and property together which omitting for conciseness sake the epithet wrongful will stand thus   forcible interception of property   forcible divestment of property   forcible usurpation   forcible investment   forcible destruction or endamagement   forcible occupation of moveables   forcible entry   forcible detainment of moveables   forcible detainment of immoveables  0 robbery§ xxxviii we come now to offences against condition a mans condition or station in life is constituted by the legal relation he bears to the persons who are about him that is as we have already had occasion to show¶ by duties which by being imposed on one side give birth to rights or powers on the other these relations it is evident may be almost infinitely diversified some means however may be found of circumscribing the field within which the varieties of them are displayed in the first place they must either be such as are capable of displaying themselves within the circle of a private family or such as require a larger space the conditions constituted by the former sort of relations may be styled domestic those constituted by the latter civil xxxix as to domestic conditions the legal relations by which they are constituted may be distinguished into   such as are superadded to relations purely natural and   such as   0 without any such natural basis subsist purely by institution by relations purely natural i mean those which may be said to subsist between certain persons in virtue of the concern which they themselves or certain other persons have had in the process which is necessary to the continuance of the species these relations may be distinguished in the first place into contiguous and uncontiguous the uncontiguous subsist through the intervention of such as are contiguous the contiguous may be distinguished in the first place into connubial and postconnubial those which may be termed connubial are two   that which the male bears towards the female   that which the female bears to the male† the postconnubial are either productive or derivative the productive is that which the male and female above mentioned bear each of them towards the children who are the immediate fruit of their union this is termed the relation of parentality now as the parents must be so the children may be of different sexes accordingly the relation of parentality may be distinguished into four species   that which a father bears to his son this is termed paternity   that which a father bears to his daughter this also is termed paternity   that which a mother bears to her son this is called maternity   that which a mother bears to her daughter this also is termed maternity uncontiguous natural relations may be distinguished into immediate and remote such as are immediate are what one person bears to another in consequence of their bearing each of them one simple relation to some third person thus the paternal grandfather is related to the paternal grandson by means of the two different relations of different kinds which together they bear to the father the brother on the fathers side to the brother by means of the two relations of the same kind which together they bear to the father in the same manner we might proceed to find places in the system for the infinitelydiversified relations which result from the combinations that may be formed by mixing together the several sorts of relationships by ascent relationships by descent collateral relationships and relationships by affinity which latter when the union between the two parties through whom the affinity takes place is sanctioned by matrimonial solemnities are termed relationships by marriage but this as it would be a most intricate and tedious task so happily is it for the present purpose an unnecessary one the only natural relations to which it will be necessary to pay any particular attention are those which when sanctioned by law give birth to the conditions of husband and wife the two relations comprised under the head of parentality and the corresponding relations comprised under the head of filiality or filiation what then are the relations of a legal kind which can be superinduced upon the abovementioned natural relations they must be such as it is the nature of law to give birth to and establish but the relations which subsist purely by institution exhaust as we shall see the whole stock of relationships which it is in the nature of the law to give birth to and establish the relations then which can be superinduced upon those which are purely natural cannot be in themselves any other than what are of the number of those which subsist purely by institution so that all the difference there can be between a legal relation of the one sort and a legal relation of the other sort is that in the former case the circumstance which gave birth to the natural relation serves as a mark to indicate where the legal relation is to fix in the latter case the place where the legal relation is to attach is determined not by that circumstance but by some other from these considerations it will appear manifestly enough that for treating of the several sorts of conditions as well natural as purely conventional in the most commodious order it will be necessary to give the precedence to the latter proceeding throughout upon the same principle we shall all along give the priority not to those which are first by nature but to those which are most simple in point of description     there is no other way of avoiding perpetual anticipations and repetitions xl we come now to consider the domestic or family relations which are purely of legal institution it is to these in effect that both kinds of domestic conditions considered as the work of law are indebted for their origin when the law no matter for what purpose takes upon itself to operate in a matter in which it has not operated before it can only be by imposing obligation now when a legal obligation is imposed on any man there are but two ways in which it can in the first instance be enforced the one is by giving the power of enforcing it to the party in whose favour it is imposed the other is by reserving that power to certain third persons who in virtue of their possessing it are styled ministers of justice in the first case the party favoured is said to possess not only a right as against the party obliged but also a power over him in the second case a right only uncorroborated by power in the first case the party favoured may be styled a superior and as they are both members of the same family a domestic superior with reference to the party obliged who in the same case may be styled a domestic inferior with reference to the party favoured now in point of possibility it is evident that domestic conditions or a kind of fictitious possession analogous to domestic conditions might have been looked upon as constituted as well by rights alone without powers on either side as by powers but in point of utility† it does not seem expedient and in point of fact probably owing to the invariable perception which men must have had of the inexpediency no such conditions seem ever to have been constituted by such feeble bands of the legal relationships then which are capable of being made to subsist within the circle of a family there remain those only in which the obligation is enforced by power now then wherever any such power is conferred the end or purpose for which it was conferred unless the legislator can be supposed to act without a motive must have been the producing of a benefit to somebody in other words it must have been conferred for the sake of somebody the person then for whose sake it is conferred must either be one of the two parties just mentioned or a third party if one of these two it must be either the superior or the inferior if the superior such superior is commonly called a master and the inferior is termed his servant and the     power may be termed a beneficial one if it be for the sake of the inferior that the power is established the superior is termed a guardian and the inferior his ward and the power being thereby coupled with a trust may be termed a fiduciary one if for the sake of a third party the superior may be termed a superintendent and the inferior his subordinate this third party will either be an assignable individual or set of individuals or a set of unassignable individuals in this latter case the trust is either a public or a semipublic one and the condition which it constitutes is not of the domestic but of the civil kind in the former case this third party or principal as he may be termed either has a beneficial power over the superintendant or he has not if he has the superintendant is his servant and consequently so also is the subordinate if not the superintendant is the master of the subordinate and all the advantage which the principal has over his superintendant is that of possessing a set of rights uncorroborated by power and therefore as we have seen not fit to constitute a condition of the domestic kind but be the condition what it may which is constituted by these rights of what nature can the obligations be to which the superintendant is capable of being subjected by means of them they are neither more nor less than those which a man is capable of being subjected to by powers it follows therefore that the functions of a principal and his superintendant coincide with those of a master and his servant and consequently that the offences relative to the two former conditions will coincide with the offences relative to the two latter xli offences to which the condition of a master like any other kind of condition is exposed may as hath been already intimated† be distinguished into such as concern the existence of the condition itself and such as concern the performance of the functions of it while subsisting first then with regard to such as affect its existence it is obvious enough that the services of one man may be a benefit to another the condition of a master may therefore be a beneficial one it stands exposed therefore to the offences of wrongful noninvestment wrongful interception usurpation wrongful investment and wrongful divestment but how should it stand exposed to the offences of wrongful abdication wrongful detrectation and wrongful imposition certainly it cannot of itself for services when a man has the power of exacting them or not as he thinks fit can never be a burthen but if to the powers by which the condition of a master is constituted the law thinks fit to annex any obligation on the part of the master for instance that of affording maintenance or giving wages to the servant or paying money to any body else it is evident that in virtue of such obligation the condition may become a burthen in this case however the condition possessed by the master will not properly speaking be the pure and simple condition of a master it will be a kind of complex object resolvable into the beneficial condition of a master and the burthensome obligation which is annexed to it still however if the nature of the obligation lies within a narrow compass and does not in the manner of that which constitutes a trust interfere with the exercise of those powers by which the condition of the superior is constituted the latter notwithstanding this foreign mixture will still retain the name of mastership‡ in this case therefore but not otherwise the condition of a master may stand exposed to the offences of wrongful abdication wrongful detrectation and wrongful imposition next as to the behaviour of persons with reference to this condition while considered as subsisting in virtue of its being a benefit it is exposed to disturbance this disturbance will either be the offence of a stranger or the offence of the servant himself where it is the offence of a stranger and is committed by taking the person of the servant in circumstances in which the taking of an object belonging to the class of things would be an act of theft or what is scarcely worth distinguishing from theft an act of embezzlement it may be termed servantstealing where it is the offence of the servant himself it is styled breach of duty now the most flagrant species of breach of duty and that which includes indeed every other is that which consists in the servants withdrawing himself from the place in which the duty should be performed this species of breach of duty is termed elopement again in virtue of the power belonging to this condition it is liable on the part of the master to abuse but this power is not coupled with a trust the condition of a master is therefore not exposed to any offence which is analogous to breach of trust lastly on account of its being exposed to abuse it may be conceived to stand in point of possibility exposed to bribery but considering how few and how insignificant the persons are who are liable to be subject to the power here in question this is an offence which on account of the want of temptation there will seldom     be any example of in practice we may therefore reckon thirteen sorts of offences to which the condition of a master is exposed viz   wrongful noninvestment of mastership   wrongful interception of mastership   wrongful divestment of mastership   usurpation of mastership   wrongful investment of mastership   wrongful abdication of mastership   wrongful detrectation of mastership   wrongful imposition of mastership   abuse of mastership  0 disturbance of mastership    breach of duty in servants    elopement of servants    servantstealing xlii as to the power by which the condition of a master is constituted this may be either limited or unlimited when it is altogether unlimited the condition of the servant is styled pure slavery but as the rules of language are as far as can be conceived from being steady on this head the term slavery is commonly made use of wherever the limitations prescribed to the power of the master are looked upon as inconsiderable whenever any such limitation is prescribed a kind of fictitious entity is thereby created and in quality of an incorporeal object of possession is bestowed upon the servant this object is of the class of those which are called rights and in the present case is termed in a more particular manner a liberty and sometimes a privilege an immunity or an exemption now those limitations on the one hand and these liberties on the other may it is evident be as various as the acts positive or negative which the master may or may not have the power of obliging the servant to submit to or to perform correspondent then to the infinitude of these liberties is the infinitude of the modifications which the condition of mastership or as it is more common to say in such a case that of servitude admits of these modifications it is evident may in different countries be infinitely diversified in different countries therefore the offences characterized by the above names will if specifically considered admit of very different descriptions if there be a spot upon the earth so wretched as to exhibit the spectacle of pure and absolutely unlimited slavery on that spot there will be no such thing as any abuse of mastership which means neither more nor less than that no abuse of mastership will there be treated on the footing of an offence as to the question whether any and what modes of servitude ought to be established or kept on foot this is a question the solution of which belongs to the civil branch of the art of legislation xliii next with regard to the offences that may concern the condition of a servant it might seem at first sight that a condition of this kind could not have a spark of benefit belonging to it that it could not be attended with any other consequences than such as rendered it a mere burthen but a burthen itself may be a benefit in comparison of a greater burthen conceive a mans situation then to be such that he must at any rate be in a state of pure slavery still may it be material to him and highly material who the person is whom he has for his master a state of slavery then under one master may be a beneficial state to him in comparison with a state of slavery under another master the condition of a servant then is exposed to the several offences to which a condition in virtue of its being a beneficial one is exposed more than this where the power of the master is limited and the limitations annexed to it and thence the liberties of the servant are considerable the servitude may even be positively eligible for amongst those limitations may be such as are sufficient to enable the servant to possess property of his own being capable then of possessing property of his own he may be capable of receiving it from his master in short he may receive wages or other emoluments from his master and the benefit resulting from these wages may be so considerable as to outweigh the burthen of the servitude and by that means render that condition more beneficial upon the whole and more eligible than that of one who is not in any respect under the controul of any such person as a master accordingly by these means the condition of the servant may be so eligible that his entrance into it and his continuance in it may have been altogether the result of his own choice that the nature of the two conditions may be the more clearly understood it may be of use to shew the sort of correspondency there is between the offences which affect the existence of the one and those which affect the existence of the other that this correspondency cannot but be very intimate is obvious at first sight it is not however that a given offence in the former catalogue coincides with an offence of the same name in the latter catalogue usurpation of servantship with usurpation of mastership for example but     the case is that an offence of one denomination in the one catalogue coincides with an offence of a different denomination in the other catalogue nor is the coincidence constant and certain but liable to contingencies as we shall see first then wrongful noncollation of the condition of a servant if it be the offence of one who should have been the master coincides with wrongful detrectation of mastership if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it noncollation of mastership which provided the mastership be in the eyes of him who should have been master a beneficial thing but not otherwise is wrongful   wrongful interception of the condition of a servant if it be the offence of him who should have been master coincides with wrongful detrectation of mastership if it be the offence of a third person and the mastership be a beneficial thing it involves in it wrongful interception of mastership   wrongful ablation of servantship if it be the offence of the master but not otherwise coincides with wrongful abdication of mastership if it be the offence of a stranger it involves in it ablation of mastership which in as far as the mastership is a beneficial thing is wrongful   usurpation of servantship coincides necessarily with wrongful imposition of mastership it will be apt to involve in it wrongful divestment of mastership but this only in the case where the usurper previously to the usurpation was in a state of servitude under some other master   wrongful collation of servantship the servantship being considered as a beneficial thing coincides with imposition of mastership which if in the eyes of the pretended master the mastership should chance to be a burthen will be wrongful   wrongful abdication of servantship coincides with wrongful ablation of mastership   wrongful detrectation of servantship with wrongful noncollation of mastership   wrongful imposition of servantship if it be the offence of the pretended master coincides with usurpation of mastership if it be the offence of a stranger it involves in it imposition of mastership which if in the eyes of the pretended master the mastership should be a burthen will be wrongful as to abuse of mastership disturbance of mastership breach of duty in servants elopement of servants and servantstealing these are offences which without any change of denomination bear equal relation to both conditions and thus we may reckon thirteen sorts of offences to which the condition of a servant stands exposed viz   wrongful noninvestment of servantship   wrongful interception of servantship   wrongful divestment of servantship   usurpation of servantship   wrongful investment of servantship   wrongful abdication of servantship   wrongful detrectation of servantship   wrongful imposition of servantship   abuse of mastership  0 disturbance of mastership    breach of duty in servants    elopement of servants    servantstealing xliv we now come to the offences to which the condition of a guardian is exposed a guardian is one who is invested with power over another living within the compass of the same family and called a ward the power being to be exercised for the benefit of the ward now then what are the cases in which it can be for the benefit of one man that another living within the compass of the same family should exercise power over him consider either of the parties by himself and suppose him in point of understanding to be on a level with the other it seems evident enough that no such cases can ever exist to the production of happiness on the part of any given person in like manner as to the production of any other effect which is the result of human agency three things it is necessary should concur knowledge inclination and physical power now as there is no man who is so sure of being inclined on all occasions to promote your happiness as you yourself are so neither is there any man who upon the whole can have had so good opportunities as you must have had of knowing what is most conducive to that purpose for who should know so well as you do what it is that gives you pain or pleasure† moreover as to power it is manifest that no superiority in this respect on the part of a stranger could for a constancy make up for so great a deficiency as he must lie under in respect of two such material points as knowledge and inclination if then there be a case where it can be for the advantage of one man to be under the power of another it must be on account of some palpable and very considerable deficiency on the part of the former in point of intellects or which is the same thing in other words in point of knowledge or understanding now there are two cases in which such palpable deficiency is known to take place these are   where a mans intellect is not yet arrived at that state in which it is capable of directing his own inclination in the pursuit of happiness this is the case of infancy‡   where by some particular known or unknown circumstance his intellect has either never arrived at that     state or having arrived at it has fallen from it which is the case of insanity by what means then is it to be ascertained whether a mans intellect is in that state or no for exhibiting the quantity of sensible heat in a human body we have a very tolerable sort of instrument the thermometer but for exhibiting the quantity of intelligence we have no such instrument it is evident therefore that the line which separates the quantity of intelligence which is sufficient for the purposes of selfgovernment from that which is not sufficient must be in a great measure arbitrary where the insufficiency is the result of want of age the sufficient quantity of intelligence be it what it may does not accrue to all at the same period of their lives it becomes therefore necessary for legislators to cut the gordian knot and fix upon a particular period at which and not before truly or not every person whatever shall be deemed as far as depends upon age to be in possession of this sufficient quantity in this case then a line is drawn which may be the same for every man and in the description of which such as it is whatever persons are concerned may be certain of agreeing the circumstance of time affording a mark by which the line in question may be traced with the utmost degree of nicety on the other hand where the insufficiency is the result of insanity there is not even this resource so that here the legislator has no other expedient than to appoint some particular person or persons to give a particular determination of the question in every instance in which it occurs according to his or their particular and arbitrary discretion arbitrary enough it must be at any rate since the only way in which it can be exercised is by considering whether the share of intelligence possessed by the individual in question does or does not come up to the loose and indeterminate idea which persons so appointed may chance to entertain with respect to the quantity which is deemed sufficient xlv the line then being drawn or supposed to be so it is expedient for a man who cannot with safety to himself be left in his own power that he should be placed in the power of another how long then should he remain so just so long as his inability is supposed to continue that is in the case of infancy till he arrives at that period at which the law deems him to be of full age in the case of insanity till he be of sound mind and understanding now it is evident that this period in the case of infancy may not arrive for a considerable time and in the case of insanity perhaps never the duration of the power belonging to this trust must therefore in the one case be very considerable in the other case indefinite xlvi the next point to consider is what may be the extent of it for as to what it ought to be that is a matter to be settled not in a general analytical sketch but in a particular and circumstantial dissertation by possibility then this power may possess any extent that can be imagined it may extend to any acts which physically speaking it may be in the power of the ward to perform himself or be the object of if exercised by the guardian conceive the power for a moment to stand upon this footing the condition of the ward stands now exactly upon a footing with pure slavery add the obligation by which the power is turned into a trust the limits of the power are now very considerably narrowed what then is the purport of this obligation of what nature is the course of conduct it prescribes it is such a course of conduct as shall be best calculated for procuring to the ward the greatest quantity of happiness which his faculties and the circumstances he is in will admit of saving always in the first place the regard which the guardian is permitted to show to his own happiness and in the second place that which he is obliged as well as permitted to show to that of other men this is in fact no other than that course of conduct which the ward did he but know how ought in point of prudence to maintain of himself so that the business of the former is to govern the latter precisely in the manner in which this latter ought to govern himself now to instruct each individual in what manner to govern his own conduct in the details of life is the particular business of private ethics to instruct individuals in what manner to govern the conduct of those whose happiness during nonage is committed to their charge is the business of the art of private education the details therefore of the rules to be given for that purpose any more than the acts which are capable of being committed in violation of those rules belong not to the art of legislation since as will be seen more particularly hereafter† such details could not with     any chance of advantage be provided for by the legislator some general outlines might indeed be drawn by his authority and in point of fact some are in every civilized state but such regulations it is evident must be liable to great variation in the first place according to the infinite diversity of civil conditions which a man may stand invested with in any given state in the next place according to the diversity of local circumstances that may influence the nature of the conditions which may chance to be established in different states on this account the offences which would be constituted by such regulations could not be comprised under any concise and settled denominations capable of a permanent and extensive application no place therefore can be allotted to them here xlvii by what has been said we are the better prepared for taking an account of the offences to which the condition in question stands exposed guardianship being a private trust is of course exposed to those offences and no others by which a private trust is liable to be affected some of them however on account of the special quality of the trust will admit of some further particularity of description in the first place breach of this species of trust may be termed mismanagement of guardianship in the second place of whatever nature the duties are which are capable of being annexed to this condition it must often happen that in order to fulfil them it is necessary the guardian should be at a certain particular place mismanagement of guardianship when it consists in the not being on the occasion in question at the place in question may be termed desertion of guardianship third it is manifest enough that the object which the guardian ought to propose to himself in the exercise of the powers to which those duties are annexed is to procure for the ward the greatest quantity of happiness which can be procured for him consistently with the regard which is due to the other interests that have been mentioned for this is the object which the ward would have proposed to himself and might and ought to have been allowed to propose to himself had he been capable of governing his own conduct now in order to procure this happiness it is necessary that he should possess a certain power over the objects on the use of which such happiness depends these objects are either the person of the ward himself or other objects that are extraneous to him these other objects are either things or persons as to things then objects of this class in as far as a mans happiness depends upon the use of them are styled his property the case is the same with the services of any persons over whom he may happen to possess a beneficial power or to whose services he may happen to possess a beneficial right now when property of any kind which is in trust suffers by the delinquency of him with whom it is in trust such offence of whatever nature it is in other respects may be styled dissipation in breach of trust and if it be attended with a profit to the trustee it may be styled peculation fourth for one person to exercise a power of any kind over another it is necessary that the latter should either perform certain acts upon being commanded so to do by the former or at least should suffer certain acts to be exercised upon himself in this respect a ward must stand upon the footing of a servant and the condition of a ward must in this respect stand exposed to the same offences to which that of a servant stands exposed that is on the part of a stranger to disturbance which in particular circumstances will amount to theft on the part of the ward to breach of duty which in particular circumstances may be effected by elopement fifth there does not seem to be any offence concerning guardianship that corresponds to abuse of trust i mean in the sense to which the lastmentioned denomination has been here confined† the reason is that guardianship being a trust of a private nature does not as such confer upon the trustee any power either over the person or over the property of any party other than the beneficiary himself if by accident it confers on the trustee a power over any persons whose services constitute a part of the property of the beneficiary the trustee becomes thereby in certain respects the master of such servants‡ sixth bribery also is a sort of offence to which in this case there is not commonly much temptation it is an offence however which by possibility is capable of taking this direction and must therefore be aggregated to the number of the offences to which the condition of a guardian stands exposed and thus we have in all seventeen of these offences viz   wrongful noninvestment of guardianship   wrongful interception of guardianship   wrongful divestment of guardianship   usurpation of guardianship   wrongful investment of guardianship   wrongful abdication of guardianship   detrectation of guardianship   wrongful imposition of guardianship   mismanagement of guardianship  0 desertion of guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of wardship    peculation in prejudice of wardship    disturbance of guardianship    breach of duty to guardians    elopement from guardians    wardstealing    bribery in prejudice of wardship xlviii next with regard to offences to which the condition of wardship is exposed those     which first affect the existence of the condition itself are as follows   wrongful noninvestment of the condition of a ward this if it be the offence of one who should have been guardian coincides with wrongful detrectation of guardianship if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it noninvestment of guardianship which provided the guardianship is in the eyes of him who should have been guardian a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful interception of wardship this if it be the offence of him who should have been guardian coincides with wrongful detrectation of guardianship if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it interception of guardianship which provided the guardianship is in the eyes of him who should have been guardian a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful divestment of wardship this if it be the offence of the guardian but not otherwise coincides with wrongful abdication of guardianship if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it divestment of guardianship which if the guardianship is in the eyes of the guardian a desirable thing is wrongful   usurpation of the condition of a ward an offence not very likely to be committed this coincides at any rate with wrongful imposition of guardianship and if the usurper were already under the guardianship of another guardian it will involve in it wrongful divestment of such guardianship   wrongful investment of wardship the wardship being considered as a beneficial thing this coincides with imposition of guardianship which if in the eyes of the pretended guardian the guardianship should be a burthen will be wrongful   wrongful abdication of wardship this coincides with wrongful divestment of guardianship   wrongful detrectation of wardship this coincides with wrongful interception of guardianship   wrongful imposition of wardship this if the offender be the pretended guardian coincides with usurpation of guardianship if a stranger it involves in it wrongful imposition of guardianship as to such of the offences relative to this condition as concern the consequences of it while subsisting they are of such a nature that without any change of denomination they belong equally to the condition of a guardian and that of a ward we may therefore reckon seventeen sorts of offences relative to the condition of a ward   wrongful noninvestment of wardship   wrongful interception of wardship   wrongful divestment of wardship   usurpation of wardship   wrongful investment of wardship   wrongful abdication of wardship   wrongful detrectation of wardship   wrongful imposition of wardship   mismanagement of guardianship  0 desertion of guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of wardship    peculation in prejudice of wardship    disturbance of guardianship    breach of duty to guardians    elopement from guardians    wardstealing    bribery in prejudice of wardship xlix we come now to the offences to which the condition of a parent stands exposed and first with regard to those by which the very existence of the condition is affected on this occasion in order to see the more clearly into the subject it will be necessary to distinguish between the natural relationship and the legal relationship which is superinduced as it were upon the natural one the natural one being constituted by a particular event which either on account of its being already past or on some other account is equally out of the power of the law neither is nor can be made the subject of an offence is a man your father it is not any offence of mine that can make you not his son is he not your father it is not any offence of mine that can render him so but although he does in fact bear that relation to you i by an offence of mine may perhaps so manage matters that he shall not be thought to bear it which with respect to any legal advantages which either he or you could derive from such relationship will be the same thing as if he did not in the capacity of a witness i may cause the judges to believe that he is not your father and to decree accordingly or in the capacity of a judge i may myself decree him not to be your father leaving then the purely natural relationship as an object equally out of the reach of justice and injustice the legal condition it is evident will stand exposed to the same offences neither more nor less as every other condition that is capable of being either beneficial or burthensome stands exposed to next with regard to the exercise of the functions belonging to this condition considered as still subsisting in parentality there must be two persons concerned the father and the mother the condition of a parent includes therefore two conditions that of a father and that of a mother with respect to such or such a child now it is evident that between these two parties whatever beneficiary powers and other rights as also whatever obligations are annexed to the condition of a parent may be     shared in any proportions that can be imagined but if in these several objects of legal creation each of these two parties have severally a share and if the interests of all these parties are in any degree provided for it is evident that each of the parents will stand with relation to the child in two several capacities that of a master and that of a guardian the condition of a parent then in as far as it is the work of law may be considered as a complex condition compounded of that of a guardian and that of a master to the parent then in quality of guardian results a set of duties involving as necessary to the discharge of them certain powers to the child in the character of a ward a set of rights corresponding to the parents duties and a set of duties corresponding to his powers to the parent again in quality of master a set of beneficiary powers without any other necessary limitation so long as they last than what is annexed to them by the duties incumbent on him in quality of a guardian to the child in the character of a servant a set of duties corresponding to the parents beneficiary powers and without any other necessary limitation so long as they last than what is annexed to them by the rights which belong to the child in his capacity of ward the condition of a parent will therefore be exposed to all the offences to which either that of a guardian or that of a master are exposed and as each of the parents will partake more or less of both those characters the offences to which the two conditions are exposed may be nominally as they will be substantially the same taking them then all together the offences to which the condition of a parent is exposed will stand as follows   wrongful noninvestment of parentality   wrongful interception of parentality   wrongful divestment of parentality   usurpation of parentality   wrongful investment of parentality   wrongful abdication of parentality   wrongful detrectation of parentality   wrongful imposition of parentality   mismanagement of parental guardianship  0 desertion of parental guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of filial wardship    peculation in prejudice of filial wardship    abuse of parental powers    disturbance of parental guardianship    breach of duty to parents    elopement from parents    childstealing    bribery in prejudice of filial wardship l next with regard to the offences to which the filial condition† the condition of a son or daughter stands exposed the principles to be pursued in the investigation of offences of this description have already been sufficiently developed it will be sufficient therefore to enumerate them without further discussion the only peculiarities by which offences relative to the condition in question stand distinguished from the offences relative to all the preceding conditions depend upon this one circumstance viz that it is certain every one must have had a father and a mother at the same time that it is not certain that every one must have had a master a servant a guardian or a ward it will be observed all along that where a person from whom if alive the benefit would be taken or on whom the burthen would be imposed be dead so much of the mischief is extinct along with the object of the offence there still however remains so much of the mischief as depends upon the advantage or disadvantage which might accrue to persons related or supposed to be related in the several remoter degrees to him in question the catalogue then of these offences stands as follows   wrongful noninvestment of filiation this if it be the offence of him or her who should have been recognised as the parent coincides with wrongful detrectation of parentality if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it noninvestment of parentality which provided the parentality is in the eyes of him or her who should have been recognised as the parent a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful interception of filiation this if it be the offence of him or her who should have been recognised as the parent coincides with     wrongful detrectation of parentality if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it interception of parentality which provided the parentality is in the eyes of him or her who should have been recognised as parent a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful divestment of filiation this if it be the offence of him or her who should be recognised as parent coincides with wrongful abdication of parentality if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it divestment of parentality to wit of paternity or of maternity or of both which if the parentality is in the eyes of him or her who should be recognised as parent a desirable thing are respectively wrongful   usurpation of filiation this coincides with wrongful imposition of parentality to wit either of paternity or of maternity or of both and necessarily involves in it divestment of parentality which if the parentality thus divested were in the eyes of him or her who are thus divested of it a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful investment of filiation the filiation being considered as a beneficial thing this coincides with imposition of parentality which if in the eyes of the pretended father or mother the parentality should be an undesirable thing will be wrongful   wrongful abdication of filiation this necessarily coincides with wrongful divestment of parentality it also is apt to involve in it wrongful imposition of parentality though not necessarily either to the advantage or to the prejudice of any certain person for if a man supposed at first to be your son appears afterwards not to be yours it is certain indeed that he is the son of some other man but it may not appear who that other man is   wrongful detrectation of filiation this coincides with wrongful noninvestment or wrongful interception of parentality   wrongful imposition of filiation this if it be the offence of the pretended parent coincides necessarily with usurpation of parentality if it be the offence of a third person it necessarily involves imposition of parentality as also divestment of parentality either or both of which according to the circumstance above mentioned may or may not be wrongful   mismanagement of parental guardianship  0 desertion of parental guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of filial wardship    peculation in prejudice of filial wardship    abuse of parental power    disturbance of parental guardianship    breach of duty to parents    elopement from parents    childstealing    bribery in prejudice of parental guardianship li we shall now be able to apply ourselves with some advantage to the examination of the several offences to which the marital condition or condition of a husband stands exposed a husband is a man between whom and a certain woman who in this case is called his wife there subsists a legal obligation for the purpose of their living together and in particular for the purpose of a sexual intercourse to be carried on between them this obligation will naturally be considered in four points of view   in respect of its commencement   in respect of the placing it   in respect of the nature of it   in respect of its duration first then it is evident that in point of possibility one method of commencement is as conceivable as another the time of its commencement might have been marked by one sort of event by one sort of signal as it may here be called as well as by another but in practice the signal has usually been as in point of utility it ought constantly to be a contract entered into by the parties that is a set of signs pitched upon by the law as expressive of their mutual consent to take upon them this condition second and third with regard to the placing of the obligations which are the result of the contract it is evident that they must rest solely on one side or mutually on both on the first supposition the condition is not to be distinguished from pure slavery in this case either the wife must be the slave of the husband or the husband of the wife the first of these suppositions has perhaps never been exemplified the opposing influence of physical causes being too universal to have ever been surmounted the latter seems to have been exemplified but too often perhaps among the first romans at any rate in many barbarous nations thirdly with regard to the nature of the obligations if they are not suffered to rest all on one side certain rights are thereby given to the other there must therefore be rights on both sides now where there are mutual rights possessed by two persons as against each other either there are powers annexed to those rights or not but the persons in question are by the supposition to live together in which case we have shown that it is not only expedient but in a manner necessary that on one side there should be powers now it is only on one side that powers can be for suppose them on both sides and they destroy one another the question is then in which of the parties these powers shall be lodged we have shown that on the principle of utility they ought to be lodged in the husband the powers then which subsist being lodged in the husband the next question is shall the interest of one party only or of both be consulted in the exercise of them it is evident that on the principle of utility the interests of   0 both ought alike to be consulted since in two persons taken together more happiness is producible than in one this being the case it is manifest that the legal relation which the husband will bear to the wife will be a complex one compounded of that of master and that of guardian lii the offences then to which the condition of a husband will be exposed will be the sum of those to which the two conditions of master and guardian are exposed thus far the condition of a husband with respect to the general outlines of it stands upon the same footing as that of a parent but there are certain reciprocal services which being the main subject of the matrimonial contract constitute the essence of the two matrimonial relations and which neither a master nor guardian as such nor a parent at any rate have usually been permitted to receive these must of course have been distinguished from the indiscriminate train of services at large which the husband in his character of master is empowered to exact and of those which in his character of guardian he is bound to render being thus distinguished the offences relative to the two conditions have in many instances in as far as they have reference to these peculiar services acquired particular denominations in the first place with regard to the contract from the celebration of which the legal condition dates its existence it is obvious that in point of possibility this contract might on the part of either sex subsist with respect to several persons of the other sex at the same time the husband might have any number of wives the wife might have any number of husbands the husband might enter into the contract with a number of wives at the same time or if with only one at a time he might reserve to himself a right of engaging in a similar contract with any number or with only such or such a number of other women afterwards during the continuance of each former contract this latter accordingly is the footing upon which as is well known marriage is and has been established in many extensive countries particularly in all those which profess the mahometan religion in point of possibility it is evident that the like liberty might be reserved on the part of the wife though in point of practice no examples of such an arrangement seem ever to have occurred which of all these arrangements is in point of utility the most expedient is a question which would require too much discussion to answer in the course of an analytical process like the present and which belongs indeed to the civil branch of legislation rather than to the penal in christian countries the solemnization of any such contract is made to exclude the solemnization of any subsequent one during the continuance of a former and the solemnization of any such subsequent contract is accordingly treated as an offence under the name of polygamy polygamy then is at any rate on the part of the man a particular modification of that offence which may be styled usurpation of the condition of a husband as to its other effects they will be different according as it was the man only or the woman only or both that were in a state of matrimony at the time of the commission of the offence if the man only then his offence involves in it pro tanto that of wrongful divestment of the condition of a wife in prejudice of his prior wife† if the woman only then it involves in it pro tanto that of wrongful divestment of the condition of a husband in prejudice of her prior husband if both were already married it of course involves both the wrongful divestments which have just been mentioned and on the other hand also the converse of all this may be observed with regard to polygamy on the part of the woman second as the engaging not to enter into any subsequent engagement of the like kind during the continuance of the first is one of the conditions on which the law lends its sanction to the first so another is the inserting as one of the articles of this engagement an undertaking not to render to or accept from any other person the services which form the characteristic object of it the rendering or acceptance of any such services is accordingly treated as an offence under the name of adultery under which name is also comprised the offence of the stranger who in the commission of the above offence is the necessary accomplice third disturbing either of the parties to this engagement in the possession of these characteristic services may in like manner be distinguished from the offence of disturbing them in the enjoyment of the miscellaneous advantages derivable from the same condition and on whichever side the blame rests whether that of the party or that of a third person may be termed wrongful withholding of connubial services and thus we have oneandtwenty sorts of offences to which as the law stands at present in christian countries the condition of a husband stands exposed viz   wrongful noninvestment of the condition of a husband   wrongful interception of the condition of a husband   wrongful divestment of the condition of a husband   usurpation of the condition     of a husband   polygamy   wrongful investment of the condition of a husband   wrongful abdication of the condition of a husband   wrongful detrectation of the condition of a husband   wrongful imposition of the condition of a husband  0 mismanagement of marital guardianship    desertion of marital guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of matrimonial wardship    peculation in prejudice of matrimonial wardship    abuse of marital power    disturbance of marital guardianship    wrongful withholding of connubial services    adultery    breach of duty to husbands    elopement from husbands  0 wifestealing    bribery in prejudice of marital guardianship liii next with regard to the offences to which the condition of a wife stands exposed from the patterns that have been exhibited already the coincidences and associations that take place between the offences that concern the existence of this condition and those which concern the existence of the condition of a husband may easily enough be apprehended without farther repetitions the catalogue of those now under consideration will be precisely the same in every article as the catalogue last exhibited liv thus much for the several sorts of offences relative to the several sorts of domestic conditions those which are constituted by such natural relations as are contiguous being included there remain those which are uncontiguous of which after so much as has been said of the others it will naturally be expected that some notice should be taken these however do not afford any of that matter which is necessary to constitute a condition in point of fact no power seems ever to be annexed to any of them a grandfather perhaps may be called by the law to take upon him the guardianship of his orphan grandson but then the power he has belongs to him not as grandfather but as guardian in point of possibility indeed power might be annexed to these relations just as it might to any other but still no new sort of domestic condition would result from it since it has been shown that there can be no others that being constituted by power shall be distinct from those which have been already mentioned such as they are however they have this in common with the beforementioned relations that they are capable of importing either benefit or burthen they therefore stand exposed to the several offences whereby those or any other relations are liable to be affected in point of existence it might be expected therefore that in virtue of these offences they should be added to the list of the relations which are liable to be objects of delinquency but the fact is that they already stand included in it and although not expressly named yet as effectually as if they were on the one hand it is only by affecting such or such a contiguous relation that any offence affecting uncontiguous relations can take place on the other hand neither can any offence affecting the existence of the contiguous relations be committed without affecting the existence of an indefinite multitude of such as are uncontiguous a false witness comes and causes it to be believed that you are the son of a woman who in truth is not your mother what follows an endless tribe of other false persuasions that you are the grandson of the father and of the mother of this supposed mother that you are the son of some husband of hers or at least of some man with whom she has cohabited the grandson of his father and his mother and so on the brother of their other children if they have any the brotherinlaw of the husbands and wives of those children if married the uncle of the children of those children and so on on the other hand that you are not the son of your real mother nor of your real father that you are not the grandson of either of your real grandfathers or grandmothers and so on without end all which persuasions result from and are included in the one original false persuasion of your being the son of this your pretended mother it should seem therefore at first sight that none of the offences against these uncontiguous relations could ever come expressly into question for by the same rule that one ought so it might seem ought a thousand others the offences against the uncontiguous being merged as it were in those which affect the contiguous relations so far however is this from being the case that in speaking of an offence of this stamp it is not uncommon to hear a great deal said of this or that uncontiguous relationship which it affects at the same time that no notice at all shall be taken of any of those which are contiguous how happens this because to the uncontiguous relation are annexed perhaps certain remarkable advantages or disadvantages while to all the intermediate relations none shall be annexed which are in comparison worth noticing suppose antony or lepidus to have contested the relationship of octavius afterwards augustus to caius julius cæsar how could it have been done it could only     have been by contesting either octaviuss being the son of atia or atias being the daughter of julia or julias being the daughter of lucius julius cæsar or lucius julius cæsars being the father of caius but to have been the son of atia or the grandson of julia or the great grandson of lucius julius cæsar was in comparison of small importance those intervening relationships were comparatively speaking of no other use to him than in virtue of their being so many necessary links in the genealogical chain which connected him with the sovereign of the empire as to the advantages and disadvantages which may happen to be annexed to any of those uncontiguous relationships we have seen already that no powers over the correlative person nor any corresponding obligations are of the number of what nature then can they be they are in truth no other than what are the result either of local and accidental institutions or of some spontaneous bias that has been taken by the moral sanction it would therefore be to little purpose to attempt tracing them out a priori by any exhaustive process all that can be done is to pick up and lay together some of the principal articles in each catalogue by way of specimen the advantages which a given relationship is apt to impart seem to be referable chiefly to the following heads   chance of succession to the property or a part of the property of the correlative person   chance of pecuniary support to be yielded by the correlative person either by appointment of law or by spontaneous donation   accession of legal rank including any legal privileges which may happen to be annexed to it such as capacity of holding such and such beneficial offices exemption from such and such burthensome obligations for instance paying taxes serving burthensome offices c c   accession of rank by courtesy including the sort of reputation which is customarily and spontaneously annexed to distinguished birth and family alliance whereon may depend the chance of advancement in the way of marriage or in a thousand other ways less obvious the disadvantages which a given relation is liable to impart seem to be referable chiefly to the following heads   chance of being obliged either by law or by force of the moral sanction to yield pecuniary support to the correlative party   loss of legal rank including the legal disabilities as well as the burthensome obligations which the law is apt to annex sometimes with injustice enough to the lower stations   loss of rank by courtesy including the loss of the advantages annexed by custom to such rank   incapacity of contracting matrimony with the correlative person where the supposed consanguinity or affinity lies within the prohibited degrees     lv we come now to civil conditions these it may well be imagined may be infinitely various as various as the acts which a man may be either commanded or allowed whether for his own benefit or that of others to abstain     from or to perform as many different denominations as there are of persons distinguished with a view to such commands and allowances those denominations only excepted which relate to the conditions above spoken of under the name of domestic ones so many civil conditions one might enumerate means however more or less explicit may be found out of circumscribing their infinitude what the materials are if so they may be called of which conditions or any other kind of legal possession can be made up we have already seen beneficial powers fiduciary powers beneficial rights fiduciary rights relative duties absolute duties but as many conditions as import a power or right of the fiduciary kind as possessed by the person whose condition is in question belong to the head of trusts the catalogue of the offences to which these conditions are exposed coincides therefore exactly with the catalogue of offences against trust under which head they have been considered in a general point of view under the head of offences against trust and such of them as are of a domestic nature in a more particular manner in the character of offences against the several domestic conditions conditions constituted by such duties of the relative kind as have for their counterparts trusts constituted by fiduciary powers as well as rights on the side of the correlative party and those of a private nature have also been already discussed under the appellation of domestic conditions the same observation may be applied to the conditions constituted by such powers of the beneficial kind over persons as are of a private nature as also to the subordinate correlative conditions constituted by the duties corresponding     to those rights and powers as to absolute duties there is no instance of a condition thus created of which the institution is upon the principle of utility to be justified unless the several religious conditions of the monastic kind should be allowed of as examples there remain as the only materials out of which the conditions which yet remain to be considered can be composed conditions constituted by beneficial powers over things conditions constituted by beneficial rights to things that is rights to powers over things or by rights to those rights and so on conditions constituted by rights to services and conditions constituted by the duties corresponding to those respective rights out of these are to be taken those of which the materials are the ingredients of the several modifications of property the several conditions of proprietorship these are the conditions if such for a moment they may be styled which having but here and there any specific names are not commonly considered on the footing of conditions so that the acts which if such conditions were recognised might be considered as offences against those conditions are not wont to be considered in any other light than that of offences against property now the case is as hath been already intimated that of these civil conditions those which are wont to be considered under that name are not distinguished by any uniform and explicit line from those of which the materials are wont to be carried to the head of property a set of rights shall in one instance be considered as constituting an article of property rather than a condition while in another instance a set of rights of the same stamp is considered as constituting rather a condition than an article of property this will probably be found to be the case in all languages and the usage is different again in one language from what it is in another from these causes it seems to be impracticable to subject the class of civil conditions to any exhaustive method so that for making a complete collection of them there seems to be no other expedient than that of searching the language through for them and taking them as they come to exemplify this observation it may be of use to lay open the structure as it were of two or three of the principal sorts or classes of conditions comparing them with two or three articles of property which appear to be nearly of the same complexion by this means the nature and generation if one may so call it of both these classes of ideal objects may be the more clearly understood the several sorts of civil conditions that are not fiduciary may all or at least the greater part of them be comprehended under the head of rank or that of profession the latter word being taken in its most extensive sense so as to include not only what are called the liberal professions but those also which are exercised by the several sorts of traders artists manufacturers and other persons of whatsoever station who are in the way of making a profit by their labour among ranks then as well as professions let us for the sake of perspicuity take for examples such articles as stand the clearest from any mixture of either fiduciary or beneficial power the rank of knighthood is constituted how by prohibiting all other persons from performing certain acts the performance of which is the symbol of the order at the same time that the knight in question and his companions are permitted for instance to wear a ribbon of a certain colour in a certain manner to call himself by a certain title to use an armorial seal with a certain mark on it by laying all persons but the knight under this prohibition the law subjects them to a set of duties and since from the discharge of these duties a benefit results to the person in whose favour they are created to wit the benefit of enjoying such a share of extraordinary reputation and respect as men are wont to yield to a person thus distinguished to discharge them is to render him a service and the duty being a duty of the negative class a duty consisting in the performance of certain acts of the negative kind† the service is what may be called a service of forbearance it appears then that to generate this condition there must be two sorts of services that which is the immediate cause of it a service of the negative kind to be rendered by the community at large that which is the cause again of this service a service of the positive kind to be rendered by the law the condition of a professional man stands upon a narrower footing to constitute this condition there needs nothing more than a permission given him on the part of the legislator to perform those acts in the performance of which consists the exercise of his profession to give or sell his advice or assistance in matters of law or physic to give or sell his services as employed in the executing or overseeing of a manufacture or piece of work of such or such a kind to sell a commodity of such or such a sort here then we see there is but one sort of service requisite a service which may be merely of the negative kind to be rendered by the law the service of permitting him to exercise his profession a service which if there has been no prohibition laid on before is rendered by simply forbearing to prohibit him now the ideal objects which in the cases     above specified are said to be conferred upon a man by the services that are respectively in question are in both cases not articles of property but conditions by such a behaviour on the part of the law as shall be the reverse of that whereby they were respectively produced a man may be made to forfeit them and what he is then said to forfeit is in neither case his property but in one case his rank or dignity in the other case his trade or his profession and in both cases his condition other cases there are again in which the law by a process of the same sort with that by which it constituted the former of the two abovementioned conditions confers on him an ideal object which the laws of language have placed under the head of property the law permits a man to sell books that is all sorts of books in general thus far all that it has done is to invest him with a condition and this condition he would equally possess although every body else in the world were to sell books likewise let the law now take an active part in his favour and prohibit all other persons from selling books of a certain description he remaining at liberty to sell them as before it thereby confers on him a sort of exclusive privilege or monopoly which is called a copyright but by investing him with this right it is not said to invest him with any new sort of condition and what it invests him with is spoken of as an article of property to wit of that sort of property which is termed incorporeal and so on in the case of an engraving a mechanical engine a medicine or in short of a saleable article of any other sort yet when it gave him an exclusive right of wearing a particular sort of ribbon the object which it was then considered as conferring on him was not an article of property but a condition by forbearing to subject you to certain disadvantages to which it subjects an alien the law confers on you the condition of a naturalborn subject by subjecting him to them it imposes on him the condition of an alien by conferring on you certain privileges or rights which it denies to a roturier the law confers on you the condition of a gentilhomme by forbearing to confer on him those privileges it imposes on him the condition of a roturier† the rights out of which the two advantageous conditions here exemplified are both of them as it were composed have for their counterpart a sort of services of forbearance rendered as we have seen not by private individuals but by the law itself as to the duties which it creates in rendering you these services they are to be considered as duties imposed by the legislator on the ministers of justice it may be observed with regard to the greater part of the conditions here comprised under the general appellation of civil that the relations corresponding to those by which they are respectively constituted are not provided with appellatives the relation which has a name is that which is borne by the party favoured to the party bound that which is borne by the party bound to the party favoured has not any this is a circumstance that may help to distinguish them from those conditions which we have termed domestic in the domestic conditions if on the one side the party to whom the power is given is called a master on the other side the party over whom that power is given the party who is the object of that power is termed a servant in the civil conditions this is not the case on the one side a man in virtue of certain services of forbearance which the rest of the community are bound to render him is denominated a knight of such or such an order but on the other side these services do not bestow any particular denomination on the persons from whom such services are due another man in virtue of the legislators rendering that sort of negative service which consists in the not prohibiting him from exercising a trade invests him at his option with the condition of a trader it accordingly denominates him a farmer a baker a weaver and so on but the ministers of the law do not in virtue of their rendering the man this sort of negative service acquire for themselves any particular name suppose even that the trade you have the right of exercising happens to be the object of a monopoly and that the legislator besides rendering you himself those services which you derive from the permission he bestows on you obliges other persons to render you those farther services which you receive from their forbearing to follow the same trade yet neither do they in virtue of their being thus bound acquire any particular name after what has been said of the nature of the several sorts of civil conditions that have names the offences to which they are exposed may without much difficulty be imagined taken by itself every condition which is thus constituted by a permission granted to the possessor is of course of a beneficial nature it is therefore exposed to all those offences to which the possession of a benefit is exposed but either on account of a mans     being obliged to persevere when once engaged in it or on account of such other obligations as may stand annexed to the possession of it or on account of the comparative degree of disrepute which may stand annexed to it by the moral sanction it may by accident be a burthen it is on this account liable to stand exposed to the offences to which as hath been seen every thing that partakes of the nature of a burthen stands exposed as to any offences which may concern the exercise of the functions belonging to it if it happens to have any duties annexed to it such as those for instance which are constituted by regulations touching the exercise of a trade it will stand exposed to so many breaches of duty and lastly whatsoever are the functions belonging to it it will stand exposed at any rate to disturbance in the forming however of the catalogue of these offences exactness is of the less consequence inasmuch as an act if it should happen not to be comprised in this catalogue and yet is in any respect of a pernicious nature will be sure to be found in some other division of the system of offences if a baker sells bad bread for the price of good it is a kind of fraud upon the buyer and perhaps an injury of the simple corporal kind done to the health of an individual or a neighbourhood if a clothier sells bad cloth for good at home it is a fraud if to foreigners abroad it may over and above the fraud put upon the foreign purchaser have pernicious effects perhaps in the prosperity of the trade at home and become thereby an offence against the national wealth so again with regard to disturbance if a man be disturbed in the exercise of his trade the offence will probably be a wrongful interception of the profit he might be presumed to have been in a way to make by it and were it even to appear in any case that a man exercised a trade or what is less unlikely a liberal profession without having profit in his view the offence will still be reducible to the head of simple injurious restrainment or simple injurious compulsion §   advantages of the present method lvi a few words for the purpose of giving a general view of the method of division here pursued and of the advantages which it possesses may have their use the whole system of offences we may observe is branched out into five classes in the three first the subordinate divisions are taken from the same source viz from the consideration of the different points in respect whereof the interest of an individual is exposed to suffer by this uniformity a considerable degree of light seems to be thrown upon the whole system particularly upon the offences that come under the third class objects which have never hitherto been brought into any sort of order with regard to the fourth class in settling the precedence between its several subordinate divisions it seemed most natural and satisfactory to place those first the connection whereof with the welfare of individuals seemed most obvious and immediate the mischievous effects of those offences which tend in an immediate way to deprive individuals of the protection provided for them against the attacks of one another and of those which tend to bring down upon them the attacks of foreign assailants seem alike obvious and palpable the mischievous quality of such as tend to weaken the force that is provided to combat those attacks but particularly the latter though evident enough is one link farther off in the chain of causes and effects the ill effects of such offences as are of disservice only by diminishing the particular fund from whence that force is to be extracted such effects i say though indisputable are still more distant and out of sight the same thing may be observed with regard to such as are mischievous only by affecting the universal fund offences against the sovereignty in general would not be mischievous if offences of the several descriptions preceding were not mischievous nor in a temporal view are offences against religion mischievous except in as far as by removing or weakening or misapplying one of the three great incentives to virtue and checks to vice they tend to open the door to the several mischiefs which it is the nature of all those other offences to produce as to the fifth class this as hath already been observed exhibits at first view an irregularity which however seems to be unavoidable but this irregularity is presently corrected when the analysis returns back as it does after a step or two into the path from which the tyranny of language had forced it a while to deviate it was necessary that it should have two purposes in view the one to exhibit upon a scale more or less minute a systematical enumeration of the several possible modifications of delinquency denominated or undenominated the other to find places in the list for such names of offences as were in current use for the first purpose nature was to set the law for the other custom had the nature of the things themselves been the only guide every such difference in the manner of perpetration and such only should have served as a ground for a different denomination as was attended with a difference in point of effect this however of itself would never have been sufficient for as on one hand the new language which it would have been necessary to invent would have been uncouth and in a manner unintelligible     so on the other hand the names which were before in current use and which in spite of all systems good or bad must have remained in current use would have continued unexplained to have adhered exclusively to the current language would have been as bad on the other side for in that case the catalogue of offences when compared to that of the mischiefs that are capable of being produced would have been altogether broken and uncomplete to reconcile these two objects in as far as they seemed to be reconcileable the following course has therefore been pursued the logical whole constituted by the sum total of possible offences has been bisected in as many different directions as were necessary and the process in each direction carried down to that stage at which the particular ideas thus divided found names in current use in readiness to receive them at that period i have stopped leaving any minuter distinctions to be enumerated in the body of the work as so many species of the genus characterized by such or such a name if in the course of any such process i came to a mode of conduct which though it required to be taken notice of and perhaps had actually been taken notice of under all laws in the character of an offence had hitherto been expressed under different laws by different circumlocutions without ever having received any name capable of occupying the place of a substantive in a sentence i have frequently ventured so far as to fabricate a new name for it such an one as the idiom of the language and the acquaintance i happened to have with it would admit of these names consisting in most instances and that unavoidably of two or three words brought together in a language too which admits not like the german and the greek of their being melted into one can never be upon a par in point of commodiousness with those univocal appellatives which make part of the established stock in the choice of names in current use care has been taken to avoid all such as have been grounded on local distinctions ill founded perhaps in the nation in which they received their birth and at any rate not applicable to the circumstances of other countries the analysis as far as it goes is as applicable to the legal concerns of one country as of another and where if it had descended into further details it would have ceased to be so there i have taken care always to stop and thence it is that it has come to be so much more particular in the class of offences against individuals than in any of the other classes one use then of this arrangement if it should be found to have been properly conducted will be its serving to point out in what it is that the legal interests of all countries agree and in what it is that they are liable to differ how far a rule that is proper for one will serve and how far it will not serve for another that the legal interests of different ages and countries have nothing in common and that they have every thing are suppositions equally distant from the truth lvii a natural method such as it hath been here attempted to exhibit seems to possess four capital advantages not to mention others of inferior note in the first place it affords such assistance to the apprehension and to the memory as those faculties would in vain look for in any technical arrangement† that arrangement of the objects of any science may it should seem be termed a natural one which takes such properties to characterize them by as men in general are by the common constitution of mans nature independently of any accidental impressions they may have received from the influence of any local or other particular causes accustomed to attend to such in a word as naturally that is readily and at first sight engage and firmly fix the attention of any one to whom they have once been pointed out now by what other means should an object engage or fix a mans attention unless by interesting him and what circumstance belonging to any action can be more interesting or rather what other circumstance belonging to it can be at all interesting to him than that of the influence it promises to have on his own happiness and the happiness of those who are about him by what other mark then should he more easily find the place which any offence occapies in the system or by what other clue should he more readily recall it lviii in the next place it not only gives at first glance a general intimation of the nature of each division of offences in as far as that nature is determined by some one characteristic property but it gives room for a number of general propositions to be formed concerning the particular offences that come under that division in such manner as to exhibit a variety of other properties that may belong to them in common it gives room therefore for the framing of a number of propositions concerning them which though very general because predicated of a great     number of articles shall be as generally true lix in the third place it is so contrived that the very place which any offence is made to occupy suggests the reason of its being put there it serves to indicate not only that such and such acts are made offences but why they ought to be by this means while it addresses itself to the understanding it recommends itself in some measure to the affections by the intimation it gives of the nature and tendency of each obnoxious act it accounts for and in some measure vindicates the treatment which it may be thought proper to bestow upon that act in the way of punishment to the subject then it is a kind of perpetual apology showing the necessity of every defalcation which for the security and prosperity of each individual it is requisite to make from the liberty of every other to the legislator it is a kind of perpetual lesson serving at once as a corrective to his prejudices and as a check upon his passions is there a mischief which has escaped him in a natural arrangement if at the same time an exhaustive one he cannot fail to find it is he tempted ever to force innocence within the pale of guilt the difficulty of finding a place for it advertises him of his error such are the uses of a map of universal delinquency laid down upon the principle of utility such the advantages which the legislator as well as the subject may derive from it abide by it and every thing that is arbitrary in legislation vanishes an evilintentioned or prejudiced legislator durst not look it in the face he would proscribe it and with reason it would be a satire on his laws lx in the fourth place a natural arrangement governed as it is by a principle which is recognised by all men will serve alike for the jurisprudence of all nations in a system of proposed law framed in pursuance of such a method the language will serve as a glossary by which all systems of positive law might be explained while the matter serves as a standard by which they might be tried thus illustrated the practice of every nation might be a lesson to every other and mankind might carry on a mutual interchange of experiences and improvements as easily in this as in every other walk of science if any one of these objects should in any degree be attained the labour of this analysis severe as it has been will not have been thrown away §   characters of the five classes lxi it has been mentioned as an advantage possessed by this method and not possessed by any other that the objects comprised under it are cast into groups to which a variety of propositions may be applied in common a collection of these propositions as applied to the several classes may be considered as exhibiting the distinctive characters of each class so many of these propositions as can be applied to the offences belonging to any given class so many properties are they found to have in common so many of these common properties as may respectively be attributed to them so many properties may be set down to serve as characters of the class a collection of these characters it may here be proper to exhibit the more of them we can bring together the more clearly and fully will the nature of the several classes and of the offences they are composed of be understood lxii characters of class   composed of private offences or offences against assignable individuals   when arrived at their last stage the stage of consummation† they produce all of them a primary mischief as well as a secondary‡   the individuals whom they affect in the first instance∥ are constantly assignable this extends to all to attempts and preparations   0 as well as to such as have arrived at the stage of consummation   consequently they admit of compensation† in which they differ from the offences of all the other classes as such   they admit‡ also of retaliation∥ in which also they differ from the offences of all the other classes   there is always some person who has a natural and peculiar interest to prosecute them in this they differ from selfregarding offences also from semipublic and public ones except in as far as the two latter may chance to involve a private mischief   the mischief they produce is obvious more so than that of semipublic offences and still more so than that of selfregarding ones or even public   they are every where and must ever be obnoxious to the censure of the world more so than semipublic offences as such and still more so than public ones   they are more constantly obnoxious to the censure of the world than selfregarding offences and would be so universally were it not for the influence of the two false principles the principle of asceticism and the principle of antipathy§   they are less apt than semipublic and public offences to require different descriptions¶ in different states and countries in which respect they are much upon a par with selfregarding ones  0 by certain circumstances of aggravation they are liable to be transformed into semipublic offences and by certain others into public    there can be no ground for punishing them until they can be proved to have occasioned or to be about to occasion some particular mischief to some particular individual in this they differ from semipublic offences and from public    in slight cases compensation given to the individual affected by them may be a sufficient ground for remitting punishment for if the primary mischief has not been sufficient to produce any alarm the whole of the mischief may be cured by compensation in this also they differ from semipublic offences and from public ones lxiii characters of class   composed of semipublic offences or offences affecting a whole subordinate class of persons   as such they produce no primary mischief the mischief they produce consists of one or other or both branches of the secondary mischief produced by offences against individuals without the primary   in as far as they are to be considered as belonging to this class the persons whom they affect in the first instance are not individually assignable   they are apt however to involve or terminate in some primary mischief of the first order which when they do they advance into the first class and become private offences   they admit not as such of compensation   nor of retaliation   as such there is never any one particular individual whose exclusive interest it is to prosecute them a circle of persons may however always be marked out within which may be found some who have a greater interest to prosecute than any who are out of that circle have   the mischief they produce is in general pretty obvious not so much so indeed as that of private offences but more so upon the whole than that of selfregarding and public ones   they are rather less obnoxious to the censure of the world than private offences but they are more so than public ones they would also be more so than selfregarding ones were it not for the influence of the two false principles the principle of sympathy and antipathy and that of asceticism   they are more apt than private and selfregarding offences to require different descriptions in different countries but less so than public ones  0 there may be ground for punishing them before they have been proved to have occasioned or to be about to occasion mischief to any particular individual which is not the case with private offences    in no cases can satisfaction given to any particular individual affected by them be a sufficient ground for remitting punishment for by such satisfaction it is but a part of the mischief of them that is cured in this they differ from private offences but agree with public lxiv characters of class   consisting of selfregarding offences offences against ones self   in individual instances it will often be     questionable whether they are productive of any primary mischief at all secondary they produce none   they affect not any other individuals assignable or not assignable except in as far as they affect the offender himself unless by possibility in particular cases and in a very slight and distant manner the whole state   they admit not therefore of compensation   nor of retaliation   no person has naturally any peculiar interest to prosecute them except in as far as in virtue of some connection he may have with the offender either in point of sympathy or of interest† a mischief of the derivative kind‡ may happen to devolve upon him§   the mischief they produce is apt to be unobvious and in general more questionable than that of any of the other classes   they are however apt many of them to be more obnoxious to the censure of the world than public offences owing to the influence of the two false principles the principle of asceticism and the principle of antipathy some of them more even than semipublic or even than private offences   they are less apt than offences of any other class to require different descriptions in different states and countries∥   among the inducements¶ to punish them antipathy against the offender is apt to have a greater share than sympathy for the public  0 the best plea for punishing them is founded on a faint probability there may be of their being productive of a mischief which if real will place them in the class of public ones chiefly in those divisions of it which are composed of offences against population and offences against the national wealth lxv characters of class   consisting of public offences or offences against the state in general   as such they produce not any primary mischief and the secondary mischief they produce which consists frequently of danger without alarm though great in value is in specie very indeterminate   the individuals whom they affect in the first instance are constantly unassignable except in as far as by accident they happen to involve or terminate in such or such offences against individuals   consequently they admit not of compensation   nor of retaliation   nor is there any person who has naturally any particular interest to prosecute them except in as far as they appear to affect the power or in any other manner the private interest of some person in authority   the mischief they produce as such is comparatively unobvious much more so than that of private offences and more so likewise than that of semipublic ones   they are as such much less obnoxious to the censure of the world than private offences less even than semipublic or even than selfregarding offences unless in particular cases through sympathy to certain persons in authority whose private interests they may appear to affect   they are more apt than any of the other classes to admit of different descriptions in different states and countries   they are constituted in many cases by some circumstances of aggravation superadded to a private offence and therefore in these cases involve the mischief and exhibit the other characters belonging to both classes they are however even in such cases properly enough ranked in the  th class inasmuch as the mischief they produce in virtue of the properties which aggregate them to that class eclipses and swallows up that which they produce in virtue of those properties which aggregate them to the  st  0 there may be sufficient ground for punishing them without their being proved to have occasioned or to be about to occasion any particular mischief to any particular individual in this they differ from private offences but agree with semipublic ones here as in semipublic offences the extent of the mischief makes up for the uncertainty of it    in no case can satisfaction given to any particular individual affected by them be a sufficient ground for remitting punishment in this they differ from private offences but agree with semipublic lxvi characters of class   or appendix composed of multiform or anomalous offences and containing offences by falsehood and offences concerning trust       taken collectively in the parcels marked out by their popular appellations they are incapable of being aggregated to any systematical method of distribution grounded upon the mischief of the offence   they may however be thrown into subdivisions which may be aggregated to such a method of distribution   these subdivisions will naturally and readily rank under the divisions of the several preceding classes of this system   each of the two great divisions of this class spreads itself in that manner over all the preceding classes   in some acts of this class the distinguishing circumstance which constitutes the essential character of the offence will in some instances enter necessarily in the character of a criminative circumstance into the constitution of the offence insomuch that without the intervention of this circumstance no offence at all of that denomination can be committed in other instances the offence may subsist without it and where it interferes it comes in as an accidental independent circumstance capable of constituting a ground of aggravation† chapter xix §   limits between private ethics and the art of legislation i so much for the division of offences in general now an offence is an act prohibited or what comes to the same thing an act of which the contrary is commanded by the law and what is it that the law can be employed in doing besides prohibiting and commanding it should seem then according to this view of the matter that were we to have settled what may be proper to be done with relation to offences we should thereby have settled every thing that may be proper to be done in the way of law yet that branch which concerns the method of dealing with offences and which is termed sometimes the criminal sometimes the penal branch is universally understood to be but one out of two branches which compose the whole subject of the art of legislation that which is termed the civil being the other‡ between these two branches then it is evident enough there cannot but be a very intimate connection so intimate is it indeed that the limits between them are by no means easy to mark out the case is the same in some degree between the whole business of legislation civil and penal branches taken together and that of private ethics of these several limits however it will be in a manner necessary to exhibit some idea lest on the one hand we should seem to leave any part of the subject that does belong to us untouched or on the other hand to deviate on any side into a track which does not belong to us in the course of this inquiry that part of it i mean which concerns the limits between the civil and the penal branch of law it will be necessary to settle a number of points of which the connection with the main question might not at first sight be suspected to ascertain what sort of a thing a law is what the parts are that are to be found in it what it must contain in order to be complete what the connection is between that part of a body of laws which belongs to the subject of procedure and the rest of the law at large—all these it will be seen are so many problems which must be solved before any satisfactory answer can be given to the main question above mentioned nor is this their only use for it is evident enough that the notion of a complete law must first be fixed before the legislator can in any case know what it is he has to do or when his work is done ii ethics at large may be defined the art of directing mens actions to the production of the greatest possible quantity of happiness on the part of those whose interest is in view iii what then are the actions which it can be in a mans power to direct they must be either his own actions or those of other agents ethics in as far as it is the art of directing a mans own actions may be styled the art of selfgovernment or private ethics iv what other agents then are there which at the same time that they are under the influence of mans direction are susceptible of happiness they are of two sorts   other human beings who are styled persons   other animals which on account of their interests having been neglected by the insensibility of the ancient jurists stand degraded into the class of things§ as to     other human beings the art of directing their actions to the above end is what we mean or at least the only thing which upon the principle of utility we ought to mean by the art of government which in as far as the measures it displays itself in are of a permanent nature is generally distinguished by the name of legislation as it is by that of administration when they are of a temporary nature determined by the occurrences of the day v now human creatures considered with respect to the maturity of their faculties are either in an adult or in a nonadult state the art of government in as far as it concerns the direction of the actions of persons in a nonadult state may be termed the art of education in as far as this business is entrusted with those who in virtue of some private relationship are in the main the best disposed to take upon them and the best able to discharge this office it may be termed the art of private education in as far as it is exercised by those whose province it is to superintend the conduct of the whole community it may be termed the art of public education vi as to ethics in general a mans happiness will depend in the first place upon such parts of his behaviour as none but himself are interested in in the next place upon such parts of it as may affect the happiness of those about him in as far as his happiness depends upon the firstmentioned part of his behaviour it is said to depend upon his duty to himself ethics then in as far as it is the art of directing a mans actions in this respect may be termed the art of discharging ones duty to ones self and the quality which a man manifests by the discharge of this branch of duty if duty it is to be called is that of prudence in as far as his happiness and that of any other person or persons whose interests are considered depends upon such parts of his behaviour as may affect the interests of those about him it may be said to depend upon his duty to others or to use a phrase now somewhat antiquated his duty to his neighbour ethics then in as far as it is the art of directing a mans actions in this respect may be termed the art of discharging ones duty to ones neighbour now the happiness of ones neighbour may be consulted in two ways   in a negative way by forbearing to diminish it   in a positive way by studying to increase it a mans duty to his neighbour is accordingly partly negative and partly positive to discharge the negative branch of it is probity to discharge the positive branch beneficence vii it may here be asked how it is that upon the principle of private ethics legislation and religion out of the question a mans happiness depends upon such parts of his conduct as affect immediately at least the happiness of no one but himself this is as much as to ask what motives independent of such as legislation and religion may chance to furnish can one man have to consult the happiness of another by what motives or which comes to the same thing by what obligations can he be bound to obey the dictates of probity and beneficence in answer to this it cannot but be admitted that the only interests which a man at all times and upon all     occasions is sure to find adequate motives for consulting are his own notwithstanding this there are no occasions in which a man has not some motives for consulting the happiness of other men in the first place he has on all occasions the purely social motive of sympathy or benevolence in the next place he has on most occasions the semisocial motives of love of amity and love of reputation the motive of sympathy will act upon him with more or less effect according to the bias of his sensibility the two other motives according to a variety of circumstances principally according to the strength of his intellectual powers the firmness and steadiness of his mind the quantum of his moral sensibility and the characters of the people he has to deal with viii now private ethics has happiness for its end and legislation can have no other private ethics concerns every member that is the happiness and the actions of every member of any community that can be proposed and legislation can concern no more thus far then private ethics and the art of legislation go hand in hand the end they have or ought to have in view is of the same nature the persons whose happiness they ought to have in view as also the persons whose conduct they ought to be occupied in directing are precisely the same the very acts they ought to be conversant about are even in a great measure the same where then lies the difference in that the acts which they ought to be conversant about though in a great measure are not perfectly and throughout the same there is no case in which a private man ought not to direct his own conduct to the production of his own happiness and of that of his fellowcreatures but there are cases in which the legislator ought not in a direct way at least and by means of punishment applied immediately to particular individual acts to attempt to direct the conduct of the several other members of the community every act which promises to be beneficial upon the whole to the community himself included each individual ought to perform of himself but it is not every such act that the legislator ought to compel him to perform every act which promises to be pernicious upon the whole to the community himself included each individual ought to abstain from of himself but it is not every such act that the legislator ought to compel him to abstain from ix where then is the line to be drawn—we shall not have far to seek for it the business is to give an idea of the cases in which ethics ought and in which legislation ought not in a direct manner at least to interfere if legislation interferes in a direct manner it must be by punishment† now the cases in which punishment meaning the punishment of the political sanction ought not to be inflicted have been already stated‡ if then there be any of these cases in which although legislation ought not private ethics does or ought to interfere these cases will serve to point out the limits between the two arts or branches of science these cases it may be remembered are of four sorts   where punishment would be groundless   where it would be inefficacious   where it would be unprofitable   where it would be needless let us look over all these cases and see whether in any of them there is room for the interference of private ethics at the same time that there is none for the direct interference of legislation x   first then as to the cases where punishment would be groundless in these cases it is evident that the restrictive interference of ethics would be groundless too it is because upon the whole there is no evil in the act that legislation ought not to endeavour to prevent it no more for the same reason ought private ethics xi   as to the cases in which punishment would be inefficacious these we may observe may be divided into two sets or classes the first do not depend at all upon the nature of the act they turn only upon a defect in the timing of the punishment the punishment in question is no more than what for any thing that appears ought to have been applied to the act in question it ought however to have been applied at a different time viz not till after it had been properly denounced these are the cases of an expostfacto law of a judicial sentence beyond the law and of a law not sufficiently promulgated the acts here in question then might for any thing that appears come properly under the department even of coercive legislation of course do they under that of private ethics as to the other set of cases in which punishment would be inefficacious neither do these depend upon the nature of the act that is of the sort of act they turn only upon some extraneous circumstances with which an act of any sort may chance to be accompanied these however are of such a nature as not only to exclude the application of legal punishment but in general to     leave little room for the influence of private ethics these are the cases where the will could not be deterred from any act even by the extraordinary force of artificial punishment as in the cases of extreme infancy insanity and perfect intoxication of course therefore it could not by such slender and precarious force as could be applied by private ethics the case is in this respect the same under the circumstances of unintentionality with respect to the event of the action unconsciousness with regard to the circumstances and missupposal with regard to the existence of circumstances which have not existed as also where the force even of extraordinary punishment is rendered inoperative by the superior force of a physical danger or threatened mischief it is evident that in these cases if the thunders of the law prove impotent the whispers of simple morality can have but little influence xii   as to the cases where punishment would be unprofitable these are the cases which constitute the great field for the exclusive interference of private ethics when a punishment is unprofitable or in other words too expensive it is because the evil of the punishment exceeds that of the offence now the evil of the punishment we may remember is distinguishable into four branches   the evil of coercion including constraint or restraint according as the act commanded is of the positive kind or the negative   the evil of apprehension   the evil of sufferance   the derivative evils resulting to persons in connection with those by whom the three abovementioned original evils are sustained now with respect to those original evils the persons who he exposed to them may be two very different sets of persons in the first place persons who may have actually committed or been prompted to commit the acts really meant to be prohibited in the next place persons who may have performed or been prompted to perform such other acts as they fear may be in danger of being involved in the punishment designed only for the former but of these two sets of acts it is the former only that are pernicious it is therefore the former only that it can be the business of private ethics to endeavour to prevent the latter being by the supposition not mischievous to prevent them is what it can no more be the business of ethics to endeavour at than of legislation it remains to show how it may happen that there should be acts really pernicious which although they may very properly come under the censure of private ethics may yet be no fit objects for the legislator to controul xiii punishment then as applied to delinquency may be unprofitable in both or either of two ways   by the expense it would amount to even supposing the application of it to be confined altogether to delinquency   by the danger there may be of its involving the innocent in the fate designed only for the guilty first then with regard to the cases in which the expense of the punishment as applied to the guilty would outweigh the profit to be made by it these cases it is evident depend upon a certain proportion between the evil of the punishment and the evil of the offence now were the offence of such a nature that a punishment which in point of magnitude should but just exceed the profit of it would be sufficient to prevent it it might be rather difficult perhaps to find an instance in which such punishment would clearly appear to be unprofitable but the fact is there are many cases in which a punishment in order to have any chance of being efficacious must in point of magnitude be raised a great deal above that level thus it is wherever the danger of detection is or what comes to the same thing is likely to appear to be so small as to make the punishment appear in a high degree uncertain in this case it is necessary as has been shown† if punishment be at all applied to raise it in point of magnitude as much as it falls short in point of certainty it is evident however that all this can be but guesswork and that the effect of such a proportion will be rendered precarious by a variety of circumstances by the want of sufficient promulgation on the part of the law‡ by the particular circumstances of the temptation∥ and by the circumstances influencing the sensibility of the several individuals who are exposed to it§ let the seducing motives be strong the offence then will at any rate be frequently committed now and then indeed owing to a coincidence of circumstances more or less extraordinary it will be detected and by that means punished but for the purpose of example which is the principal one an act of punishment considered in itself is of no use what use it can be of depends altogether upon the expectation it raises of similar punishment in future cases of similar delinquency but this future punishment it is evident must always depend upon detection if then the want of detection is such as must in general especially to eyes fascinated by the force of the seducing motives appear too improbable to be reckoned upon the punishment though it should be inflicted may come     to be of no use here then will be two opposite evils running on at the same time yet neither of them reducing the quantum of the other the evil of the disease and the evil of the painful and inefficacious remedy it seems to be partly owing to some such considerations that fornication for example or the illicit commerce between the sexes has commonly either gone altogether unpunished or been punished in a degree inferior to that in which on other accounts legislators might have been disposed to punish it xiv second with regard to the cases in which political punishment as applied to delinquency may be unprofitable in virtue of the danger there may be of its involving the innocent in the fate designed only for the guilty whence should this danger then arise from the difficulty there may be of fixing the idea of the guilty action that is of subjecting it to such a definition as shall be clear and precise enough to guard effectually against misapplication this difficulty may arise from either of two sources the one permanent to wit the nature of the actions themselves the other occasional i mean the qualities of the men who may have to deal with those actions in the way of government in as far as it arises from the latter of these sources it may depend partly upon the use which the legislator may be able to make of language partly upon the use which according to the apprehension of the legislator the judge may be disposed to make of it as far as legislation is concerned it will depend upon the degree of perfection to which the arts of language may have been carried in the first place in the nation in general in the next place by the legislator in particular it is to a sense of this difficulty as it should seem that we may attribute the caution with which most legislators have abstained from subjecting to censure on the part of the law such actions as come under the notion of rudeness for example or treachery or ingratitude the attempt to bring acts of so vague and questionable a nature under the controul of law will argue either a very immature age in which the difficulties which give birth to that danger are not descried or a very enlightened age in which they are overcome xv for the sake of obtaining the clearer idea of the limits between the art of legislation and private ethics it may now be time to call to mind the distinctions above established with regard to ethics in general the degree in which private ethics stands in need of the assistance of legislation is different in the three branches of duty above distinguished of the rules of moral duty those which seem to stand least in need of the assistance of legislation are the rules of prudence it can only be through some defect on the part of the understanding if a man be ever deficient in point of duty to himself if he does wrong there is nothing else that it can be owing to but either some inadvertence† or some missupposal† with regard to the circumstances on which his happiness depends it is a standing topic of complaint that a man knows too little of himself be it so but is it so certain that the legislator must know more‡∥ it is plain that of individuals the legislator can know nothing concerning those points of conduct which depend upon the particular circumstances of each individual it is plain therefore that he can determine nothing to advantage it is only with respect to those broad lines of conduct in which all persons or very large and permanent descriptions of persons may be in a way to engage that he can have any pretence for interfering and even here the propriety of his interference will in most instances lie very open to dispute at any rate he must never expect to produce a perfect compliance by the mere force of the sanction of which he is himself the author all he can hope to do is to increase the efficacy of private ethics by giving strength and direction to the influence of the moral sanction with what chance of success for example would a legislator go about to extirpate drunkenness and fornication by dint of legal punishment not all the tortures which ingenuity could invent would compass it and before he had made any progress worth regarding such a mass of evil would be produced by the punishment as would exceed a thousandfold the utmost possible mischief of the offence the great difficulty would be in the procuring evidence an object which could not be attempted with any probability     of success without spreading dismay through every family tearing the bonds of sympathy asunder† and rooting out the influence of all the social motives all that he can do then against offences of this nature with any prospect of advantage in the way of direct legislation is to subject them in cases of notoriety to a slight censure so as thereby to cover them with a slight shade of artificial disrepute xvi it may be observed that with regard to this branch of duty legislators have in general been disposed to carry their interference full as far as is expedient the great difficulty here is to persuade them to confine themselves within bounds a thousand little passions and prejudices have led them to narrow the liberty of the subject in this line in cases in which the punishment is either attended with no profit at all or with none that will make up for the expense xvii the mischief of this sort of interference is more particularly conspicuous in the article of religion the reasoning in this case is of the following stamp there are certain errors in matters of belief to which all mankind are prone and for these errors in judgment it is the determination of a being of infinite benevolence to punish them with an infinity of torments but from these errors the legislator himself is necessarily free for the men who happen to be at hand for him to consult with being men perfectly enlightened unfettered and unbiassed have such advantages over all the rest of the world that when they sit down to inquire out the truth relative to points so plain and so familiar as those in question they cannot fail to find it this being the case when the sovereign sees his people ready to plunge headlong into an abyss of fire shall he not stretch out a hand to save them such for example seems to have been the train of reasoning and such the motives which led lewis the xivth into those coercive measures which he took for the conversion of heretics and the confirmation of true believers the groundwork pure sympathy and lovingkindness the superstructure all the miseries which the most determined maevolence could have devised‡ but of this more fully in another place∥ xviii the rules of probity are those which in point of expediency stand most in need of assistance on the part of the legislator and in which in point of fact his interference has been most extensive there are few cases in which it would be expedient to punish a man for hurting himself but there are few cases if any in which it would not be expedient to punish a man for injuring his neighbour with regard to that branch of probity which is opposed to offences against property private ethics depends in a manner for its very existence upon legislation legislation must first determine what things are to be regarded as each mans property before the general rules of ethics on this head can have any particular application the case is the same with regard to offences against the state without legislation there would be no such things as a state no particular persons invested with powers to be exercised for the benefit of the rest it is plain therefore that in this branch the interference of the legislator cannot any where be dispensed with we must first know what are the dictates of legislation before we can know what are the dictates of private ethics§ xix as to the rules of beneficence these as far as concerns matters of detail must necessarily be abandoned in great measure to the jurisdiction of private ethics in many cases the beneficial quality of the act depends essentially upon the disposition of the agent that is upon the motives by which he appears to     have been prompted to perform it upon their belonging to the head of sympathy love of amity or love of reputation and not to any head of selfregarding motives brought into play by the force of political constraint in a word upon their being such as denominate his conduct free and voluntary according to one of the many senses given to those ambiguous expressions the limits of the law on this head seem however to be capable of being extended a good deal farther than they seem ever to have been extended hitherto in particular in cases where the person is in danger why should it not be made the duty of every man to save another from mischief when it can be done without prejudicing himself as well as to abstain from bringing it on him this accordingly is the idea pursued in the body of the work† xx to conclude this section let us recapitulate and bring to a point the difference between private ethics considered as an art or science on the one hand and that branch of jurisprudence which contains the art or science of legislation on the other private ethics teaches how each man may dispose himself to pursue the course most conducive to his own happiness by means of such motives as offer of themselves the art of legislation which may be considered as one branch of the science of jurisprudence teaches how a multitude of men composing a community may be disposed to pursue that course which upon the whole is the most conducive to the happiness of the whole community by means of motives to be applied by the legislator we come now to exhibit the limits between penal and civil jurisprudence for this purpose it may be of use to give a distinct though summary view of the principal branches into which jurisprudence considered in its utmost extent is wont to be divided §   jurisprudence its branches xxi jurisprudence is a fictitious entity nor can any meaning be found for the word but by placing it in company with some word that shall be significative of a real entity to know what is meant by jurisprudence we must know for example what is meant by a book of jurisprudence a book of jurisprudence can have but one or the other of two objects   to ascertain what the law‡ is   to ascertain what it ought to be in the former case it may be styled a book of expository jurisprudence in the latter a book of censorial jurisprudence or in other words a book on the art of legislation xxii a book of expository jurisprudence is either authoritative or unauthoritative it is styled authoritative when it is composed by him who by representing the state of the law to be so and so causeth it so to be that is of the legislator himself unauthoritative when it is the work of any other person at large xxiii now law or the law taken indefinitely is an abstract and collective term which when it means any thing can mean neither more nor less than the sum total of a number of individual laws taken together∥ it follows that of whatever other modifications the subject of a book of jurisprudence is susceptible they must all of them be taken from some circumstance or other of which such individual laws or the assemblages into which they may be sorted are susceptible the circumstances that have given rise to the principal branches of jurisprudence we are wont to hear of seem to be as follow   the extent of the laws in question in point of dominion   the political quality of the persons     whose conduct they undertake to regulate   the time of their being in force   the manner in which they are expressed   the concern which they have with the article of punishment xxiv in the first place in point of extent what is delivered concerning the laws in question may have reference either to the laws of such or such a nation or nations in particular or to the laws of all nations whatsoever in the first case the book may be said to relate to local in the other to universal jurisprudence now of the infinite variety of nations there are upon the earth there are no two which agree exactly in their laws certainly not in the whole perhaps not even in any single article and let them agree today they would disagree tomorrow this is evident enough with regard to the substance of the laws and it would be still more extraordinary if they agreed in point of form that is if they were conceived in precisely the same strings of words what is more as the languages of nations are commonly different as well as their laws it is seldom that strictly speaking they have so much as a single word in common however among the words that are appropriated to the subject of law there are some that in all languages are pretty exactly correspondent to one another which comes to the same thing nearly as if they were the same of this stamp for example are those which correspond to the words power right obligation liberty and many others it follows that if there are any books which can properly speakin be styled books of universal jurisprudence they must be looked for within very narrow limits among such as are expository there can be none that are authoritative nor even as far as the substance of the laws is concerned any that are unauthoritative to be susceptible of an universal application all that a book of the expository kind can have to treat of is the import of words to be strictly speaking universal it must confine itself to terminology accordingly the definitions which there has been occasion here and there to intersperse in the course of the present work and particularly the definition hereafter given of the word law may be considered as matter belonging to the head of universal jurisprudence thus far in strictness of speech though in point of usage where a man in laying down what he apprehends to be the law extends his views to a few of the nations with which his own is most connected it is common enough to consider what he writes as relating to universal jurisprudence it is in the censorial line that there is the greatest room for disquisitions that apply to the circumstances of all nations alike and in this line what regards the substance of the laws in question is as susceptible of an universal application as what regards the words that the laws of all nations or even of any two nations should coincide in all points would be as ineligible as it is impossible some leading points however there seem to be in respect of which the laws of all civilized nations might without inconvenience be the same to mark out some of these points will as far as it goes be the business of the body of this work xxv in the second place with regard to the political quality of the persons whose conduct is the object of the law these may on any given occasion be considered either as members of the same state or as members of different states in the first case the law may be referred to the head of internal in the second case to that of international jurisprudence now as to any transactions which may take place between individuals who are subjects of different states these are regulated by the internal laws and decided upon by the internal tribunals of the one or the other of those states the case is the same where the sovereign of the one has any immediate transactions with a private member of the other the sovereign reducing himself pro re natâ to the condition of a private person as often as he submits his cause to either tribunal whether by claiming a benefit or defending himself against a burthen there remain then the mutual transactions between sovereigns as such for the subject of that branch of jurisprudence which may be properly and exclusively termed international†   0 with what degree of propriety rules for the conduct of persons of this description can come under the appellation of laws is a question that must rest till the nature of the thing called a law shall have been more particularly unfolded it is evident enough that international jurisprudence may as well as internal be censorial as well as expository unauthoritative as well as authoritative xxvi internal jurisprudence again may either concern all the members of a state indiscriminately or such of them only as are connected in the way of residence or otherwise with a particular district jurisprudence is accordingly sometimes distinguished into national and provincial but as the epithet provincial is hardly applicable to districts so small as many of those which have laws of their own are wont to be such as towns parishes and manors the term local where universal jurisprudence is plainly out of the question or the term particular though this latter is not very characteristic might either of them be more commodious xxvii third with respect to time in a work of the expository kind the laws that are in question may either be such as are still in force at the time when the book is writing or such as have ceased to be in force in the latter case the subject of it might be termed ancient in the former present or living jurisprudence that is if the substantive jurisprudence and no other must at any rate be employed and that with an epithet in both cases but the truth is that a book of the former kind is rather a book of history than a book of jurisprudence and if the word jurisprudence be expressive of the subject it is only with some such words as history or antiquities prefixed and as the laws which are any where in question are supposed if nothing appears to the contrary to be those which are in force no such epithet as that of present or living commonly appears where a book is so circumstanced that the laws which form the subject of it though in force at the time of its being written are in force no longer that book is neither a book of living jurisprudence nor a book on the history of jurisprudence it is no longer the former and it never was the latter it is evident that owing to the changes which from time to time must take place in a greater or less degree in every body of laws every book of jurisprudence which is of an expository nature must in the course of a few years come to partake more or less of this condition the most common and most useful object of a history of jurisprudence is to exhibit the circumstances that have attended the establishment of laws actually in force but the exposition of the dead laws which have been superseded is inseparably interwoven with that of the living ones which have superseded them the great use of both these branches of science is to furnish examples for the art of legislation† xxviii fourthly in point of expression the laws in question may subsist either in the form of statute or in that of customary law as to the difference between these two branches which respects only the article of form or expression it cannot properly be made appear till some progress has been made in the definition of a law xxix last the most intricate distinction of all and that which comes most frequently on the carpet is that which is made between the civil branch of jurisprudence and the penal which latter is wont in certain circumstances to receive the name of criminal what is a penal code of laws what a civil code of what nature are their contents     is it that there are two sorts of laws the one penal the other civil so that the laws in a penal code are all penal laws while the laws in a civil code are all civil laws or is it that in every law there is some matter which is of a penal nature and which therefore belongs to the penal code and at the same time other matter which is of a civil nature and which therefore belongs to the civil code or is it that some laws belong to one code or the other exclusively while others are divided between the two to answer these questions in any manner that shall be tolerably satisfactory it will be necessary to ascertain what a law is meaning one entire but single law and what are the parts into which a law as such is capable of being distinguished or in other words to ascertain what the properties are that are to be found in every object which can with propriety receive the appellation of a law this then will be the business of the third and fourth sections what concerns the import of the word criminal as applied to law will be discussed separately in the fifth                 essay on the promulgation of laws and the reasons thereof with specimen of a penal code         i promulgation of the laws let us suppose the general code completed and that the seal of the sovereign has been set to it what remains to be done that a law may be obeyed it is necessary that it should be known that it may be known it is necessary that it be promulgated but to promulgate a law it is not only necessary that it should be published with the sound of trumpet in the streets not only that it should be read to the people not only even that it should be printed all these means may be good but they may be all employed without accomplishing the essential object they may possess more of the appearance than the reality of promulgation to promulgate a law is to present it to the minds of those who are to be governed by it in such manner as that they may have it habitually in their memories and may possess every facility for consulting it if they have any doubts respecting what it prescribes there are many methods of attaining this end none of them ought to be neglected but it has been too common to neglect them all the forgetfulness of legislators in this respect has exceeded every thing which could have been imagined i speak more particularly of modern legislators we shall find models deserving of imitation in antiquity and it is astonishing that the example which should have had the greatest weight among christian nations should have had scarcely any influence in this respect they have borrowed from moses laws which possessed only a relative and local utility but they have not imitated him in that which bears the noblest character of wisdom and which is suited to all times and all places it is said by some naturalists that the ostrich is among the most stupid of birds inasmuch as it leaves its eggs in the sand unmindful that the passing foot may crush them if this were true bacon who has converted into sources of wisdom so many of the ancient fables might have turned it into an apologue and the legislator who after having framed his laws abandons their promulgation to chance and thinks that his task is finished when the most important of his duties has only begun would have been represented by the ostrich it is true that before laws can be promulgated they must exist that which is called unwritten law which consists of rules of jurisprudence is a law which governs without existing the learned may exercise their ingenuity in guessing at it but the unlearned citizen can never know it were these rules to receive an authentic form and to be promulgated they would no longer be mere rules but would become real laws to render them such has been one of the great objects of my plan and the facility of promulgation has been one of the principal objects which i have had in view it is with this view that i have divided the general code into particular codes that they may be separated or collected together according to the powers and wants of the individuals whom they respectively concern to promulgate the english laws as they exist at present to pile the decisions of the judges upon the top of the statutes of parliament would be chimerical it would be to present the sea to those that thirst it would do nothing for the mass of the people who would not be able to comprehend them a point say the mathematicians has no parts so neither are there any parts in chaos if the laws be good it is desirable that they should be known if otherwise the knowledge of them may be mischievous for example if you leave in your code bad coercive laws persecuting laws it is well that     they remain undiscovered by informers if your laws of procedure favour the impunity of crimes if they afford means of eluding justice of evading taxes of cheating creditors it is well that they remain unknown but what other system of legislation besides this will gain by being unknown there are some laws which seem to have a natural notoriety such are those which concern crimes against individuals as theft personal injuries fraud murder c but this notoriety does not extend to the punishment which however is the motive upon which the legislature relies for procuring obedience to the law it does not extend even to those circumstances often so delicate which must be noticed before the line of demarcation can be traced among so many crimes differently punished nor even to those actions which are either innocent or meritorious the dissemination of the laws ought to be regulated by the number of persons whom they concern the universal code ought to be promulgated to all the particular codes ought to be set before the classes to which they respectively refer a roadbook is useful but it is of most use to those who are to be guided by its regulations and who wish to travel the universal code of all secular books would be the most valuable and almost the only one necessary for all if not as a book of law at least as a book of morals the sacred books command men to be honest a good code would explain in what justice consists and would exhibit in what manner it was possible to be unjust probity prudence benevolence these are the subjects of morality the law ought however to include all that relates to probity all that teaches men to live together without injuring each other there will then remain for morality prudence and benevolence but secure probity and prudence will have fewer snares to escape and will walk more securely prevent men from injuring one another and benevolence will have fewer sufferings to relieve methods of promulgating the universal code schools it ought to be made the chief book one of the first objects of instruction in all schools it formed the foundation of instruction among the hebrews and tradition relates that the jewish kings were required to make a copy of the whole law with their own hands in those cases in which a certain degree of education is required as a prerequisite to the enjoyment of a certain employment the aspirant might be required to produce an exact copy of the code written with his own hand or translated into a foreign language the most important parts of it might be committed to memory and repeated as a catechism that for example which contains the definition of offences and the reasons for their being ranged into classes in this manner before sixteen years of age without hindrance to any other studies the pupils in public schools would become more conversant with the laws of their country than those lawyers at present are whose hair has grown grey in the contentions of the bar the change would arise out of the nature of the laws themselves the pupils might translate the national code into the dead languages they might translate them into the living languages they might turn them into verse the mother tongue of the laws teach your children said an ancient philosopher what they ought to know when they are men and not what they ought to forget this philosopher would not have condemned the new study i propose churches why should not the reading of the laws form as it did among the jews a part of divine service would not the association of ideas be beneficial would it not be well to represent the supreme being as the protector of the laws of property and security would it not add dignity to the ceremony if the laws respecting parents and children were read upon the performance of baptism and the laws respecting husbands and wives at the time of marriage this public reading in places of worship would be as respects the most ignorant classes a means of instruction as little costly as it would be interesting and the code would be unnecessarily voluminous if it would not be possible to read it through many times in the year different places the laws which only concern certain places as markets theatres highways ought to be fixed up in the places themselves where it is desirable that they should be present to the minds of those who have to observe them there are few men who would dare to violate a law speaking as it were to all eyes and addressing itself to all as to so many witnesses upon whom it would call to bear testimony against the evil doer translations if the nation which ought to obey the same laws is composed of different peoples speaking different languages it is proper that an authentic translation of the code should be made into each of these languages it is also proper that it should be translated into the languages of the principal nations of europe     the interests of these nations are so mingled that they have all occasion to understand the laws of the others besides it would prevent a stranger from falling into those faults which he might otherwise commit through ignorance of the law and also guard him from the snares which otherwise might be laid for him by abusing his ignorance hence would arise security for commerce and confidence in transactions among foreign nations it is a proceeding called for by candour and honesty have you any thing contrary to the ordinances of the king is the foolish and insidious question asked at many customhouses of the stranger who perhaps for the first time enters the kingdom how should he know those ordinances he might reply does the king himself know them my reply may constitute either a snare or an offence show me your ordinances in my own language and then if i deceive you punish me particular codes in taking up a condition every citizen should be obliged to provide himself with the code which relates to that condition the code according to its extent should be printed as a book or on a sheet in those cases in which the whole code cannot be printed on a sheet an abridgement or index to it ought so to be this sheet should be required to be stuck up in a fixed place and its exhibition in this manner should be made a matter of police as it respects shops places of amusement theatres c the rogues would doubtless be disposed to throw a veil over so unwelcome a witness against them in the same manner as certain devotees are reported to have done when they wished not to be seen by their saints laws concerning contracts there is one species of promulgation specially adapted to agreements among individuals and to wills with regard to things of sufficient value it might be required that they should be written upon stamped paper which should bear upon its margin a notice of the laws concerning the transaction to which it referred this plan is borrowed from english jurisprudence but the instances in which it has been employed are very few in comparison with those in which it has been neglected and in which it would have been equally useful i have gathered with carefulness this precious seed that its cultivation may be extended ii promulgation of reasons for writing laws it is enough to know how to write for establishing them it is only necessary to possess power the difficulty consists in establishing good laws now good laws are those for which good reasons are assignable but it is one thing to have established good laws justifiable by good reasons another thing to have discovered those reasons and to have presented them to view in the most advantageous light a third problem yet more difficult of solution is to find a common base for all the laws one unique and clear principle to shew their harmony with it to dispose them in the best order to give them the greatest simplicity and the greatest clearness of which they are susceptible to find an isolated reason for a law is to do nothing a comparative balance for and against is desirable since we cannot rely with confidence upon a reason unless we can be assured that there is nothing stronger to oppose to it in a contrary direction to the present time reasons have been regarded as works of supererogation we need not be astonished at this legislators have been hitherto directed upon the most important points by a species of instinct they have felt an evil they have confusedly sought for a remedy laws have been made nearly in the same manner as the first towns were built to look for a plan among these heaps of ordinances would be like searching for an order of architecture amidst the huts of a village will it be believed that it has been laid down as a principle that a law ought only to bear a character of absolute authority lord chancellor bacon the great restorer of learning will not allow that reasons should be assigned because it might lead to disputes concerning the law† he might perhaps have felt that the best reasons he could have given would have been found imperfect he had no desire to satisfy the people no inclination to take the pains necessary for satisfying them besides this in his time the wisdom of kings scarcely differed from the divine stet pro ratione voluntas was their motto it must be acknowledged that at the period at which bacon lived the notions respecting the principles of law were too imperfect to serve as the foundation of a reasonable system he was more qualified than any one to expose the fallacy of the best reasons which could have been assigned for the greater part of the then existing laws and therefore he might fear to expose them to a trial which they could not sustain but this is no ground for fear that laws founded upon reasons based in utility will be liable to be thus overthrown when such a code shall have been accomplished   0 should all the lawyers in the world attack it with keenest appetites what would be the result they would be like vipers biting at a file there would have been many more codes supported by reasons if those who have made the laws had believed themselves to be as superior in information to their fellowmen as they felt themselves to be in power those who had felt themselves furnished with strength to enter upon the career would not have renounced this more flattering part of their employment if there had been no occasion to satisfy the people they would have been desirous of satisfying themselves they would have felt that it was not right to assume infallibility at the same moment that they renounced the guidance of reason those who are able to convince men will treat them like men those who only command avow their inability to convince it is difficult if not impossible that the composition and sanction of a code of laws should proceed from the same hand the situation in which a sovereign is placed the kind of life to which he is accustomed the duties he has to fulfil absolutely exclude him from the knowledge of the details which such a work demands engaged in the labyrinths of jurisprudence a cæsar a charlemagne a frederick would appear no more than an ordinary man it is therefore impossible that such a work should be the result of the personal knowledge of a sovereign suppose a perfect code framed the sovereign who should recognise its merit and give it his support would rank above all other sovereigns he would not however be considered the author of the reasons by which the code was attended these would have proceeded from the hand which penned them the compiler of the code and the sovereign would each have their parts to act before the public you tell me might the latter say that the laws you have framed are only good and wise and it is well subject them to the proof sire might the compiler reply the laws which i have proposed are not the product of caprice there is not a syllable which i have put there for which there did not appear to me a good and conclusive reason not a single regulation which did not appear to me the best that could be adopted under the present circumstances of your people permit me then to add my reasons throughout the whole of your code by no other means can you be so completely assured of their merit or i who have adopted or invented them or the people who will have to obey them besides if the name of the sovereign has most influence upon the present generation that of the compiler will have most with the generations to come power whilst living may ally itself with the reputation of wisdom but this union is dissolved by death the veneration for great talents is increased when the foibles of the individual are forgotten and when the dread of rivalry no longer exists the veneration which thus attaches to the man of genius who is dead will serve to protect his labours against precipitate change we proceed to consider in greater detail the different advantages which would result from a constant and sustained application of this method an innovation always requires to be justified an innovation which extends to the entire system of the laws requires the strongest reasons for its justification we may observe then in general that if the laws were constantly accompanied with a commentary of reasons they would better fulfil the design of the legislator in all respects they would be more pleasantly studied more easily known more constantly retained and more cordially approved all these desirable effects are intimately connected among themselves and the attainment of either is one step towards obtaining the others if the study of the law is dry it arises much less from the nature of the subject than from the manner in which it has been treated that which renders books of jurisprudence so dry and wearisome is the confusion the want of connection the appearance of caprice the difficulty of discovering any reason and the barbarous nomenclature of the mass of incoherent and contradictory laws compilers have made their works an exercise of patience and have addressed them only to the memory the laws presented under this austere form appear only to require obedience and never lay aside their severity let the laws be accompanied by justificatory reasons this will shed a portion of interest over the laws themselves and make the study of them agreeable in reading the laws we shall then learn to think and shall discover the solution of many enigmas which had previously been inexplicable to us by this means we shall enlarge and strengthen our minds we shall be admitted into the counsels as it were of the philosophers and sages who have framed the laws and shall find in their works a manual of philosophy and morals the truths developed in the laws are interesting and when they shall thus have been clearly arranged and their connection exhibited this study will become interesting to the young instead of repulsive even to those who are compelled to engage in it when it shall be shown to be connected with reason and philosophy and shall have been rendered easy of acquisition it will even become a disgrace not to be acquainted with it this exposition of reasons will render the laws more easily understood a rule the reason of which is unknown takes no hold upon the understanding those things are best comprehended of which we know the why and the wherefore the terms of law     may be clear and familiar add to them the reason of the law and the light is increased no doubt rests upon the real intention of the legislator the mind of the reader holds immediate communion with the mind of the author the more clearly the laws are understood the more easily will they be retained the reasons annexed will serve as a kind of technical memory they will serve as a species of cement by which to unite all those regulations which would otherwise appear as fragments and dispersed ruins the reasons themselves would serve as a kind of guide in those cases in which the law was unknown it would be possible to judge beforehand what its regulations would be and by knowing the principles of the legislator to place oneself by imagination in his situation to divine or conjecture his will in the same manner as we conjecture what would be the determination of a reasonable being with whom we had long lived and with whose maxims we were well acquainted but the greatest advantage is that which results from conciliating the approbation of all minds by satisfying the public judgment and obtaining obedience to the laws not from a passive principle of blind fear alone but with the concurrence of the will also when the people are dreaded reasons are sometimes offered to them but this extraordinary method rarely succeeds because it is extraordinary the people suspect there is some intention to deceive they are put upon their guard and yield rather to their mistrust than to their judgment without reasons all laws may be condemned or defended with equal blindness if we listen to innovators the most salutary law will be designated as tyrannical if we listen to a crowd of lawyers the most absurd law if its origin be unknown will pass for wisdom itself exhibit the reasons of the laws and you disarm all cheats and fanatics because thus you will give to all discussions respecting the laws a clear and determinate object there is the law there is the reason assigned for that law is it a good reason is it bad the question is reduced to this simple issue but those who have studied the progress of political quarrels know that the object of the heads of parties especially is to avoid this fatal shoal this examination of utility personalities antiquity law of nature laws of nations and a thousand other terms of this kind have been invented as a means of preventing recourse to this short method of shortening and resolving controversies if the laws were founded upon reason they would infuse themselves so to speak into the minds of the people they would form part of the logic of the people they would extend their influence over their moral nature the code of public opinion would be formed by analogy upon the code of the laws and by the agreement between the man and the citizen obedience to the laws would come to be hardly distinguishable from the feeling of liberty the commentary of reasons would be of great utility in the application of the laws it would be a compass for the judges and all government functionaries the reason assigned would unceasingly direct back to the intention of the legislator all those who wandered from it a false interpretation would not square with this reason unintentional errors would become almost impossible prevarications could not be hidden the whole course of the law would be enlightened and the citizens would judge the judges in a point of view still more enlarged the adoption of this plan is recommended by its influence upon the perfection of the law the necessity of furnishing a sufficient reason for every law would be a preservative against a blind routine on the one hand and a restraint to every thing arbitrary on the other if you are required to state your reason for each proposition it will be necessary to think instead of to copy to possess clear ideas and to admit nothing without proof there will no longer be any opportunity for preserving in the laws fantastic distinctions useless regulations unnecessary restraints inconsistencies will become too prominent the disproportion between good and evil will become too offensive the most defective parts will continually tend towards amelioration upon the plan of the most perfect those parts which have attained the highest possible degree of perfection will never lose it a good reason for their existence will always prove a safeguard which will defend them against precipitate and capricious changes a phalanx so strong will daunt the most audacious innovator the strength of the reason will become the strength of the law it will act as an anchor to prevent the vessel from being driven about by the force of the winds or being insensibly drawn aside by the currents it may be said that the laws and especially the most essential laws are founded on such palpable truths that it is unnecessary to prove them the end of reasoning is conviction but if complete conviction already exist for what purpose employ reasoning to produce it there are truths which it is necessary to prove not for their own sakes because they are acknowledged but that an opening may be made for the reception of other truths which depend upon them it is necessary to demonstrate certain palpable truths in order that others which may depend upon them may be adopted it is in this manner we provide for the reception of first principles which     once received prepare the way for the admission of all other truths all the world acknowledges that assassination is an evil action its punishment ought to be severe every body is agreed again if it is necessary to analyze the mischievous effects of assassination it will be necessary as a step towards bringing men to acknowledge the fitness of the law which distinguishes between different species of assassination that it may only punish them according to their respective degrees of malignity that those actions which bear the exterior characters of assassination but do not produce its bitter fruits may either not be punished or only punished in a less degree for example suicide duelling infanticide murder after violent provocation c in the same manner it is necessary to expose the evil of theft not that men may be led to agree that theft is an evil but that they may be led to acknowledge a multitude of other truths which without this demonstration would still be neglected it is necessary that a variety of actions may be collected together under this head of crime which have been hitherto neglected and for detaching others which have no sufficient relation with crimes of this class in a word it is necessary for the purpose of collecting all the true and genuine species and rejecting all the spurious in order to establish the grounds for appointing different degrees of punishment why should the laws of one state be unknown in every other they have been thrown together at hazard without connection and without arrangement there is no common measure among them without doubt there are cases in which diversity of situation may demand diversity of legislation but these cases can only exist in a few instances and those much fewer than is usually imagined in this respect it will be proper to distinguish between an absolute and a temporary necessity an absolute necessity is founded upon circumstances that cannot change a temporary necessity is founded upon accidental circumstances which may change if there be one method better calculated than another to bring nations more nearly together this which i propose of a system of laws founded upon reasons clearly announced is one the free communication of knowledge will propagate this system in all directions the instant it is created such a system of legislation will prepare for itself a universal dominion since philosophers have begun to compare the laws of different nations when they have been able to divine any reason to observe any relation of resemblance or of contrast it has been a species of discovery if legislators had been guided by the principle of utility these researches would have been without an object the laws derived from the same principle tending towards the same object would no longer present systems more ingenious than solid in which we have to seek to find any reason at all and in which when any one fancies he finds a reason for a law he thinks the law is justified montesquieu has often misled his readers he employs all his mind that is to say a mind of the first order in discovering amid the chaos of laws the reasons which may have influenced the legislators he has been desirous of lending them a wisdom of intention in institutions the most contradictory and the most extravagant but when we agree with him that he has discovered their true motives at what conclusion do we arrive they acted upon a reason but was this a good reason if it were good in some respects was it the best reason if they had made a law directly opposed to it would they not have done better such is the examination which always remains to be made such is the examination to which he scarcely ever descends the science of legislation though it has made but little progress is much more simple than one would be led to believe after reading montesquieu the principle of utility directs all reasons to a single centre the reasons which apply to the detail of arrangements are only subordinate views of utility in the civil law reasons should be drawn from four sources that is to say from the four objects according to which the legislator ought to regulate his conduct in the distribution of private laws subsistence abundance equality security in penal laws the reasons should be drawn from the nature of the evil of offences and from that of the remedies of which they are susceptible these remedies are of four kinds preventive remedies suppressive remedies satisfactive remedies penal remedies in the law of procedure the reasons should equally derive their source from the different ends which ought to be kept in view correctness of judgment quickness and economy in financial law the reasons should be drawn from two principal objects saving in expense in order to avoid the evil of constraint choice of the tax in order to avoid its accessory inconveniencies there are some parts of the law in which the custom of assigning reasons has been followed to a certain point in matters of police of finance and political economy their objects are modern it has been necessary to create every thing nothing relating to them being found in the ancient laws what has been done has been not only an invention but a positive opposition to ancient usages and prejudices hence it has been necessary to combat them it has been necessary that authority should justify itself such was the     origin of those preambles to their laws which procured so much credit to m turgot and m neckar but there are much more important branches of legislation in which it has not been customary to assign any reasons the civil code the penal code the code of procedure if it has not been done it is not that they have not dared to do it but because they knew not how lawyers have among themselves a peculiar language technical reasons conventional fictions a logic current at the bar but they have an indistinct perception that the public will not receive it with the same complacency as themselves that they will not be satisfied with the same jargon if the chancellors of kings had been such men as turgot and neckar they like them would have felt more pride in giving their reasons than in making their edicts in making laws it is only necessary to occupy a certain position in order to make a reasonable law and to give reasons for it it is requisite that the party be worthy of that position but an isolated reason is a mere trifle the reasons for the laws if they are good are so connected that unless they have been prepared for the whole body they cannot with certainty be given for any part hence in order to present in the most advantageous manner the reason for a single law it is necessary that the plan of a system of reasons for all the laws should have been formed it is necessary previously to have laid the foundation of a reasonable system of morality to have analyzed the principle of utility and to have separated it from the two false principles of sympathy and antipathy to give a reason for a law is to show that it is conformable to the principle of utility in accordance with this principle the repugnance which a certain action inspires is not a sufficient ground for its prohibition such a prohibition would only be founded upon the principle of antipathy the satisfaction which another action affords to us is not a sufficient ground for a law authorising its performance such a law would be only founded upon the principle of sympathy the principal business of the laws the only business which is evidently and incontestibly necessary is the preventing of individuals from pursuing their own happiness by the destruction of a greater portion of the happiness of others to impose restraints upon the individual for his own welfare is the business of education the duty of the old towards the young of the keeper towards the madman it is rarely the duty of the legislator towards the people it is not a merely speculative idea which is thus recommended a system of penal laws has been thus sketched out and accompanied with a commentary of reasons by which even the least important regulations are justified i am so convinced of the necessity of this exposition of reasons that i would not dispense with one of them at any price to confide in what is called a feeling of justice a feeling of truth is a source of error i have seen upon a thousand occasions that the greatest mistakes are concealed in all those feelings which are not brought to the touchstone of examination if this feeling this first guide the avant courier of the mind be correct it will always be possible to translate it into the language of reason pains and pleasures as i have repeatedly shown are the only clear sources of ideas in morals these ideas may be rendered familiar to all the world the catechism of reasons is worthless if it cannot be made the catechism of the people i add here as an example of this theory the first chapter of the penal code i have not however given the whole of it nor inserted all the forms and references which it ought to have if it formed a part of the code itself this species of precision would be superfluous here this example may also serve as a

injuryf when without lawful cause an individual seeing another in danger abstains from helping himg and the evil happens in consequence punishments   fine at the discretion of the tribunal   imprisonment at the option and discretion of the tribunal   security for good conduct this also at option and discretion   in very grave cases banishment from the presence of the party injured for a time or for ever this also at option and discretion   costs at option and discretion nb each of these articles requires references to the different sections of the general head of punishments there the phrases at option and discretion should be explained at option is a concise method of expressing that it will be lawful for the judge either to employ this punishment or not at discretion signifies that the judge ought to employ a certain portion of this punishment with this limitation that he should employ so much or so little as shall be conformable to the general rules prescribed to him under the general head of punishments‡ aggravations   superiority of age when the offended person is older than the offender   sex when the party injured is a female and the delinquent a male the extraportion of the punishment ought to consist of a characteristic penance at the choice of the tribunal with greater or less publicity at its discretion   weakness when the party injured is the inferior either as respects natural strength or difference of weapons so that he had no chance of defending himself with success       numbers when on account of the number of aggressors resistance was unequal or impossible   parental relation when the party injured stands in the relation of father or mother grandfather or grandmother to the delinquent the delinquent in such case should always in addition to the ordinary punishment undergo a penance more or less public upon the stool of repentance with his hands tied above his head and an inscription stating his offence   quasipaternity when the delinquent is a minor and the party injured his guardian his preceptor or his master he who brings us up is a second parent this circumstance will still have some force but it will be less when the delinquent has attained his majority if there be no ground of extenuation an extra portion of characteristic punishment should be awarded as for a like injury done to a parent   premeditation the longer an offence is premeditated the greater is the aggravation it is written let not the sun go down upon your wrath   nocturnal irruption this is the case when the premeditated offence is committed at night after being concealed on the premises to wait a favourable opportunity or when the offender has broken in or has attempted to break into the dwelling of the party injured the extra portion of punishment should be characteristical at the option of the tribunal and attended with more or less publicity at discretion   ambuscade as when an offender makes a sudden attack upon his adversary when unprepared as if for example he hide himself behind a wall a hedge or in a hollow way or spreads his snare by night  0 violation of asylum    violation of sleep    clandestinity as when the delinquent endeavours to hide himself or to evade by other means the pursuit of justice    disguise as when the delinquent either by wearing a mask or other clothes than his own seeks to render himself unknown as an extrapunishment he may be exposed to a penance more or less public in an iron mask or in a dress similar to that in which he had disguised himself†    salary when the delinquent has been hired to commit the crime a characteristic punishment would be a more or less public exhibition of the delinquent with the wages of his iniquity suspended about his neck there are some cases in which this punishment ought not to be inflicted unless the offence is a very grave one the first is when it has not been premeditated and when the suborner can shew some provocation received the second is when the suborner thus provoked is the weaker or of a superior rank to the party injured    project of coercion when the object of the offence is to compel the party injured to do or not to do a certain thing the offence nevertheless not being a theft or an act of clandestine or violent destruction extra punishment characteristic punishment the extortion press the cap of repentance these at option of the tribunal fine even to the whole of his property confinement banishment forced labour limited or perpetual these at discretion extenuations when the delinquent has really received or sincerely believes himself to have received a provocation from the party injured this may be a source of extenuation that which constitutes the provocation is a wrong this wrong may be of a legal or moral kind explanations the sincere persuasion of even an imaginary wrong furnishes some degree of extenuation it is of no consequence whether the erroneous supposition in this case rest upon a point of fact or a point of law it turns upon a point of fact when you believe that you have received a certain damage from your adversary and he has really not done it to you it turns upon a point of law when you believe that he has no right to do you a certain damage and he really has the right to do it it is of no consequence to whom the wrong in question immediately refers whether to the party himself provoked or to any person particularly dear to him or to the public in general for the interests of the public ought to be dear to every one or to the person himself who gave the provocation for each individual should be dear to every man consequently if you think you see any one plunging into vice and the vexation with which you resent his evil conduct lead you to strike him it is a less crime than if you had struck him in the course of a quarrel arising out of your own interests the wrong done may be either moral or legal a legal wrong is one which is punishable     by the laws a moral wrong may be any act whether punishable by the laws or not which being hurtful to the party injured is liable to be punished by the censure of the world for example an act of violence of perfidy or of ingratitude general observation the extenuation furnished by provocation is greatest in proportion to the following circumstances   the gravity of the wrong   the recentness of its date   the difficulty which the injured party might have in obtaining legal redress explanations the gravity of the wrong upon this occasion ought not to be estimated simply according to the evil of such an offence to society in general but with a view to its tendency particularly to excite resentment consequently a personal insult or an act of defamation constitutes a strongerprovocation than a theft the date of a provocation requires some particular remarks at the same distance of time a provocation may be more or less lively according to its magnitude that which weighs down the heart may be yet recent whilst another which is lighter in comparison may be forgotten however as a boundary is requisite a provocation ought not to be esteemed recent if more than a month have elapsed between the time of its receipt and the occurrence of the fact to which it is alleged to have given rise a provocation should be dated not from the time when it occurred but from the time when it came to the knowledge of the party injured and even every circumstance adding much to the malignity of the action and only becoming known after the other parts had been known should be deemed a renewal of the provocation thus if after having learned that a man had beaten your son—a month afterwards you should learn that your son had lost an arm in consequence of the blows or that a man with arms had fallen upon your son who was disarmed and that he had struck him after he asked for quarter if you should attack this man in consequence and beat him the provocation in this case ought to be deemed recent thus a train of distinct provocations which are all recent with respect one to another and of which the last is recent with relation to the fact in question ought all to be esteemed recent in relation to this fact this succession is what properly constitutes the unity of the quarrel second extenuation if a man in defending his person or his property from attack does more injury to his adversary than was necessary for its defence the surplus is an injury but an injury susceptible of excuse in consequence of the provocation this is even the most favourable case since it is not only recent but immediate in judging whether an attack could be repulsed with less evil to the aggressor it is necessary to place oneself in the place of the attacked and to recollect that in the agitation of his mind he could not coolly consider all his means of defence and choose precisely that which should accomplish his purpose with the least possible evil to his adversary there is a great difference in this respect between the quiet of the closet and the bustle of action suppose that a man suddenly assail you with a stick and that there is at your door a stick and a bar of iron you seize the bar of iron and strike the man a dangerous blow or kill him this ought to be deemed justifiable selfdefence unless it could be proved that you had deliberately taken the bar of iron in preference to the stick with the intention of killing him or wounding him more than was necessary for your security commentary of reasons upon this law first question why are the slightest injuries of this kind rendered punishable answer because there is always a reason for punishing it there is no sensation how indifferent soever it may appear which may not become an intolerable torment from its duration or its repetition let any one be allowed to touch your person in any manner whatsoever without being called to account for it he may abuse this liberty so much as to render your life a burthen to you you become in effect his slave you will live in a state of perpetual fear and the feeling of your inferiority will never quit you on the other hand if the offence is slight the punishment may be so also and how small soever the injury may be the punishment may be diminished in proportion because the judge may exercise his powers of discretion in this respect on the side of gentleness second question why are negative offences of this class rendered punishable as well as positive offences answer because in the one case as well as the other the punishment is well grounded is efficacious is necessary third question why is an ulterior punishment added to that which is included in the obligation to render compensation for the evil done answer without this additional punishment it will not in every case be certain that the amount of punishment exceeds the profit of the offence how can it be ascertained     that the compensation directed by the judge entirely accomplished its purpose if it be not complete the offended party so to speak loses and the offender gains besides there are differences in fortune with regard to which a proportion is with difficulty established it is much for one to receive a certain sum it is very little for another to pay it the rich would be led to persuade themselves that for a certain price they might satisfy their resentment towards those of an inferior rank fourth question why is a fine found among the articles of punishment answer because money levied by way of fine produces a double advantage as punishment by its effect on the delinquent as a tax which tends to diminish by its amount the taxes imposed upon the honest citizens fifth question why employ imprisonment answer to provide for the case in which the delinquent shall not have wherewith to pay a fine also to provide for the case of a delinquent secretly supported by a party a punishment purely pecuniary would not at all affect him sixth question why require security answer in order to prevent or stifle all design which the offender may have of avenging himself upon his adversary for having brought him to justice and delivered him up to punishment seventh question why employ banishment from the presence of the injured party answer because there are some cases in which this punishment would be necessary still farther to humble the offender and there are other cases in which the offended party ought to be spared further suffering offences of this class are very various there is no degree of torment so frightful which may not belong to them it may therefore happen that the sight of the offender may prove a source of suffering to the offended person for a long period and even for ever if one of the two must avoid the other it is more fitting the inconveniences of the removal should fall upon the guilty rather than upon his innocent antagonist whom he has already injured eighth question why is age a circumstance of aggravation answer in order that the text of the law itself may be a lesson of morality insomuch that young persons seeing that the law itself shows a particular regard to their superiors in age may contract a disposition always to treat them with particular respect it is by age that men acquire experience and by experience wisdom the respect of the youngest for the eldest will therefore prove reciprocally profitable ninth question why is a particular protection extended to females answer a moral object is again in view it is proper to inspire them with a most delicate sense of honour and this object is attained by increasing the guilt of every injury done towards them besides the law ought to inspire men with a disposition of peculiar regard for females because they are not all beautiful and beauty does not last for ever whilst the men have a constant superiority over the women on account of their superior strength there may also perhaps be a superiority of mental strength either derived from nature or acquired by exercise tenth question why should an injury of this class done to a parent be punished with greater severity answer for a moral end an habitual disposition in children and minors to respect their parents is useful even to themselves that they may the more readily submit themselves to the guidance of those who know best what is most suitable for them and who desire their welfare it is useful to the parents to whom it serves as a recompense for their expenses their fears and the cares of education it is also useful to the state because it encourages men to marry and from families which constitute the wealth and strength of a state some of these reasons independently of the consideration of age apply to guardians teachers and masters eleventh question why is premeditation a source of aggravation answer the greater the pertinacity a man displays in his resentments the more danger is to be apprehended from him the longer his desire of vengeance continues the more probable is it that it will be gratified if a man who is irritated against you throw about fire and flame if his irritation continue for one day only you will be secure if you are protected for a day but if he persevere in his intentions of avenging himself during ten days the danger to which you are exposed from him is ten times as great as in the former case those who hear of your quarrel with him understand this and experience a secret uneasiness when they recollect that they have so dangerous a character among them they may not understand the precise reason of what they feel but this is the cause of the difference in the public feeling towards persons who entertain projects of revenge for a longer or a shorter time   besides the longer a man is governed by hostile feelings upon a given occasion the stronger proof he gives of perverse antisocial dispositions the punishment must be more severe which is to operate upon a hardened character that which would be sufficient to soften and correct a naturally benevolent mind would have no effect upon an implacable and barbarous heart such characters must be restrained by greater terrors     twelfth question why are the different circumstances of attack by night lying in ambush and violation of domicile when accompanied by premeditation considered as aggravations answer these different circumstances all tend to increase the danger and terror of the individual attacked but especially when the domicile is violated when a man sees himself forced in his last entrenchment in his interior asylum which holds all that is most dear to him and in which he retires to sleep with confidence if your adversary await you out of doors you can take precautions against him you are safe while you remain at home but if doors and walls do not stop him you have security nowhere such is the reflection which arises in every mind and produces general alarm but if a quarrel begin at night nocturnity is not a circumstance of aggravation even nocturnal irruption into the house would neither be so dangerous nor so alarming when the individual warned by threats was able to take measures for escape or defence thirteenth question why is clandestinity made a source of aggravation answer because it augments the mischief of the offence it adds terror to suffering and may render a man the most miserable of beings by making him dread a succession of similar injuries to which he could see no end as he could possess no defence against an invisible enemy in ordinary cases where we know the author of an offence we may have the protection of the laws we may be sure that if the evil is not repaired at least that it shall not be augmented it will not remain unpunished but if the delinquent can hide himself behind a curtain so as neither to be known nor suspected he has all the profit of the crime he laughs at the laws and makes a jest of the terrors they ought to inspire it is necessary therefore to take from him the desire to have recourse to inventions of this kind by presenting to him the frightful prospect of an extraordinary degree of punishment in case his subtleties should be detected his artifices will appear less seductive when accompanied with such fears fourteenth question why is disguise distinguished as respects its punishment from other means of clandestinity answer disguise may increase terror to an extreme degree a deformed mask a long crape a white veil which dresses up a phantom may have the strongest effect upon the imagination particularly upon weak and superstitious persons or invalids upon women and children this circumstance also furnishes a favourable opportunity for the use of a characteristic and striking punishment fifteenth question why is the circumstance of wages an aggravation answer first because it increases the alarm and danger when a man beats another in his own quarrel this violence inspires fears only in those who quarrel with him but when a man for the sake of money engages in the quarrel of another all who may chance to have a dispute with any one may dread the bravo by profession many persons who now believe themselves secure because those with whom they have quarrelled are weak and timid will live in a state of continual alarm when they learn that there are men who sell their strength and courage to those who will buy them and that their enemies may be able to do by means of these strangers what they could not do of themselves the danger will appear the greater in proportion as their enemies are rich and are able to offer great rewards for such services a circumstance which would tend to redouble the inevitable inconveniences of the unequal distribution of wealth and which would add to the facility with which the rich might humble and oppress the poor secondly one such action indicates the vilest and most depraved character the motive of pecuniary interest has clearly overpowered all the social motives and it is only the dread of an extraordinary degree of punishment which can restrain so atrocious a fool sixteenth question why is provocation a source of extenuation answer this circumstance diminishes the mischief of the crime as respects the evil of the second order when a man provoked to a certain degree does mischief he may be dangerous but it is only when thus provoked as long as we conduct ourselves towards him as every body ought to behave to such persons we have nothing to fear from him we must have secretly formed the design of offending him if we are alarmed at the vengeance which such provocation would call down even an imaginary provocation provided that the error has been real is a source of extenuation for the same reasons as a real provocation the extent of the extenuation however is less in this case but only from the difficulty of ascertaining the point of fact namely the sincerity of him who has believed himself to be provoked without having been so seventeenth question why is excess in selfdefence a source of extenuation answer this circumstance operates in the same manner as the preceding but with more force the man who in his own defence does greater mischief than his own defence required need only be dreaded by those who attack him     essay on the influence of time and place in matters of legislation   0     introduction thus far then i think i hear a reader say you have proceeded in your inquiries thus far you have determined or endeavoured to determine what is expedient to be done in the way of law but where and when to be performed for some country and some period of time you must necessarily have had in view if expedient in any country and at any time it must be expedient in some individual country at some individual period of time that shall be assigned suppose then that country suppose that period to have been assigned let it have been your own or not your own let it have been this or that or any other will the laws then which you propose for the given country what concerns the article of time need not any longer be repeated would they be equally good for every other if not what is the influence of place and time on the expediency of what you propose to give the question at once a universal form what is the influence of the circumstances of place and time in matters of legislation what are the coincidences and what the diversities which ought to subsist between the laws established in different countries and at different periods supposing them in each instance the best that can be established i will reduce the question at once to that form in which the solution of it has the most immediate relation to practice and if just will be productive of the most immediate benefit i take england then for a standard and referring every thing to this standard i inquire what are the deviations which it would be requisite to make from this standard in giving to another country such a tincture as any other country may receive without prejudice from english laws i take my own country for the standard partly because to that country if to any i owe a preference but chiefly because it is that with the circumstances of which i have the best opportunity to be informed this then is the hypothesis—the laws which i would propose are established in this my country and they are of course according to my conception of them the best that can be devised in this magnificent and presumptuous dream i indulge myself without controul and in it for the purpose of the argument i must be allowed to indulge myself this then is one term in the comparison but there wants another the problem as it stands at present is the best possible laws for england being established in england required the variations which it would be necessary to make in those of any other given country in order to render them the best laws possible with reference to that other country but the problem it is evident must in strictness admit of as many solutions as there are countries which in the point in question are different from england and from each other to make the tour of the globe in this manner would evidently be an endless task all that can be done here is to pitch upon some one country in particular for an example we might choose russia since for a single empire that includes the most ample tract over which any system of laws could according to the present divisions of territory by possibility be extended but what likelihood is there that laws passed in england should be received in russia we might choose canada for to that country conquered by the arms of england laws framed in england have been in contemplation to be transferred but the differences of all kinds that can influence the inquiry     are too inconsiderable between england and canada to furnish that instruction which another example may afford that it may be as instructive as possible this second country should in regard to the circumstances in question form as strong a contrast with england as possible such an example we seem to have in the province of bengal diversity of climate mixture of inhabitants natural productions face of the country present laws manners customs religion of the inhabitants every circumstance on which a difference in the point in question can be grounded as different as can be add to which that between these two countries a transfer of the kind in question has actually been made or attempted to be made in reality in regard to almost any two other examples that could have been chosen the question would have been a mere question of speculation in regard to this whatever just remark may happen to be made is of immediate use and applies immediately to practice to bengal then let us direct the principal measure of our attention not precluding ourselves from casting every now and then for the sake of variety a transient glance towards other countries according as chance may present them to our view to a lawgiver who having been bred up with english notions shall have learnt how to accommodate his laws to the circumstances of bengal no other part of the globe can present a difficulty these being the two countries between which the comparison is to be drawn let us see upon what principles it is to be made it is our destiny as soon as ever we have got a glimpse of perfection to leave it by the way complete perfection requires universal accuracy universal accuracy requires infinite detail it would be something however to trace though it were ever so general an outline of the model of perfection and like moses the jewish lawgiver to point out though we enter not the promised land to draw up in a perfect manner a statement of the difference between the laws that would be the best for england and the laws that would be best for bengal would require three things first the laws which it is supposed would be the best for england must be exhibited in terminis next the leading principles upon which the differences between those and the laws for bengal appear to turn must be displayed lastly those principles must be applied to practice by travelling methodically over the several laws which would require to be altered from what they are in the one case in order to accommodate them to the other according to this plan were it rigorously pursued a complete code of laws for england accompanied with a collection of all the laws for bengal which would require to be different from those which are for england would form a part only of the matter belonging to the present head the impracticability of this plan is such as need not be insisted upon on this plan i would however wish the reader to fix his eye for though it would be impossible to travel over the whole extent of it upon paper he may upon occasion travel over any or every part of it with what degree of attention he thinks proper in his own mind chapter i principles to be followed in trans planting laws the laws which would be the best for england the country from which the laws are to be transferred being given the next object of consideration is by what principles are the variations necessary to be made in these laws in order to accommodate them to the circumstances of bengal the country into which they are to be transferred to be determined it has already been shown that the end and business of every good law may for shortness sake be reduced to this universal expression the prevention of mischief now mischief of whatever kind is ultimately reducible to pain or what may be deemed equivalent to it loss of pleasure what then have different countries different catalogues of pleasures and of pains the affirmative i think will hardly be maintained thus far at least human nature may be pronounced to be every where the same if the difference lies not in the pains and pleasures themselves it must lie if any where in the things that are or are liable to be their causes in this point in effect we shall find it to lie upon a little examination the same event an event of the same description nay even the same individual event which would produce pain or pleasure in one country would not produce an effect of the same sort or if of the same sort not in equal degree in another the pathological powers of any exciting cause depend upon two particulars   upon the state and condition of the person himself whose interests are in question   upon the state and condition of the external object the action of which is the exciting cause now the circumstances the union of which constitutes the state and condition of a man in as far as he is liable to be affected by an exciting cause as well as those which constitute the state and condition of any object which is exterior to him in as far as the action of such object is liable to become with reference to him an exciting cause are the same circumstances of which the detail has been given under the title of circumstances influencing sensibility in the catalogue then     of these circumstances we shall find the sum total of the principles of which we are in search the principles which in our inquiry concerning the influence of place and time on matters of legislation are to serve as a guide the plan upon which this inquiry is to be conducted is already then completely drawn the great task of invention has been performed what remains is little more than manual labour to assist him in the execution of it the legislator should be provided with two sets of tables those of the first set would exhibit a number of particulars relative to the body of laws which has been pitched upon for a standard as contemplated in different points of view for example a table of offences tables of justifications aggravations extenuations and exemptions a table of punishments a table of the titles of the civil code a table of the titles of the constitutional code and so on those of the other set will be a general table of the circumstances influencing sensibility tables or short accounts of the moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic biases of the people for whose use the alterations are to be made a set of maps as particular as possible a table of the productions of the country natural and artificial tables of the weights measures and coins in use tables of its population and the like† these tables if a man would work with accuracy he should have not metaphorically only but literally and materially before his eyes upon the plan thus chalked out i proceed to exhibit the alterations above spoken of following the order of the matters in the original code which is supposed to be the standard in this course it cannot for the reasons assigned already be expected that i should travel long nor even in it that i should glean up the whole of the matter as i go all that can consistently be done is to give a set of examples which in point of order shall exemplify the method that has been chosen and in point of multitude and of variety shall afford a tolerably satisfactory illustration of the principles under the direction of which they have been brought to light i proceed then according to the order of the offences‡   simple corporal injuries—these would not admit of many modificasions on account of difference of place mere corporal sensibility of whatever differences it may admit in degree is in kind much the same all the world over yet a wound in a hot and unhealthy climate may be much more dangerous than the same wound would be in a temperate and healthy climate∥ stripping a man stark naked might cause death in siberia in circumstances in which it would be only play in the east indies   irreparable corporal injuries—under this head it would be necessary to consider whether any and what indulgence should be given to the practice of emasculation there would be more reason it should seem for such indulgence where the services of persons thus mutilated are looked upon as a necessary guard to conjugal fidelity than where the only use of them is to afford a somewhat higher gratification than could perhaps otherwise be procured to the ear of a musical dilettante   wrongful confinement and wrongful banishment—the effects of these two injurious acts are liable to great diversity from differences in point of climate manners or religion a nights confinment in the prison called the blackhole in the hot climate of calcutta after producing the most excurciating torments proved fatal to nearly all the persons who were confined in it in a winters     night in siberia the same number of persons might perhaps have undergone a confinement of the same length in a similar space without any very remarkable inconvenience confinement inflicted upon a gentoo might under certain circumstances be attended with the forfeiture of his caste a possession to him much dearer than life even banishment if the effects of it were to seclude him from the necessary means of observing his religious ceremonies might be attended with a similar effect either species of coercion might at any rate wound his conscience inflicting thereby a simple mental injury of the severest kind the gentoos seem to stand at the summit of the scale of sensibility on this line descending we find the mahometan the jew the greek christian the catholic christian all exposed to suffer from similar causes according to their respective notions of religious duty the mahometan by being hindered from performing his ablutions or forced upon a diet inconsistent with his fasts the jew in like manner by being forced at any time into a forbidden diet the greek by being put under a coercion of the same kind during any of his times of fasting the catholic from a similar cause or from the being prevented from hearing mass even the pious protestant might suffer in some degree by finding himself deprived for a length of time of the comforts of a spiritual communion these being so many circumstances demanding particular attention in the choice of punishments to be inflicted on such individuals   simple mental injuries—those sights those discourses which would give pain to the inhabitant of one country would not in every instance be productive of a similar sensation to the inhabitant of another this difference too like so many others turns upon the point of religion the sectary of every religion at least the vulgar that is the great bulk of every sect is exposed to the dread of invisible agents but the names and attributes of those agents are different the mind of a gentoo may be filled with unspeakable terror from the apprehension of a visit from peshush while an ignorant christian is afraid of witches devils ghosts and vampires the votary of every sect may receive a cruel wound from any discourse or exhibition which tends to reflect contempt on any of the objects of his veneration protestants feel little in comparison but for christ jesus and for that blessed spirit which is often figured as a dove the catholic to the list of divine persons adds the virgin mary and every martyr and every saint who is added to the calendar makes an almost equal addition to the sphere of his sensibility the mahometan has his apostles besides mahomet and the gentoo his deities besides brama among the higher classes of mahometans and gentoos for a man to intrude himself into the presence of a married woman would to the husband be an unpardonable injury a bare request to see her an affront such injuries to which the european would be insensible might in asia with perfect propriety be referred to the denomination now before us more than this the idea which it would be proper to annex to these several offences will vary much in different countries in virtue of the various circumstances to which it will be respectively proper to give the effect of justification exemption extenuation or aggravation the differences of castes in hindostan furnish a copious stock of extenuations and aggravations to different classes of offences the extraordinary extent if one may so say of the surface of their moral as well as religious sensibility exposes them to a proportional variety of injuries hence so many peculiar grounds of defence and provocation we are told that on the malabar side of the coast if a hallachore chance to touch a man of a superior tribe he draws his sabre and cuts him down on the spot without any check from his own conscience or from the laws of his country a prejudice so strong though altogether unjust and ferocious would require great forbearance on the part of the legislator it would require art to soften and to combat it but it would be better to yield to it altogether for a time than uselessly to compromise his authority and expose his laws to hatred   semipublic offences—different countries are subject to different calamities according to their situation climate productions means of defence c hence results a great variety in the laws of police in those countries which are nurseries of the plague many precautions may be requisite which would be needless against that horrible distemper in other countries such precautions would give rise to a correspondent train of offences it might become an offence for example to pass from one town to another to enter a port to leave a vessel before the prescribed time or to disembark a bale of goods c in great britain it could scarcely be in the power of any authority short of the supreme to do any thing in the way of engrossing or otherwise towards producing or enhancing the calamity of famine in islands of less extent and fertility or under governments more liable to abuse the danger might not be so ideal in bengal the famine by which so many millions were swept off in the year          was owing let us hope to no other cause than the inclemency of the seasons or the insuperable difficulties attending a new system of government but without legislative precautions a similar effect might perhaps be produced by the abuse of delegated power in that distant member of the british empire in mountainous countries great mischief is sometimes done by falls of snow which in the neighbourhood of the alps are called avalanches and by which whole villages are sometimes overwhelmed a sudden concussion given to the air by means so inconsiderable as the discharge of a pistol will sometimes it is said be sufficient to give rise to a catastrophe of this sort i forget what traveller it is who says that on this account the discharge of firearms is made penal in some parts of that mountainous region in maritime countries the coasts of which consist of a loose sand there are often found different sorts of plants chiefly of the rush kind which by the matted contexture of their roots communicate to the soil a degree of tenacity by means of which it is enabled to afford a more effectual resistance to the encroachments of the water by the laws of various countries in europe the destruction of such plants is prohibited under penalties which would be altogether useless in different situations in the dutch and flemish provinces the extreme vigilance with which it is necessary to guard against the incursions of the sea will naturally give occasion to various regulations for which there would be no use in a more elevated situation in towns where the coldness of the climate requires that the houses should be substantial and the dearness of groundrent renders the style of building lofty the danger that may attend the fall of such as happen to be ruinous gives occasion to regulations which would be unnecessary in those sultry regions where an ordinary house is little more than a large umbrella in some parts of spanish america the fear of earthquakes prevents the inhabitants it is said from giving to their buildings that degree of solidity which on other accounts they would deem eligible in such hazardous situations the superintending care of the legislator might perhaps not improperly second the prudence of the individual in hot climates the letting into a country a mass of stagnant water might in certain situations be productive of an injury to public health from which the inhabitants of more temperate regions are in a great measure secure sicily and other parts of italy are exposed to a wind called the sirocco which by the excessive heat and languor it occasions is extremely troublesome certain parts of the east are occasionally afflicted with a wind called samiel the influence of which is said to be almost instantaneously fatal if in any of those countries there was a wood or a hill or even a wall which could in any degree answer the purpose of screening the neighbourhood from the blast the removal of such a fence might be guarded against by penalties which in our temperate regions would have no such utility to justify them in arabia and other countries where water is scarce the exposing or dissipating the water of a single spring might expose thousands to perish with thirst and render the communication between one district and another almost impracticable in russia the destroying or putting down a few inns might be productive of effects almost equally mischievous in england hundreds of much better houses of the like sort are put down every year without occasioning the least sensation   selfregarding offences against the person—in the northern climates drunkenness makes men stupid in the southern mad in the one it is folly in the other wickedness to speak at random in the one situation penalties against drunkenness should be slight in the other they should be severe in mahometan countries the strict prohibition supposed to be laid by the koran against the use of intoxicating liquors makes some amends perhaps for the mischievous effect of that barbarous religion   offences against reputation these offences vary according to the state of opinions and manners among other traits which discover the manners of the ancient greeks we learn from what xenophon relates regarding himself that crimes against nature could be esteemed but a joke even now wherever the mahometan religion prevails such practices seem to be attended with but little disrepute in england not only the letter of the law makes them capital as in other parts of europe but the law is carried into execution with a degree of zeal which no other species of criminality is sufficient to inspire but were it even altogether unpunishable by law a groundless imputation of this nature would be an injury scarcely less atrocious than at present since the consequence of being reputed guilty would be attended with a degree of infamy which can be compared to nothing so properly as that which attends forfeiture of caste among the hindoos in england to say of a farmer that he had sown ryegrass and clover in the same field would be of as little prejudice to him as to say that he had sown either of those plants alone in judea while the mosaic institutions were in vigour such an imputation would     have been a very serious injury levit xix    deut xxi    0    a spanish grazier would as soon hear of his having bred a mule as of his having bred a horse the purity of a jewish grazier would have been shocked at the imputation universally the degree of damage which a man sustains by an act of defamation depends not at all upon the aspect borne by the dictates of utility to the practice he is charged with but to the aspect which is borne to the practice by the political moral and religious sanctions by the moral principally and immediately and by the other two chiefly in virtue of the degree in which the moral is subject to their influence   offences against the person and reputation together—it is evident enough that the idea annexed to the denomination of a lascivious injury must be liable to considerable variation according as the manners of the people in this respect are more or less reserved different parts of the female body are veiled in different countries with different degrees of care in asia the whole person is invisible in sparta the young women appeared in public with an open and flowing robe among ourselves propriety as to dress changes with the fashions the idea of obscenity how strange soever it may appear seems not to be invariably annexed to the same parts and the same functions among lettered nations indeed mens notions in this respect seem to be pretty uniform but among unlettered nations however civilized in other respects the case is different in otaheite the few notions of modesty which are discoverable seem to be transferred from the functions by which the species is continued to those by which the individual is preserved atkins the traveller observed an instance of this among a tribe of negroes as often as the king drank two of his attendants held up a cloth before his face that he might not be seen wine however is no friend to modesty when his majesty had got drunk this respect was laid aside the same notions of delicacy have been established in other african tribes if we may give credit to several more ancient travellers who are quoted by barbeyrac in his notes on puffendorff† the inhabitants of senegal they tell us are as much ashamed of their mouth as of any other part of the body and therefore they ordinarily go with a cover upon it which they only take off for the purpose of eating this custom may perhaps derive its origin from some superstition the inhabitants of the maldives carefully hide themselves during their repasts fearful lest their food should be charmed whilst they are eating it   offences against property—it is evident that these are liable to infinite diversity in as far as the events which it is expedient should be admitted into the list of those constitutive of title are liable to differ other differences will necessarily arise from a thousand sources too tedious to particularize to enlarge upon this head would be impossible without prematurely engaging in the intricacies of the civil branch of jurisprudence the name of usury will in different countries according to the greater or less plenty of money be given to contracts of very different descriptions in england six per cent is deemed excessive in bengal twelve per cent is deemed moderate it is the usual interest just as it was among the ancient romans the offence of extortion will require to be differently defined in different political situations if a clerk in a merchants countinghouse were to present his compliments and state to the prime minister of england that a present of money would not be unacceptable the statement would be laughed at but such has not always been the case in bengal an equally civil and cautiously worded message directed to mahomed reza pawn appears not have been altogether unattended to‡ the kind of government occasions a great variety in the definition of this kind of offence greater precautions are requisite to protect the subjects in a conquered country or under an absolute government than among the citizens of a free state on the other hand a conquering republic is more oppressive to the conquered country than a conquering monarch a monarch may be rapacious but he is interested in preventing the exactions of his officers in a republic on the other hand—in the senate of rome for example—there existed a tacit collusion among those that possessed authority some religious professions expose their followers to pecuniary extortion those of the mahometans and hindoos are particularly subject to this abuse but they have not equalled the catholic church in this particular which whilst preaching poverty nearly succeeded in becoming the sole proprietor of all property in protestant countries this field of extortion has been shut up if the priest assists his flock in the way to heaven it is well but he is not believed to possess the power of preventing them going thither without him  0 offences against condition—the powers annexed to conditions of the domestic kind are constituted by the justifications annexed to various offences or to speak more plainly     by exceptive clauses subjoined to the laws establishing the circumstances constitutive of the parties title to the condition in question as circumstances justificative of such acts as were it not for such exceptions would be unlawful these differ in different countries in most christian countries it must be some very extraordinary behaviour on the part of a wife that can render it allowable in a husband to keep her under confinement to a mahometan i speak always of those who are rich enough to live in this style not to be allowed to keep his wives in confinement would be intolerable the matrimonial condition is not the same in reality in mahometan and christian countries here the woman contracts with her husband nearly upon a principle of equality there marriage is impressed with a character of servitude here the woman preserves her liberty there at least among the more opulent she is kept in a state of seclusion among christians polygamy consists in having more than one wife among mahometans in having more than four wives among asiatics the husband is more the master than the guardian of his wife in europe the husband is as much the guardian as the master after the death of her husband the wife does not regain her liberty as among us in hindostan among the mahometans at least the next heir of the deceased husband becomes the guardian of the widow and without the privileges of the husband he succeeds to his authority as her jailor i have said among most european nations in spain we find a slight tincture of asiatic manners left by foreign conquerors after the religion that seems to have introduced them had been extirpated a tincture originally foreign and now almost worn out in russia we find manners originally asiatic softening by culture into european the examples thus given will suffice to show the manner in which the principles ought to be applied with what care it is necessary to proceed that established opinions may not be violently shocked and in what manner the laws may be adapted to the imperious and oftentimes unchangeable circumstances of the people to be governed the subjects of public offences of constitutional law and procedure have not yet been glanced at nor will it be necessary at present to pursue them the influence of local circumstances is generally recognised as to the two former and with regard to all of them it would not be easy to bring the points of difference to view in so striking a manner chapter ii regard to be paid to subsisting institutions looking over the examples above given we shall find reason for dividing them into two classes the first class consisting of those which are physical in which the influence of the circumstance operating as a ground of variation is insurmountable the other consisting of those which are moral in which that influence is not necessarily and absolutely insurmountable however difficult inexpedient or unsafe it may be to act in opposition to it to the first class belong the circumstances of climate and the texture of the earth in as far as the condition of things exterior to man is determined by them to the other class belong the circumstances of government religion and manners including the several primary circumstances through the intervention of which these secondary ones display their efficacy but it may be said that the articles of climate and texture of the earth but particularly the former have a certain influence over the articles of government manners and religion and since it will be impossible to change the one it will be impossible to alter the other hence these physical circumstances may be found opposing insurmountable obstacles to a certain kind of legislation the influence of these physical circumstances is incontestible but are they necessarily pernicious are they not subject to the art of the legislator the whole of history proves that there is no circumstance connected with climate or texture of the earth incompatible with the happiness of man and that wherever men can live there they may possess a government a religion and manners that will render them happy the world has been a field of change egypt no longer worships the goddess isis and india may cast off its devotion to bramah italy has nourished the most warlike of people and the effeminacy of the modern italians cannot therefore be considered the effect of their climate greece has been once covered with republics and there is therefore no reason to believe it doomed to be for ever the habitation of slaves mahomet impressed upon the peaceful tribes of arabia a warlike enthusiasm overturning with a handful of fanatics the laws the religion the customs the inveterate prejudices of a multitude of people could we suppose this extraordinary man possessing the same power of will endowed with more knowledge and more genius would it be too much to say that he might have bestowed on these nations laws more consonant with their happiness and less hostile to the human race     if this example be not deemed conclusive we may turn to the example of peter the great what he has not done in point of legislation is not to be attributed to the effects of climate this did not set the bounds to his success he accomplished all that he designed and if his mind had been embued with a perfect system of legislation he would have found greater facility in its establishment than in establishing an imperfect one the greatest obstacles with which he met arose from his own faults but there are yet more delicate and more important questions which turn upon the suitability of the changes and the manner of their accomplishment take the form of government in the country to be regulated and compare it with that of the standard country in any point whatsoever that of the former is in the point in question either exactly upon a par with the latter or superior to it or inferior that it should be superior is scarce consistent with the supposition for then the law of the standard country is not in that point what it is supposed to be the best imaginable if the former be inferior then comes in the question which is likely to be the greater evil the evil depending upon such inferiority or the evil if any which might be produced by the measures requisite to remove the other the evil of the disease or the evil of the remedy this question is complicated and includes many others the evil of the remedy is perhaps likely to be but temporary while the evil of the disease and thence the benefit of the remedy is likely to be perpetual here then comes in another question what portion of present comfort is it worth while to sacrifice for the sake of any and what chance of future benefit and the magnitude of each being given for what length of time is it worth while to sacrifice a present comfort of the given magnitude to a given chance of succeeding benefit that in many instances it must be extremely difficult to ascertain to which of these cases the expediency of a given law belongs and that to arrive at entire certainty may be absolutely impossible is not to be denied but the use of breaking down the question into these subordinate questions is not the less undeniable it is always something to see where the difficulty lies although it should be insuperable and to point out the only means by which the best solution can be given although that solution should not be so satisfactory as could be wished it is something to get certain principles leaving facts in the uncertainty that belongs to them by showing the real uncertainty of the most conclusive arguments that can be offered on the subject it will prevent us from giving to less conclusive arguments more than their due weight it will enable us to unravel the web of sophistry and to humble the pride of declamation it will be of service in as far as the caution that accompanies a salutary doubt is preferable to the rashness that may be the result of misconception such sort of instruction indeed brings little thanks to him who gives it to be in doubt is to be unsatisfied to be unsatisfied is to be uneasy people in general had rather be decided and in the wrong than in the right and undecided declamation has here then as on many other topics the advantage over argument and a mans chance of persuasion will be in proportion rather to the energy of his expressions than to the justness of his views that even in regard to forms of government there should be many points that are indifferent may easily be conceived the same may happen with respect to religion as with respect to every thing that concerns the temporal interests of society it is still more evident that the case may easily be the same with regard to manners it may even happen that the law which prevails in the country to be regulated shall be better for that country than it would be in the standard country while the law that obtains with relation to the same point in the standard country is better for that country than it would be in the country to be regulated thus suppose that in the standard code it were found advisable that in such part as relates to procedure an institution somewhat similar to that at present in force in england with relation to juries should have place it might happen that in bengal such a plan could not in any part of it be adopted with any advantage or that if it could yet in several points a variety of additions defalcations or alterations would require to be made why because in england in certain causes the requisite degree of impartiality and intrepidity taken together might with better reason be expected from juries than in a judge whereas in bengal in the same causes the same degree of those qualities taken together might with better reason be expected from a judge than from a jury at least if constituted in precisely the same way as in the former case this difference however would depend in good measure upon a certain inferiority which at present there appears to be in bengal with respect to the form of government on the one hand and the national manners on the other insomuch that were the time ever to come when such inferiority should disappear the reasons for the difference between the institutions would become less forcible and perhaps vanish altogether at present it has been said the passion of avarice has implanted among the inhabitants of english race in bengal two evil propensities     a propensity to practise extortion to the prejudice of the subjected asiatics and a propensity to practice peculation to the prejudice of the public revenue hence arises a sort of tacit convention and combination on the part of every man to support assist and protect every other in the practice of the like enormities a jury then if taken at hazard from the body of english inhabitants would never convict a man of either of those offences how manifest soever were his guilt but a judge not having any such concerns with the natives as could lead to the practice of extortion nor being invested with any such trust as could give room to peculation having the eyes of mankind fixed upon every part of his conduct and being raised by his rank and fortune above the level of ordinary society would have strong motives to restrain him from engaging and no adequate motives to induce him to engage in any such combination so long then as such a state of manners continues you must either have no laws against extortion or peculation or no juries or juries de medietate composed partly of english and partly of asiatics if a mixture of that sort can by any set of expedients be made practicable and eligible upon the whole whether the facts be as here suggested i pretend not to inquire i state them merely in the way of supposition to answer the purpose of a feigned case for which purpose their truth is altogether immaterial it is sufficient if they have such a colour of truth as not to appear absolutely improbable if this be allowed it is then not a case utterly improbable that the standard of perfection in matters of law may with regard to certain points be different in different countries for a time at least even where the influence of physical grounds of variation is out of the question the case may be the same with regard to religion politically considered but is more particularly apt to be so with regard to those ordinary and continually repeated points of behaviour which come under the head of manners and way of life it may be better that in bengal at least among people of asiatic race the husbands should be disposed to expect that their wives should keep confined and that the women should be disposed to submit to such confinement while in england it may be better that the husband should not be disposed to entertain any such expectation nor the wife to comply with it if that be the case there will be no reason why by any news laws we should seek to make an alteration in these ancient manners i state this again hypothetically as before montesquieu seems to be decided in the affirmative those who read says he of the treacheries assassinations poisonings and all sorts of enormities which the liberty of the female sex is the occasion of at goa and in the other settlements of the portuguese in the indies where religion allows but of one wife comparing them at the same time with the innocence and purity of manners that characterize the same sex in turkey persia the mogul empire china and japan will be satisfied that it is oftentimes as necessary to separate women from men when a man has but one of them as when he has a number how the case may have stood among the portuguese i cannot say but the english have also their settlements in that country and english wives have at least as much liberty as could possibly have been enjoyed by portuguese yet who ever heard of any such abominations as montesquieu has been speaking of among the former if this example had occurred to montesquieu he would not have attributed these things to the influence of climate and a more general view of his subject would perhaps have rendered him less dogmatic thus much must be allowed at any rate that in order to judge of the regard that ought to be paid to subsisting institutions these institutions must be examined in making such an examination there are two questions which are constantly to be kept in view what are the present institutions relative to the point in question and how far the expediency of giving them continuance follows from their existence these two questions distinct as they are are very often confounded but the more these points are in danger of being confounded the greater is the care that ought to be taken to keep them distinct in the first place in ones own mind in the next place in the language made use of to express them unfortunately nothing has been more common among writers than to confound them indeed it is almost next to impossible so to turn the phrase in each case as to keep them separate all that one can do is to give warning of the distinction once for all this source of misapprehension could not but occur in the course of the examples given in the last preceding chapter but being now noticed it is to be hoped it will be removed i there gave them as circumstances the influence of which required to be attended to without meaning to determine whether it were advisable to give way to it without reserve there being such and such laws already subsisting it deserves consideration how far a new set of laws inconsistent with them ought to be established there being such and such a religion and state of manners already prevailing to which the new laws would be repugnant it deserves consideration how far the establishment of such laws is to be wished for this was a   0 question i meant in many cases merely to bring to view without deciding upon it to show how natural it is to fall into this confusion i will quote an instance out of montesquieu which however is but one out of a thousand when a country says he is so circumstanced that the climate of itself produces more inhabitants than the country can support it is idle to make laws in the view of promoting population here then he lays down a rule immediately on the back of it he produces three examples for the purpose one should naturally suppose of justifying the rule if the rule which he has given is conformable to his sentiments one should think that the examples he gives of what has been done in conformity to that rule are so too but in the instances i am about to mention one can hardly imagine this to have been the case in china and tonquin a father is permitted to expose his newborn children in china and tonquin again the father is permitted to sell his daughters though at a marriageable age in formosa a woman before she is five and thirty is not permitted to bear children though able and willing to support them it being the duty of the priestess to search all women under that age who are suspected of the crime of pregnancy and if guilty to force an abortion by stamping on their bodies how immense the distance between the policy of the rule and the policy of the several laws which are brought to view as if they were so many applications of the rule judging from the rule itself it is folly by turning a pleasure into a task to render the lives of the present race uncomfortable for the sake of giving birth to contingent beings who would be produced without it judging from the first example it is right to permit a parent to take away life from a being who cannot suffer from the apprehension of the loss of it and to whom if he retained it it would only be a burthen judging from the second example it is right to permit a parent to consign his daughter in whom education has moderated the bitterness of such a change to the arms of a man whom it is uncertain whether she will like judging from the third a stranger is permitted or required to invade the peace of a family to violate the person of a woman and endanger her life by a most cruel outrage and all without a motive it is difficult to form a clear idea of what montesquieu intended he appears to have confounded the question of fact with the question of fitness he has laid down a maxim and has cited three customs which have only a very distant connection with it and yet he seems to have placed them all upon the same level chapter iii rules respecting the method of transplanting laws of the circumstances which make the laws that would be expedient in one country ineligible in another some are grounded in nature some in prejudice some depend on the state and condition of objects that are extrinsic with regard to the mind of man some on the state and condition of the mind of man itself the establishment of such laws as were it not for the influence of these circumstances would be the best is in the first case impossible in the latter in some instances equally impossible in others possible but not worth the while considering the hazard in some perhaps neither impossible nor unworth the while supposing the business to be planned with sagacity and conducted with the utmost tenderness and circumspection when attempts have been made to transplant without revision the laws of one country into another and the consequences of such attempts have proved pernicious it has been partly indeed because the laws were bad there but partly also because they would have been bad any where they were bad in the soil that gave them birth how should they be tolerable in another in an immense heap of rubbish there may have been some diamonds without attempting a separation dirt and diamonds have been shot down together the law is every where an immense labyrinth to traverse its recesses would be a tax on indolence as well as a test of talents the severest tax that can be imposed on the one the severest test that the other can be exposed to it is a work of labour this labour they never have had the courage to engage in for their own selves how should they ever for the sake of others not that the laws of barbarous nations should therefore be eternal while those of the most civilized demand a change laws need not be of the wild and spontaneous growth of the country to which they are given prejudice and the blindest custom must be humoured but they need not be the sole arbiters and guides he who attacks prejudice wantonly and without necessity and he who suffers himself to be led blindfold a slave to it equally miss the line of reason legislators who having freed themselves from the shackles of authority have learnt to soar above the mists of prejudice know as well how to make laws for one country as for another all they need is to be possessed fully of the facts to be informed of the local situation the climate the bodily constitution the manners the legal customs the religion of those with whom they have to deal these are the data they require possessed of these     data all places are alike if they are more at home in their own country than elsewhere it is only because the requisite stock of facts in the former situation is already possessed by them without their being obliged to wait the time which in a foreign country it would require to seek them out the following rules if given for the purpose of information would be idle but by way of memento they may have their use they are chiefly a recapitulation of the preceding disquisitions   no law should be changed no usage at present prevailing should be abolished without special reason unless some specific assignable benefit can be shown as likely to be the result of such a change   the changing of a custom repugnant to our own manners and sentiments to one which is conformable to them for no other reason than such repugnancy or conformity is not to be reputed as a benefit the satisfaction is for one or a small number the pain is for all or a great number the first and sufficient reason besides where shall these changes founded in caprice be stopped if my taste is a sufficient reason for me an opposite taste may be as sufficient a reason for another the emperor who would proscribe one letter of the alphabet should recollect that his successor may determine to restore it queen elizabeth who was so anxious about the dress of the clergy should have remembered that it might as easily be altered in the following reign   in all matters of indifference let the political sanction remain neuter and let the authority of the moral sanction take its course the only difficulty lies in ascertaining what is and what is not indifferent here the great use of a complete catalogue of pains and pleasures appears it furnishes the only elements for the solution of this difficulty if there result from an action an evil neither of the first nor second order it belongs to the class of things indifferent† when it was sought to engage frederic the great in the question which then agitated the town of neufchatel respecting the eternity of punishment he replied that if the neufchatelans were pleased with being damned eternally he did not wish to deprive them of the satisfaction   the easiest innovation to introduce is that which is effected merely by refusing to a coercive custom the sanction of the law especially where the coercion imposed upon one party is not attended with profit to another in catholic countries it is sufficient for the destruction of all that is injurious to liberty in convents c to refuse the sanction of the laws to monastic vows in india the wife often resolved to burn herself upon the death of her husband if the act were altogether voluntary and she were persuaded she should find her account in it it might be represented as tyrannical to oppose her but such permission should not be granted till after she had undergone an examination and the fact of her consent were indubitably ascertained   the clear utility of the law will be as its abstract utility deduction made of the dissatisfaction and other inconvenience occasioned by it hotheaded innovators full of their own notions only pay attention to abstract advantage they reckon discontent for nothing their impatience to enjoy is the greatest obstacle to their success this was the great error of joseph ii the greater part of the changes he proposed were good abstractedly but as he had not considered the dispositions of the people he rendered his best designs abortive by his imprudence how often are men the dupe of words what is the public good but the happiness and contentment of the public   the value of dissatisfaction will be in the compound ratio of three things     the multitude of the persons dissatisfied     the intensity of the dissatisfaction in each person     the duration of the dissatisfaction on the part of each these are the bases of calculation if we would operate with success the smaller the number of the discontented the greater the chance of success but this is not a reason for employing less humanity in the manner of treating them if only one person were rendered unhappy by the change he would yet be worthy of the notice of the legislator who ought at least to free his measures from insult and contempt to create new hopes to collect those which revive and to publish amnesties for the past really useful changes possess a fund of reason which will tend at all times to produce a conviction of their utility every species of dissatisfaction should be relieved by its particular remedy a pecuniary loss requires pecuniary compensation a loss of power may be compensated either by an indemnity in money or in honour dissappointed expectation may be softened by those arrangements which open a new career to hope   as a means of obviating dissatisfaction indirect legislation should be preferred to direct gentle means to violent example instruction and exhortation should precede     or follow or if possible stand in the place of law ought inoculation to have been established by law no without doubt even supposing it had been possible the effect would have been dreadful it would have carried alarm and dismay into a multitude of families the practice however has become universal in england from the force of example and public discussion alone catherine ii was very skilful in the art of ruling minds she did not make laws obliging the russian nobility to enter the military service which they disliked but by determining all their ranks by fixing all precedencies even among civilians according to the grades in the army she combated their indolence by their vanity and the nobles of the most distant provinces sought to obtain the new distinctions that they might not be superseded by those whom they had hitherto esteemed beneath them   in choosing among many laws which shall be introduced first select that which being established will facilitate the introduction of the others   the slowness of its operation is as far as it goes an objection to a measure but if this slowness may be a means of obviating a dissatisfaction which expeditious measures would excite the former may be preferable when the prejudices of the people are violent and obstinate the legislator is in great danger of running into extremes one extreme is to take fire at the prejudice and resolve upon its extirpation without weighing the good and bad effects of such a measure in the balance of utility the other is to suffer these prejudices to be made use of as a pretext for that indolence and pusillanimity which would leave the evil without remedy these prejudices have generally some salvo for good government and good morals it is the province of the legislator to find out this salvo if there be one and make use of it and in the mean time if it be worth while to try what instruction and other gentle means will do towards getting the better of the prejudice it was in this manner as has been observed by rousscau that francis i overthrew the employment of seconds in duels quant à ceux dit il qui aurant la lâcheté demployer des seconds c he opposed honour to honour and as the individuals fought to prove their courage no one dared to call in those auxiliaries whose assistance was thus marked as throwing a suspicion upon that courage itself but if nothing of the kind will do and it be found impossible to untie the gordian knot it must een be cut the welfare of all must not be sacrificed to the obstinacy of a few nor the happiness of ages to the quiet of a day prejudices that appear unsurmountable at first view may be got over with a little management among the inhabitants of hindostan a man of a certain rank would think himself eternally dishonoured were he obliged to make his appearance in a court of justice what does that signify persons of that description are always rich send a special commission to examine them and make them pay the expense among the hindoos persons of a certain rank would sooner submit to any inconvenience than take an oath what does that signify persons of that description may as well be trusted upon their word as others upon their oath do they say what is not true it is as easy to punish them for simple falsehood as to punish others for perjury do not quakers among us depose upon their affirmation and do not peers in certain cases affirm upon their honour neither mahometans nor gentoos can bear that any officer of justice any more than any other person of the male sex should visit the apartments much less the persons of their women justice on this account is not worth purchasing at such a price what does that signify appoint women to the office an englishwoman would cry out and with equal justice against the tyranny of subjecting her person to the brutal inquisitiveness of male examiners how many englishwomen deriving protection against such treatment from the odium which it would excite return from calais to dover swaddled up with lace like egyptian mummies but is it absosolutely necessary because female delicacy is not to be violated that the public should be defrauded that modesty should be turned into a cloak for avarice either the payment of a tax upon these luxuries ought not to be commanded or the nonpayment ought not to go unpunished among the various castes or tribes of the hindoos there is one of which the members are called decoits to these decoits brama has revealed that it is proper they should steal every thing they can lay their hands on and if necessary rob and murder every body that comes in their way what is to be done with them are they out of respect to their conscience to be permitted to labour in this their vocation no verily for if it was the pleasure of brama that these people should apply their industry to robbery it was also the pleasure of brama that they should bear the consequences of the industry that shall have been employed by honest men to save themselves from being robbed in another country in asia it is reported that there lived a tribe of people from whom the word assassin has its name if one of     these were commanded by their chief who found frequent occasion to issue such commands to go and cut the throat of any one he named obedience was sure to follow the terror of this titled murderer spread far and near kings were not safe upon their thrones but at last a tartar chief found means to apply the only remedy that probably occurred to him against such a public pestilence possibly the only one it admitted of and the whole race was exterminated by him mr hastings in considering how to deal with the decoits recommends a milder yet not less effectual remedy let the men and their families says he be made slaves domestic slavery considered as a punishment has little severity in it as montesquieu already had observed in a country where political freedom is unknown as a preventive remedy nothing could be more effectual montesquieu says that in changing customs and manners customs and manners only should be employed not laws why because says he laws are the particular institutions of the legislator customs and manners those of the nation in general the maxim itself has some truth in it but the reason is good for nothing for what act or what habit is it that a law can be made against and that might not be the act of the nation in general were it not for the law to understand what there is of truth in the maxim and what are the true reasons of it let us turn to his example for without his examples one should seldom know what to make of his rules peter the great made a law obliging the russians to cut off their beards and wear their clothes short like europeans and to enforce it he posted guards in the streets to cut off the skirts of all such coats as should be found longer than the standard the measure says montesquieu was tyrannical the change which he wanted to bring about he should have effected not by making a law but by setting an example in the making of this law his object was either to gratify his own taste merely by putting the people into a dress he liked to see instead of one he did not like to see or it was to polish them that is to bring the national character as near as he could to the european which he looked upon as better calculated to make them happy the latter supposition is the more probable as well as the more honourable and it is that in which montesquieu himself seems disposed to acquiesce in the former supposition the law being a coercive one was improper the punishment annexed to it and the hardship produced by it being groundless and the law may well indeed be styled what montesquieu styles it tyrannical on the other supposition it was a measure of indirect legislation levelled at all those mischievous points of behaviour to which he imagined his subjects would be the less prone were they to take the maxims of europeans for their model the proposed change being effected he might then thus say to the people that were about him ye are europeans this is now a european country see every thing about you is european look even at the common people their countenances their dresses are european ye yourselves are european behave yourselves then like europeans ye are european husbands treat your wives then as european gentlemen treat theirs ye are european landlords treat your vassals then as european gentlemen treat their tenants ye are european gentlemen think it then as great a disgrace for any of you to be seen drunk as it is for an european gentleman ye are european gentlemen betake yourselves then to the profitable studies the innocent and elegant amusements of european gentlemen much more might he have added in the same strain could he have effected the desired change of character without effecting this change in dress could he have effected the change in dress merely by dressing himself as he wished to see his subjects dress or by other means less coercive than this law in either of these cases the law and the hardship attendant upon it was not useless indeed as montesquieu calls it inutile but however needless was the benefit attendant upon the proposed change of manners or rather of so much of that change as was owing solely to the change of dress worth the purchasing at the expense of all that hardship if not the law was then unprofitable such is the slow and minute but sure and satisfactory method of estimating the tendency of a law upon the principle of utility in all such matters the cautious statesman will avoid the tone of peremptoriness and decision his conclusions will always in the first instance be hypothetical if such and such events are the likeliest to take place but are they this is a matter which ought to be stated as accompanied with the degree of uncertainty that belongs to it beware of those who by the vehemence of their assertions by the confidence of their predictions make up for the weakness of their reasons whatever degree of advantage the law in question was calculated to produce the price paid for that benefit must be acknowledged to have been a high one the observances prescribed being constant and habitual the idea of compulsion would be incessantly before their eyes and this compulsion could not but appear tyrannical as it would seem     to be imposed either for no reason at all or for a reason which would seem worse than none the british parliament in      made a law to compel the scottish highlanders to lay aside their national costume the design of this law was political the people were strongly attached to this ensign of distinction and regarded with contempt the inhabitants of the low country who had long since adopted the english dress the pretender by exhibiting himself among them dressed in the ancient costume had charmed these mountaineers and they followed his standard in crowds after the rebellion was quelled it was wished that this national garb which recalled old ideas and served as the signal of a party should disappear but this act which incessantly called up the idea of restraint was unsuccessful and only served to recall what it was desired should be forgotten after half a century of experience its inutility and danger have been perceived and this tyrannical law has been repealed and england has no soldiers more faithful or more intrepid than these mountaineers whose energy would most probably have been destroyed if their ancient customs had unfortunately been overcome by force the general result of these rules is that the legislator in producing great changes ought to be calm collected and temperate in welldoing he ought to fear to enkindle the passions and to excite an opposition which may irritate even himself if it is possible he ought never to drive his enemies to despair but surrounding his labours with a triple rampart of confidence enjoyment and hope to spare to conciliate to provide for all interests indemnifying those that lose and making an alliance so to speak with time the true auxiliary of all useful changes the chemist which amalgamates contraries dissolves obstacles and unites discordant parties when he possesses real strength it is not necessary that he should exert it that it may be perceived while it is only half discovered he is sure of success every one knows his own interest consists in joining as speedily as possible with the strongest party and none will join in useless resistance unless their selflove has been wounded chapter iv laws appear the worse for being transplanted we have seen the danger that attends the introduction of a large body of laws at once into any country those laws being the best imaginable we have seen the cautions which in the management of such a business require to be observed the danger and the caution which will be requisite in surmounting it will of course be greater in proportion to the divergency of the laws in question from the line of perfection but this is not all the danger in short the mischief for it is more than danger is much greater than in that proportion where the new laws are such as are already in force in another nation would you see the worth of any established body of law in its genuine colours transplant it into a foreign clime the vicious parts of it that is speaking of any system as yet in being the great bulk of it no longer veiled by partiality will display themselves in their genuine weakness and impropriety the people of every country are attached to their own laws to those parts of them at least under which they have been bred and to which they have been taught to pay an habitual acquiescence if the people are not the lawyers are whose voice in a matter of this sort goes the greatest part of the way towards forming what appears to be the voice of the people they were born under them they have been used to them they know no better if they know but little of their own laws they know nothing at all of any others whatever benefit they derive from political society they derive from them and the benefits that are not to be had from them are looked upon as unattainable they are assiduously taught and the people are ready enough to believe that the oppressions they suffer from the same quarter are the price and the necessary price of those benefits the patience of nations under the abuses which are the growth of their own country and their impatience under whatever are imported from a foreign country have their source in the same natural and unavoidable mixture of ignorance and prejudice they will endure abuses they have been accustomed to but they will not endure new ones they will sit easy under the yoke of their own prejudices but they will not sit easy under the prejudices of another people when a body of very imperfect laws such as are the best of those of which the groundwork has been laid in barbarous ages is imported in the lump from one country into another it will be found that opposite judgments will be entertained of it by the two nations the one will be disposed to think a great deal better of it the other if possible a great deal worse of it than it deserves to a man who has learnt by rote what the law in such or such a case happens to be without considering why and for what reason it ought to be so such is his regard for the whole together such is his regard for every individual part that abuses and defects the most flagrant become equally sacred with institutions the most salutary and indispensable     the constitutional branch of the law of england taking it in its leading principles would probably be found the best beyond comparison that has hitherto made its appearance in the world resting at no very great distance perhaps from the summit of perfection thus it stands at least in the opinion of judicious and impartial minds which opinion will i believe appear the more just the more it is considered more particularly when considered with reference to the circumstances and situation of that favoured people whose happiness it is to have stumbled upon so invaluable a possession between this part of the law and some of the principles that govern the system of procedure particularly in what concerns criminal matters there is a pretty strict connection and dependence the honour due to those parts which however superior in importance are in point of truth but as one out of a hundred is extended by an easy process of the imagination or rather of the affections to the other ninetynine examine it piece by piece we should find it a vast bundle of inconsistencies the wisdom of one page being constantly disgraced by the folly of the next but this incongruity does not show itself to the distant and admiring multitude against whose censure its very immensity which is one of its greatest blemishes forms a most effectual defence do you comprehend the whole of it no then pretend not to sit in judgment over any part of it such is the rebuke which the sage professor is ever ready to give to the uninstructed layman such is the opiate which the uninitiated layman is ever ready to administer to himself this predilection how effectually soever it may have veiled from the eyes of englishmen the defects of english laws while the dominion of those laws has been confined within the limits of the country which gave them birth is not so strong but that the experience of their effects when transplanted into bengal has been able to overcome it experience too fatal not to be severely felt and too manifest to be dissembled has demonstrated their inapitude those however who have seen the inapitude of this system because they could not fail to see it and who have cried out under it because the burthen of it was become intolerable complaining of it as unfit to be established there have scarce ventured to go farther bad as they found the system there they have not ventured to insinuate scarcely perhaps have they so much as allowed themselves to suspect that it is chargeable with any intrinsic defects and that it was bad with reference to the country which gave it birth the most striking feature in the original polity of that distant country is the despotism of its leading principles the most striking feature in that of the english government is the strictness of its procedure hence it seems to have been concluded and that too hastily that laws that are competent to a free country must for that reason be incompetent to an arbitrary one from this observation an hypothesis has been formed for reconciling the experienced incompetency of the english laws as applied to bengal with their supposed competency as applied to england laws which are fit for a free country it has been said are for that very reason unfit for a country where the government is arbitrary and despotical that this observation is just as applied to certain parts of the law is not to be denied but that it is applicable to the greater part of them or even to more than a very small part is what i am much disposed to question in opposition to these notions i would venture to lay down the following propositions  st that the english law is a great part of it of such a nature as to be bad every where  d but that it would not only be but appear worse in bengal than in england  d that a system might be devised which while it would be better for bengal would also be better even for england to enable us to form a judgment as to the truth of these propositions let us take a general though rapid view of the english law with a view to the following particulars—   the manner in which it has taken its rise   the nature and texture of it as it stands at present in england   the effects which it either promises to have or has been found to have in consequence of the attempts that have been made to introduce it into bengal these several points cannot always be kept distinct in the mode of treating them but it will be proper that the distinction there is between them should be constantly kept in view the english law like every other body of law which has grown up together as it were by accretion without a plan is distinguishable into statute and customary law the statute law framed with great attention to the circumstances and for the most part with great regard to the welfare of england was framed without any regard to the interests circumstances or welfare of countries the acquisition of which had never been foreseen the customary or as it is called the common law in which accident rather than design has mixed up a few principles which are inestimable has been made up with scarce any regard for the welfare of any country even of that which has given it birth to prove this for a proof suited to the present purpose must be given in a few lines or not at all i shall not dig into the dark ruins of remote antiquity nor send my readers to wander among the discordant elements     of british saxon danish norman and german jurisprudence a single trait is sometimes sufficient to mark with force and verity the character of an individual the character of a body of laws may be learned from the general complexion of it let us interrogate the great oracle of british law sir edward coke in the first volume of his institutes he has furnished us with a list of the topics or heads of argument which according to him furnish the several grounds of decision which are recognised in the courts of justice they are twenty in number of these the principle of utility the argumentum ab inconveniente as he phrases it it must be confessed is one but in what style is it introduced it stands neither the first nor the last nor in any post of honour it is shuffled in without distinction towards the middle to judge from this account what is the chance then that the rule of law on which the decision is grounded in any given instance shall be of the number of those in the framing of which the welfare of the people has been kept in view to judge from this account it should be as one to twenty the farther we penetrate into the recesses of english law taking utility for our guide the better shall we be convinced that the account given of it by this its warmest panegyrist is not an unsuitable one and that for the greater part of it it is a piece of cobweb work spun out of fantastic conceits and verbal analogies rather than a mass of substantial justice cast in the mould of reason that the assertion may not appear entirely gratuitous let us run over a few of the most prominent points in the english law with a rapid pace considering all along how far it answers what ought to be the purposes of its institution in england and thence or otherwise how far it is likely to answer the like purposes in bengal i shall say nothing here of the numerous defects and inconsistencies of the penal branch of the law of the want of symmetry that prevails throughout the whole of the absolute want of names for so many extensive and important heads of delinquency of the total want of authoritative definitions for the few offences that have a name of the multitude of crying injuries which are left without redress of the impunity of so many mischievous practices and the unmerited punishment annexed to so many acts of which the mischief is light or undiscernible of the utter want of plan in the adjustment of punishment to offences of the neglect of every rule of proportion of the want of variety and appositeness in the species of punishment that are employed of the lavish and unnecessary use that is made of the invariable unequable incommensurable uncharacteristic unfrugal unpopular uncompensatory irremissible punishment of death the total want of method and comprehension in the very imperfect attention that is paid to the several grounds of justification aggravation extenuation and exemption the want of fixed and settled principles for ascertaining the quantity and quality of the compensation or other satisfaction which the several sorts of injuries have a claim to these details would lead me into too wide a field for the present purpose and what is more these are defects of which the ruder penal systems already established in bengal would probably be found to possess a still more ample share the points i would rather choose for examples are those in which the inaptitude of the english law must appear the more striking inasmuch as the practice of the asiatic courts in relation to those points is or for any thing that hinders may be less unconformable to the rules of reason a few of these points i shall now run over keeping the outlines of the method i have pitched upon in view but without imposing on myself the duty of touching upon every head or of making out the connection between one head and another the defects i shall have occasion to bring to view will be found to arise from various causes sometimes from the deformities which grew up with the law in its cradle sometimes from the additional deformities which have been produced in it by the circumstances which have happened to accompany its migration it has been said that christianity is part and parcel of the common law of england and under the authority of this dictum those who have dared freely to examine the evidences of christianity and when unconvinced by them to express their opinions have been punished transferred to bengal this law would lay the foundation for the persecution of all the mahometan and hindoo population such is the excellency of the english laws say its panegyrists that there is no right but has its remedy the opposite conclusion is that where there is no remedy there is no right and upon this principle the english common law constantly acts with regard to every thing but land are you an antiquary your otho may be stolen from you and you can only recover the value of the copper are you a connoisseur you may lose your raphael and be paid for the canvas and the colour by the yard are you a lover the miniature of your mistress may be snatched from you by a rival and you only receive for it the price that would be paid by a broker this is bad enough in england where we are accustomed to it transplanted to bengal the evil would of course be increased under english law the greater the injury done to you the less chance have you of reparation if you adversary injure you slightly you may compel him to make you amends by damages if he kill you his purse is saved     at least from making compensation to your family if then you have any purpose of revenge or avarice to answer by keeping a man in confinement do so but let the place be unhealthy and keep him there till his death the law will not allow his family to touch your fortune in this case only let his death be slow transplanted to an asiatic climate what scope does such a law afford to the exercise of asiatic ingenuity the days how broiling the nights how damp the peons how obedient the cutcheries how close the marshes of the ganges how conveniently pestilential the more atrocious the crime the more remediless the party injured take a lawyer unawares propose this maxim to him on a sudden and ask him whether he ever heard of any thing so obviously unjust he will probably answer without hesitation in the negative a maxim like this he would perhaps tell you could have obtained no where but in a nation of idiots was fit only for that imaginary scene depictured for the amusement of children in which the pig is roasting the cook and the thief hanging the judge yet to this maxim a real and very extensive regard is paid by the law of england if a man give you a black eye you may make him pay for it but if he put out your eye you get nothing and whatever is taken from him goes nominally to the king really to john stokes or jack nokes who has no concern at all in the matter if a man kill your pig you get the value of it but if he kill your wife or your child you get nothing if any thing is got out of him it goes to a stranger as before a man sets your house on fire if by misfortune you receive amends if through malice you receive nothing lawyers have been found to defend this for say they so long as satisfaction is made what signifies who gets it to know whether they are sincere pass a law that whosoever owes any thing to these reasoners shall pay it to the king the mahometan law bad as it is is at least unsullied by this abomination it inclines in certain cases towards the opposite extreme substituting satisfaction to punishment instead of superadding it in a country where there is no king who is to get the forfeiture this would make a curious question as lawyers feelingly call it wherever the legislator has left the print of his improvidence had the death of lord pigot been deemed murder the forfeitures of the delinquent council would have afforded noble pickings for the gentlemen of the long robe a rich bone of technical contention what became of the spoils of the bramin nundocomar whom the english judges hanged on pretence that a set of men in london had made forgery a felony without benefit of braminship the standing principle of the good old common law is that the king is every thing is a criminal to be punished it is because he has broken the kings peace is civil justice to be administered it is that the ears of majesty may find rest but in bengal there is no king to be consistent there ought to be no offences at any rate no efficient means of punishing the high officers of government are provided there if that country has hitherto escaped absolute destruction if the lust of power and the thirst of riches have hitherto been kept within any tolerable bounds we must attribute it to the force of the moral not to that of the political sanction to manners and not to laws if we regard the character of the different tribunals in england and refer to their origin we shall find that the present jurisdictions have been obtained by encroachments upon one another but the result of the method in which their powers have been obtained has been that the whole system of procedure has been built upon the foundation of fiction and is full of formalities delays embarrassments and expense of which it is impossible in the course of a chapter to give the details the character of the english judges has in general been above all suspicion and reproach but the course of procedure has been far from possessing that clearness brevity and economy which it ought to have what then must have been the sensations of the poor hindoo when forced to submit to all these wanton and ridiculous vexations unable to attribute to an european mind the folly adequate to the production of such a mass of nonsense and of gibberish he must have found himself compelled to ascribe it to a less pardonable cause to a deliberate plan for forcing him to deliver himself up without reserve into the hands of the european professional bloodsuckers carrying on the traffic of injustice under the cloak of law the most remarkable circumstance connected with these absurdities in english procedure is that the judges are aware of the evils and every now and then act upon a different system but where the english judge acts rightly once in a hundred times the cawzee and the bramin were in the habit of acting rightly every day     but not only were the english commonlaw courts introduced into hindostan with all their fictions they were plagued also with a court of chancery with its interminable delays you are the father of a family you call on me and say two of my children have a dispute about a plaything each of them claims it as his own advise me then what shall i do to settle the matter between them what shall i do to come at the truth i look grave and answer you as follows i fear indeed there is something wrong on one side or the other i am afraid that one or other of them does not speak truth falsehood should not be permitted to gain its ends if i were in your place i would endeavour to sift the matter to the bottom i will tell you then how you shall manage you must not think of sending for either of them and examining him unawares nor of bringing them face to face so far from it should either of them happen to come into the room where you are of his own accord you must take care and not say a syllable to him about the matter ill tell you what you must do let your youngest son tell his story upon paper putting what questions to his brother he thinks proper give the other boy a reasonable time to contrive his answer first six weeks then a month then three weeks then a fortnight if his answer should be evasive then go on the same course with him again perhaps the youngest may by this time think of some questions which he omitted to put the first time or a fresh string of questions may be made requisite by the answers to the first this will make another string of adjournments necessary meantime the eldest perhaps will be for telling his story and putting his questions in return by this means the time for deliberation will be doubled when affairs are come to this pass you may either read what they have written yourself or you may desire their uncle to inquire of the people of the family whether any body heard any thing of what passed taking care not to speak to either of the boys themselves when their uncle has told you what he has learnt then the matter will be ripe for your decision by this time twice as much as the money in dispute will have been spent in pens and paper all memory of what passed at the time when the dispute arose will be at an end your children will have become skilled in the evils of falsehood and evasion the time of the servants will have been taken up in carrying letters and messages backwards and forwards your own time will have been wasted in poring over all this idle scrawl a fixed enmity will have taken root between your children your relations and servants will have taken their parts on one side or on the other and thus the truth will be fully brought to light and the whole family will enjoy uninterrupted peace and harmony after i had made my speech would not you think me in a delirium from the beginning to the end would you think there was the least particle of common sense this however is without the least sophistication the exact progress of what is called a suit in equity a suit which unless justice were denied might be brought for a pecuniary demand as trifling as that which has been here supposed when i say exact i mean as far as it goes but according to a very simple pattern stripped of a thousand incidents by fewer or more of which a suit can scarcely fail to be diversified not a syllable here of pleas replications demurrers bills of interpleader bills of revivor exceptions to reports rehearings motions and the like in the patriarchal government no type could be found of mysteries like these i know very well that a state is larger than a family i know very well that a judge is not to be expected to feel the same impartial tenderness for suitors as a father for his children but it lies upon those who think they can defend the current practice to show why the same methods which are sure to defeat the purposes of justice in the one case are necessary to effect them in the other and who would think it this mass of absurdity is the work of modern refinement not of ancient barbarism the times are clearly marked in history when an english judge had it in his power to do justice it was then thought no more a hardship to compel a man to attend to his own concerns than to attend to the concerns of other people each party was ready to relate and to answer to examine and be examined in the presence of the judge advocates there were a few attornies there were none not a farthing of expense upon either party till it was seen which of them had deserved it if the one had complained without cause he was fined for his vexatiousness if the other had contested the claim without reason he was fined for his litigiousness why then were these simple and pure forms abandoned why were they not reestablished when new tribunals were instituted in another country instead of transferring this system of possible equity and certain misery to bengal chapter v influence of time we now come to speak of the influence of time on the expediency of a law or set of laws the question on this head divides itself into two the laws that are the best possible for     a given place at the time present being found would the same laws had they happened to be found in time past have been the best possible for that time past and the like with relation to the time future this we see when considered with a view to any direct influence it can have is a mere question of speculation nobody can transfer our present laws to time past we cannot transfer them to time future nevertheless as a right way of thinking on this head may contribute perhaps in a manner more or less remote to guard us against mistakes in practice a few words on this head may not be altogether thrown away time as we have already had occasion to observe is nothing of itself to learn what influence it possesses we must inquire what influence may be exercised by those causes of a superior order into which that influence is resolvable in regard to causes purely physical the field of variation at least as to any correspondent variation of influence cannot be very considerable as to the nature of the soil lands once marshy may be drained lands once dry may be overflowed rivers which formerly flowed into the sea may in very particular situations be intercepted and dissipated in their course from lakes communication may be opened to the sea peninsulas may by nature or by industry be converted into islands and continents may be intersected in various directions by canals the higher parts of mountains may crumble down by their own weight or be washed down by rivers at the mouths of rivers islands may be formed or the continents lengthened out by deposition in the sea volcanoes when constant may tend to reduce mountains to a level when occasional they may raise plains into hills sink beds in them for lakes or throw up islands in the sea ports may be deserted or new ones hollowed out by the caprices of the ocean all these alterations may give occasion for correspondent changes in regard to the individual places that are the objects of certain laws principally those laws to which semipublic offences offences against the public force offences against the public wealth respectively owe their birth but the general nature of those offences and the general nature of those laws will be still the same and at any rate whatever modifications on this head are made requisite by time will be such and such only as are made requisite by place it is the same thing with regard to climate and those peculiarities in respect of animal and vegetable produce which are the consequences partly of this circumstance and partly of the former partly by means of cultivation and partly by other causes of which the operation is less known the quantity of sensible heat diffused over the surface of the earth appears to have a tendency by slow degrees to verge towards an equilibrium hot climates become perhaps a little cooler more certainly cold climates become a little warmer the productions of one country are in course of time transplanted to another and the course of cultivation may in consequence be changed but if any change is in consequence required in the laws it arises from the blindness or indolence of the legislator of former times if in his enactments he have employed specific terms he must alter and add to them but if he have employed generic terms it is the nature of these to open up and let in the specific ones as fast as they are formed so far then as the texture of the soil and the nature of its productions are concerned a succession of time may give occasion to a demand for some of the alterations to which a change of place may give occasion but this change will not extend to those variations which are consequences of climate in the moral qualities of men the changes which time may bring on in respect of heat and cold will never be considerable enough to give to one zone the temperature of another it seems to be a common notion that those laws which are the best with reference to the circumstances of a civilized nation would not have been so with reference to the circumstances of a rude and ignorant nation on the contrary that rude nations must have rude and simple that is imperfect laws i mean not only that in point of fact the laws of a rude nation will have been rude but that in point of expediency it was proper they should be so the former of these propositions is undeniable the latter i deny let us examine the time past and look forward to the future §   retrospective view would the best possible laws at the present period have been the best possible laws in times past on this occasion we must once more bring to view the distinction between matters of fact and the matter of right or rather of expediency between what has taken place and what ought to have taken place that in rude ages the tenor of the laws has always been very different from what would be the standard of perfection for the present age is not to be disputed that it could not but have been so without a miracle is also pretty clear but were the imperfect laws which obtained then better for that time than the most perfect which we can imagine now would have been for the same time the affirmative is what seems to have been insinuated but as it should seem without sufficient cause there are two classes of people from whom this notion seems to have gained countenance the one consisting of those who from indolence or timidity or less pardonable motives   0 have found it convenient to set their faces against every proposal that savours of improvement or reformation to people of this description it must have seemed the happiest contrivance imaginable if from the very excellence of a system of laws they could raise an argument and that a conclusive one against its fitness such an argument when sifted to the bottom will indeed be found to be a contradiction in terms but how few are they by whom such arguments can be sifted to the bottom if they can get such an argument to apply to the laws of past times the next step is to transfer it to the present get such an argument to pass muster in the first case in which there is but little reason in it and perhaps you may get it received in the other case in which there is no reason in it at all the other class of people are those who have a system to defend which without some such expedient would be indefensible this is the case with the votaries of all those absurd and false religions which have descended into the details of legislation viewed by the light of polished reason the defects of our code are too glaring to be dissembled say then that from causes peculiar to that age it could not have been better that to invest it with the authority of law in present times would appear to be a measure equally ridiculous and destructive in any country in which the defects of it are not veiled by the thickest prejudice is not to be denied that this pretended emanation of divine wisdom would be found worse than the worst of those systems of law which are in force in polished nations is scarcely to be disputed with any prospect of success what is to be done there is but one thing which is to take the blame off the shoulders of the legislator and lay it upon the people say they were stupid stubborn prejudiced intractable this will put you at your ease you may then acknowledge and acknowledge with safety that in a certain sense the laws were bad and this will entitle you to maintain that in another sense they are good they were bad in theory but they were good the best possible in practice they were bad in appearance but they were the best possible in effect the plea is plausible enough while it keeps to generals and as there is no other it must be made the most of distress of argument forced it from minds engrossed by prejudice and it may pass as any thing else would pass upon those who are prejudiced the same way but come to particulars the illusion vanishes take what nation you will give them what character you please where could have been the advantage that injuries should have been left without redress that men should be teazed and perplexed by a chain of minute and frivolous obligations that punishments perhaps of the severest kind should be heaped on them for acts from which no mischievous consequences can be traced that when the act which is forbidden happens to be of the number of those that are pernicious no account should be taken of the various grounds of justification aggravation extenuation and exemption which are pertinent to the case that punishments should be inflicted without measure and without choice that no enumeration should be given of the grounds of right nor any complete set of principles established for the decision of claims to property that the business of judicial procedure should be abandoned to arbitrary discretion and that where power of any other sort is given no care should be taken to shape it to its end by the necessary apparatus of obligations qualifications and exceptions if there be any ground for denying the truth of the position that the laws which are the best for a civilized would have also been the best for a rude age in any case it is in the case of that part of the law which concerns punishments and that part of it which concerns the laws in principium in a very rude age it is possible that punishments in point of quantity might require to be somewhat greater than it is necessary they should be in a civilized one in a rude age the religious sanction has commonly given but little assistance to the political the force of the former though much greater in a rude than a civilized age being diverted into other channels hence one reason why the quantum of punishment provided by the political sanction may require to be somewhat greater in the former period than in the latter in a rude age the moral sanction has less force than in a civilized one hence another reason for adding something to the magnitude of the punishment provided by the political sanction in a rude period of society the people are not yet broken in to the habit of spontaneously lending their assistance to the laws hence a third reason the differences however that may be occasioned by these circumstances can at the utmost be but very slight especially if the maxim laid down in a former chapter be true that even in a civilized age the whole complement of punishment that is judged necessary must be taken from the political sanction and that the auxiliary sanctions alone cannot safely be depended upon for any part of it if an intelligent mahometan be to be found press him upon the absurdity of the laws of mahomet drive him to his last shift he will say true considered with regard to their application to the purposes of the present life they are indeed not altogether what they might have been if made now but consider the time consider the state of the people the state of knowledge at that time such laws as a man might make now would not have been understood they were excellent     for the time they were excellent for the people better laws than those the people would never have received such laws as a man might make now either could not then have been expressed or would not have been understood to this argument there is a short answer the words that mahomet made use of we know to those words the same ideas or ideas that were the same to all material purposes were annexed then that are annexed now so at least we must suppose in as far as we pretend to understand them give me the words of the koran give me the ideas that belong to them i ask no more out of them and them alone i undertake to produce you a code which shall contain a hundred times the useful matter there is in that without any of those absurdities the existence of which upon comparison made with the ideas of utility we have at present you cannot but acknowledge but better laws though they could have been written at that time and would have been understood would not have been received for the people were an ignorant prejudiced and headstrong people this argument may also be demolished without much difficulty ignorant prejudiced and stubborn as they were did not your prophet tear from them their dearest their most sacred prejudices were they not polytheists and did he not make them unitarians did he not search out with the severest diligence the crimes and vicious propensities they were most addicted to throughout the whole of his system and of his proceedings is any want of firmness any of audacity discernible if not there is but one want to which the imperfection of his system can any longer be attributed the want of wisdom the want of wisdom on the part of a man who you say was taught by god himself the want of a share of wisdom equal to what may be found at present in a man of the most ordinary level my people will not endure even the most necessary restraints i have therefore laid them under a vast multitude that are of no use such logic may pass upon some minds but they must first of all have been prepared by a pretty ample dose of prejudices the energy of character necessary to enable a man to lead mankind to influence as well the intellectual faculties as the affections the character to which we have given the name of enthusiasm is made up of a determined active courage and a rambling imagination no coward no man even of selfish prudence was ever a founder of a new system of legislation nemo unquam vir magnus sine aliquo afflatu divino fuit says cicero the plain truth of this as far as it is true is that the energy of the head in the degree in which it is necessary to constitute a legislator i mean always an enterprising innovating legislator is always accompanied with a more than common degree of energy in the heart it is not to considerations of personal prudence that the imperfections of the laws of mahomet must be attributed he attempted every thing that his genius had discovered the defects in his work arose from want of knowledge if he had known better he would have done better this conclusion if true completely overturns the foundations of the mahometan religion hence he has neglected nothing that could enable him to elude it and the universal ignorance of its professors is partly the result of the contrivance of the legislator to prevent the detection of his imposture it is a saying attributed to solon that the laws he had given to the athenians were not such as were the best in themselves but the best they were capable of receiving in this there was doubtless somewhat of truth especially when applied to that turbulent and jealous people and the saying would hold good in the greatest degree in regard to the constitutional branch of their laws but that it was strictly true one may venture without much hesitation to deny there could not have been a more convenient maxim for saving the credit of a legislator and those who have had a legislator to defend have not failed to make the most of it but there are few maxims perhaps that have been carried so much beyond the mark and it has been frequently cited in cases where it has not only been erroneous in itself but not altogether innocent in its consequences whatever athenian arrogance may pretend it will not easily gain credit with a discerning mind that at so early a period of society the best of all possible laws should have presented themselves to view it will not be believed that among a people whose character disqualified them from receiving any better laws than those which solon gave them there should have existed a man who in his own mind had carried that most difficult of sciences to so high a pitch of perfection that it will never be possible for any other man to carry it higher this sort of apology what degree of truth soever there may have been in it in the instance in which it has been made has since been much abused and it has been employed to gain a reputation of wisdom and expediency for many a mischievous and many a foolish law the law such as it is lies before you yet foolish as you may think it the lawgiver may for aught that you know have been the wisest of mankind but such as the author is such are his works since then the lawgiver is wise the law itself may perhaps be a wise one too how foolish soever it may appear to you it may have had its     use though you and i dont see it let the law then stay where it is to abolish it is dangerous a mischief may ensue which we are not able to foresee such is the circle in which many a man who insensible to the force of truth has nothing to guide him but the prejudice he has conceived in favour of antiquity scruples not to run if any one has a mind to see how far the legislator was entitled to the benefit of this plea let him consider in what channel the prejudices of the people are likely to have run and in what points they are likely to have imposed a coercion upon the legislator it is natural enough they should have opposed any important violent change he might have been inclined to make in the article of religion and yet we have seen religions overthrown by the legislator and others set up in their stead it is natural enough they should oppose the investing men with new powers or making a new distribution of the old and yet in this way too we have seen great changes made by legislators with little or no opposition on the part of the people it is natural enough they should oppose any wishes he might form or might be suspected to entertain of subjecting them to new and irksome restraints or obligations although among the most necessary restraints and obligations we shall find some of the most irksome but a supposition that is not by any means a natural one is that by dint of menaces and clamour they should have forced him to fetter their own freedom by a heap of idle trifling and ridiculous obligations and restraints when a code amidst all its redundancies is defective and regulations of the most obvious use and necessity are looked for in it in vain it is not a mere ipse dixit that will warrant us to give credit for utility to institutions in which not the least trace of utility is discernible §   prospective view will the best possible laws at the present period be the best possible laws in all time to come before a period be put to this chapter it may naturally be expected that some notice should be taken of the immutability which many have been so fond of attributing to certain laws or pretended laws as also of the muchtalkedof distinction between mala in se and mala prohibita with reference to actions a distinction which seems analogous to the former how mighty in every branch of science and in the moral branch in particular how mighty and how universal is the force of words how many questions even of those of which one would least expect it would if examined with attention be found to turn upon nothing else who would have thought it even the question concerning the immutability of certain laws is of the number the same act which ought to be forbidden in one age and country ought it to be forbidden in every other yes and no yes if in pronouncing the word act we have in view a large and general class of acts no if a narrow and particular one the plain truth of the matter is this there are certain acts which admit of laws which if worded in a certain manner may stand good and be equally applicable to all places and times while there are other acts for which no such laws can be devised under the former predicament come those acts of which the name is included in a single word such as murder theft adultery perjury and the like let no one commit murder let no one commit theft let no one commit adultery let no one commit perjury and so on upon this plan we might make a variety of laws of which the expediency might without impropriety be termed universal and immutable but laws while the expression of them is confined to terms so loose and so extensive will never be found precise and clear enough for use the act thus vaguely described must before it can be thoroughly understood and perfectly distinguished be broken down into species the law relating to it must accordingly be broken down into a multitude of laws the phrase pure as it stands now must be transformed into others in which provisions of an expository limitative or exceptive nature will be necessary now among these qualifying provisions will in every case be some the effect of which is to except out of the general prohibition certain cases in which the act is either commanded or allowed by some other branch of the code of law now of these qualifying provisions some it will be found ought in point of expediency to be different in one country from what they are in another different in the same country at one time from what they are at another and this is the secret history of the universality and immutability of these universal and immutable laws the notion concerning the essential distinction between mala in se and mala prohibita is a sort of counterpart and consequence of the former mala in se are the offences that are forbidden by the laws that are immutable mala prohibita such as are prohibited by laws that are not immutable the common notion of this distinction as far as a distinction which has no clearness in it is capable of an explanation seems to be this mala in se which i suppose is put instead of mala per se are acts which are evil of themselves that is although there be no political law by which they stand prohibited mala prohibita are such acts as are indeed evil but would not have been so had it not been for the law by which they stand prohibited the foundation of this distinction is none     of the clearest but to throw some little matter of light upon all this darkness the following observations may be of use— if any act can with propriety be termed pernicious it must be so in virtue of some events which are its consequences this has been clearly shown already therefore no act can strictly speaking be mala in se in itself pernicious nor even of or by itself any farther than the words of or by may be understood to exclude the influence of certain laws now then as to mala prohibita why is it that any act is prohibited if prohibited with good cause because the events which are its consequences are pernicious if the law is a good one the distinction between mala in se and mala prohibita therefore appears but verbal if the consequences are otherwise than pernicious the law and whatever punishment it is sanctioned by are groundless and thence improper again the distinction pretends to suppose abstraction to be made of subsisting political laws but in truth no such abstraction is ever made the cases in which the taking the goods of another is theft depend upon the laws and a similar observation may be made with regard to other acts considered as mala in se even killing becomes murder only in the absence of any ground of extenuation or justification allowed by the law on the other hand the evil of acts termed mala prohibita does not arise from the prohibitory law itself but is the result of that cluster of laws by which the negative or positive act directed to be done or omitted is applied to beneficial purpose the evil however of an act which becomes mischievous in consequence of the establishment of certain laws is not less real than that of an act mala in se the evil of such an act may indeed far exceed the evil even of an act of murder let such an act be the nonpayment of taxes let the deficiency rise to a certain amount an enemy breaks in and among the consequences of the irruption are many thousand homicides which if they have not the name have the effect of murder were i to choose to what i would most truly and readily attribute these magnificent prerogatives of universality and immutability it should rather be to certain grounds of law than to the laws themselves to the principles upon which they should be founded to the subordinate reasons deducible from those principles and to the best plan upon which they can be put together to the considerations by which it is expedient the legislator should suffer himself to be governed rather than to any laws which it is expedient he should make for the government of those who stand committed to his care on this ground then a man engaged in a design like that which is the object of this work might lay claim to the attributes of universality and eternity for the rectitude of his doctrines with as little arrogance as he could claim for them the most confined and temporary expediency provided that in the execution of his plan he has boldness and strength of mind enough to set apart all along whatsoever is peculiar to particular times and places and to raise his contemplation to that elevated point from which the whole map of human interests and situations lies expanded to his view the rules concerning the cases that are respectively meet and unmeet for punishment and for reward the rules concerning the proportion proper to be observed between offences and punishments between acts of merit and reward the rules concerning the properties to be wished for in a lot of punishment and reward the principles on which the division of offences has its foundation the principles on which the various methods of attacking offences by indirect or farfetched means all these if they are just and proper now would at any time have been so and will be so every where and to the end of time they will hold good so long as pleasure is pleasure and pain is pain so long as steel wounds fire burns water seeks a level bread nourishes inanition destroys so long as the tooth of the slanderer keeps its venom so long as difference of sex attracts so long as neighbour needs the help of neighbour so long as men derive credit or fortune from their ancestors or feel an affection for their children the author of a work entitled public happiness has maintained that the condition of man has gone on progressively ameliorating from the commencement of time and dr priestley has expressed his expectation that man will ultimately attain a degree of happiness and knowledge which far surpasses our present conceptions these glorious expectations remind us of the golden age of poetry they have however this advantage the happiness of which they speak is to come and we are not discouraged by vain regrets for what is past we may hope then that in future time improvements will be made among other things in the practice of legislation but we must only consider that the laws have reached the maximum of their perfection and that men have obtained the maximum of their happiness inasmuch as it depends upon the laws when great crimes shall be known only by the laws which prohibit them when the catalogue of prohibited acts shall no longer contain actions the evil of which is imaginary when the rights and duties of the different classes of men shall be so well defined in the civil code that there shall be no suits arising     upon points of law when the system of procedure shall be so simplified that the disputes which from time to time may arise upon questions of fact shall be terminated without any other expense or delay than is absolutely necessary when the courts of justice though always open shall be rarely resorted to when nations having laid aside their arms and disbanded their armies by mutual agreement and not from mutual weakness shall only pay almost imperceptible taxes when commerce shall be free so that what may be done by many shall not be restricted exclusively to a small number and when oppressive taxes prohibitions and bounties shall not prevent its natural development when perfect liberty shall be allowed to those branches of trade which require liberty and positive encouragements shall be granted to those which require it when from the perfection of constitutional law the rights and duties of public officers shall have been so well distributed and the dispositions of the people to submit and to resist so well tempered that the prosperity resulting from the preceding causes shall be beyond the danger of revolutions and in conclusion when the law which should be the rule of human actions shall be concise intelligible without ambiguity and in the hands of every one but to what will the happiness arising from all this amount it may be described as the absence of a certain quantity of evil it will arise from the absence of a part of the different evils to which human nature is subject the increase of happiness which will hence result is doubtless sufficiently great to excite the zeal of all virtuous minds in this career of perfection which is open to us but there is nothing in it unknown or mysterious and which cannot be perfectly understood every thing beyond this is chimerical perfect happiness belongs to the imaginary regions of philosophy and must be classed with the universal elixir and the philosophers stone in the age of greatest perfection fire will burn tempests will rage man will be subject to infirmity to accidents and to death it may be possible to diminish the influence of but not to destroy the sad and mischievous passions the unequal gifts of nature and of fortune will always create jealousies there will always be opposition of interests and consequently rivalries and hatred pleasures will be purchased by pains enjoyments by privations painful labour daily subjection a condition nearly allied to indigence will always be the lot of numbers among the higher as well as the lower classes there will be desires which cannot be satisfied inclinations which must be subdued reciprocal security can only be established by the forcible renunciation by each one of every thing which might wound the legitimate rights of others if we suppose therefore the most reasonable laws constraint will be their basis but the most salutary constraint in its distant effect is always an evil is always painful in its immediate operation the limits of perfectibility are not so easily assigned in some other points it is not possible to say precisely how far the human mind may go in the regions of poetry in the different branches of literature in the fine arts as painting music c it is however probable that the sources of novelty will be exhausted and that if the instruments of pleasure become more exquisite taste will become proportionably severe this faithful picture the result of facts is more worthy of regard than the deceptive exaggerations which excite our hopes for a moment and then precipitate us into discouragement as if we had deceived ourselves in hoping for happiness let us seek only for what is attainable it presents a career sufficiently vast for genius sufficiently difficult for the exercise of the greatest virtues we shall never make this world the abode of perfect happiness when we shall have accomplished all that can be done this paradise will yet be according to the asiatic idea only a garden but this garden will be a most delightful abode compared with the savage forest in which men have so long wandered this discussion has been necessary in order to show that scarcely at present have just ideas been formed of perfection in matters of government until the grand principle of utility had been exhibited until it had been separated from the two false principles with which it had been unceasingly confounded until by the aid of this principle the end to be pursued and the means to be employed had been recognised until so to speak all the legislative apparatus had been provided and all the fundamental truths had been arranged it was impossible to form any precise notion of a perfect system of legislation but if at length these different objects have been accomplished the idea of its perfection is no longer a chimera it is so to speak presented to him who knows how to appreciate it he may trace the whole of its horizon and though no one now living may be permitted to enter into this land of promise yet he who shall contemplate it in its vastness and its beauty may rejoice as did moses when on the verge of the desert

declared   constructed in different languages a table of this sort would afford an interesting specimen of their comparative copiousness and expressiveness   of the value of a pleasure the elements or ingredients are   its intensity   its duration of these two its magnitude is composed   its certainty say rather its probability   its propinquity or nearness measurable no otherwise than by the opposite quality its remoteness in both which cases by the supposition it is not present   its purity which is inversely as the value of any pain or pains loss or losses viz of pleasure in such sort associated with it as that in case of his experiencing the pleasure a man will experience them otherwise not   its fecundity which is directly as the value of any pleasure or pleasures exemption or exemptions viz from pain which in case of his experiencing the pleasure he will experience otherwise not   its extent which is as the number of the persons by whom a pleasure of the sort in question produced by the individual event or state of things in question which is the cause of the pleasure is experienced   apply this to reward to punishment to compensation to the matter of good and the matter of evil employed to those respective purposes in so far as this application is neglected the business of law and government is carried on blindfold  0 positive good understand pathological good is either pleasure itself or a cause of pleasure negative good either exemption from pain or a cause of such exemption    in like manner positive evil is either pain itself or a cause of pain negative evil either loss of pleasure or a cause of such loss    in the character of an interest—a desire—a motive—equivalent to and thence equipollent with a given pleasure may be exemption from a given pain—say for simplicitys sake an exemption equivalent to a given pain loss of a given pleasure—say for simplicitys sake a loss    moral good is as above pathological good in so far as human will is considered as instrumental in the production of it in so far as any thing else is made of it either the word is without meaning or the thing is without value and so in regard to evil    for pathological might here have been put the more ordinary adjunct physical were it not that in that case those pleasures and pains the seat of which is not in the body but only in the mind might be regarded as excluded    take away pleasures and pains not only happiness but justice and duty and obligation and virtue—all which have been so elaborately held up to view as independent of them—are so many empty sounds    as a spring of action a pleasure cannot operate but in so far as in the particular direction in question action is regarded as a means of obtaining it a pain in so far as action is regarded as a means of avoiding it    in so far as it happens not to operate as a spring of action a pleasure may be termed inert pleasures which in their very nature are inert are   all pleasures of mere recollection   all pleasures of mere imagination   even pleasures of expectation when the expected pleasure is regarded as certain and not capable of being by action either brought nearer or increased and so it is with pains  0     in a remote way indeed it may happen to any such pleasure howsoever in itself inert to give birth to action but then it is only by means of some different pleasure which it happens to bring to view    in itself the pleasure derived for example from a recollected landscape is an inert one an effect of it may indeed be the sending a man again to the place to take another view but in that case the operating pleasure—the actuating motive—is a different one viz the pleasurable idea of the pleasurable sensation expected from that other view d original   viz as opposed to derivative by the adjunct original may be distinguished such pleasures as are the immediate and simultaneous accompaniments of perception viz physical i e corporeal or merely psychological i e mental—and so of pains   by the adjunct derivative such as are not accompaniments of perception viz of present perception but are derived from past perception—and so of pains   derived from past perception they are the fruit of memory i e of recollection or of imagination of memory in so far as they are copies of an entire picture of imagination in so far as they are copies taken in the way of abstraction from detached parts of any such picture—those parts being taken either each by itself or mixed up together in any order along with parts taken in like manner from other pictures   derived from imagination if the conception formed of them be accompanied with a judgment more or less decided—a persuasion more or less intense—of the future realization of the pictures so composed the imagination is styled expectation and the pleasure if any there be which is the immediate accompaniment of such persuasion is styled a pleasure of expectation or a pleasure of hope if not so accompanied a pleasure of imagination and nothing more and so of pains except that pains of expectation have for their synonyms not pains of hope but pains of apprehension   thus it is no otherwise than through the medium of the imagination that any pleasure or any pain is capable of operating in the character of a motive it is only through the medium of these derivative representations that the past original can in any shape or in any part be brought to view   note that in the way of imagination from original pleasures may be derived not pleasures only but likewise pains pain for example is a natural accompaniment of the recollected idea of the past pleasure when the expectation is that it will not be—as pleasure is when the expectation is that it will be—again realized and so in the case of pains e simple   the pleasures and pains here brought to view are every one of them simple and elementary out of these others in any number may be compounded and for the compound so made appropriate denominations may be and in an indefinite number have been framed giving each of them to the compound object especially in so far as the denomination employed is singleworded the aspect of a simple one for example in note r pleasures of the bottle   love the sexual considered as a motive   love of justice   love of liberty   objection the pleasures and pains styled as above simple are not so in every instance for under the import of the word physical pleasure no   physical pleasures of all sorts with the several motives are included answer the pleasure which on any individual occasion is here considered as being in question is not the less simple for on the occasion here supposed no more than one such pleasure is as being in prospect though that one may be of any one of the species comprised under the class designated by the word in question viz physical whether of this same class or of any other class or of any two classes suppose two pleasures operating on the same occasion in the character of motives then and then only is it that to the pleasure and to the correspondent motive the epithet compound in the sense in which it is here employed is applicable f interest   a man is said to have an interest in any subject in so far as that subject is considered as more or less likely to be to him a source of pleasure or exemption—subject viz thing or person thing in virtue of this or that use which it may happen to him to derive from that thing person in virtue of this or that service which it may happen to him to receive at the hands of that person   a man is said to have an interest in the performance of this or that act by himself or any other—or in the taking place of this or that event or state of things—in so far as upon and in consequence of its having place this or that good i e pleasure or exemption is considered as being more or less likely to be possessed by him   it is said to be a mans interest that the act the event or the state of things in question should have place in so far as it is supposed that—upon and in consequence of its having place—good to a greater value will be possessed by him than in the contrary case in the former case interest corresponds to a single item in the account of good and evil in the latter case it corresponds to a balance on the side of good   for the word interest no synonyms have been found

hope i e of expectation   need demand exigency necessity may exist without any corresponding desire so likewise want in so far as it is synonymous to these four appellatives without being so to desire exposed to danger a man has need of and so far is in want of all necessary means of safety but so long as he is ignorant of the danger he has no desire of or for any of them   as hope is to pleasure and exemption so is fear to pain and loss   expectation and prospect are without selfcontradiction applicable to pain to loss and to their supposed causes hope not m motives   synonyms to the word

corresponding considerations capable of operating in subservience to these several motives to the will in the character of motives to the understanding no book could comprise the catalogue   to the head of motives to the understanding belong means   the desire existing whatsoever in the character of a means promises to be contributory to the attainment of the end i e to the possession of the pleasure or the exemption which is the object of the desire operates in the character of an incentive i e a motive viz by giving increase to the apparent value of the good in respect of certainty   as by judgment desire is influenced so by desire judgment witness interestbegotten prejudice—the tendency of the influence being in the first case regular and salutary rightly instructive and directive in the other case irregular and naturally sinister deceptious and seductive   motives to the understanding operate as such in every case on the will else they would not be motives the converse does not hold good antecedently to action the actions termed involuntary excepted the will is in every case perceptibly in exercise not so the understanding   in so far as the effect or tendency of the desire is to restrain action not to produce it the term motive cannot be employed without a contradiction in terms unfortunately the word restrictive though in the form of an adjective it is in the form of a substantive is not as yet in the language   of the sorts of psychological powers brought to view in this table under the appellation of motives three at least viz no   regard for reputation c no   piety and no  0 sympathy will be found to be more frequently and extensively as well as more usefully employed to the purpose of restraint than to that of incitement—as restrictives than as motives in comparison of the degree of efficiency with which mans power of producing unhappiness small indeed is that with which his power of producing happiness is capable of being employed by the power of the political sanction almost all the pleasures and pains of which mans nature is susceptible thence almost all the motives to the action of which he is sensible are capable of being applied to the purpose of restraint but except in so far as they are so employed by that power incitement alone is the purpose to which in the character of springs of action as the term springs of action imports the motives under the governance of which man is placed are mostly employed all perform alike the office of a spur  0  upon these few rests principally the charge of performing the office of a bridle   pleasure pain c—connection between the respective imports of these several appellatives when to a mans enjoying a certain good i e a certain pleasure or exemption from a certain pain—it has appeared to him to be necessary that a certain event or state of things should have had place and for the purpose of causing it to have place he has performed a certain act then so it is that among the psychological phænomena which on the occasion in question have had place and operation in his mind are the following viz   he has felt himself to have an interest in the possession of that same good   he has felt a desire to possess it   he has felt an aversion to the idea of his not possessing it   he has felt the want of it   he has entertained a hope of possessing it   he has had before his eyes the fear of not possessing it   and the desire he has felt of possessing it has operated on his will in the character of a motive by the sole operation or by the help of which the act exercised by him as above has been produced  0 such has been the state of the case of whatsoever nature the pleasure or the pain in question has been whether of the selfregarding or of the extraregarding class if of the extraregarding class whether of the social or of the dissocial order or genus    thus it is that these intimately connected but not otherwise commensurable appellatives serve for the exposition of each other no one of these having any superior genus nor consequently being susceptible of the only species of exposition as yet in common use viz that which is called a definition and is performed by the assignment of some word expressive of a superior genus of which the word in question denotes a species    to the will it is that the idea of a pleasure or an exemption applies itself in the first instance in that stage its effect if not conclusive is velleity by velleity reference is made to the understanding viz   for striking a balance between the value of this good and that of the pain or loss if any which present themselves as eventually about to stand associated with it   then if the balance appear to be in its favour for the choice of means thereupon if action be the result velleity is perfected into volition of which the correspondent action is the immediate consequence for the process that has place this description may serve alike in all cases time occupied by it may be of any length from a minute fraction of a second as in ordinary cases to any number of years n eulogistic o dyslogistic p neutral   eulogistic or dyslogistic any such appellative may in either case be termed censorial   thus it is that in addition to the import which in the character of a simple term properly belongs to it will be found involved in every such censorial appellation the import of at least one entire proposition viz a proposition expressive of a judgment of approbation or disapprobation as above   various and as yet seldom altogether determinate are the grounds on which this judgment seems to have been framed—  a supposed excess of intensity on the part of the desire see nos                       a supposed impropriety in the choice of the subject on which the act from which the pleasure is expected to be derived is exercised see no     a supposed impropriety in the nature of the act i e in so far as the imputed impropriety has any intelligible grounds a supposed mischievousness—a balance on the side of evil pathological evil on the part of its consequences see the above and the several other instances   on this occasion to take the case of a dyslogistic appellative the error in so far as there is any consists in this viz that on account of some accidental effect which on this or that occasion has been observed to be produced by the desire the whole corresponding group of psychological entities—pleasure interest desire motive—are on all occasions by the undistinguishing and uneludible force of this condemnatory appellative involved in one common and undistinguishing censure and vice versâ when the censorial appellative is of the eulogistic cast whatsoever mischievous effects are liable and apt to be produced by the desire are covered and kept out of sight whereas to a truly enlightened as well as sincerely benevolent mind it will appear that on each individual occasion it is by the probable balance in the account of utility whether of pleasure or of pain that the judgment whether it be of approbation or of disapprobation ought to be determined q impassioned   between such as are simply censorial and such as are moreover impassioned the line will almost every where be necessarily and irremediably indeterminate on the question to which of the two classes the appellative belongs the decision therefore cannot but be in a proportionable degree arbitrary   passion being among the causes of wrong judgment and consequent misconduct any intimation of the existence of any such feeling in the breast of him by whom the appellative is applied may on that score have its practical use   having without the form the force of an assumption—and having for its object and but too commonly for its effect a like assumption on the part of the hearer or reader—the sort of allegation in question how   0 illgrounded soever is when thus masked apt to be more persuasive than when expressed simply and in its own proper form especially where to the character of a censorial adding the quality and tendency of an impassioned allegation it tends to propagate as it were by contagion the passion by which it was suggested on this occasion it seeks and finds support in that general opinion of the existence of which the eulogistic or dyslogistic sense which thus as it were by adhesion has connected itself with the import of the appellative operates as proof   applied to the several springs of action and in particular to pleasures and to motives these censorial and impassioned appellatives form no inconsiderable part of the ammunition employed in the war of words   under the direction of sinister interest and interestbegotten prejudice they have been employed in the character of fallacies or instruments of deception by polemics of all classes—by politicians lawyers writers on controversial divinity satirists and literary censors   causes of the comparative numbers of censorial and neutral names of motives eulogistic appellatives in some instances abundant in others rare or wanting so likewise dyslogistic in some instances both abundant neutral appellatives in most instances either rare or wanting—such are among the observations which the contents of this table may be apt to suggest of so remarkable a diversity where it may be asked are we to look for the cause—answer in the interest which on the several occasions in their character of makers and employers of language men have understood themselves to have in propagating the persuasion which by the appellatives respectively in question has been endeavoured to be impressed—of this proposition the proof will it is supposed be seen in the following paper entitled observations n b where on this occasion appellatives are said to be wanting understand singleworded ones by combinations of words no assignable object for which appellatives may not be found r compound pleasures exemplified example i pleasures of the bottle—no

ex gr in respect of the influence exercised—immediately or through the medium of the understanding—on the wills of persons on the same side or in the way of intimidation on the wills or sensibilities of persons on the opposite side in the same manner may be analyzed—and resolved into the simple and elementary pleasures of which they are composed—other complex pleasures agreeing with and differing from one another in endless variety according to the nature of the sources from whence they are respectively derived ex gr   pleasures of the ballroom—  pleasures of the theatre—  pleasures of the fine arts—whether severally produced or conjunctively in modes proportion and groups indefinitely diversifiable     note that—according to the nature of the instrument by means of which or of the channel through which any such complex pleasure is considered as being capable of being experienced—the desire may be resolvable into the desire corresponding to this or that one in the catalogue of the more simple pleasures for instance into no   desire of the matter of wealth—no   desire of amity—no   desire of reputation ii observations §   pleasures and pains the basis of all the other entities these the only real ones those fictitious among all the several species of psychological entities the names of which are to be found either in the table of the springs of action or in the explanations above subjoined to it the two of which are as it were the roots—the main pillars or foundations of all the rest—the matter of which all the rest are composed—or the receptacles of that matter—which soever may be the physical image employed to give aid if not existence to conception—will be it is believed if they have not been already seen to be pleasures and pains of these the existence is matter of universal and constant experience without any of the rest these are susceptible of—and as often as they come unlooked for do actually come into—existence without these no one of all those others ever had or ever could have had existence true it is that when the question is—what in the case in question are the springs of action by which on the occasion in question the mind in question has been operated upon or to the operation of which it has been exposed—the species of psychological entity to be looked out for in the first place is the motive but of the sort of motive which has thus been in operation no clear idea can be entertained otherwise than by reference to the sort of pleasure or pain which such motive has for its basis viz the pleasure or pain the idea and eventual expectation of which is considered as having been operating in the character of a motive this being understood the corresponding interest is at the same time understood and if it be to the pleasurable class that the operating cause in question belongs then so it is that in its way to become a motive the interest has become productive of a desire if to the painful class of a correspondent aversion and thus it is that on the occasion in question the operation of a motive of the kind in question whatever it be meaning a motive to the will having had existence it cannot but be that a corresponding desire or aversion—and the idea and eventual expectation at least of a corresponding pleasure or pain—and the idea and belief of the existence of a corresponding interest—must also have had existence on this basis must also be erected and to this standard must be referred—whatsoever clear explanations are capable of being suggested by the other more anomalous appellatives above spoken of such as emotion affection passion disposition inclination propensity quality viz moral quality vice virtue moral good moral evil destitute of reference to the ideas of pain and pleasure whatever ideas are annexed to the words virtue and vice amount to nothing more than that of groundless approbation or disapprobation all language in which these appellatives are employed is no better than empty declamation a virtuous disposition is the disposition to give birth to good—understand always pathological good—or to prevent or abstain from giving birth to evil—understand always pathological evil—in so far as the production of the effect requires exertion in the way of selfdenial i e sacrifice of supposed lesser good to supposed greater good in so far as the greater good to which the less is sacrificed is considered as being the good of others the virtue belongs to the head of probity or beneficence in so far as it is considered as being the good of self to that of selfregarding prudence no    means selecting is the name by which the other branch of prudence may be designated viz that which being subservient in its nature and being so with reference to some interest is equally capable of being understood to be so whether that interest be of the selfregarding class no    or of the extraregarding viz of the social no  0 or of the dissocial class no   §   no act properly speaking disinterested if so it be that of the view here given of the causes of human action the general tenor is conformable to the truth of things then so it is that by means of it divers psychological phænomena—divers phænomena of the human mind—which till now have been either not at all or but indistinctly perceived—phænomena of the most unquestionable importance with reference to practice—will now for the first time have become distinctly visible   in regard to interest in the most extended—which     is the original and only strictly proper sense—of the word disinterested no human act ever has been or ever can be disinterested for there exists not ever any voluntary action which is not the result of the operation of some motive or motives nor any motive which has not for its accompaniment a corresponding interest real or imagined   in the only sense in which disinterestedness can with truth be predicated of human action it is employed in a sense more confined than the only one which the etymology of the word suggests and can with propriety admit of—what in this sense it must be understood to denote being—not the absence of all interest—a state of things which consistently with voluntary action is not possible—but only the absence of all interest of the selfregarding class not but that it is very frequently predicated of human action in cases in which divers interests to no one of which the appellation of selfregarding can with propriety be denied have been exercising their influence and in particular no   fear of god or hope from god and no   fear of illrepute or hope of good repute   if what is above be correct the most disinterested of men is not less under the dominion of interest than the most interested the only cause of his being styled disinterested is—its not having been observed that the sort of motive suppose it sympathy for an individual or a class of individuals has as truly a corresponding interest belonging to it as any other species of motive has of this contradiction between the truth of the case and the language employed in speaking of it the cause is—that in the one case men have not been in the habit of making—as in point of consistency they ought to have made—of the word interest that use which in the other case they have been in the habit of making of it   at the same time by its having been as properly and completely and indisputably the product of interest as any other action ever is or can be whatsoever merit may happen to belong to any action to which in the loose and ordinary way of speaking the epithet disinterested would be applied is not in any the slightest degree lessened not that in the case where sympathy is the motive there is less need of—nor even less actual demand for—such a word as interest than in the case where the motive and interest are of the selfregarding class not but that even in the case of sympathy conjugates of the word interest are employed and even the word itself witness these expressions among so many—there stands a man in whose behalf i feel myself strongly interested a man in whose fate—in whose sorrows—i take a lively interest c c §   appellatives eulogistic dyslogistic and neutral—cause of their comparative penury and abundance as applied to springs of action of the declared opinions of such of the several members of the community by whom respectively in relation to the subject in question an opinion or judgment of approbation or disapprobation is expressed is that quantity of the force of public opinion otherwise termed the force of the popular or moral sanction which is thus brought to bear upon that subject composed and constituted in and by any act by which intimation is given of such his judgment in quality of member of the tribunal by which that judgment is considered as pronounced a man may be considered as delivering his vote on the present occasion the subjectmatter of this judgment will be seen to be the several springs of action by which on the several occasions in question human conduct—human action—is liable to be influenced and determined—these several springs of action considered as being in operation and as giving birth to whatsoever acts or modes of conduct may respectively be the result on and by the delivery of this vote in so far as it is with himself that it originates he makes as it were a motion which by the concurrence of as many as join with him in the sentiment so expressed is formed into a judgment a judgment pronounced by that portion be it what it may of the tribunal of public opinion which the persons so concurring compose i in this as in every other instance in which any thing is either done or said whatsoever is done or said is the result of interest of interest in this or that one of its shapes as above explained—benevolence—sympathy not excluded—operating upon him by whom it is done or said in the character of a motive in this interest will be seen the cause of the several diversities above spoken of and which will now be in a more particular manner brought to view i case   eulogistic appellatives none—for the numbers see the table instances no   desire of food and drink no   sexual desire no   physical desires in general no   desire of power no   curiosity no    love of ease no    desire of selfpreservation no    personal interest in general cause or reason of this deficiency—men in general do not derive any advantage one man from what is done by another for the satisfaction of those several desires objection in the case of no   in this case it is on what is done by some other person for the gratification of this desire that on the part of each person the correspondent     gratification depends—answer true but on the occasion of those more or less elaborated discourses of which language as it stands expressed in and by means of its permanent signs is composed it does not answer a mans purpose to bring it to view in any state other than that in which being as abovem entioned p  0 combined with other desires it enters into the composition of that complex desire which admits of the neutral or rather eulogistic appellative—love ii case   eulogistic abundant—instances no   love of the matter of wealth—no   regard for reputation—no   fear of god—no  0 goodwill towards men cause or reason of all these several desires there is not one which it is not common for one man to behold an advantage to himself in the creating and increasing in the breasts of other men but as to love of the matter of wealth see below case   iii case   dyslogistic wanting—instances none—cause or reason there exists not any species of desire such that by the pursuit of it i e of the object of it it does not frequently happen that one mans interest is opposed and his desires frustrated by the interests and corresponding desires and pursuits of other men iv case   dyslogistic abundant—instances generally speaking all fourteen with little distinction worth noticing cause or reason the same as just mentioned for sexual desire when taken by itself dyslogistic appellatives may be observed to be in a more particular degree abundant cause or reason this may be seen in—  the intensity of the desire—  its aptitude to enter into combination with others as above—  the importance of the consequences with which the gratification of it is liable to be attended—  the variety of ways in which the interests of different persons are liable to be put in opposition to each other by the force of it   of two rivals each is thus by the interest correspondent to this desire prompted to vent his antipathy against his opponent by whatsoever names of reproach he can find applicable   husbands find themselves annoyed by it in the persons of gallants and so in a corresponding manner wives   parents and other guardians in the persons of their wards   legislators moralists and divines finding it operating to so great an extent and with so efficient a force in opposition to their views and endeavours make unceasing war upon it the corresponding compound or mixed desire love being protected by its necessity to the preservation of the species and thence by public opinion the form of invective is by this means directed exclusively against the simple desire which however is not only the basis but the indispensably necessary basis of the whole compound v case   neutral abundant—instances none—cause or reason seldom comparatively speaking has a man occasion to speak of a motive as operating or of a desire c as having place in any human breast—whether his own or any other—without feeling an interest in presenting it either to the approbation or to the disapprobation of those for whose ear or eye his discourse is intended vi case   neutral wanting—instances many understand singleworded appellatives which are the only ones here in question viz no   sexual desire—no   physical desire in general—no   love of money or rather of the matter of wealth—no   love of power—unless ambition as well as aspiringness be regarded as purely neutral—no   desire of amity—no   regard for reputation—no    love of ease—no    the desire corresponding to personal interest at large vii case   eulogistic and dyslogistic both abundant—instance no   love of the matter of wealth—cause or reason under the two respective heads indication has in some measure been already given of it what remains to be given is—an indication of the different circumstances in which judgments thus opposite—the judgment having moreover in each case emotion for its not unfrequent accompaniment—take their rise   as to disbursement and nondisbursement in so far as acquisition has already taken place some persons there will commonly be connected with the person in question by this or that circumstance the effect of which has been to render it their interest that in this or that particular way on this or that particular occasion he should disburse in speaking of disbursement by these it is that appellatives of the eulogistic cast will naturally have been employed—so on the other hand in speaking of nondisbursement appellatives of the dyslogistic cast others there will have been by whose connection with that same person it will have been rendered their interest that in the way in question or the occasion in question he should not disburse in speaking of nondisbursement by these it is that appellatives of the eulogistic cast will naturally have been employed in speaking of disbursement appellatives of the dyslogistic cast   as to acquisition and nonacquisition rivality and competition of interests apart—generally speaking of those who by any tie whether of selfregarding interest or sympathy are more or less intimately connected or disposed to be connected with the party in question it is the interest that the quantity of the matter of wealth possessed by him—of wealth of which an inseparable accompaniment is power—and thence that the quantity     of it acquired by him should at all times be as great as possible but so far as concerns acquisition finding that operation necessary as it is to human existence loaded notwithstanding to wit by the influence of the abovementioned causes with the sort of reproach involved in the import of the several articles in the long list of dyslogistic appellatives exhibited in the table—and at the same time not provided with eulogistic nor so much as with neutral appellatives—thence in their endeavours to obtain for it the approbation of their hearers or readers—and for that purpose to elude the force of the dyslogistic appellatives which in a manner lie in wait for it unable to find for the desire in question any appellatives which by its eulogistic quality would be rendered applicable to their purpose—men put aside that species of desire and look out for some other which being furnished with eulogistic appellatives shall at the same time be nearly enough resembling to it or connected with it to be made to pass instead of it under these circumstances labour being necessary to the acquisition of wealth and at the same time equally necessary to the preservation of existence thus it is that disguised under the name of desire of labour the desire of wealth has been in some measure preserved from the reproach which with so much profusion has been wont to be cast upon it when viewed in a direct point of view and under its own name meantime as to labour although the desire of it—of labour simply—desire of labour for the sake of labour—of labour considered in the character of an end without any view to any thing else is a sort of desire that seems scarcely to have place in the human breast yet if considered in the character of a means scarce a desire can be found to the gratification of which labour and therein the desire of labour is not continually rendered subservient hence again it is that when abstraction is made of the consideration of the end there scarcely exists a desire the name of which has been so apt to be employed for eulogistic purposes and thence to contract an eulogistic signification as the appellative that has been employed in bringing to view this desire of labour industry is this appellative and thus it is that under another name the desire of wealth has been furnished with a sort of letter of recommendation which under its own name could not have been given to it aversion—not desire—is the emotion—the only emotion—which labour taken by itself is qualified to produce of any such emotion as love or desire ease which is the negative or absence of labour—ease not labour—is the object in so far as labour is taken in its proper sense love of labour is a contradiction in terms frugality economy—these it is true are eulogistic terms but by these preservation of the quantity of wealth acquired—preservation only not acquisition—is the thing indicated add to the above the terms thrift and thriftiness for if in the import of these two latter terms acquisition be in any way included it is only in a confined way and as in the beforementioned cases as it were by stealth insinuated it is declared it can scarce be said to be to thrive is the property—the physical property—of a plant or an inferior species of animal applied to a human being—employed in a psychological sense—it is indicative of prosperity in general—of happiness in general—and not in the shape of any particular pleasure reaped in and from the gratification of the correspondent particular desire viii case   eulogistic appellatives how supplied—in some instances in default of a singleworded one manyworded appellatives of the eulogistic cast may be formed by adding to a neutral or but faintly dyslogistic appellative an eulogistic adjunct—examples   no   dyslogistic appellative sensuality eulogistic adjunct refined   neutral though but faintly dyslogistic appellative luxury eulogistic adjunct elegant and note in this view the phrase luxury of beneficence   no   neutral or but faintly dyslogistic appellative ambition eulogistic adjunct honest generous noble laudable virtuous c   no   dyslogistic appellative pride eulogistic adjunct honest generous c as above n b some instances there are in which the quantity of odium heaped upon the desire by this or that dyslogistic appellative is so great as not to be overbalanced or so much as counterbalanced by any eulogistic adjunct that can be set in the scale against it by any such additament the expression would be made to wear the appearance of a selfcontradictory one—examples no   dyslogistic appellatives gluttony drunkenness no   dyslogistic appellatives lewdness c no   dyslogistic appellative servility no    neutral appellative antipathy dyslogistic appellative malignity in company with none of these would any such epithets as honest generous noble virtuous laudable c be found endurable §   good and bad—attributives applied to species of motives impropriety of the application—its causes and effects as there is not any sort of pleasure the enjoyment of which if taken by itself is not a good—taken by itself that is on the supposition that it is not preventive of a more than equivalent pleasure or productive of more than equivalant pain—nor any sort     of pain from which taken in like manner by itself the exemption is not a good—in a word as there is not any sort of pleasure that is not itself a good nor any sort of pain the exemption from which is not a good—and as nothing but the expectation of the eventual enjoyment of pleasure in some shape or of exemption from pain in some shape can operate in the character of a motive—a necessary consequence is that if by motive be meant sort of motive there is not any such thing as a bad motive no nor any such thing as a motive which to the exclusion of any other can with propriety be termed a good motive incontestable as the correctness of these positions will be found to be perpetual are the occasions on which in discourses on moral political and even legal subjects motives are distinguished from and contrasted with one another under the respective names of good motives and bad motives from this speculative error practical errors of the very first importance may be seen to have taken their rise in the instance of any person to assign as the cause by which any act of his has been produced any motive to which the adjunct bad is wont to be prefixed is among the number of acts for which under the description of criminal offences men are held punishable—punishable—yes and actually and habitually punished—when perhaps in the very nature of the case one of the sort of motives thus denominated is the only one by which the act in question the existence of which is unquestionable could have been produced in the composition of this error what there is of truth seems to be this viz that as there are some motives the force of which they being either of the selfregarding or of the dissocial class is more liable than the force of those of the remaining class viz the social class to operate in the breast of each particular individual to the prejudice of the general good—of the interest of mankind at large so on the other hand there are others—and more particularly among those which belong to the social class—which in a particular degree are capable of being employed and with success in checking the operative force of the above comparatively dangerous motives and restraining it from applying itself with effect to the production of acts of the tendency just mentioned but if in any such observations a sufficient warrant were supposed to be found for attaching to a motive of the former description the appellative of a bad motive or to a motive of the other description any such appellative as that of a good motive—and for acting accordingly viz by punishing a man as often as his conduct was deemed to have for its cause one of these bad motives or rewarding him as often as it was found to have for its cause any one of those good motives—of any such error supposing it universally embraced and permanently acted upon the destruction of the whole human race would be the certain consequence—regulators are good things mainsprings are bad things therefore to make a good watch put into it regulators two or as many more as you please but not one mainspring exactly as conducive as such notions would be to good watchmaking would be to good government the notion that mens conduct ought not to be influenced by any motives but those of the sort commonly called good motives—that it ought not ever to be influenced by any motives of the sort commonly called bad motives a measure of government is brought to view—by certain persons it is opposed—the motives by which they are engaged in the opposition to it are it is said bad motives—conclusion it ought to be adopted a measure of government is brought to view—by certain persons it is supported—the motives by which they are engaged in the support of it are it is said bad motives—conclusion it ought to be rejected—by the influence of arguments such as these how frequently has a bad measure been adopted a good measure thrown out for an alleged wrong a person is under prosecution the motives by which the prosecutor is engaged in the prosecution are it is said bad motives lucre for example or selfish ambition or vengeance therefore the defendant ought to be acquitted or the prosecution quashed—by the influence of arguments such as these how frequently has a wrongdoer been exempted from the infliction due to his transgression—exempted more or less either from punishment or from the burthen of satisfaction in a pecuniary or in whatever other shape it has been due and note that for the sort of imputation of which this argument is composed seldom can there be any difficulty in finding a plausible ground or even a true one note however that from the nature of the motive the mischief produced by an action of a mischievous species is really liable to receive very considerable increase but it is not from the sort of motive which is most apt to be spoken of as a bad motive that in this case the mischief will always receive the greatest increase the desire of acquiring the matter of wealth—let this as it so commonly is be set down in the catalogue of bad motives yet by those who bear hardest upon it it will hardly be deemed so bad a motive as revenge but there are offences of which when produced by the desire of the matter of wealth the mischief is by far greater than that of an offence of the same     denomination produced by revenge take for example murder committed in prosecution of a plan of highway robbery and murder produced by a private quarrel in the first case in the alarm and danger—in which consists by far the greater part of the mischief—all are sharers whose occasions happen to call them that way in the second case none but those to whom it might happen to offer to the murderer a provocation equally irritating with that which gave occasion to his crime of all motives actual or imaginable the very best if goodness were to be measured by necessity to human existence would be the motives that correspond respectively to the desires of food and drink no   and to sexual desire no   yet to any such desire as that of eating or drinking by those by whom so much is said of good motives and so much stress is laid upon the degree of goodness of a mans motives admittance would scarcely have been given into their list of good motives and as to sexual desire taken by itself so bad a thing is it commonly deemed in the character of a motive or even in the character of a desire that all the force which it is in the power of human exertion to muster has to a great extent been employed in the endeavour to extinguish it altogether under the general name of selfregarding interest no    are comprisable the several particular interests corresponding to all the several motives that do not belong either to the social class no  0 or the dissocial class no    weed out of the heart of man this species of interest with the corresponding desires and motives the thread of life is cut and the whole race perishes—selfregarding interest—has it any where a place in the catalogue of good motives oh no scarce any where as yet is it known by any such unimpassioned any such neutral name selfinterest selfishness interestedness these are the only names it is known by and to any of these to attach good—any such epithet as good—would be a contradiction in terms fear of god no  —sympathy no  0—love of reputation no  —to these if to any would be assigned a place—and if not the only place the highest place—in the catalogue of good motives yet in a savage state to look no higher men have existed from the very first in countless multitudes with scarce any perceptible traces in their conduct of the influence or existence of any such motives at any rate in the character of motives capable of operating with efficiency as a check to excess in the action of the selfregarding and dissocial motives moreover of all those good motives the goodness or badness of the effect depends altogether upon the direction in which on each occasion they act—upon the nature of the effects—the consequences pleasurable or painful of which they become efficient causes or preventives   fear of god the mischiefs of which this motive has been productive are altogether as incontestable as and still more distinctly visible than the good effects witness the word persecution with the miseries which it serves to bring to view   sympathy of the operation of sympathy in so far as the object of it is but a single individual the effects supposing it to operate alone and unchecked may be neither better nor worse than those of selfishness of these effects the degree of its efficiency being given the goodness depends upon the extent to which they reach and that extent—such is its amplitude—has at one end unity at the other the number of the whole of the human race—or rather of the whole sensitive race all species included—present and future   love of reputation infanticide when committed by the mother of an illegitimate offspring has no other motive for its cause murder committed upon the body of any other individual in whose agency in the way of testimony or any other a man beholds a cause of life in respect of reputation is equally capable of being produced by the same cause conquest—a short word for the aggregate of all the crimes and all the mischiefs that man is capable of committing or suffering by—in particular for murder robbery and violence in every other imaginable shape committed all of them upon the very largest scale—is even without any such aid as that of love of power love of the matter of wealth or antipathy capable of being produced by this same motive see more on this head in introduction to principles of morals and legislation ch motives §   proper subjects of the attributives good and bad are consequences intentions acts habits dispositions inclinations and propensities so of the attributives virtuous and vitious except consequences how as to interests and desires consequences and intentions—intentions considered in respect of the consequences to the production of which they are directed or at any rate in respect of the consequences which at the time of the intention a man actually had or at least ought it is supposed to have had in view—these together with the acts which the intentions in question are considered as having been directed to the production of or as having a tendency to produce—will it is believed be seen to be the only subjects to which in the character of attributives such adjuncts as good and bad can either with speculative propriety or     without danger of practical error in so far as acts and springs of action are concerned be attached to motives they cannot without impropriety be attached—viz for the reasons already exhibited at large for the like reasons neither can bad be attached to pleasures or to exemptions viz from pain nor good to pains or to losses viz of pleasure for the like reasons neither can vitious be attached to pleasures any more than virtuous to pains for the like reasons neither can bad be attached to any species of interests—nor therefore good to any species of interest to the exclusion of any other of late years though any such expression as good interest has hardly ever been seen or heard yet the expression best interests—chiefly in the rhetorical or other impassioned style is become a common one according to analogy for the same reasons neither should vitious any more than bad or good be attached to desires aversions or propensities but when the word desire is employed it is commonly with reference to some act—which for the gratification of the desire the person in question is considered as having it in contemplation to exercise and—forasmuch as in respect of consequences and intentions the adjuncts good and bad are in strictness of speech and without any danger of leading to error properly as well as continually attached to acts—thence it is that in as far as any act—any sort of act or any individual act—to which those epithets may with propriety be attached is in view these same epithets may without impropriety as in practice they are continually be applied to desires so likewise the epithets vitious and virtuous as accordingly the epithet vitious frequently is as also sometimes the epithet virtuous though not with equal frequency to dispositions inclinations and propensities—vitious and virtuous as well as bad and good are and with similar propriety frequently applied in practice to aversions the occasion for applying them has not in the instance of any one of those four attributives been wont to present itself with any considerable degree of frequency in respect of the relation that has place between the import of the word act and the import of the word habit—we hear of good and bad virtuous and vitious habits—as properly and at least as frequently as of good and bad virtuous and vitious acts applied to interests in the character of a dyslogistic epithet instead of bad or vitious we have sinister—eulogistic except as above best—the superlative of good—we have none in ethics sinister has not as in anatomy and thence in heraldry dexter for its accompaniment on this occasion by sinister if any thing determinate is meant is meant—operating or tending to operate in a sinister direction i e in such a direction as to give birth to a bad alias a vitious act the sorts of bad or vitious acts of which sinister interest is in practice commonly spoken of as the efficient cause seem to be more frequently if not exclusively such as come under the denomination of acts of improbity than such as come under the denomination of acts of imprudence such as are considered as injurious to the interests of other persons than such as are considered as injurious to the interest of the agent himself—but it is in the accidental course of practice and not in the nature of the case that the restriction will it is believed be seen to have originated §   causes of misjudgment and misconduct—intellectual weakness inborn and adoptive—sinister interest and interestbegotten prejudice as between the two main departments of the human mind viz the volitional and the intellectual—according as it is the one or the other the state of which is under consideration as being subjected or exposed to the operation of interest—termed in so far as the direction in which it is considered as operating is considered as sinister sinister interest as above—the result of the operation will receive a different description in so far as it is the volitional department—in so far as it is the will—delinquency with or without immorality—or immorality—with or without delinquency—is the result in so far as it is the intellectual faculty misjudgment—with or without misconduct—is the result as to error though mostly employed as synonymous to misjudgment it is not unfrequently employed as synonymous to misconduct and therefore not fit to be employed in contradistinction to it indigenous intellectual weakness—adoptive intellectual weakness—or in one word prejudice—sinister interest understand selfconscious sinister interest—lastly interestbegotten though not selfconscious prejudice—by one or other of these denominations may be designated it is believed the cause of whatever is on any occasion amiss in the opinions or conduct of mankind of these several distinguishable psychological causes of misjudgment and misconduct the mutual relations may be stated as follows of the intellectual department the condition—of the intellectual faculties the operation—is on every occasion exposed to the action and influence of the sensitive and the volitional judgment—opinion—is liable to be acted upon influenced and perverted by interest     on the occasion in question suppose misjudgment alone or misconduct alone or both together to have had place—suppose a judgment more or less erroneous to have been pronounced—an opinion in some way or other erroneous to have been formed in this case in the production of the result as above interest may have had or may not have had a share if no the result has had for its cause mere weakness—intellectual weakness—whether it be indigenous or adoptive i e prejudice if yes then whatsoever of misconduct may happen to be included in it has had for its cause either sinister interest i e selfconscious sinister interest or interestbegotten prejudice §   simultaneously operating motives—cooperating conflicting or both seldom it will readily be seen does it happen that a mans conduct stands exposed to the action of no more than one motive frequently indeed—not to say commonly—does it happen that on one and the same occasion it is acted upon by a number of motives acting in opposite direction in each of those two opposite directions respectively sometimes by one sometimes by more than one motive and on every such occasion be it what it may the action is of course the result of that one motive or that group of simultaneously operating motives of which on that same occasion the force and influence happen to be the strongest be this as it may on every occasion conduct—the course taken by a mans conduct—is at the absolute command of—is the neverfailing result of—the motives—and thence in so far as the corresponding interests are perceived and understood of the corresponding interests—to the action of which his mind—his will—has on that same occasion stood exposed employ the term freewill—to the exclusion of the term freewill employ the term necessity—in respect of the truth of the above observations the language so employed will not be found to be expressive of any real difference §   substitution of motives acts produced by one motive commonly ascribed to another—causes of this misrepresentation the sort of motives to the influence of which a man would in general be best pleased that his breast should be regarded as most sensible—this for the present purpose may serve for the explanation of what is meant by good motives the reverse may serve for bad motives in his dealings with other men it is seldom however that a man is not exposed to the conjunct action of motives more than one in so far as this sort of concurrence is observable the sort of motive to which a mans conduct will be apt to be ascribed in preference will vary with the relative position of him to whom on the occasion in question it happens to speak or think of it the best motive that will be recognised as capable of producing the effect in question is the motive to which the man himself—and in proportion as their dispositions towards him are amicable other men in general—will be disposed to ascribe his conduct and accordingly to exhibit it in the character of the sole efficient cause or at the least as the most operative among the efficient causes by which such his conduct was produced things being in this state—if among the causes by which the conduct in question was actually produced a motive of a complexion sufficiently respected be to be found this is the motive to which—at least in the character of a predominant one—but most naturally because most simply in the character of the exclusively operative one the conduct will be ascribed but if no such sufficiently respected motive can be found then instead of the actual motive some such other motive will be looked out for and employed as being sufficiently favourable shall by the nearness of its connexion with the actual one have been rendered most difficultly distinguishable from it to speak shortly if the actual motive do not come up to the purpose another will in the account given of the matter be substituted to it or more shortly still the motive will be changed and so vice versa in the case of enmity thus it is that for example in political contention no line of conduct can be pursued by either of two parties but what by persons of the same party is ascribed to good motives by persons of the opposite party to bad motives—and so in every case of competition which as most such cases have has any thing in it of enmity on any such occasion the motive which though but one out of several actual and cooperating motives or though it be but as above a substituted motive is thus put forward may be designated by the appellation of the covering motive being employed to serve as a covering to whatsoever actually operating motives would not have been so well adapted as itself to the purpose in view follow a few examples— i no   desire corresponding to the pleasures of the palate eulogistic covering sympathy viz as implied in some such expression as love of good cheer—love of a social bowl or glass nb for pleasure of this sort taken by itself—i e for solitary gratification in this shape—a covering of the eulogistic cast would scarcely be to be found ii no   sexual desire eulogistic covering love viz the compound affection of which     the component elements are brought to view as above to the single desire of having children is the sexual intercourse ascribed by romebred lawyers in the case of marriage a desire for which there is no place but in the breasts of the comparatively few who are in a state of relative affluence after birth—in how high a degree soever the child is an object of love—before birth to indigent parents the same child could scarcely have been an object of desire iii no   desire of the matter of wealth eulogistic covering industry a desire as above which if by it be meant the desire of labour simply and for its own sake has no existence no   love of power—eulogistic coverings   love of country—a mans own country i e sympathy for the feelings of its inhabitants—present or future or both—taken in the aggregate   love of mankind philanthropy i e sympathy for the human race taken in the aggregate such being the effects to the production of which the exercise of power will whether it be or no be said to be directed   love of duty another impossible motive in so far as duty is understood as synonymous to obligation an act the performance of which is seen or supposed to be amicable to mankind at large or to his own countrymen in particular—any such act a man may love to do either on that consideration or on any other but be it which it may and let him find ever so much pleasure in the doing of it what is not possible is—that a man should derive any pleasure from any such thought as that of being forced to do it   sense of duty by this—if by it be meant any thing but the love of duty as above—will be meant fear of the several pains which in the character of evil consequences to the individual in question may as it appears to him befall him in case of a neglect on his part in relation to that same duty—fear of legal punishment fear of loss of amity at the hands of this or that individual—fear of loss of reputation—fear of the wrath of god iv no   desire of amity viz of obtaining or preserving a share more or less considerable in the goodwill and therein in the eventual good offices of this or that particular individual coverings   sympathy at large as towards that same individual   gratitude as towards that same individual i e sympathy produced by reflection on such or such benefits already received at his hands   no    antipathy—illwill viz towards this or that particular individual—in so far as prosecution whether at the bar of a legal tribunal or at the bar of public opinion has been the instrument employed in the gratification of the desire—covering public spirit no  0 or love of justice the compound affection as above so—if the object in which a gratification for the desire is sought be an act of enmity at large exercised with out any such warrant—the action may perhaps still by the agent in question or even in his behalf by a friend be termed an act of justice viz of that justice which is exercised by the infliction of suffering on a person to whom with or without sufficient ground misconduct in some shape or other has been imputed of these six species of desires and motives by the operation of which so large a portion of the business of human life is carried on it is not very often that any one will either by the man himself or even by any other person in so far as such other person speaks in the character of his friend be recognised in quality of so much as a cooperating cause much less as the sole cause of the effect which by the conjunct or perhaps sole operation of it has been produced these desires and motives may accordingly be considered as the unseemly parts of the human mind of the sort of figleaves commonly employed for the covering of them specimens have now been given as above   0     a fragment on government or a comment on the commentaries being an examination of what is delivered on the subject of government in general in the introduction to sir william blackstones commentaries with a preface in which is given a critique on the work at large by jeremy bentham esq of lincolns inn rien ne recule plus le progrès des connoissances quun mauvais ouvrage dun auteur célèbre parce quavant dinstruire il faut commencer par detromper montesquieu esprit des loix l xxx ch xv             preface to the first edition published in      the age we live in is a busy age an age in which knowledge is rapidly advancing towards perfection in the natural world in particular every thing teems with discovery and with improvement the most distant and recondite regions of the earth traversed and explored—the allvivifying and subtle element of the air so recently analyzed and made known to us—are striking evidences were all others wanting of this pleasing truth correspondent to discovery and improvement in the natural world is reformation in the moral if that which seems a common notion be indeed a true one that in the moral world there no longer remains any matter for discovery perhaps however this may not be the case perhaps among such observations as would be best calculated to serve as grounds for reformation are some which being observations of matters of fact hitherto either incompletely noticed or not at all would when produced appear capable of bearing the name of discoveries with so little method and precision have the consequences of this fundamental axiom it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong been as yet developed be this as it may if there be room for making and if there be use in publishing discoveries in the natural world surely there is not much less room for making nor much less use in proposing reformation in the moral if it be a matter of importance and of use to us to be made acquainted with distant countries surely it is not a matter of much less importance nor of much less use to us to be made better and better acquainted with the chief means of living happily in our own if it be of importance and of use to us to know the principles of the element we breathe surely it is not of much less importance nor of much less use to comprehend the principles and endeavour at the improvement of those laws by which alone we breathe it in security if to this endeavour we should fancy any author especially any author of great name to be and as far as could in such case be expected to avow himself a determined and persevering enemy what should we say of him we should say that the interests of reformation and through them the welfare of mankind were inseparably connected with the downfall of his works of a great part at least of the esteem and influence which these works might under whatever title have acquired such an enemy it has been my misfortune and not mine only to see or fancy at least i saw in the author of the celebrated commentaries on the laws of england an author whose works have had beyond comparison a more extensive circulation have obtained a greater share of esteem of applause and consequently of influence and that by a title on many grounds so indisputable than any other writer who on that subject has ever yet appeared it is on this account that i conceived some time since the design of pointing out some of what appeared to me the capital blemishes of that work particularly this grand and fundamental one the antipathy to reformation or rather indeed of laying open and exposing the universal inaccuracy and confusion which seemed to my apprehension to pervade the whole for indeed such an ungenerous antipathy seemed of itself enough to promise a general vein of obscure and crooked reasoning from whence no clear and sterling knowledge could be derived so intimate is the connexion between some of the gifts of the understanding and some of the affections of the heart it is in this view then that i took in hand that part of the first volume to which the author has given the name of introduction it is in this part of the work that is contained whatever comes under the denomination of general principles it is in this part of the work that are contained such preliminary views as it seemed proper to him to give of certain objects real or imaginary which he found connected with his subject law by identity of name two or three sorts of laws of nature the revealed law and a certain law of nations it is in this part of the work that he has touched upon several topics which relate to all laws or institutionsa in general or at least to whole     classes of institutions without relating to any one more than to another to speak more particularly it is in this part of his work that he has given a definition such as it is of that whole branch of law which he had taken for his subject that branch which some considering it as a main stock would term law without addition and which he to distinguish it from those others its condivident branchesb terms law municipal—an account such as it is of the nature and origin of natural society the mother and of political society the daughter of law municipal duly begotten in the bed of metaphor—a division such as it is of a law individually considered into what he fancies to be its parts—an account such as it is of the method to be taken for interpreting any law that may occur in regard to the law of england in particular it is here that he gives an account of the division of it into its two branches branches however that are no ways distinct in the purport of them when once established but only in respect of the source from whence their establishment took its rise the statute or written law as it is called and the common or unwritten—an account of what are called general customs or institutions in force throughout the whole empire or at least the whole nation—of what are called particular customs institutions of local extent established in particular districts and of such adopted institutions of a general extent as are parcel of what are called the civil and the canon laws all three in the character of so many branches of what is called the common law—in fine a general account of equity that capricious and incomprehensible mistress of our fortunes whose features neither our author nor perhaps any one is well able to delineate—of equity who having in the beginning been a rib of law but since in some dark age plucked from her side when sleeping by the hands not so much of god as of enterprising judges now lords it over her parent sister— all this i say together with an account of the different districts of the empire over which different portions of the law prevail or over which the law has different degrees of force composes that part of our authors work which he has styled the introduction his eloquent discourse on the study of the law with which as being a discourse of the rhetorical kind rather than of the didactic i proposed not to intermeddle prefaces the whole it would have been in vain to have thought of travelling over the whole of so vast a work my design therefore was to take such a portion of it as might afford a fair and adequate specimen of the character and complexion of the whole for this purpose the part here marked out would i thought abundantly suffice this however narrow in extent was the most conspicuous the most characteristic part of our authors work and that which was most his own the rest was little more than compilation pursuing my examination thus far i should pursue it i thought as far as was necessary for my purpose and i had little stomach to pursue a task at once so laborious and so invidious any farther if hercules according to the old proverb is to be known ex pede much more thought i is he to be known ex capite in these views it was that i proceeded as far as the middle of the definition of law municipal it was there i found not without surprise the digression which makes the subject of the present essay this threw me at first into no small perplexity to give no account of it at all—to pass wholly sub silentio so large and in itself so material a part of the work i was examining would seem strange at the same time i saw no possibility of entering into an examination of a passage so anomalous without cutting in pieces the thread of the discourse under this doubt i determined at any rate for the present to pass it by the rather as i could not perceive any connexion that it had with any thing that came before or after i did so and continuing my examination of the definition from which it digressed i travelled on to the end of the introduction it then became necessary to come to some definitive resolution concerning this eccentric part of it and the result was that being loth to leave the enterprise i had begun in this respect imperfect i sat down to give what i intended should be a very slight and general survey of it the farther however i proceeded in examining it the more confused and unsatisfactory it appeared to me and the greater difficulty i found in knowing what to make of it the more words it cost me i found to say so in this way and by these means it was that the present essay grew to the bulk in which the reader sees it when it was nearly completed it occurred to me that as the digression itself which i was examining was perfectly distinct from and unconnected with the text from which it starts so was or so at least might be the critique on that digression from the critique on the text the former was by much too large to be engrafted into the latter and since if it accompanied it at all it could only be in the shape of an appendix there seemed no reason why the same publication should include them both to the former therefore as being the least i determined to give that finish which i was able and which i thought was nenecessary     and to publish it in this detached manner as the first if not the only part of a work the principal and remaining part of which may possibly see the light some time or other under some such title as that of a comment on the commentaries in the meantime that i may stand more fully justified or excused at least in an enterprise to most perhaps so extraordinary and to many doubtless so unacceptable it may be of use to endeavour to state with some degree of precision the grounds of that war which for the interests of true science and of liberal improvement i think myself bound to wage against this work i shall therefore proceed to mark out and distinguish those points of view in which it seems principally reprehensible not forgetting those in which it seems still entitled to our approbation and applause there are two characters one or other of which every man who finds any thing to say on the subject of law may be said to take upon him—that of the expositor and that of the censor to the province of the expositor it belongs to explain to us what as he supposes the law is to that of the censor to observe to us what he thinks it ought to be the former therefore is principally occupied in stating or in inquiring after factsc the latter in discussing reasons the expositor keeping within his sphere has no concern with any other faculties of the mind than the apprehension the memory and the judgment the latter in virtue of those sentiments of pleasure or displeasure which he finds occasion to annex to the objects under his review holds some intercourse with the affections that which is law is in different countries widely different while that which ought to be is in all countries to a great degree the same the expositor therefore is always the citizen of this or that particular country the censor is or ought to be the citizen of the world to the expositor it belongs to show what the legislator and his underworkman the judge have done already to the censor it belongs to suggest what the legislator ought to do in future to the censor in short it belongs to teach that science which when by change of hands converted into an art the legislator practises let us now return to our author of these two perfectly distinguishable functions the latter alone is that which it fell necessarily within his province to discharge his professed object was to explain to us what the laws of england were ita lex scripta est was the only motto which he stood engaged to keep in view the work of censure for to this word in default of any other i find it necessary to give a neutral sense the work of censure as it may be styled or in a certain sense of criticism was to him but a parergon—a work of supererogation a work indeed which if aptly executed could not but be of great ornament to the principal one and of great instruction as well as entertainment to the reader but from which our author as well as those that had gone before him on the same line might without being chargeable with any deficiency have stood excused a work which when superadded to the principal would lay the author under additional obligations and impose on him new duties which notwithstanding whatever else it might differ in from the principal one agrees with it in this that it ought to be executed with impartiality or not at all if on the one hand a hasty and indiscriminating condemner of what is established may expose himself to contempt on the other hand a bigoted or corrupt defender of the works of power becomes guilty in a manner of the abuses which he supports the more so if by oblique glances and sophistical glosses he studies to guard from reproach or recommend to favour what he knows not how and dares not attempt to justify to a man who contents himself with simply stating an institution as he thinks it is no share it is plain can justly be attributed nor would any one think of attributing to him any share of whatever reproach any more than of whatever applause the institution may be thought to merit but if not content with this humbler function he takes upon him to give reasons in behalf of it reasons whether made or found by him it is far otherwise every false and sophistical reason that he contributes to circulate he himself is chargeable with nor ought he to be holden guiltless even of such as in a work where fact not reason is the question he delivers as from other writers without censure by officiously adopting them he makes them his own though delivered under the names of the respective authors not much less than if delivered under his own for the very idea of a reason betokens approbation so that to deliver a remark under that character and that without censure is to adopt it a man will scarcely therefore without some note of disapprobation be the instrument of introducing in the guise of a reason an argument which he does not really wish to see approved some method or other he will take to wash his hands of it some method or other he will take to let men   0 see that what he means to be understood to do is merely to report the judgment of another not to pass one of his own upon that other then he will lay the blame at least he will take care to repel it from himself if he omits to do this the most favourable cause that can be assigned to the omission is indifference—indifference to the public welfare—that indifference which is itself a crime it is wonderful how forward some have been to look upon it as a kind of presumption and ingratitude and rebellion and cruelty and i know not what besides not to allege only nor to own but to suffer any one so much as to imagine that an oldestablished law could in any respect be a fit object of condemnation whether it has been a kind of personification that has been the cause of this as if the law were a living creature or whether it has been the mechanical veneration for antiquity or what other delusion of the fancy i shall not here inquire for my part i know not for what good reason it is that the merit of justifying a law when right should have been thought greater than that of censuring it when wrong under a government of laws what is the motto of a good citizen to obey punctually to censure freely thus much is certain that a system that is never to be censured will never be improved that if nothing is ever to be found fault with nothing will ever be mended and that a resolution to justify every thing at any rate and to disapprove of nothing is a resolution which pursued in future must stand as an effectual bar to all the additional happiness we can ever hope for pursued hitherto would have robbed us of that share of happiness which we enjoy already nor is a disposition to find every thing as it should be less at variance with itself than with reason and utility the commonplace arguments in which it vents itself justify not what is established in effect any more than they condemn it since whatever now is establishment once was innovation precipitate censure cast on a political institution does but recoil on the head of him who casts it from such an attack it is not the institution itself if well grounded that can suffer what a man says against it either makes impression or makes none if none it is just as if nothing had been said about the matter if it does make an impression it naturally calls up some one or other in defence for if the institution is in truth a beneficial one to the community in general it cannot but have given an interest in its preservation to a number of individuals by their industry then the reasons on which it is grounded are brought to light from the observation of which those who acquiesced in it before upon trust now embrace it upon conviction censure therefore though illfounded has no other effect upon an institution than to bring it to that test by which the value of those indeed on which prejudice alone has stamped a currency is cried down but by which the credit of those of sterling utility is confirmed nor is it by any means from passion and illhumour that censure passed upon legal institutions is apt to take its birth when it is from passion and illhumour that men speak it is with men that they are in illhumour not with laws it is men not laws that are the butt of arroganced spleen     and turbulence may indeed prompt men to quarrel with living individuals but when they make complaint of the dead letter of the law the work of departed lawgivers against whom no personal antipathy can have subsisted it is always from the observation or from the belief at least of some real grievance the law is no mans enemy the law is no mans rival ask the clamorous and unruly multitude—it is never the law itself that is in the wrong it is always some wicked interpreter of the law that has corrupted and abused ite thus destitute of foundation are the terrors or pretended terrors of those who shudder at the idea of a free censure of established institutions so little does the peace of society require the aid of those lessons which teach men to accept of any thing as a reason and to yield the same abject and indiscriminating homage to the laws here which is paid to the despot elsewhere the fruits of such tuition are visible enough in the character of that race of men who have always occupied too large a space in the circle of the profession a passive and enervate race ready to swallow any thing and to acquiesce in any thing with intellects incapable of distinguishing right from wrong and with affections alike indifferent to either insensible shortsighted obstinate lethargic yet liable to be driven into convulsions by false terrors deaf to the voice of reason and public utility obsequious only to the whisper of interest and to the beck of power this head of mischief perhaps is no more than what may seem included under the former for why is it an evil to a country that the minds of those who have the law under their management should be thus enfeebled it is because it finds them impotent to every enterprise of improvement not that a race of lawyers and politicians of this enervate breed is much less dangerous to the duration of that share of felicity which the state possesses at any given period than it is mortal to its chance of attaining to a greater if the designs of a minister are inimical to his country what is the man of all others for him to make an instrument of or a dupe of all men surely none so fit as that sort of man who is ever on his knees before the footstool of authority and who when those above him or before him have pronounced thinks it a crime to have an opinion of his own those who duly consider upon what slight and trivial circumstances even in the happiest times the adoption or rejection of a law so often turns circumstances with which the utility of it has no imaginable connexion—those who consider the desolate and abject state of the human intellect during the periods in which so great a part of the still subsisting mass of institutions had their birth—those who consider the backwardness there is in most men unless when spurred by personal interests or resentments to run atilt against the colossus of authority—those i say who give these considerations their due weight will not be quite so zealous perhaps as our author has been to terrify men from setting up what is now private judgment against what once was publicf nor to thunder down the harsh epithet of arrogance on those who with whatever success are occupied in bringing rude establishments to the test of polished reason they will rather do what they can to cherish a disposition at once so useful and so rareg which is so little connected with the causes that make popular discontentments dangerous and which finds so little aliment in those propensities that govern the multitude of men they will not be for giving such a turn to their discourses as to bespeak the whole of a mans favour for the defenders of what is established nor all his resentment for the assailants they will acknowledge that if there be some institutions which it is arrogance to attack there may be others which it is effrontery to defend tourreilh has defended torture torture established by the public judgment of so many     enlightened nations beccaria indecent and arrogant beccaria has condemned it of these two whose lot among men would one choose rather—the apologists or the censors of a piece with the discernment which enables a man to perceive and with the courage which enables him to avow the defects of a system of institutions is that accuracy of conception which enables him to give a clear account of it no wonder then in a treatise partly of the expository class and partly of the censorial that if the latter department is filled with imbecility symptoms of kindred weakness should characterize the former the former department however of our authors work is what on its own account merely i should scarce have found myself disposed to intermeddle with the business of simple exposition is a harvest in which there seemed no likelihood of there being any want of labourers and into which therefore i had little ambition to thrust my sickle at any rate had i sat down to make a report of it in this character alone it would have been with feelings very different from those of which i now am conscious and in a tone very different from that which i perceive myself to have assumed in determining what conduct to observe respecting it i should have considered whether the taint of error seemed to confine itself to parts or to diffuse itself through the whole in the latter case the least invidious and considering the bulk of the work the most beneficial course would have been to have taken no notice of it at all but to have sat down and tried to give a better if not the whole in general but scattered positions only had appeared exceptionable i should have sat down to rectify those positions with the same apathy with which they were advanced to fall in an adverse way upon a work simply expository if that were all there were of it would have been alike ungenerous and unnecessary in the involuntary errors of the understanding there can be little to excite or at least to justify resentment that which alone in a manner calls for rigid censure is the sinister bias of the affections if then i may still continue to mention as separate parts which in the work itself are so intimately and indeed undistinguishably blended it is the censorial part alone that has drawn from me that sort of animadversion i have been led to bestow indiscriminately on the whole to lay open and if possible supply the imperfections of the other is an operation that might indeed of itself do service but that which i thought would do still more service was the weakening the authority of this under the sanction of a great name every string of words however unmeaning—every opinion however erroneous will have a certain currency reputation adds weight to sentiments from whence no part of it arose and which had they stood alone might have drawn nothing perhaps but contempt popular fame enters not into nice distinctions merit in one department of letters affords a natural and in a manner irrecusable presumption of merit in another especially if the two departments be such between which there is apparently a close alliance wonderful in particular is that influence which is gained over young minds by the man who on account of whatever class of merit is esteemed in the character of a preceptor those who have derived or fancy themselves to have derived knowledge from what he knows or appears to know will naturally be for judging as he judges for reasoning as he reasons for approving as he approves for condemning as he condemns on these accounts it is that when the general complexion of a work is unsound it may be of use to point an attack against the whole of it without distinction although such parts of it as are noxious as well as unsound be only scattered here and there on these considerations then it may be of use to show that the work before us in spite of the merits which recommend it so powerfully to the imagination and to the ear has no better title on one account than on another to that influence which were it to pass unnoticed it might continue to exercise over the judgment the introduction is the part to which for reasons that have been already stated it was always my intention to confine myself it is but a part even of this introduction that is the subject of the present essay what determined me to begin with this small part of it is the facility i found in separating it from every thing that precedes or follows it this is what will be more particularly spoken to in another placei it is not that this part is among those which seemed most open to animadversion it is not that stronger traces are exhibited in this part than in another of that spirit in our author which seems so hostile to reformation and to that liberty which is reformations harbinger it is not here that he tramples on the right of private judgment that basis of every thing that an englishman holds deark it is not here in particular that he insults our understandings with nugatory reasons stands forth the professed champion of religious intolerance or openly sets his face against civil reformation it is not here for example he would persuade     us that a trader who occupies a booth at a fair is a fool for his pains and on that account no fit object of the laws protectionl it is not here that he gives the presence of one man at the making of a law as a reason why ten thousand others that are to obey it need know nothing of the matterm it is not here that after telling us in express terms there must be an actual breaking to make burglary he tells us in the same breath and in terms equally express where burglary may be without actual breaking and this because the law will not suffer itself to be trifled withn it is not here that after relating the laws by which peaceable christians are made punishable for worshiping god according to their consciences he pronounces with equal peremptoriness and complacency that every thing yes every thing is as it should beo it is not here that he commands us to believe and that on pain of forfeiting all pretensions to either sense or probity that the system of our jurisprudence is in the whole and every part of it the very quintessence of perfectionp     it is not here that he assures us in point of fact that there never has been an alteration made in the law that men have not afterwards found reason to regretq it is not here that he turns the law into a castle for the purpose of opposing every idea of fundamental reparationr     it is not here that he turns with scorn upon those beneficient legislators whose care it has been to pluck the mask of mystery from the face of jurisprudences if here as every where he is eager to hold the cup of flattery to high station he has stopt short however in this place of idolatryt     it is not then i say this part it is not even any part of that introduction to which alone i have any thoughts of extending my examination that is the principal seat of that poison against which it was the purpose of this attempt to give an antidote the subject handled in this part of the work is such as admits not of much to be said in the person of the censor employed as we have seen in settling matters of a preliminary nature—in drawing outlines it is not in this part that there was occasion to enter into the details of any particular institution if i chose the introduction then in preference to any other part it was on account of its affording the fairest specimen of the whole and not on account of its affording the greatest scope for censure let us reverse the tablet while with this freedom i expose our authors ill deserts let me not be backward in acknowledging and paying homage to his various merits a justice due not to him alone but to that public which now for so many years had been dealing out to him it cannot be supposed altogether without title so large a measure of its applause correct elegant unembarrassed ornamented the style is such as could scarce fail to recommend a work still more vitious in point of matter to the multitude of readers he it is in short who first of all institutional writers has taught jurisprudence to speak the language of the scholar and the gentleman put a polish upon that rugged science cleansed her from the dust and cobwebs of the office and if he has not enriched her with that precision that is drawn only from the sterling treasury of the sciences has decked her out however to advantage from the toilette of classic erudition enlivened her with metaphors and allusions and sent her abroad in some measure to instruct and in still greater measure to entertain the most miscellaneous and even the most fastidious societies the merit to which as much perhaps as to any the work stands indebted for its reputation is the enchanting harmony of its numbers a kind of merit that of itself is sufficient to give a certain degree of celebrity to a work devoid of every other so much is man governed by the ear the function of the expositor may be conceived to divide itself into two branches that of history and that of simple demonstration the business of history is to represent the law in the state it has been in in past periods of its existence the business of simple demonstration in the sense in which i will take leave to use the word is to represent the law in the state it is in for the time beingv again to the head of demonstration belong the several businesses of arrangement narration and conjecture matter of narration it may be called where the law is supposed to be explicit clear and settled matter of conjecture or interpretation where it is obscure silent or unsteady it is matter of arrangement to distribute the several real or supposed institutions into different masses for the purpose of a general survey to determine the order in which those masses shall be brought to view and to find for each of them a name the businesses of narration and interpretation are conversant chiefly about particular institutions into the details of particular institutions it has not been my purpose to     descend on these topics then i may say in the language of procedure non sum informatus viewing the work in this light i have nothing to add to or to except against the public voice history is a branch of instruction which our author though not rigidly necessary to his design called in not without judgment to cast light and ornament on the dull work of simple demonstration this part he has executed with an elegance which strikes every one with what fidelity having not very particularly examined i will not take upon me to pronounce among the most difficult and the most important of the functions of the demonstrator is the business of arrangement in this our author has been thought and not i conceive without justice to excel at least in comparison of any thing in that way that has hitherto appeared tis to him we owe such an arrangement of the elements of jurisprudence as wants little perhaps of being the best that a technical nomenclature will admit of a technical nomenclature so long as it is admitted to mark out and denominate the principal heads stands an invincible obstacle to every other than a technical arrangement for to denominate in general terms what is it but to arrange and to arrange under heads what is it but to denominate upon a large scale a technical arrangement governed then in this manner by a technical nomenclature can never be otherwise than confused and unsatisfactory the reason will be sufficiently apparent when we understand what sort of an arrangement that must be which can be properly termed a natural one that arrangement of the materials of any science may i take it be termed a natural one which takes such properties to characterize them by as men in general are by the common constitution of mans nature disposed to attend to such in other words as naturally that is readily engage and firmly fix the attention of any one to whom they are pointed out the materials or elements here in question are such actions as are the objects of what we call laws or institutions now then with respect to actions in general there is no property in them that is calculated so readily to engage and so firmly to fix the attention of an observer as the tendency they may have to or divergency if one may so say from that which may be styled the common end of all of them the end i mean is happinessw and this tendency in any act is what we style its utility as this divergency is that to which we give the name of mischievousness with respect then to such actions in particular as are among the objects of the law to point out to a man the utility of them or the mischievousness is the only way to make him see clearly that property of them which every man is in search of the only way in short to give him satisfaction from utility then we may denominate a principle that may serve to preside over and govern as it were such arrangement as shall be made of the several institutions or combinations of institutions that compose the matter of this science and it is this principle that by putting its stamp upon the several names given to those combinations can alone render satisfactory and clear any arrangement that can be made of them governed in this manner by a principle that is recognised by all men the same arrangement that would serve for the jurisprudence of any one country would serve with little variation for that of any other yet more the mischievousness of a bad law would be detected at least the utility of it would be rendered suspicious by the difficulty of finding a place for it in such an arrangement while on the other hand a technical arrangement is a sink that with equal facility will swallow any garbage that is thrown into it that this advantage may be possessed by a natural arrangement is not difficult to conceive institutions would be characterized by it in the only universal way in which they can be characterized by the nature of the several modes of conduct which by prohibiting they constitute offencesx these offences would be collected into classes denominated by the various modes of their divergency from the common end that is as we have said by their various forms and degrees of mischievousness in a word by those properties which are reasons for their being made offences and whether any such mode of conduct possesses any such property is a question of experiencey now a bad law is that which prohibits a mode of conduct that is not mischievousz thus would it be found impracticable to place the mode of conduct prohibited by a bad law under any denomination of offence without asserting such a matter of fact as is contradicted by experience thus cultivated in short the soil of jurisprudence would be found to repel     in a manner every evil institution like that country which refuses we are told to harbour any thing venomous in its bosom the synopsis of such an arrangement would at once be a compendium of expository and of censorial jurisprudence nor would it serve more effectually to instruct the subject than it would to justify or reprove the legislator such a synopsis in short would be at once a map and that an universal one of jurisprudence as it is and a slight but comprehensive sketch of what it ought to be for the reasons of the several institutions comprised under it would stand expressed we see and that uniformly as in our authors synopsis they do in scattered instances by the names given to the several classes under which those institutions are comprised and what reasons not technical reasons such as none but a lawyer gives nor any but a lawyer would put up withaa but reasons such as were they in themselves what they might and ought to be and expressed too in the manner they might and ought to be any man might see the force of as well as he nor in this is there any thing that need surprise us the consequences of any law or of any act which is made the object of a law—the only consequences that men are at all interested in—what are they but pain and pleasure by some such words then as pain and pleasure they may be expressed and pain and pleasure at least are words which a man has no need we may hope to go to a lawyer to know the meaning ofbb in the synopsis then of that sort of arrangement which alone deserves the name of a natural one terms such as these—terms which if they can be said to belong to any science belong rather to ethics than to jurisprudence even than to universal jurisprudence will engross the most commanding stations what then is to be done with those names of classes that are purely technical—with offences for example against prerogative with misprisions contempts felonies præmunirescc what relation is it that these mark out between the laws that concern the sorts of acts they are respectively put to signify and that common end we have been speaking of not any in a natural arrangement what then would become of them they would either be banished at once to the region of quiddities and substantial forms or if and in deference to attachments too inveterate to be all at once dissolved they were still to be indulged a place they would be stationed in the corners and byeplaces of the synopsis stationed not as now to give light but to receive it but more of this perhaps at some future time to return to our author embarrassed as a man must needs be by this blind and intractable nomenclature he will be found i conceive to have done as much as could reasonably be expected of a writer so circumstanced and more and better than was ever done before by any one in one part particularly of his synopsis several fragments of a sort of method which is or at least comes near to what may be termed a natural onedd are actually to be found we there read of corporal injuries of offences against peace against health against personal securityee liberty property—light is let in though irregularly at various places in an unequal imitation of this synopsis     that has lately been performed upon what is called the civil law all is technical all in short is darkness scarce a syllable by which a man would be led to suspect that the affair in hand were an affair that happiness or unhappiness was at all concerned inff to return once more to our authors commentaries not even in a censorial view would i be understood to deem them altogether without merit for the institutions commented on where they are capable of good reasons good reasons are every now and then given in which way so far as it goes one half of the censors task is well accomplished nor is the dark side of the picture left absolutely untouched under the head of trial by jury are some very just and interesting remarks on the yetremaining imperfections of that mode of trial and under that of assurances by matter of record on the lying and extortious jargon of recoveries† so little however are these particular remarks of a piece with the general disposition that shows itself so strongly throughout the work indeed so plainly adverse to the general maxims that we have seen that i can scarce bring myself to attribute them to our author not only disorder is announced by them but remedies wellimagined remedies are pointed out one would think some angel had been sowing wheat among our authors taresgg with regard to this essay itself i have not much to say the principal and professed purpose of it is to expose the errors and insufficiencies of our author the business of it is therefore rather to overthrow than to set up which latter task can seldom be performed to any great advantage where the former is the principal one to guard against the danger of misrepresentation and to make sure of doing our author no injustice his own words are given all along and as scarce any sentence is left unnoticed the whole comment wears the form of what is called a perpetual one with regard to a discourse that is simply institutional and in which the writer builds upon a plan of his own a great part of the satisfaction it can be made to afford depends upon the order and connexion that are established between the several parts of it in a comment upon the work of another no such connexion or at least no such order can be established commodiously if at all the order of the comment is prescribed by the order perhaps the disorder of the text the chief employment of this essay as we have said has necessarily been to overthrow in the little therefore which has been done by it in the way of setting up my view has been not so much to think for the reader as to put him upon thinking for himself this i flatter myself with having done on several interesting topics and this is all that at present i propose among the few positions of my own which i have found occasion to advance some i observe which promise to be far from popular these it is likely may give rise to very warm objections objections which in themselves i do not wonder at and which in their motive i cannot but approve the people are a set of masters whom it is not in a mans power in every instance fully to please and at the same time faithfully to serve he that is resolved to persevere without deviation in the line of truth and utility must have learnt to prefer the still whisper of enduring approbation to the shortlived bustle of tumultuous applause other passages too there may be of which some farther explanation may perhaps not unreasonably be demanded but to give these explanations and to obviate those objections is a task which if executed at all must be referred to some other opportunity consistency forbad our expatiating so far as to lose sight of our author since it was the line of his course that marked the boundaries of ours   0 historical preface intended for the second edition i the booksellers obliging attention in applying for my permission to do what he had a full right to do without any such permission had produced on my part a desire to make in some shape or other a return for it i could think of none more suitable than the supplying him with a few recollections relative to the effects public and private which followed this my first attempt and the then unseen causes in which they have for some time appeared to me to have had their root i had gone some length when the conception struck me that by being put together in a certain order the facts might be made productive of an incomparably more useful effect and in this hope i must find what consolation i can for the consumption of a quantity of time much exceeding my original expectations the change consists in the adding as deduced from the particular facts a confirmation of those general conceptions in the development and application of which no small portion of the aggregate mass of my intervening works have been employed namely that no system or form of government ever had or ever could have had for its actual and principal end in view the good of any other persons than the very individuals by whom on each occasion the powers of it were exercised that in particular this has been the case with the least bad of all bad governments—the english that of the angloamerican united states being the first of all governments to which the epithet of good in the positive sense of the word could with propriety be attached that in england in particular in this case have been all the individuals and all the bodies among whom the powers of government have at any time been shared and in a more particular manner such of the functionaries as have been at the head of the judicial department functionaries by whom under the notion and pretence of exercising no other than judicial power legislative power has with the connivance and in subservience to the sinister interest of the supreme and sole ostensible legislature been all along usurped and exercised what at the same time occurred to me was—that those allcomprehensive conclusions of which in my view the facts are demonstrative and which will accordingly in this comparatively short trifle be seen expressed in the most direct terms and without any the smallest doubt disguise or reserve—are the same as those which in the memoirs of bubb doddington and of horace walpole as well as in many others by which of late years such new and instructive lights of the same colour have been spread over the field of government suggest themselves to an observant mind but have not in either of those works received any such determinate expression and that thus in the minds of some readers this little additional fragment thus incidentally pinned upon a former fragment might have the farther use of serving as a sort of key to the mysteries as yet but incompletely revealed in those no less instructive than interesting anterior and in every sense greater works as to claim to confidence the relative time of publication gives to this preface so far as it goes the advantage over those works for the correctness of the narration it affords a sort of security which in those instances has no place the narrative not having in either of them been intended for publication till the author should be out of the way of all personal responsibility in respect of it ii when the fragment made its appearance the sensation it produced was for some time not inconsiderable to the unqualified admiration which the commentaries had for so many years been in possession of it constituted the first considerable exception perhaps the very first exception bearing any thing like a general aspect that had ever been seen in print no name being in the titlepage nor any information concerning the author obtainable from the bookseller conjecture set itself to work more than one father was found for it each of the very first class no minor one lord mansfield lord camden and mr dunning the latter five years afterwards cabineted and ennobled under the title of lord ashburton it was by dr johnson that it was fathered upon dunning that prime leader of the kings bench bar much about that time i belonged     to a dinner club of which johnson was the despot it was not however immediately from his mouth that the conjecture reached me it came through some other member to whom he had mentioned it completely erroneous as it was it was not perhaps completely groundless the sagacity of his deluded but powerful mind was exemplified by it the eloquence of dunning was eminently and exclusively of the logical cast not any the slightest ray of sentimentality was ever seen to issue from it as to myself in the days of my studentship the chief part of my attendance was paid at the kings bench if in my style appropriate aptitude in any shape or degree is discernible it is probably in no small degree to dunning that it is due precision correctness clearness guardedness in expression—closeness in argumentation—seemed to me his characteristic features in these combined with force he seemed to me altogether without a rival to these he added a sort of controversial insinuation such as belonged to his purposes and not to mine that which i here speak of is that which i heard from him in public for in private at that time i never had had any the slightest intercourse with him at the bar of all men that i had ever heard he had been the one whom i had heard with the greatest pleasure and attention the one whose style in speaking it seemed to me that on all occasions it would be matter of the highest satisfaction to me to be able in any way to imitate when the style has thus been mentioned every thing has been mentioned in which the lexicographers conjecture could find any the slightest support it proves the collateral fact—that not only the affections but the acquirements of the preeminent lawyer who was the subject of it were altogether unknown to the miserable and miserypropagating ascetic and instrument of despotism by whom it was delivered in the fragment marks of some little general acquaintance with the field of science and general literature may be seen here and there peeping out the office of his father—a country attorney whose abode was in the little town from which the son on his elevation took his title—had been the university of john dunning whatever analogy may in respect of certain faculties have had place between the illustrious advocate and the obscure reformist—in respect of feelings and wishes with relation to the universal interest nothing could be much more opposite some grounds for this assurance will be presently seen the two other conjectures were still more completely groundless and though coming from professional men as completely destitute of or rather opposite to manifest probability as conjectures can easily be i speak of the intrinsic evidence afforded by the work compared with the high political situation and professionally known characters of these its reputed authors as to lord camden nothing could be much less assorted to his character or situation than a work of the complexion of the fragment on the hill of forensic ambition lord camdens place had for years been on the summit the authors was at the very bottom to lord camden in his situation nothing could be more completely wanting than all inducement to assume and keep up the tone of juvenility and tyroship which will be seen pervading the work and painting in genuine colours the state of the authors mind for improvements in the state of the law the author had long been under the stimulus of that appetite which age the grand moderator of most appetites has left hitherto undamped to lord camden all improvement in that line was an object of undisguised aversion for this assurance the direct evidence afforded by documents of a public nature—the direct evidence—negative and positive together will of itself if my recollection does not greatly deceive me afford tolerably sufficient warrant and if so the little private incidents which will be seen presently will receive their explanation from it and operate in the character of circumstantial evidence in confirmation of it in favour of innovation in any such shape not a syllable i am confident is to be found in any speech of his that has been handed down to us if this be correct here then though but negative is the direct evidence as to positive evidence the same sources would be found to afford that which is but too conclusive i recollect not nor would it be worth the search at what exact time my eyes were first wounded by it the following little history will enable the reader should he think it worth his while to find it some time after the appearance of the fragment the house of commons was found to contain a small knot of young men in whose minds a disposition to contribute to the improvement of the law had begun to manifest itself william eden who afterwards entered into the diplomatic career and was raised to the peerage by the title of lord auckland was one of them probably enough for i have no recollection about the others at the head of them the first fruit of their labours was the production of a bill which had for its object the clearing the statutebook of a few insignificant samples of its antique rubbish if i recollect right there were half a dozen of them altogether incapable were they of doing good in any shape on the other hand they did no harm in any shape always excepted the encumbering the statutebook contributing to the confusion     with which it covers the field of legislation and loading with so much useless lumber the memory and the purse of one of these samples alone the remembrance still dwells with me date the   th of edward i language french object preventing the importation of certain pieces of coined metal called pollards or crokards i know not how it happened nor is it material it was with that commodity as with corn at present the abundance of it was a nuisance severe penalties were employed for the exclusion of it the reader need scarce be informed that the danger of an excess in that article could not be very menacing at the time of the bringing in of mr edens bill in the commons it was suffered to pass but in the house of lords it found armed against it an authority altogether irresistible it was lord camdens from such authority in a place where authority is every thing very few words were sufficient i remember reading them in the newspapers of the words themselves i have no recollection nor are they worth searching for as to the purport of them what i am confident of is that it would be found in the book on fallacies probably in mr dumonts edition of it in french and moreover that it would serve for the exclusion as well of the most important improvement as of the minute projected benefit which it was thus employed to crush not even by any of the most determined antireformists of the present day with or without the mask of a reformist on his countenance would the reform if such it may be called be termed either intemperate or immoderate seeing it thus dealt with i was chagrined to the degree that may be imagined chagrined and at that time even astounded for at that time no suspicion to the prejudice of the liberalism of that head of the whig lawyers had i believe as yet presented itself to my mind iii among the effects of the work such as it was was a sort of concussion produced by it in the sort of world it belonged to in the world of politics but more particularly in the world of law more particularly still in the higher regions the inhabitants of which in this as in other professions form a sort of celestial conclave of the secrets of which whatsoever observation is endeavoured to be made from the subjacent low grounds is made through a medium impregnated with awe admiration and conjecture the peep here given into its mysteries will perhaps be found neither uninteresting nor uninstructive it may be assistant to the grand purposes which the work itself has for its objects—objects which may be seen containing the germ of every thing which on the same field has been sown by the same hand since a more particular object is the throwing light into the den of the longrobed cacus—cacus felt the light and trembled the more extensive and indeed allcomprehensive object is the pointing attention to the imperfections which even at that time of day were seen swarming in the frame of the government and to the ricketiness of the only foundations in which on the ground of argument it had ever found support no such imperfection having place but what brought profit in some shape or other to those among whom the power was shared their interest of course was that those same imperfections should in their whole mass remain for ever unremoved and therefore be at all times as little as possible in view as a basis for all such operations as should be directed to this same object the fragment at the same time fragment as it was undertook to set up and may be seen setting up accordingly the greatest happiness of the greatest number in the character of the proper and only proper and defensible end of government as the only standard by which any apt judgment could be formed on the propriety of any measure or of the conduct of any person occupied in making opposition or giving support to it at that time of day so far as regards the general frame of the government scarcely in any one of those imperfections did the author of the fragment see the effect of any worse cause than inattention and prejudice he saw not in them then what the experience and observations of nearly fifty years have since taught him to see in them so plainly the elaborately organized and anxiously cherished and guarded products of sinister interest and artifice under the name of the principle of utility for that was the name adopted from david hume the fragment set up as above the greatest happiness principle in the character of the standard of right and wrong in the field of morality in general and of government in particular in the field of government it found in this country the original contract in possession of that character the existence of that pretended agreement need it now be said was and is a fable authors of the fable the whig lawyers the invention such as it was had been made by them for their own purposes and nothing could have been better contrived for the existence of the contract being admitted the terms remained to be settled and these would of course be on each occasion what the interest of the occasion required that they should be it was in this offspring of falsehood and sinister interest that the fragment beheld the phantom on the shoulders of which the revolution that substituted guelphs to stuarts and added corruption to     force had till then had its sole declared support against this phantom the fragment will be seen making declared war the only war but one that had ever been made against it on any side and the only war without exception that had ever been made against it on the side and in favour of the people against this attack thus made no defence has i believe ever been attempted scarcely since that time has the chimera been seen to show itself scarcely at any rate under its own name such as it was it was the offspring of fiction meaning here by the word fiction that which is meant by it in lawlanguage a fiction of law may be defined—a wilful falsehood having for its object the stealing legislative power by and for hands which could not or durst not openly claim it—and but for the delusion thus produced could not exercise it thus it was that by means of mendacity usurpation was on each occasion set up exercised and established a sort of partnership was thus formed formed in so far as a partnership can be said to have place between a master and his at all times removable servants a partnership having for its object the extracting on joint account and for joint benefit out of the pockets of the people in the largest quantity possible the produce of the industry of the people monarch found force lawyers fraud thus was the capital formed creatures of a day and for years together neither possessing present nor certainty of future existence the representatives of the people now such convenient partners were not as yet ripe for admittance parties in the concern as yet but those two—monarch and lawyers whatever was the fraud thus practised partners on both sides found their account in it interests of both provided for of course the monarch not being acknowledged in the capacity of sole legislator had every thing to gain by suffering these his at all times removable creatures thus to exercise the power belonging to that office for with the instrument thus constructed and always at hand—an instrument which continually increasing experience showed to be so fit for use—depredation and oppression might at all times be exercised exercised in shapes and degrees in which he could not have dared to exercise them by himself in a direct way or to propose in an open way to the representatives of the people as little could the authors of this powerstealing system fail to find their account in it since for the sake of the profit received by him as above their master could do no otherwise than connive all along at those other lies and devices by which depredation and oppression were acted by them for their own benefit here again was another source of profit to the head partner for in virtue and to the extent of his power of patronage—upon each vacancy their office with the annexed plunderage became his his—not to retain indeed but at any rate his to give mendacity is a name too soft for falsehood thus applied applied to such purposes and by men so situated for in comparison of the suffering thus produced the greatest ever produced by any thing to which the word is applied in the intercourse between individual and individual would be found inconsiderable an operation by which the nature and effects of it would be placed in their full and true light is obvious and simple run over the field of law as laid down in any of the books pick out the several parts in which a fiction in any shape has been employed the most extensively and mischievously operative will be found in blackstone for others the books of judicial procedure called books of practice would be to be looked at set down the several fictions under the several heads they belong to in each instance the particular mischief to the public together with the profit to the judge or judges of the judicatory called the court for the purpose of letting in the servants to a share of the worship paid to the master are the articles to be looked for if honestly looked for in no case would there be much difficulty in finding them in the profit made out of each fabrication would be seen the final cause of it one preeminently serviceable and allcomprehensive effect there is to which if to no other they would every one of them be found contributory this is general debility in the understanding of the deluded people for the more prostrate that debility the more flagrant the ulterior degree of depredation and oppression to which they might thus be brought to submit of the degree of debility produced no better measure need be given than the fact of mens having been in this way made to regard falsehood as an instrument not only serviceable but necessary to justice in others this vice was not only punished all the while by these appointed guardians of virtue but painted in its proper colours that which is vice in all others how could it in them be virtue how but that to them belonged the power of making wrong and right change natures and determining what shall be morality as well as what shall be law making as well the one as the other thus dependent—not on their effects on the happiness of the community at large but on the everchangeable good pleasure of the possessors of power by what means soever obtained and in what manner soever exercised thus in regard to morality and in regard to truth the power of determining if not what shall     be truth what to all practical purposes shall be taken for it to produce ductility produce debility no recipe was ever more effectual no time at which the virtue of it has been more thoroughly understood than at present but for this how could judges have been suffered to make law or priests gospel as they have been and still are though in the fragment the mask was not taken off so completely or forcibly as here still the effects produced by any such disclosure may without much difficulty be imagined nowhere till this little work appeared nowhere had there been a heart to declare—nowhere perhaps even an eye clearly to see—that in the hands of these arbiters of every mans destiny this pretended product of matchless wisdom—this object of veneration to the deluded multitude—had never been any thing better than a cover for rascality by no former hand had the gauntlet been thrown down in the face of the brotherhood that gauntlet which though so repeatedly offered again to learned vizards no eye has ever yet seen the possibility of taking up iv the effects produced on sinister interest—on sinister interest in these high places—by the wounds thus given to it may without much difficulty be imagined but the greatest happiness of the greatest number requires that they should be not only imagined but proved and this they shall now be in so far as natural probability aided by whatever support it may be thought to receive from the character of the narrator can gain credence for the indication given of a set of actings and workings of which for the most part the mind in its most secret recesses was the theatre these effects the reader will see in the deportments of the various personages—keepers and workers of the state engines—in relation to the present work and another by the same hand and among them will be found the several shining lights to which by the conjecturists who thereby so clearly proved themselves not to have been members of the abovementioned conclave the work was as above ascribed he will see the great lawyers of the age—those of the one party as well as those of the other—concurring and he will learn to judge whether it was not by concert in a system of deportment and discourse having for its effect—and he will judge whether it had not also for its object—the keeping covered up in the napkin the talents such as they were by which the unwelcome performance had been produced he will see the hand of a great statesman employing itself at length in the endeavour to draw them out of the napkin and put them to use but for the great purpose which have been seen never would the patience of the public have been tried by any such string of personal anecdotes in which an insignificant individual cannot but be the most prominent figure in themselves the facts are much too trivial to afford a warrant even for the time employed in bringing them to view—a time which considering the engagements the performance of which has thus been delayed cannot be thought of without remorse one consolation is as already observed—and this it is that constituted the temptation—that to the allcomprehensive theory of which those engagements required the establishment these anecdotes will afford the confirmation given by particular experience fundamental principles of the constitutional branch of the allcomprehensive code now forming three—   endindicating principle the greatesthappiness principle   obstacleindicating principle the universal selfpreferenceannouncing principle   meansindicating principle the interestjunctionprescribing principle to him to whom the house of commons votes or even the newspaper indications given of them are familiar neither a warrant nor a key will be found wanting for these denominations laconic as they are of all the great public men who will here pass under review one alone will be seen to whom the greatest happiness principle and the author of the fragment in respect of the proclamation and applications made of it was not according to all appearance an object of aversion of this aversion the cause lay it will be seen in the nature of the species of the class and of the situation of the class on the one part not in the nature of the individuals on either part in that same situation the conduct of any other individuals would without material variation have been the same the individuals in question being of both parties men in every sense as good as any that are ever likely to be in those same situations so long as the form of government is what it is sinister interests two in the same breast—lawyers interest and ruling statesmans interest lawyers interest hostile to that of all suitors and of all those who may have need to be so that is to say—of all who are not lawyers ruling statesmans interest hostile to all subjects interest in a form of government which to the inclination common to all breasts adds in the ruling hands adequate power power to an amount sufficient for winding up to the pitch of perfection the system of depredation and oppression power by means of the corruption and     delusion which are the essence of this form of government in addition to that physical force and those means of intimidation and remuneration which belong of necessity to every form of government of the three confederated interests that of the lawyer tribe is in a more particular degree mischievous mischievous in as much as to their share in the common sinister interest they add one which is peculiar to themselves and in as much as by the peculiar strength given to their minds by exercise they take the lead of all the other members of the confederacy and are the men by whose exertion whatsoever is most difficult of that which is wished to be done is done and thus will be seen an exemplification of the obstacleindicating—the universalselfpreference indicating—principle so long as the form of government continues to be what it is—not better and better but continually worse and worse—must the condition of the people be until the sinister sacrifice—the sacrifice of the interest of the many to the interest joint or several of the one or the few—shall have been consummated in that which austrian italy—in that which english ionia—in that which ireland is—may be seen even now that which england is hastening to be forms continuing what they are englishmen cannot too soon prepare themselves for being shot sabred hanged or transported at the pleasure of the placed and momentarily displaceable creatures of a monarch free from all check but the useless one of an aristocracy sharing with him in the same sinister interest precedents have already been established and by whomsoever made whether by those who claim to make law or by those who in the very act disclaim it every thing for which a precedent has been made is regarded as justified of the several particular interests of the aristocrat in all his shapes including the feefed lawyer and the taxfed or rentfed priest all prostrate at the foot of the throne—is composed the everlastingly and unchangeably ruling interest opposite to the interest of the greatest number—opposite through the whole field of government—is that same ruling interest that which this interest requires is—that the quantity of power wealth and factitious dignity in the possession and at the disposal of the ruling few should be at all times as great as possible that which the interest of the subject many requires is—that the quantity of power and wealth at the disposal of the ruling few should at all times be as small as possible of these necessary instruments the smallest quantity of that worse than useless instrument—factitious dignity not an atom no such instrument of corruption and delusion no such favoured rival and commodious substitute to meritorious and really useful service no such essentially disproportionate mode of remuneration while for really useful service apt notification would afford the only remuneration which in the shape of honour can be proportionate can opposition be more complete but to be governed by men themselves under the dominion of an interest opposite to ones own what is it but to be governed by ones enemies in or out of office possessors or expectants tories or whigs leaning most to the monarchical side or most to another side equally hostile to that of the people—what matter is it in which of these situations a man is if to all the interest he adds more than the power of an enemy vain therefore—vain for ever will be all hope of relief unless and until the form given to the government is such that those rulers in chief whose particular interests are opposite to the universal interest shall have given place to others whose particular interests have been brought into coincidence with that same universal interest in a word till the interestjunctionprescribing principle as above shall have been carried into effect in the angloamerican united states this problem—has it not been solved six public characters must now be brought upon the stage mr or sir alexander wedderburne lord mansfield earl of shelburne lord camden mr dunning colonel barré denominations those which belonged to them at the time spoken of in the case of lord shelburne it will be seen how illassorted the picture of the statesman is with those of the lawyers that precede and follow it but the interpolation is unavoidable without it the other personages could not have been brought to view v the first personage to be produced is wedderburne at the time here spoken of solicitorgeneral afterwards with the title of lord loughborough chiefjustice of the common pleas and under that and the subsequent title of earl of rosselyn lord chancellor the fragment had not been out long when a dictum which it had drawn from him showed me but too plainly the alarm and displeasure it had excited the audacious work had come upon the carpet in particular the principle of utility which it so warmly advocates this principle and the argument in support of it in opposition to the whiglawyer fiction of the original contract what say you to it said somebody looking at wedderburne answer—it is a dangerous one this appalling word with the application made of it to the principle contains all that was reported to me of the rest of the conversation nothing any more than of the other parties to it for on this     as on other similar occasions what came to me come through cautious strainers attached to me more or less by principle and affection but to the adversary by pressing interests the dictum such as it is though but from this one member of the conclave will be a sufficient key to whatsoever might otherwise seem mysterious in the language or deportment of those others warm from the mouth of the oracle the response was brought to me what i saw but too clearly was—the alarm and displeasure of which it was the evidence what i did not see was—the correct perception couched in it the perception i mean of the tendency of the principle with reference to the particular interest of the particular class to the head of which the already elevated lawyer was on his way till within a few years—i am ashamed to think how few—did this same response remain a mystery to me the principle of utility a dangerous principle dangerous to endeavour to do what is most useful the proposition said i to myself is a selfcontradictory one confusion of ideas on his part for i could find no other cause was the cause to which i attributed it the confusion was in mine the man was a shrewd man and knew well enough what he meant though at that time i did not by this time my readers most of them know i hope what he meant as well as he the paraphrase by which upon occasion they would expound it would be to some such effect as this—by utility set up as the object of pursuit and standard of right and wrong in the practice of government what this man means to direct peoples eyes to is—that which on each occasion is most useful to all those individuals taken together over whom government is exercised but to us by whom the powers of government are exercised over them—to us so far from being most useful that which would be most useful to them would on most occasions be calamitous let this principle but prevail it is all over with us it is our interest that the mass of power wealth and factitious dignity we enjoy at other peoples expense be as great as possible it is theirs that it be as small as possible judge then whether it is not dangerous to us and who should we think of but ourselves thus far wedderburne what this one lawyer said all those others thought and who knows how many hundred times they may not have said it not long after i found myself in company with him it was the first time and the only one it was at the house of my intimate friend linda of whom presently any account given of me by him could not but have been in an eminent degree favourable wedderburne eyed me but did not speak to me he was still solicitorgeneral with all deference i ventured some slight question to him it was of a sort that any one could have put to any one answer short and icy vi i come now to lord mansfield not many days from the publication of the fragment had elapsed when he had not only taken cognisance of it but been delighted by it there was in those days a mr way who was or had been in office under him and whom it should seem he had been in the habit of employing to read to him at odd times be this as it may he was employed in reading this little work some connexions of mine were intimate with mr way the effects produced by it on the language and deportment of the noble and learned hearer were reported to them by this reader and it may be imagined they were not long in reaching me some of the remarks that dropt from his lord were also mentioned while this or that passage was reading—now cried his lordship he seems to be slumbering while this or that other—now he is awake again which were the sleepy parts which the animated and animating ones was at that time a mystery to me to me it was at length cleared up whether it be so to the reader he will presently have to determine this was not the only ground i had for expecting a favourable notice on the part of lord mansfield on that occasion it had happened to me to minister as will be seen presently to an antipathy of his on another occasion it fell in my way to minister to his selfcomplacency i think it was between the publication of the fragment on government and that of the introduction to morals and legislation that i took my second trip to paris in the passageboat from dover i joined company with david martin david martin was a scotchman he was a portrait painter he had painted a portrait of lord mansfield his errand to paris was to procure an artist to make an engraving of it from an english hand an engraving that would be satisfactory was not to be had for less than   00 guineas strange i remember his mentioning was the artist by whom that price had been required the young painters errand to paris was to import a cheaper one the expedition was not altogether fruitless two engravings there are and i believe no more than two considerable ones of lord mansfield one represents him in the zenith of his political career the other near the close of it the earliest is that for which his admirers are indebted to the brush and in no small degree to the graver of david martin while at paris martin and i took up our quarters in the same lodginghouse his inquiries brought     him to an engraver whose name was littret de montigny they entered into an agreement i drew up the articles of it the subject was not without its difficulties the language french i am but a sorry frenchman now i was i imagine not quite so bad an one then my performance went through the hands of several frenchmen artists as well as others one alteration alone being made in it the substitution of the word art to the word metier which with unconsciously offensive impropriety i had employed the artist was imported but perseverance failed the task of finishing fell back into the hand of the painter as above martin was familiar at ken wood to the noble and learned patron the parisian expedition could not be an uninteresting one particulars were called for and given—the document was produced he read it and took particular notice of it it received his unqualified approbation the draught was in the whole complexion of it one of the ordinary track of business he inquired who the draughtsman was and was informed from the first morning on which i took my seat on one of the hired boards that slid from under the officers seats in the area of the kings bench it was about ten years before the publication of the fragment at the head of the gods of my idolatry had sitten the lord chiefjustice what his politics were i did not comprehead but being his they could not but be right days and weeks together have i made my morning pilgrimage to the chief seat of the living idol with a devotion no less ardent and longing and somewhat less irrational than if it had been a dead one summons to the interior would have been admission into paradise no such beatification was i predestinated to receive the notice taken of my fragment had kindled my hopes the notice taken of my draught had revived them they were revived a second time and with no better result among my longrobed disciples the first in the order of time george wilson silkgownsman and head of the norfolk circuit being second and romilly third was john lind having received the holy ghost—as much of it at least whatever it be as the bishop could give him—he had gone from baliol college oxford to a chaplainship at the sublime porte dismissed for being too agreeable to his excellencys mistress he was in his passage through warsaw retained to read english to a prince czartorinski father or uncle to prince adam whose correspondence with me appears in my papers on codification and uncle or cousin to the amiable the virtuous the unfortunate stanislaus last polish king of the aristocraticomonarchicoanarchical republic of poland with the prince he had not been long before he was taken from him by the king with the rank of privy counsellor he was made director of a corps of  00 cadets organized by him under the orders of the king to serve as a seminary of liberal education and a rampart against priestcraft every thing could not be begun at once education at large remained in the hands of jesuits while he was occupied in this charge the time came for a nephew of the kings prince stanislaus poniatowski to be sent upon his travels the care of him was given to john lind it was the time of the first partition lind had not been many weeks in london when under the title of letters on poland he produced an octavo volume in which the atrocity of the transaction was painted in lively and appropriate colours aided by his commissions and his address it procured for the author high and favourable notice he was well received at the prime ministers—lord norths he was well received at the house of his honourable and right reverend brother and at the cardtable of his not less reverend wife he was rather too much at that table sometimes have i seen him returning from it with a tolerably wellfilled purse but too often with an empty one his connexion with the king of poland assisted his celebrity in bringing him acquainted with lord mansfield with whom stanislaus during a years stay in england had been intimate lind was in fact the resident of poland at the court of london though as being a subject of the king of england he could not be received as the representative of a foreign potentate twice or thrice aweek as regularly as the post went out he used to write a letter to his master occasion pressing i remember with what pride i one day officiated as his deputy in the sunshine of official favour he produced another political work it was entitled remarks on the acts of the thirteenth parliament c it touches however upon no others than those which related to the colonies the foundation he had from me it constitutes the first section of the work i had committed to writing in the compass of those few pages the state of the question as it had presented itself to me he informed me of his project recollecting this paper i put it into his hand little did i expect to see it figuring away in print much less without the alteration of a word and in a situation so leading and conspicuous this second work received the commendations of lord mansfield the freedom with which his lordships quebec bill is treated in it was pardoned by him in declaration and appearance at least in that part i had not any share but it can scarce be that he did not think i had the basis on which the whole work rested could not have been unobserved by him lind being so much with     lord mansfield his lordship could not but hear again of me in fact he did hear of me mention as having been made of me was every now and then reported to me to the last however i heard nothing as from him if not by horace walpoles memoirs by the general histories of the time i must suppose the reader more or less acquainted with the character of lord mansfield if so he cannot have turned over many pages in the fragment without seeing that the principles displayed in it stand in as direct opposition to the so well known biases and endeavours of the great ultratory as can easily be imagined to me all this neglect remained a mystery the chiefjustice had retired from office perhaps from life before my inquiries had led me any further into constitutional law than the fragment shows till a dozen years ago or less will it be believed i knew not what was meant by influence for i know not how long my mind remained fast bound in the silken chains thrown around it by his eloquence when quibbles stood in the way of his purpose he would speak slightingly of them and i thought him liberal invectives rained upon him but i thought him calumniated as the american controversy the badness of the only arguments employed against bad government whether on the one side of the water or the other had left me sticking to it party i belonged to none i knew not what sort of a thing party was in that book of linds i had placed the question as above on the ground of the greatest happiness of the greatest number meaning always in both countries taken together with me it was a matter of calculation pains and pleasures the elements of it no party had argued the question or taken it up on that ground no party had any stomach for calculation none perhaps would have known very well how to go about it if they had the battle was fought by assertion right was the weapon employed on both sides we have a right to be as we now choose to be said people on the american side we have a right to continue to make you what we choose you should be said rulers on the english side we have a right to legislate over them but we have no right to tax them said lord camden by way of settling the matter as if irreconcileable interests could be reconciled by a distinction without a difference when our selfstyled representatives join with king lords and soldiers in forcing us to give them money—speaking to the king they say—we give it you doing this said the whig chancellor is not making laws revenue laws are not laws by the same reason it may be proved that if before he takes your purse a highwayman says give it me this will not be robbing you i have been running wild age does so upon stories of younger years i come back to the aversion i come back to the fruit of it—the neglect which sat so heavy upon me what remains is—to reconcile the belief of it with the delight afforded by the same work at the same time as proved to me by the unquestionable evidence above mentioned the task will not be a difficult one there was a heartburning between the noble and learned lord and the author of the commentaries in the kings bench while his lordship was chief sir william was puisne to the puisne sitting on the same bench with the scorning and overpowering chief was sitting in hot water i have not been consulted and i will be heard said another of his puisnes once in my hearing it was wiles son to the chief justice but to return to blackstone the state of humours could no longer be concealed when for quiet the weaker party was glad to slip down from the kings bench into the common pleas all this put together—if the fragment be looked into in this view there will not it is believed be much difficulty in discovering which were the sleepy which the awakening parts in some were seen the tormentor of his tormentor hence the delectation in others a liberalism and a logic threatening his despotism and his rhetoric hence the aversion vii now opens a very different scene chief place bowood in the year      and not before not less than five years after its publication the fragment—for such was the declaration made—produced me a visit from the earl of shelburne that visit kindness—and that sort and degree of esteem which it belongs to any person rather than to the object of it to call by its appropriate name nothing could have been more unexpected by lord mansfield i was disappointed at lord shelburnes i was indemnified at ken wood i should have been mortified and disgusted at bowood i was caressed and delighted a novel—nor that altogether an uninteresting one—might be made out of a correct and unvarnished picture of the incidents to which that visit to a garret at lincolnsinn gave birth fifty years hence if i have nothing else to do i will set about it of esteem not to speak of affection marks more unequivocal one man could not receive from another than in the course of about twelve years i received from lord shelburne but for such only as belong to the great public purpose in view can time or room be found here one thing will be found not altogether foreign to it though not its existence my attachment to the great cause of manking received its first encouragement and its first development in the affections i found in that heart and the company i found in that house amongst the friendships     it gave me was dumonts one that it helped to form was romillys some weeks had elapsed when the visit to lincolns inn produced one of some minutes to shelburne house and that one of some weeks to bowood this had not lasted many days when the purpose of it or at least one purpose was declared to me a scene took place the remembrance of which is at more than forty years distance as fresh in my mind as if it had been but yesterday the rest of the company used to sit down to supper i not a little before they repaired to the supper table i used to retire for the night in my way was a room on a table in which the guests used to receive or deposit the lights they had need of in passing to and from their several apartments repairing to it one evening for my candles—in the act of taking them up i was met by the master of the house with those which he came to deposit mr bentham said he candles in hand—mr bentham in a tone somewhat hurried as his manner sometimes was what is it you can do for me my surprise could not but be visible candles still in hand—nothing at all my lord said i nothing that i know of i never said i could i am like the prophet balaam the word that god putteth into my mouth—that alone can i ever speak for discernment he was eminent for quickness of conception not less so he took this for what it was meant for—a declaration of independence he deposited his candles i went off with mine if by this rencontre any expectation of his was disappointed—neither his kindness nor the marks of his esteem were lessened some years after more than once did it happen to me to do something for him but so it happened it was always in pursuit of the greatest happiness principle and whatever was done nothing did he know of it till after it was done i shall again have to speak of him presently viii another cause may perhaps have had its share in producing the visit of lord shelburne to the assailant of the commentaries a breach i mean between the lord and the commentator the fact was once mentioned but neither time nor particulars ever known to me if it was by the above supposed confederacy that the visit was so long retarded and at that time this breach recent—by that stimulus was perhaps given the force by which at last their trammels were broken through blackstone seems to have had something about him that rendered breaches with him not difficult it was while i was a child without a guide—idling trembling and hiding myself at queens college oxford—that the commentator then fellow of all souls took possession of the new created law professorship browne provost of queens was then vicechancellor professor served vicechancellor with notice accompanying it with a claim of precedence the vicechancellor when in the streets was and i suppose is preceded by a stick with silver on it called a mace and a man called a beadle to carry it let him walk said browne before my beadle lord shelburne had been the making of blackstone the lord had been in personal favour with george iii he introduced the lecturer and made the monarch sit to be lectured so he himself told me the lecturer as any body may see shewed the king how majesty is god upon earth majesty could do no less than make him a judge for it blasphemy is—saying any thing a judge can gratify himself or thinks he can recommend himself by punishing a man for if tailoring a man out with gods attributes and under that very name is blasphemy none was ever so rank as blackstones the commentaries remain unprosecuted the poison still injected into all eyes piety is never offended by it it may be perhaps should piety in high places ever cease to be a tool of despotism i too heard the lectures age sixteen and even then no small part of them with rebel ears the attributes i remember in particular stuck in my stomach no such audacity however as that of publishing my rebellion was at that time in my thoughts ix now as to lord camden the preparatory mention of lord shelburne was necessary to the mention of his political associates and advisers and in particular this their chief i was already at bowood when the exchancellor with his unmarried daughter made their appearance the marked kindness and attention shown to me in that family could leave no doubt as to the manner in which i had been spoken of to the grave personage from the very first however the manner of his address to me carried with it in my eyes a sort of coldness and reserve this being the first time of my seeing him—i was not in a condition to form an immediate judgment whether such was his general manner or whether there was any thing in it that applied in a particular manner to myself of the drift of my book and the sort of sensation it had made it is not in the nature of the case he should have been ignorant not a syllable on the subject did he ever say to me he saw the countenance that was shown to me by every body else no such countenance did he ever show to me no advance did i ever make to him to him in his situation it belonged not to me in mine to make advances on no occasion did he ever make any to me   0 not many days had elapsed when a little incident helped to strengthen my suspicions one evening after dinner miss pratt was singing i was accompanying her on a violin not so loud not so loud mr bentham cried lord camden tone and manner but too plainly indicating displeasure you eat too much mr bentham said he one day to me nor was there any want of hearers you eat too much reading so much as you do two or three ounces aday should be enough for you the fact was—all the rest of the company sat down to two meals of meat i unless when forced never to more than one at that one if excess was ever observed none was ever experienced two purposes seemed as if aimed at representing me as a glutton and representing me as that sort of bookworm by which nothing could ever be done for his noble friend in a similar strain was what little he ever said to me but your own deportment says somebody—may there not have been something in it that was displeasing to him to this point i shall speak presently a man of such celebrity and who had for so many years occupied the first places in the law could not fail of awakening in a man in my situation and of my turn of mind a desire to form some conception of the bent of his i observed his conversation i observed the books he opened and set before him i watched with particular interest every opportunity of observing whether the system of law ever presented itself to his mind as being in any part of it or as to any point in it susceptible of melioration by nothing i could ever catch could i ever divine that any such conception had ever entered into his head—with the exception of here and there an anecdote such as the sphere he had always moved in could not fail to have furnished him with i heard nothing in his talk that might not have been heard in any drawingroom or in any coffeehouse x i come now to john dunning it was one evening after dinner that he made his appearance he came fresh from bristol of which city he was recorder i found him standing in a small circle recounting his exploits they were such as when associated with the manner in which he spoke of them and the feelings that sat on his countenance brought up to me lord chiefjustice jefferies he had been the death of two human beings he looked and spoke as if regretting there had not been two thousand upon my approach the scowl that sat on his brow seemed more savage than before the cause i had not at the time any suspicion of the effect was but too visible as i came up he was wiping his face the weather was warm and he had in various ways been heated it was the tail only of a sentence that i heard it appeared to me incorrect i expressed a hope that it was so subdued and respectful i well remember was my tone for notwithstanding the freedom to which no member of the bar could have been unaccustomed—the temerity such as it was was by no means unaccompanied with the fear of giving offence the scowl was deeper still he made no answer he took no further notice of me bystanders smothered a titter as well as they could supper was soon after served it was a meal of which i never partook he went off the next morning i saw no more of him i had seen quite as much as was agreeable to me in conversation with lord shelburne once an observation of mine was—that what junius says of the practice of the long robe when he calls it the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong is not precisely true for that upon the whole wrong in his quality of best customer enjoys a pretty decided preference natural enough replied my noble friend and i remember hearing it observed of dunning that he never seemed to do the thing so much con amore as when the wrong was on his side xi last comes colonel barré on his arrival at bowood he too found me already established there barré was a perfect man of the world dunning was sitting for one of lord shelburnes seats barré for another speeches are assigned to him in the debates and mention is made of him in junius—similes are there ascribed to mr burke sarcasms to colonel barré but his great merit was martyrdom he had suffered under the third of the georges as of late sir robert wilson under the fourth being a soldier of fortune he was regarded as being in a more exclusive degree the property of his patron when the patron became minister an indemnity value £ 000 ayear was given to the protegé during his ministry the patron occupied the villa at streatham at which brewer thrale used to entertain burke johnson and their associates i was sitting there after dinner with lord shelburne and barré—no one else present but lady shelburne—when the print was brought in which represents lord shelburne giving the dole to barré in the character of belisarius both are striking likenesses now as to what passed at bowood between him and me towards others his deportment was easy towards myself stately distant and significant what said i to myself can i do to propitiate this minor divinity except from the sort of reports which give nothing but the surface he was altogether unknown to me in my portmanteau i had imported two articles—an unfinished quarto in print of which presently—and     a manuscript of between a dozen and a score of pages it was an attack upon deodands when a man who has a child and a waggon loses the child by the waggons going over it—a notion that my paper had been labouring to produce was—that the loss of the child would be suffering enough without the loss of the waggons being added to it different has been and continues to be the opinion of the sages of the law so of course of those who worship them—english are all our institutions this as well as every other the colonel being a soldier not a lawyer while presenting him with this specimen of them little did i think of encountering in his mind any very formidable prepossession vain confidence one day finding him alone at the common readingtable i put into his hand my little paper a day or two after i ventured to ask whether it had been looked at mr bentham said he returning it with a look and tone of scorn you have got into a scrape scrape colonel what scrape i know of no scrape the case admits of no answer the unfortunate paper was pocketed i went my way and there the matter ended you are a greenhorn you know nothing of the world you wrote that book of yours you made your foolish attacks upon the lawyers you thought it would be a treat to us to see you running at them you are a silly fellow you dont know how necessary they are to us what have we to do with deodands you thought to cut a figure you have got yourself into a scrape in this paraphrase i found the interpretation—the only one i could ever find—for the appalling riddle a confirmation which this interpretation received will be seen presently it was not however received till some years afterwards meantime a little incident rendered me a little more fortunate it recovered for me more or less of the ground which the deodand had lost me it was at the dawn of the french revolution some of the leading men were in london the lansdowne house cook not being yet arrived from the country it was the autumn of      the dinner was given at colonel barrés circumstances were such that i could not well have been left out of the invitation in the drawingroom the conversation turned upon the house of commons debates the colonels name had been looked for and not found the remark touched upon a sore place—so i found afterwards embarrassment was visible i stept in to his relief m le colonel said i est comme le dieu dans la fable il ne paroit que dans les grandes occasions a buzz of applause run round the colonel whom i had got out of this scrape was most conspicuous and most audible it was two or three years after this that the enigma of the scrape received the solution above hinted at when my proposal for a penitentiary system upon the panopticon plan had received acceptance colonel barré with every body else knew of it speaking to a common friend who had been acting officially on the occasion of it—i am glad said he to see mr bentham turning his hand to useful things seeing that i do not betray his name the friend whether he remembers it or no will i hope pardon me why was the one thing useful while the other was so much otherwise as to have got me into a scrape the reader has perhaps already answered for me neither the lawyer tribe nor any other section of the ruling few had any visible interest in the evils to which the panopticon plan would have applied a remedy a prison in which all the prisoners could at all times be seen at a glance by the keeper—without his being seen by any of them or changing his place—was more intelligible than a deodand and if a man who had then the whole ministry with him—pitt dundas rose every body—could be said to be in a scrape it could not be a very pitiable one i have mentioned the colonels embarrassment the cause of it was this i knew it not till afterwards person and manner imposing selfpossession perfect but ignorance was extraordinary extraordinary even in honourable house indolence no less so from dunning the patron used to extract his information to barré he was forced to administer it the trouble i used to have in fighting him up that was lord shelburnes expression to me one day is altogether inconceivable the inaptitude of the showy soldier may perhaps furnish an additional means of interpretation for the whatcanyoudoforme the ministry lord norths was already tottering in america the war of misgovernment against the only possible good government was unpromising profiting by the weakness of england ireland had raised herself within an ace of independence it was her quinquennium it was her golden age by universal confession it was an age of concord tranquility morality festivity and happiness but for the sinister aristocratical interest of her whig chief charlemont—she would have substituted to her still increasing misery that felicity which can never be seen on this side of the atlantic till it has been imported from the other as ministry darkened opposition brightened always on the watch for men of talents     in all lines lord shelburne was now on the lookout for recruits in the line of politics he had felt the want of them it has been seen how dunning could not be at the bar or at chambers and in the house at the same time xii this greatest happiness principle had been declared dangerous of course every consistent application of it this was from alexander wedderburne comes now a confirmation by lord camden and mr dunning words different for so circumstances required meaning the same the introduction to morals and legislation was not published till      it had been printed the greatest part of it in      the second edition of it is now in the press in the trunk which accompanied me to bowood in      was a copy of it it had not been long there before it was in lord shelburnes hands all the entreaties i could use were insufficient to prevent him from treating the ladies with it at the breakfast table not to speak of the general complexion of it in one particular it was peculiarly ill adapted to such an auditory in some eight or ten places the reader will in the second edition meet with the word sexual in the place of this stands in the first edition a word more appositely stationed in a medical advertisement than in the places in which i had seated it when the word bolted out some little embarrassment was the consequence at length the word certain presented itself to the noble lecturer—and by the help of the substantive significative of the subjectmatter together with the pause and the confusion constituted a succedaneum and that a tolerably adequate one—the lectures had not been numerous when to my no small relief an influx of company put an end to them before i left bowood—lord shelburne after observing to me how new the subject was to him and how ill qualified he was of himself to appreciate a work in which so much depth of thought had been displayed informed me that his intention was to submit it to the consideration of men better qualified than himself to comprehend its merits and derive the profit that was to be derived from it and in this view lord camden and mr dunning were particularized i had not been long in london on my return from bowood when i received a visit from lord shelburne i will deal plainly with you said he i told you i should put your book into the hands of lord camden and mr dunning i have done so lord camden acknowledged its merits in the character of a theoretical work but he confessed he had found some difficulty in comprehending it and if such is the case with me said he i leave you to imagine how it may be with the generality of readers thus far lord shelburne of dunnings opinion i recollect not any particulars it was but too plainly of the same cast here was a second scrape—another work by the same man by whom nothing could be done for the head of a party a work which had nothing to do with useful things thus incomprehensible was it to the wisest of the wise it has not been so to babes and sucklings two boys of sixteen have been giving a spontaneous reading to it in the person of a tailor it has found a spontaneous and unpaid editor who having read it as an amateur gives himself in this way a second reading of it it is the basis of that one in french for which so much use has been found or at least thought to be found in other countries of the effects of that report on me—a conception may be formed from the abovementioned dates the work would not have come out when it did in      but for george wilson xiii one objection remains and my hypothesis must if possible be cleared of it nothing intentionally disagreeable in you did any of these personages see says somebody this you may have credit for without much difficulty but in the tout ensemble of a man there may be disagreeable matter to any amount without his intending it can you be quite sure that something of this sort may not have had place in your case for if yes then this and not your reforms and improvements may have been the thing that set them against you and if so your proof fails the answer will i hope be a tolerably satisfactory one in the case of wedderburne the person had not been seen the work was not only the sole object of displeasure but the declared cause of it in the case of lord mansfield the person was never seen in such sort as to be known in conjunction with the name in the case of the disdainful soldier not only the contempt but the cause of it was declared declared before any other had any time for coming into existence for the two remaining cases i must take other ground if in the eyes of the two great lawyers or either of them cause of personal disgust towards the author had had place and that in such degree as to extend itself to the work—let it be judged whether the effect could have failed to be still more sensible on that sex whose sensibility in such a case is naturally so much more acute true it is that what on this or that individual occasion may have been the sort of sentiment produced in the mind of this or that individual of the one sex by the person or deportment of this or that one of the other is not of itself of any great political moment     but whether—on the part of those who are obeyed and paid as guardians of the happiness of the species—there be a conspiracy and that a standing one and till the angloamerican united states afforded one exception a universal one—a conspiracy against that of which they are the professed guardians—this is no such trifle to close the evidence against the conspiracy i must now call two ladies what i have to say is not of a nature to point any sentiment of disrespect towards either of them and if it were they are not in a condition to be much affected by it   enter first miss pratt when upon my fiddles overpowering her voice the part of hogarths enraged musician was played by her noble and learned father his rage was rendered the less distressing to me by his daughters not appearing to be a sharer in it not that there was not war between us not that she was not the aggressor but whatever was the cause of the war it was any thing but that i remember not whether it was before or after this that a letter came to me as from a gentleman who had been of the company alluding to offence received from me and suggesting the propriety of a rencontre the gentleman was a quiet gentleman and nothing had passed between us—it was a forgery the forger was discovered it was miss pratt flagrant was the enormity the investigation had not been indelicate vengeance would have been justice but mediatrixes surrounded me mercy took the place of justice the father was neither party nor privy this was the first time of my seeing the lady it was also the last more than thirty years had elapsed when the aunt of the late marquis of londonderry being in company with a friend of mine took notice of the pleasant days she had that year passed at bowood the adversary she had made to herself was not unremembered at this time or some subsequent one i received in the bosom of the same family a general invitation from her now noble brother the present marquis sensibility to the kindness was not wanting but he had not been witness to any thing of what had fallen on me from his father without business or special invitation i never went anywhere and a house in which the head is cold is not a house to visit at this last piece of evidence is upon my brief but in a court of justice i should pause before i called the witness the invitation was of the number of those which are not quite so likely to be remembered by the giver as by the receiver   next comes mrs dunning her husband on his arrival at bowood found her there and he left her there her stay was considerable—her voice too my fiddle had accompanied as also her piano on which she was a proficient no complaint of overloudness there the aversion whatever it may be that had been conceived by the husband—had it been shared in by the wife about ten or eleven years had elapsed when an incident occurred which may be regarded perhaps as affording some proof of the negative lord ashburton had paid the debt of nature one day at lansdowne house the master of it took me aside and in express terms after an eulogium pronounced on the dowager gave it me as his opinion that should my wishes point that way disappointment was not much to be apprehended the case was sufficiently intelligible the ladys only son—the present lord—was a minor and in tender age your son said he requires a guardian mr bentham would be a faithful one your brothers are engrossed by other cares no such conversation had indeed been mentioned to me but circumstances sufficiently spoke it my surprise was considerable gratitude not inferior but the offer was of the sort of those which may be received in any numbers while at most only one at a time can be profited by i have mentioned brothers the founder of the baring dynasty was one of them he and i were good friends much of all this is but too little to the purpose but what is to the purpose is—that in a family in which whatever is best in aristocratical manners was at the highest pitch of refinement whatever aversion was entertained by the great law lords was peculiar to the confederacy and was not shared in by those who had any ordinary cause of disgust had place would naturally have been most sensible to it xiv a tolerably satisfactory solution the reader may now perhaps think has been given for the tardiness of the advances made by lord shelburne to the author of the fragment coupled and contrasted with the cordiality of them when made on this hypothesis the cognizance he took of it was not less early than that taken of it by the lawyer tribe including his abovementioned learned advisers his disposition towards the author was thereupon of the kind afterwards manifested meantime they seeing to what it led and looking upon their influence on him as endangered by it concurred in the endeavour to prevent his making any such advances at length came some incident or reflection the effect of which was—his breaking loose from their trammels when at last the young intruder made his appearance in the circle—thereupon with or without concert came the practice of doing what the nature of the case admitted of towards keeping down his influence and preserving their own views on political subjects     from being supplanted—supplanted by other views so opposite as they saw his to be in itself nothing can be more unimportant than the little intrigue was if there was one no one can be more fully sensible to its unimportance than he is who if there was one was the subject of it but in regard to the state and form of government in this country what it proves so far as it proves any thing is of no mean importance it is—that under the government under which we live the particular interest of the rulers is in direct opposition to almost every thing that is good—to all reform to all considerable melioration even to the stopping of the career of abuse in any line and thence on almost all points to the universal interest and that as it can never fail to be in their inclination so is it at all times in their power to make sacrifice—continual and allcomprehensive sacrifice—of that same universal interest to that same particular and sinister interest under such a form of government the ruler in all his shapes deriving an advantage immediate or unimmediate from every thing by which the universal interest receives injury—feeling that sinister interest assaulted by almost every thing by which service in any shape is rendered to the universal interest—beholds an adversary not to say an enemy in every man by whom any such service is endeavoured to be rendered as to the lawyer—to the sinister interest which is common to him with all others by whom in a government so constituted the powers of government are exercised—this man adds another sinister interest peculiar to his own tribe an interest in that system by which while not so much as a chance for justice is allowed to any but a comparatively few even those few are kept in a state of oppression oppressed by factitious delay vexation and expense created by lawyers in the situation of judges and legislators for the sake of the profit extracted by the fraternity out of the expense the consequence is a confederacy—a perpetual and indissoluble confederacy—among the ruling few of all classes to defend themselves and one another against all such endeavours as by service rendered to the universal interest act thereby in necessary opposition to that particular and sinister interest of this confederacy whatsoever be the state of parties the ruling men of all parties are members members linked together against the universal interest by that particular and sinister interest in which they are all of them partakers for whatsoever may be the hostility of the two sinister interests to one another the hostility of both to the only right and proper interest is much more extensive and unchangeable on any of the points on which that system of corruption depredation and oppression in which they have a common interest rests let any serious attack be made—mutual hostility vanishes and alliance against the common adversary takes the place of it xv only one piece of evidence more it is however a sweeping one among my friends was and is one who during the period in question to a judgment fully competent added materials not less adequate to the forming the most correct conception respecting the state of the affections in certain of the personages above mentioned with relation to those whose interest in this as in all countries composes the universal interest i asked him once and begged of him to consider whether on the part of them or any of them on any occasion whatsoever it had ever happened to him to observe any symptoms of real regard for the universal interest in a word whether according to the best observation he could make any object beyond the field of the general scramble for power ever found a place in their affections those on the tory side—wedderburne and lord mansfield—were out of the question—lord camden dunning and barré were particularly mentioned his answer was clear deliberate and decisive—it was in the negative xvi a natural enough object of curiosity will be the sort of sensation produced by the little work in the mind of the learned author whose great work is the subject of it some small satisfaction on this point likewise it happens to be in my power to afford it had not long been out when from one quarter or another the intelligence was brought to me the question had been asked him—i never knew from whom—for in telling such tales out of school great caution was in every instance observed be this as it may a question had been asked him—whether he knew who the author was no was the answer not his name all i know of him is where he comes from—he is a scotchman the conjecture had much better grounds than those others that have been mentioned the scotch minds were less illsuited than the english to the sort of business he saw done the scotch law having for its foundation the roman—the range of thought in the field of law is necessarily much less narrow among scotch than among english lawyers by the arguments in the fragment their sinister interests their interestbegotten prejudices their reputation are not so directly struck at as those of their southern brethren as to fiction in particular compared with the work done by it in english law the use made of it in theirs is next to nothing no need have they had of any such clumsy instruments     they have two others and of their own making by which things of the same sort have been done with much less trouble nobile officium gives them the creative power of legislation this and the word desuetude together the annihilative having less need of insincerity than the english—language has with them been less impudently insincere when the english said james the second had abdicated his throne—the contrary being true in the eyes of every body—the scotch said he had forfeited it so much as to intrinsic evidence now as to extrinsic by the sort of notices taken of the fragment by lord mansfield as above a suspicion might naturally enough be produced in the mind of the harassed puisne that the adversary was a sort of sad dog of the scotch breed set upon him by the overbearing chief a question somebody else put to the author of the commentaries was—whether it was his intention to make any answer to the critique no was the reply not even if it had been better written but though he made not any answer to it nor any express mention of it by its name he did not altogether refrain from noticing it in the preface to the then next edition of his work and i take for granted to all the subsequent ones there are allusions to it intimation is given that the work would be the better instead of the worse for the attack thus made on it so far as regarded the currency of his work—if ever i entertained expectations of seeing it lessened as for aught i know i did they were pretty effectually disappointed what at that time i had not sufficiently perceived was—that for the sort of work that his is the demand was in its nature boundless for the sort of work that mine was the demand is bounded by very narrow limits what the law is or is likely to be taken to be—every man if it were possible and not too much trouble to him would know what the law ought to be is as yet of the number of those things about which few indeed—on any points except such few and comparatively narrow ones in which it has happened to a man to take some particular interest—either know any thing or care we never met two years however had not elapsed before we were on better terms the penitentiary system had for its first patrons mr eden the mr eden above spoken of and sir william blackstone they framed in conjunction—and without exposure to sale circulated—the draught of a bill for that purpose a copy i do not remember how found its way into my hands some friend of mine i think gave it me without saying how he had come by it it gave rise on my part to my second work entitled a view of the hard labour bill written and published in      a copy of it communicated as far as i remember in the same way went to mr eden and another to mr justice blackstone in the mode of communication i followed the example that had been set me the tone of this second comment though free and holding up to view numerous imperfections was upon the whole laudatory for my delight at seeing symptoms of ever so little a disposition to improvement where none at all was to be expected was sincere and warmly expressed from mr eden the communication produced an answer of some length cold formal distant and guarded written as a man writes when he feels what he is not willing to acknowledge no desire expressed of any verbal communication he was then on the eve of his departure for the now united states with governor johnstone and i forget who else with proper chains in their hands—chains which the refractory americans were to be invited to put upon their necks between twenty and thirty years after the earliest of the works edited by m dumont having come out i had the pleasure of numbering a nephew of his lordships sir frederick eden among my declared disciples and not many years ago the pain of losing in him a highly valued friend from the judge i received a note which still exists i believe somewhere of every thing that is material in the terms of it i have preserved the memory after thanks and so forth in the third person—some of the observations said he he believed had already occurred to the framers of the bill not mentioning himself as one of them and many others were well deserving of their attention to any reader of this work if any such there be by whom that other of mine has been perused the frigid caution with which the acknowledgment is thus guarded—the frigid caution so characteristic of the person as well as the situation will not have been unexpected that the fragment was not unknown to either of them may readily be imagined if so to no man who has read it will there be any thing wonderful in their reserve to all this correspondence george wilson was of course privy bentham said he to me one day dont you feel now and then some compunction at the thought of the treatment your fragment gives to blackstone of all the men that ever sat on a westminster hall bench he is perhaps the only one that ever attempted any thing that had the good of the people or the improvement of the law for its object independently of professional interest and party politics think of the treatment he has received from you i did think of it—and had any     good come from it in this instance the more i had thought of it with the greater satisfaction should i have thought of it little did i think—little i am persuaded did even he think—that after the improvements made afterwards in the system—and by the universal opinion of that time they were no slight ones—it would have terminated in an hermeticallysealed bastile in which at an expense to the public of £ 000 ahead for lodging alone no more than six hundred will be provided for when the number is completed instead of two thousand at no more than £   ahead annual expense between £ 0 and £ 0 ayear per head instead of £   which upon the death of the first contractor would have ceased such at least has been the computation made by an intelligent and honest hand be this as it may was it for the author of the fragment to see cause of compunction in the effect thus produced in the case of blackstone no unless it be for bell and lancaster to feel compunction for whatever good has been done by excellent church and her associates towards the instruction of the people in what instance by any supporters of matchless constitution has this or any thing else been done with any the least tinge of good in it but with the feelings with which ancient pistol

john lind his intention not known to me till executed three letters on the fragment on governmen from the morning chronicle of the  th  0th and   th july      d  th july      letter the first of an examination into the merits of a critique on blackstones commentaries lately published under the title of a fragment on government this book being favourably spoke of by a gentleman whose good sense is generally admired i was induced at an expense of  s  d to purchase it it did not appear to have been ushered into the world in the usual mode of advertising for on inquiry after it at several booksellers they knew nothing of its being published probably the author whoever he is had reasons for introducing it as privately as possible the mode is peculiar and so indeed appears the work itself not to allow the author to be a man of education and perhaps great reading would be offending common sense his quotations amply prove that he possesses both and his ingenious play upon words in those passages chosen from blackstone where he delights in ringing the changes on their meaning with more glee than ever ringer tuned the sonorous bell seems to tell us that he is not altogether deficient in logical learning and abstracted reasoning to what end however has he wrote read transcribed studied reasoned or pondered was a consequential question with me after i had perused all he had thrown together in the preface which he calls a critique on blackstone at large and afterwards in his introduction with five chapters—one on the formation of government  d on forms of government  d on the british constitution  thly on the right of the supreme power to make laws and  thly on the duty of such power to make laws but after this disquisition i found nothing further gratifying than that this fragment on government instead of being either the gleanings from other writings on subjects under that name or an illustration of what they might doubtfully contain was neither more nor less than a warm attack on a few pages from blackstones introduction to his commentaries which the fragment author confesses to be much offended at and therefore he conceived the design of pointing out some of the capital blemishes in that work or rather as he terms it of laying open and exposing the universal inaccuracy which seemed to him to pervade the whole there is something promising in this language it is bold significant and peremptory     it argues conscious and superlative wisdom in the author and invites his reader to proceed for who that has read blackstone and admired him even for those merits which the fragment attributes to him but would willingly have the sun of wisdom shine upon them and be undeceived in such their admiration of a work promising a general vein of obscure and crooked reasoning from whence no sterling knowledge could be derived but when we seriously consider its import what is it what is the kind of man that writes and reasons and what is the effect of both i answer—either to create a disgust in weak minds for blackstones commentaries without a material cause or with men of experience and of better judgment to show the writers literary talents metaphysically and logically exerted for though as he confesses that his logomachy has been beyond description laborious and irksome yet it at last amounts to no more than a tedious and intricate war of words put together in very harsh order by a conceited writer who seems envious of blackstones fame and desirous of trimming his laurel by putting himself if not above at least in competition with him had he submitted his syllogisms with a small share of humility and avoided that positive preceptive manner which runs through his whole book we must have been pleased with it as a specimen of his abilities but his sentiments on the introduction to the commentaries in their present clothing i fear will make but few converts to his way of thinking and if any they will be among the meanest of his readers d d  0th july      letter the second of an examination into the merits of a critique on blackstones commentaries lately published under the title of a fragment on government sir from the reception which i find my former letter has met with among my friends in the circle of the law there is no necessity for my making the smallest apology to your readers for the intrusion of the present i doubt not if the author of the fragment gives himself the trouble to read me under the abovementioned head but he will feel the force of what i advance with a selfconviction that he has principally wrote in vain the sale of his book however extensive will be no criterion whereby to determine this because curiosity may lead his readers to contribute for his emolument beyond the charge of paper and print not advertising for little expense on that account appears to have attended this his publication if however he wrote for fame only pecuniary profit was not his pursuit and he may disregard the limited number his bookseller sells of this book for him provided he succeeds in tickling his readers ears so as to bring reproach and reprehension on the commentaries to do which he has spared no trouble labour appears in the produce of almost every line he has wrote and as he has palpably bewildered himself it follows with men of superior judgment that he has laboured in vain that is to say though he has ingeniously flourished his reasoning on what he calls the obscurity or absurdity of blackstones description of society and its consequences yet as i have already said it amounts to nothing he tells us that the passage in blackstones introduction proposed by him for examination occupies seven pages from the   th to the   d inclusive to defeat the validity of which he has filled no less than    pages in his fragment in general they are sensible and he has said a great deal to convince us or rather with intent to convince which is widely different that blackstone was a perfect blockhead in all he wrote in those selfsame seven pages and knew not what he was about when he talked of society state of nature and original contract and that he has confused the definition of the one with the other in contradiction sometimes to his own ideas of either with respect to society the fragment argues truly and it gives us perhaps a good notion of what results from it but does it say more than blackstone or not certainly yes—or the author must have been an extraordinary writer indeed if in fiftysix pages he had not put together a little more than blackstone has done in seven but after all has he said more in effect certainly not for having discussed according to his confessed ingenious though peculiar mode the import of society sometimes in opposition to blackstone sometimes nearly with him what does he proceed to say why that it may be he has misunderstood his meaning the context is then spun out for several pages to prove to us that the darkness of the whole paragraph from blackstone is rendered so more from himself than any real construction which a reader of it less contemplative nice or exceptious could possibly put upon it the consequence therefore is that the fragment in this particular says a great deal meaning much logical and ambidextrous sense to little purpose soon after it has said it may be possible that its author has misunderstood blackstone it makes him confess the paragraph spoken of from that gentleman to be a riddle which he cannot solve why then say so much about it why traduce from its merit or attempt to perplex the truth of it the answer is plain to show the authors integrity and derogate if possible from the defects     of the universally admired commentaries the author of the fragment having now tired himself in his journey after truth on the word society for no other purpose than to tell us this riddle of his own is unsolveable he then assures us from himself only that it were of use it should be seen to be so that peace may be restored to the desponding student who prepossessed with the hopes of a rich harvest of instruction makes a crime to himself of his inability to reap what in truth blackstone never sowed fine writing indeed and if every student sits down to blackstone in that way of thinking which is next to impossible he will read with prejudice and poison will attend on every line he reads—the purpose of these letters is to anticipate such reading which i have no doubt will succeed d a b   th july      d letter the third by john lind esq afterwards barrister at law to d author of two letters on a fragment on government sir though it be your opinion that the fragment says a great deal to little purpose† and though it be my opinion that with respect to yourself this is very true yet i cannot bring myself to participate in the regret you seem to feel at having expended three shillings and sixpence in the purchase of this—to you unimproving—performance what advantage has not the world derived from this petty expense two such letters as yours are surely impayable we have indeed your own word for the excellency of your first letter as well as for the candour and discernment of your friends in the circle of the law so favourably you assure us did they receive this first letter that not the smallest apology was necessary for the second i have not the honour i fear of being included in the circle of your friends but if my word be of any weight you may be assured sir that the second is equal to the first no apology then will be necessary for a third but leaving you to improve as little as you please by the perusal of the fragment and your friends in the circle of the law or in any other circle to improve as much as they can by the perusal of your letters i will only beg leave to examine what are the objections which you make to the fragment the first relates to the manner of introducing the work to the knowledge of the public it was done it seems too privately nay even irregularly it was not advertised so often as it should have been at the court of apollo as well as at other courts there are it seems certain gentlemen ushers certain masters of the ceremonies or to give them a denomination more expressive of their function certain flappers without whose friendly help it is a mark of impertinence in a writer to offer his work and illbreeding in a reader to receive it whether such be the custom with gentlemenushers or with flappers at the court of laputa or any other court i know not having never descended so low as to quit my garret for a court but such i know it to my cost is the custom with the flappers in the literary world these inserters of advertisements they must be paid and hence you insinuate that the author was led by motives of avarice to spare this expense i love to clear things as i go to this objection then i shall confine myself in this present letter and it is without doubt an objection of the first magnitude i appeal to the proprietors of the public papers and to the receivers at the stampoffice were the author a staunch friend to the liberty of the press he would certainly have thrown more money into the pockets of the former as certainly were he a staunch friend to government he would have thrown more money into the caisse of the latter i have however my fears that the book will make its way notwithstanding the shameful negligence of the author in this particular should this be the case what is to be done consult your friends in the circle of the law it is possible there may be found among them some of that race whom this fragmentwriter as you elegantly call him has treated so cavalierly in the   th and   th pages of his preface cannot they convert what you call a peculiar into a clandestine mode of ushering the work into the world cannot they prove that the doing it privately was in effect adding to the publicity—just as you have proved that by saying a great deal more he has in effect said no more than another had said before him you have discovered that the author had reasons for introducing his work privately meaning all the while for making it as public as possible your friends have but one step farther to make they have only to assign these reasons—a malicious intention of defrauding his majesty of his revenues and the printers of the papers of their dues c this is no bad ground for a special pleader to go to work upon     you see sir i defend no man when he is in the wrong amicus socrates amicus plato sed magis amica veritas the objection i have now considered is peculiarly your own i do not believe any two men in england could have hit upon it and here you see i give up my author to you entirely my candour on this occasion will i hope entitle me to the favour of your attention when i come to consider two other objections which are not so peculiarly your own a b p s i should have done myself the honour of writing to you much sooner had i not waited for what the printer seemed to promise a continuation of your very instructive letters   0 introduction i the subject of this examination is a passage contained in that part of sir w blackstones commentaries on the laws of england which the author has styled the introduction this introduction of his stands divided into four sections the first contains his discourse on the study of the law the second entitled of the nature of laws in general contains his speculations concerning the various objects real or imaginary that are in use to be mentioned under the common name of law the third entitled of the laws of england contains such general observations relative to these lastmentioned laws as seemed proper to be premised before he entered into the details of any parts of them in particular in the fourth entitled of the countries subject to the laws of england is given a statement of the different territorial extents of different branches of those laws ii tis in the second of these sections that we shall find the passage proposed for examination it occupies in the edition i happen to have before me      which is the first and all the editions i believe are paged alike the space of seven pages from the   th to the   d inclusive iii after treating of law in general of the law of nature law of revelation and law of nations branches of that imaginary whole our author comes at length to what he calls law municipal that sort of law to which men in their ordinary discourse would give the name of law without addition the only sort perhaps of them all unless it be that of revelation to which the name can with strict propriety be applied in a word that sort which we see made in each nation to express the will of that body in it which governs on this subject of law municipal he sets out as a man ought with a definition of the phrase itself an important and fundamental phrase which stood highly in need of a definition and never so much as since our author has defined it iv this definition is ushered in with no small display of accuracy first it is given entire it is then taken to pieces clause by clause and every clause by itself justified and explained in the very midst of these explanations—in the very midst of the definition—he makes a sudden stand and now it bethinks him that it is a good time to give a dissertation or rather a bundle of dissertations upon various subjects on the manner in which governments were established—on the different forms they assume when they are established—on the peculiar excellence of that form which is established in this country—on the right which he thinks it necessary to tell us the government in every country has of making laws—on the duty of making laws which he says is also incumbent on the government—in stating these two last heads i give as near as possible his own words thinking it premature to engage in discussions and not daring to decide without discussion on the sense v the digression we are about to examine is as it happens not at all involved with the body of the work from which it starts no mutual references or allusions no supports or illustrations communicated or received it may be considered as one small work inserted into a large one the containing and the contained having scarce any other connexion than what the operations of the     press have given them it is this disconnexion that will enable us the better to bestow on the latter a separate examination without breaking in upon any thread of reasoning or any principle of order vi a general statement of the topics touched upon in the digression we are about to examine has been given above it will be found i trust a faithful one it will not be thought however much of a piece perhaps with the following which our author himself has given us this says he meaning an explanation he had been giving of a part of the definition above spoken of will naturally lead us into a short inquiry into the nature of society and civil governmenta and the natural inherent right that belongs to the sovereignty of a state wherever that sovereignty be lodged of making and enforcing laws vii no very explicit mention here we may observe of the manner in which governments have been established or of the different forms they assume when established no very explicit intimation that these were among the topics to be discussed none at all of the duty of government to make laws none at all of the british constitution though of the four other topics we have mentioned there is no one on which he has been nearly so copious as on this last the right of government to make laws that delicate and invidious topic as we shall find it when explained is that which for the moment seems to have swallowed up almost the whole of his attention viii be this as it may the contents of the dissertation before us taken as i have stated them will furnish us with the matter of five chapters—one which i shall entitle formation of government—a second forms of government—a third british constitution—a fourth right of the supreme power to make laws—a fifth duty of the supreme power to make laws chapter i formation of government i the first object which our author seems to have proposed to himself in the dissertation we are about to examine is to give us an idea of the manner in which governments were formed this occupies the first paragraph together with part of the second for the typographical division does not seem to quadrate very exactly with the intellectual as the examination of this passage will unavoidably turn in great measure upon the words it will be proper the reader should have it under his eye ii the only true and natural foundations of society says our author† are the wants and the fears of individuals not that we can believe with some theoretical writers that there ever was a time when there was no such a thing as society and that from the impulse of reason and through a sense of their wants and weaknesses individuals met together in a large plain entered into an original contract and chose the tallest man present to be their governor this notion of an actually existing unconnected state of nature is too wild to be seriously admitted and besides it is plainly contradictory to the revealed accounts of the primitive origin of mankind and their preservation two thousand years afterwards both which were effected by the means of single families these formed the first society among themselves which every day extended its limits and when it grew too large to subsist with convenience in that pastoral state wherein the patriarchs appear to have lived it necessarily subdivided itself by various migrations into more afterwards as agriculture increased which employs and can maintain a much greater number of hands migrations became less frequent and various tribes which had formerly separated reunited again sometimes by compulsion and conquest sometimes by accident and sometimes perhaps by compact but though society had not its formal beginning from any convention of individuals actuated by their wants and their fears yet it is the sense of their weakness and imperfection that keeps mankind together that demonstrates the necessity of this union and that therefore is the solid and natural foundation as well as the cement of society and this is what we mean by the original contract of society which though perhaps in no instance it has ever been formally expressed at the first institution of a state yet in nature and reason must always be understood and implied in the very act of associating together namely that the whole should protect all its parts and that every part should pay obedience to     the will of the whole or in other words that the community should guard the rights of each individual member and that in return for this protection each individual should submit to the laws of the community without which submission of all it was impossible that protection could be certainly extended to any for when society is once formed government results of course as necessary to preserve and to keep that society in order unless some superior were constituted whose commands and decisions all the members are bound to obey they would still remain as in a state of nature without any judge upon earth to define their several rights and redress their several wrongs—thus far our author iii when leading terms are made to chop and change their several significations sometimes meaning one thing sometimes another at the upshot perhaps nothing and this in the compass of a paragraph one may judge what will be the complexion of the whole context this we shall see is the case with the chief of those we have been reading for instance with the words society—state of nature—original contract—not to tire the reader with any more society in one place means the same thing as a state of nature does in another place it means the same as government here we are required to believe there never was such a state as a state of nature there we are given to understand there has been in like manner with respect to an original contract we are given to understand that such a thing never existed that the notion of it is even ridiculous at the same time that there is no speaking nor stirring without supposing that there was one iv first society means a state of nature for if by a state of nature a man means any thing it is the state i take it men are in or supposed to be in before they are under government the state men quit when they enter into a state of government and in which were it not for government they would remain but by the word society it is plain at one time that he means that state first according to him comes society then afterwards comes government for when society says our author is once formed government results of course as necessary to preserve and keep that society in order and again immediately afterwards—a state in which a superior has been constituted whose commands and decisions all the members are bound to obey he puts as an explanation nor is it an inapt one of a state of government and unless men were in a state of that description they would still remain he says as in a state of nature by society therefore he means once more the same as by a state of nature he opposes it to government and he speaks of it as a state which in this sense has actually existed v secondly this is what he tells us in the beginning of the second of the two paragraphs but all the time the first paragraph lasted society meant the same as government in shifting then from one paragraph to another it has changed its nature tis the foundations of society† that he first began to speak of and immediately he goes on to explain to us after his manner of explaining the foundations of government tis of a formal beginning of society‡ that he speaks soon after and by this formal beginning he tells us immediately that he means the original contract of society‡ which contract entered into a state∥ he gives us to understand is thereby instituted and men have undertaken to submit to laws§ so long then as this first paragraph lasts society i think it is plain cannot but have been meaning the same as government vi thirdly all this while too this same state of nature to which we have seen society a state spoken of as existing put synonymous and in which were it not for government men he informs us in the next page would remain§ is a state in which they never were so he expressly tells us this notion says he of an actually existing unconnected state of nature that is as he explains himself afterwards§ a state in which men have no judge to define their rights and redress their wrongs is too wild to be seriously admitted‡ when he admits it then himself as he does in his next page we are to understand it seems that he is bantering us and that the next paragraph is what one should not otherwise have taken it for a piece of pleasantry vii fourthly the original contract is a thing we are to understand that never had existence perhaps not in any state certainly therefore not in all perhaps in no instance says our author has it ever been formally expressed at the first institution of a state¶ viii fifthly notwithstanding all this we must suppose it seems that it had in every state yet in nature and reason says our author it must always be understood and implied¶ growing bolder in the compass of four or five pages where he is speaking of our own government he asserts roundly that such a contract was actually made at the first formation of it the legislature would be changed he says from that which was     originally set up by the general consent and fundamental act of the society ix let us try whether it be not possible for something to be done towards drawing the import of these terms out of the mist in which our author has involved them the word society i think it appears is used by him and that without notice in two senses that are opposite in the one society or a state of society is put synonymous to a state of nature and stands opposed to government or a state of government in this sense it may be styled as it commonly is natural society in the other it is put synonymous to government or a state of government and stands opposed to a state of nature in this sense it may be styled as it commonly is political society of the difference between these two states a tolerably distinct idea i take it may be given in a word or two x the idea of a natural society is a negative one the idea of a political society is a positive one tis with the latter therefore we should begin when a number of persons whom we may style subjects are supposed to be in the habit of paying obedience to a person or an assemblage of persons of a known and certain description whom we may call governor or governors such persons altogether subjects and governors are said to be in a state of political society xi the idea of a state of natural society is as we have said a negative one when a number of persons are supposed to be in the habit of conversing with each other at the same time that they are not in any such habit as mentioned above they are said to be in a state of natural society xii if we reflect a little we shall perceive that between these two states there is not that explicit separation which these names and these definitions might teach one at first sight to expect it is with them as with light and darkness however distinct the ideas may be that are at first mention suggested by those names the things themselves have no determinate bound to separate them the circumstance that has been spoken of as constituting the difference between these two states is the presence or absence of an habit of obedience this habit accordingly has been spoken of simply as present that is as being perfectly present or in other words we have spoken as if there were a perfect habit of obedience in the one case it has been spoken of simply as absent that is as being perfectly absent or in other words we have spoken as if there were no habit of obedience at all in the other but neither of these manners of speaking perhaps is strictly just few in fact if any are the instances of this habit being perfectly absent certainly none at all of its being perfectly present governments accordingly in proportion as the habit of obedience is more perfect recede from in proportion as it is less perfect approach to a state of nature and instances may present themselves in which it shall be difficult to say whether a habit perfect in the degree in which to constitute a government it is deemed necessary it should be perfect does subsist or not b     xiii on these considerations the supposition of a perfect state of nature or as it may be termed a state of society perfectly natural may perhaps be justly pronounced what our author for the moment seemed to think it an extravagant supposition but then that of a government in this sense perfect or as it may be termed a state of society perfectly political a state of perfect political union a state of perfect submission in the subject of perfect authority in the governor is no less soc xiv a remark there is which for the more thoroughly clearing up of our notions on this subject it may be proper here to make to some ears the phrases state of nature state of political society may carry the appearance of being absolute in their signification as if the condition of a man or a company of men in one of these states or in the other were a matter that depended altogether upon themselves but this is not the case to the expression state of nature no more than to the expression state of political society can any precise meaning be annexed without reference to a party different from that one who is spoken of as being in the state in question this will readily be perceived the difference between the two states lies as we have observed in the habit of obedience with respect then to a habit of obedience it can neither be understood as subsisting in any person nor as not subsisting but with reference to some other person for one party to obey there must be another party that is obeyed but this party who is obeyed may at different times be different hence may one and the same party be conceived to obey and not to obey at the same time so as it be with respect to different persons or as we may say to different objects of obedience hence it is then that one and the same party may be said to be in a state of nature and not to be in a state of nature and that at one and the same time according as it is this or that party that is taken for the other object of comparison the case is that in common speech when no particular object of comparison is specified all persons in general are intended so that when a number of persons are said simply to be in a state of nature what is understood is that they are so as well with reference to one another as to all the world     xv in the same manner we may understand how the same man who is governor with respect to one man or set of men may be subject with respect to another how among governors some may be in a perfect state of nature with respect to each other as the kings of france and spain others again in a state of perfect subjection as the hospodars of wallachia and moldavia with respect to the grand signior others again in a state of manifest but imperfect subjection as the german states with respect to the emperor others again in such a state in which it may be difficult to determine whether they are in a state of imperfect subjection or in a perfect state of nature as the king of naples with respect to the poped xvi in the same manner also it may be conceived without entering into details how any single person born as all persons are born into a perfect subjection to his parents that is into a state of perfect political society with respect to his parents may from thence pass into a perfect state of nature and from thence successively into any number of different states of political society more or less perfect by passing into different societies xvii in the same manner also it may be conceived how in any political society the same man may with respect to the same individuals be at different periods and on different occasions alternately in the state of governor and subject today concurring perhaps active in the business of issuing a general command for the observance of the whole society amongst the rest of another man in quality of judge tomorrow punished perhaps by a particular command of that same judge for not obeying the general command which he himself i mean the person acting in character of governor had issued i need scarce remind the reader how happily this alternate state of authority and submission is exemplified among ourselves xviii here might be a place to state the different shares which different persons may have in the issuing the same command to explain the nature of corporate action to enumerate and distinguish halfadozen or more different modes in which subordination between the same parties may subsist to distinguish and explain the different senses of the words consent representation and others of connected import consent and representation those interesting but perplexing words sources of so much debate and sources or pretexts of so much animosity but the limits of the present design will by no means admit of such protracted and intricate discussions xix in the same manner also it may be conceived how the same set of men considered among themselves may at one time be in a state of nature at another time in a state of government for the habit of obedience in whatever degree of perfection it be necessary it should subsist in order to constitute a government may be conceived it is plain to suffer interruptions at different junctures it may take place and cease xx instances of this state of things appear not to be unfrequent the sort of society that has been observed to subsist among the american indians may afford us one according to the accounts we have of those people in most of their tribes if not in all the habit we are speaking of appears to be taken up only in time of war it ceases again in time of peace the necessity of acting in concert against a common enemy subjects a whole tribe to the orders of a common chief on the return of peace each warrior resumes his pristine independence xxi one difficulty there is that still sticks by us it has been started indeed but not solved this is to find a note of distinction—a characteristic mark—whereby to distinguish a society in which there is a habit of obedience and that at the degree of perfection which is necessary to constitute a state of government from a society in which there is not a mark i mean which shall have a visible determinate commencement insomuch that the instance of its first appearance shall be distinguishable from the last at which it had not as yet appeared tis only by the help of such a mark that we can be in a condition to determine at any given time whether any given society is in a state of government or in a state of nature i can find no such mark i must confess any where unless it be this—the establishment of names of office the appearance of a certain man or set of men with a certain name serving to mark them out as objects of obedience such as king sachem cacique senator burgomaster and the like this i think may serve tolerably well to distinguish a set of men in a state of political union among themselves from the same set of men not yet in such a state xxii but suppose an incontestible political society and that a large one formed and from that a smaller body to break off by this breach the smaller body ceases to be in a state of political union with respect to the larger and has thereby placed itself with respect to that larger body in a state of nature—what means shall we find of ascertaining     the precise juncture at which this change took place what shall be taken for the characteristic mark in this case the appointment it may be said of new governors with new names but no such appointment suppose takes place the subordinate governors from whom alone the people at large were in use to receive their commands under the old government are the same from whom they receive them under the new one the habit of obedience which these subordinate governors were in with respect to that single person we will say who was the supreme governor of the whole is broken off insensibly and by degrees the old names by which these subordinate governors were characterized while they were subordinate are continued now they are supreme in this case it seems rather difficult to answer xxiii if an example be required we may take that of the dutch provinces with respect to spain these provinces were once branches of the spanish monarchy they have now for a long time been universally spoken of as independent states independent as well of that of spain as of every other they are now in a state of nature with respect to spain they were once in a state of political union with respect to spain namely in a state of subjection to a single governor a king who was king of spain at what precise juncture did the dissolution of this political union take place at what precise time did these provinces cease to be subject to the king of spain this i doubt will be rather difficult to agree upone xxiv suppose the defection to have begun not by entire provinces as in the instance just mentioned but by a handful of fugitives this augmented by the accession of other fugitives and so by degrees to a body of men too strong to be reduced the difficulty will be increased still farther at what precise juncture was it that ancient rome or that modern venice became an independent state xxv in general then at what precise juncture is it that persons subject to a government become by disobedience with respect to that government in a state of nature when is it in short that a revolt shall be deemed to have taken place and when again is it that that revolt shall be deemed to such a degree successful as to have settled into independence xxvi as it is the obedience of individuals that constitutes a state of submission so is it their disobedience that must constitute a state of revolt is it then every act of disobedience that will do as much the affirmative certainly is what can never be maintained for then would there no such thing as government to be found any where here then a distinction or two obviously presents itself disobedience may be distinguished into conscious or unconscious and that with respect as well to the law as to the factf disobedience that is unconscious with respect to either will readily i suppose be acknowledged not to be a revolt disobedience again that is conscious with respect to both may be distinguished into secret and open or in other words into fraudulent and forcibleg disobedience that is only fraudulent will likewise i suppose be readily acknowledged not to amount to a revolt xxvii the difficulty that will remain will concern such disobedience only as is both conscious and that as well with respect to law as fact and forcible this disobedience it should seem is to be determined neither by numbers altogether that is of the persons supposed to be disobedient nor by acts nor by intentions all three may be fit to be taken into consideration but having brought the difficulty to this point at this point i must be content to leave it to proceed any farther in the endeavour to solve it would be to enter into a discussion of particular local jurisprudence it would be entering upon the definition of treason as distinguished from murder robbery riot and other such crimes as in comparison with treason are spoken of as being of a more private nature suppose the definition of treason settled and the commission of an act of treason is as far as regards the person     committing it the characteristic mark we are in search of xxviii these remarks it were easy to extend to a much greater length indeed it is what would be necessary in order to give them a proper fulness and method and precision but that could not be done without exceeding the limits of the present design as they are they may serve as hints to such as shall be disposed to give the subject a more exact and regular examination xxix from what has been said however we may judge what truth there is in our authors observation that when society understand natural society is once formed government that is political society whatever quantity or degree of obedience is necessary to constitute political society results of course as necessary to preserve and to keep that society in order by the words of course is meant i suppose constantly and immediately at least constantly according to this political society in any sense of it ought long ago to have been established all the world over whether this be the case let any one judge from the instances of the hottentots of the patagonians and of so many other barbarous tribes of which we hear from travellers and navigators xxx it may be after all we have misunderstood his meaning we have been supposing him to have been meaning to assert a matter of fact and to have written or at least begun this sentence in the character of an historical observer whereas all he meant by it perhaps was to speak in the character of a censor and on a case supposed to express a sentiment of approbation in short what he meant perhaps to persuade us of was not that government does actually result from natural society but that it were better that it should to wit as being necessary to preserve and keep men in that state of order in which it is of advantage to them that they should be which of the abovementioned characters he meant to speak in is a problem i must leave to be determined the distinction perhaps is what never so much as occurred to him and indeed the shifting insensibly and without warning from one of those characters to the other is a failing that seems inveterate in our author and of which we shall probably have more instances than one to notice xxxi to consider the whole paragraph with its appendage together something it may be seen our author struggles to overthrow and something to establish but how it is he would overthrow or what it is he would establish are questions i must confess myself unable to resolve the preservation of mankind he observes was effected by single families this is what upon the authority of the holy scriptures he assumes and from this it is that he would have us conclude the notion of an original contract the same notion which he afterwards adopts to be ridiculous the force of this conclusion i must own i do not see mankind was preserved by single families—be it so what is there in this to hinder individuals of those families or of families descended from those families from meeting together afterwards in a large plain or any where else entering into an original contract or any other contract and choosing the tallest man or any other man present or absent to be their governor the flat contradiction our author finds between this supposed transaction and the preservation of mankind by single families is what i must own myself unable to discover as to the actually existing unconnected state of nature he speaks of the notion of which he says is too wild to be seriously admitted whether this be the case with it is what as he has given us no notion of it at all i cannot judge of xxxii something positive however in one place we seem to have these single families by which the preservation of mankind was effected—these single families he gives us to understand formed the first society this is something to proceed upon a society then of one kind or the other—a natural society or else a political society was formed i would here then put a case and then propose a question in this society we will say no contract had as yet been entered into no habit of obedience as yet formed was this then a natural society merely or was it a political one for my part according to my notion of the two kinds of society as above explained i can have no difficulty it was a merely natural one but according to our authors notion which was it if it was already a political one what notion would he give us of such an one as shall have been a natural one and by what change could such precedent natural one have turned into this political one if this was not a political one then what sort of a society are we to understand any one to be which is political by what mark are we to distinguish it from a natural one to this it is plain our author has not given any answer at the same time that to give an answer to it was if any thing the professed purpose of the long paragraph before us xxxiii it is time this passage of our author were dismissed as among the expressions of it are some of the most striking of those which the vocabulary of the subject furnishes and these ranged in the most harmonious order on a distant glance nothing can look fairer a prettier piece of tinselwork one should seldom see exhibited from     the showglass of political erudition step close to it and the delusion vanishes it is then seen to consist partly of selfevident observations and partly of contradictions partly of what every one knows already and partly of what no one can understand xxxiv throughout the whole of it what distresses me is not meeting with any positions such as thinking them false i find a difficulty in proving them so but the not meeting with any positions true or false unless it be here and there a selfevident one that i can find a meaning for if i can find nothing positive to accede to no more can i to contradict of this latter kind of work indeed there is the less to do for any one else our author himself having executed it as we have seen so amply the whole of it is i must confess to me a riddle more acute by far than i am must be the œdipus that can solve it happily it is not necessary on account of any thing that follows that it should be solved nothing is concluded from it for aught i can find it has in itself no use and none is made of it there it is and as well might it be any where else or no where xxxv were it then possible there would be no use in its being solved but being as i take it really unsolvable it were of use it should be seen to be so peace may by this means be restored to the breast of many a desponding student who now prepossessed with the hopes of a rich harvest of instruction makes a crime to himself of his inability to reap what in truth his author has not sown xxxvi as to the original contract by turns embraced and ridiculed by our author a few pages perhaps may not be ill bestowed in endeavouring to come to a precise notion about its reality and use the stress laid on it formerly and still perhaps by some is such as renders it an object not undeserving of attention i was in hopes however till i observed the notice taken of it by our author that this chimera had been effectually demolished by mr humeh i think we hear not so much of it now as formerly the indestructible prerogatives of mankind have no need to be supported upon the sandy foundation of a fiction xxxvii with respect to this and other fictions there was once a time perhaps when they had their use with instruments of this     temper i will not deny but that some political work may have been done and that useful work which under the then circumstances of things could hardly have been done with any other but the season of fiction is now over insomuch that what formerly might have been tolerated and countenanced under that name would if now attempted to be set on foot be censured and stigmatized under the harsher appellations of encroachment or imposture to attempt to introduce any new one would be now a crime for which reason there is much danger without any use in vaunting and propagating such as have been introduced already in point of politica discernment the universal spread of learning has raised mankind in a manner to a level with each other in comparison of what they have been in any former time nor is any man now so far elevated above his fellows as that he should be indulged in the dangerous licence of cheating them for their good xxxviii as to the fiction now before us in the character of an argumentum ad hominem coming when it did and managed as it was it succeeded to admiration that compacts by whomsoever entered into ought to be kept—that men are bound by compacts are propositions which men without knowing or inquiring why were disposed universally to accede to the observance of promises they had been accustomed to see pretty constantly enforced they had been accustomed to see kings as well as others behave themselves as if bound by them this proposition then that men are bound by compacts and this other that if one party performs not his part the other is released from his being propositions which no man disputed were propositions which no man had any call to prove in theory they were assumed for axioms and in practice they were observed as rulesi if on any occasion it was thought proper to make a show of proving them it was rather for forms sake than for any thing else and that rather in the way of momento or instruction to acquiescing auditors than in the way of proof against opponents on such an occasion the commonplace retinue of phrases was at hand justice right reason required it the law of nature commanded it and so forth all which are but so many ways of intimating that a man is firmly persuaded of the truth of this or that moral proposition though he either thinks he need not or finds he cant tell why men were too obviously and too generally interested in the observance of these rules to entertain doubts concerning the force of any arguments they saw employed in their support it is an old observation how interest smooths the road to faith xxxix a compact then it was said was made by the king and people the terms of it were to this effect—the people on their part promised to the king a general obedience the king on his part promised to govern the people in such a particular manner always as should be subservient to their happiness i insist not on the words i undertake only for the sense as far as an imaginary engagement so loosely and so variously worded by those who have imagined it is capable of any decided signification assuming then as a general rule that promises when made ought to be observed and as a point of fact that a promise to this effect in particular had been made by the party in question men were more ready to deem themselves qualified to judge when it was such a promise was broken than to decide directly and avowedly on the delicate question when it was that a king acted so far in opposition to the happiness of his people that it were better no longer to obey him xl it is manifest on a very little consideration that nothing was gained by this manœuvre after all no difficulty removed by it it was still necessary and that as much as ever that the question men studied to avoid should be determined in order to determine the question they thought to substitute in its room it was still necessary to determine whether the king in question had or had not acted so far in opposition to the happiness of his people that it were better no longer to obey him in order to determine whether the promise he was supposed   0 to have made had or had not been broken for what was the supposed purport of this promise it was no other than what has just been mentioned xli let it be said that part at least of this promise was to govern in subservience to law that hereby a more precise rule was laid down for his conduct by means of this supposal of a promise than that other loose and general rule to govern in subservience to the happiness of his people and that by this means it is the letter of the law that forms the tenor of the rule now true it is that the governing in opposition to law is one way of governing in opposition to the happiness of the people the natural effect of such a contempt of the law being if not actually to destroy at least to threaten with destruction all those rights and privileges that are founded on it rights and privileges on the enjoyment of which that happiness depends but still it is not this that can be safely taken for the entire purport of the promise here in question and that for several reasons first because the most mischievous and under certain constitutions the most feasible method of governing in opposition to the happiness of the people is by setting the law itself in opposition to their happiness second because it is a case very conceivable that a king may to a great degree impair the happiness of his people without violating the letter of any single law third because extraordinary occasions may now and then occur in which the happiness of the people may be better promoted by acting for the moment in opposition to the law than in subservience to it fourth because it is not any single violation of the law as such that can properly be taken for a breach of his part of the contract so as to be understood to have released the people from the obligation of performing theirs for to quit the fiction and resume the language of plain truth it is scarce ever any single violation of the law that by being submitted to can produce so much mischief as shall surpass the probable mischief of resisting it if every single instance whatever of such a violation were to be deemed an entire dissolution of the contract a man who reflects at all would scarce find any where i believe under the sun that government which he could allow to subsist for twenty years together it is plain therefore that to pass any sound decision upon the question which the inventors of this fiction substituted instead of the true one the latter was still necessary to be decided all they gained by their contrivance was the convenience of deciding it obliquely as it were and by a side wind that is in a crude and hasty way without any direct and steady examination xlii but after all for what reason is it that men ought to keep their promises the moment any intelligible reason is given it is this that it is for the advantage of society they should keep them and if they do not that as far as punishment will go they should be made to keep them it is for the advantage of the whole number that the promises of each individual should be kept and rather than they should not be kept that such individuals as fail to keep them should be punished if it be asked how this appears the answer is at hand—such is the benefit to gain and mischief to avoid by keeping them as much more than compensates the mischief of so much punishment as is requisite to oblige men to it whether the dependence of benefit and mischief that is of pleasure and pain upon mens conduct in this behalf be as here stated is a question of fact to be decided in the same manner that all other questions of fact are to be decided by testimony observation and experiencek xliii this then and no other being the reason why men should be made to keep their promises viz that it is for the advantage of society that they should is a reason that may as well be given at once why kings on the one hand in governing should in general keep within established laws and to speak universally abstain from all such measures as tend to the unhappiness of their subjects and on the other hand why subjects should obey kings as long as they so conduct themselves and no longer why they should obey in short so long as the probable mischiefs of obedience are less than the probable mischiefs of resistance why in a word taking the whole body together it is their duty to obey just so long as it is their interest and no longer this being the case what need of saying of the one that he promised so to govern of the other that they promised so to obey when the fact is otherwise xliv true it is that in this country     according to ancient forms some sort of vague promise of good government is made by kings at the ceremony of their coronation and let the acclamations perhaps given perhaps not given by chance persons out of the surrounding multitude be construed into a promise of obedience on the part of the whole multitude that whole multitude itself a small drop collected together by chance out of the ocean of the state and let the two promises thus made be deemed to have formed a perfect compact—not that either of them is declared to be the consideration of the other xlv make the most of this concession one experiment there is by which every reflecting man may satisfy himself i think beyond a doubt that it is the consideration of utility and no other that secretly perhaps but unavoidably has governed his judgment upon all these matters the experiment is easy and decisive it is but to reverse in supposition in the first place the import of the particular promise thus feigned in the next place the effect in point of utility of the observance of promises in general suppose the king to promise that he would govern his subjects not according to law not in the view to promote their happiness—would this be binding upon him suppose the people to promise they would obey him at all events let him govern as he will let him govern to their destruction—would this be binding upon them suppose the constant and universal effect of an observance of promises were to produce mischief would it then be mens duty to observe them would it then be right to make laws and apply punishment to oblige men to observe them xlvi no it may perhaps be replied but for this reason among promises some there are that as every one allows are void now these you have been supposing are unquestionably of the number a promise that is in itself void cannot it is true create any obligation but allow the promise to be valid and it is the promise itself that creates the obligation and nothing else the fallacy of this argument it is easy to perceive for what is it then that the promise depends on for its validity what is it that being present makes its valid what is it that being wanting makes it void to acknowledge that any one promise may be void is to acknowledge that if any other is binding it is not merely because it is a promise that circumstance then whatever it be on which the validity of a promise depends that circumstance i say and not the promise itself must it is plain be the cause of the obligation which a promise is apt in general to carry with it xlvii but farther allow for arguments sake what we have disproved allow that the obligation of a promise is independent of every other allow that a promise is binding propriâ vi binding then on whom on him certainly who makes it admit this for what reason is the same individual promise to be binding on those who never made it the king fifty years ago promised my greatgrandfather to govern him according to law my greatgrandfather fifty years ago promised the king to obey him according to law the king just now promised my neighbour to govern him according to law my neighbour just now promised the king to obey him according to law be it so what are these promises all or any of them to me to make answer to this question some other principle it is manifest must be resorted to than that of the intrinsic obligation of promises upon those who make them xlviii now this other principle that still recurs upon us what other can it be than the principle of utilityl the     principle which furnishes us with that reason which alone depends not upon any higher reason but which is itself the sole and allsufficient reason for every point of practice whatsoever chapter ii forms of government i the contents of the whole digression we are examining were distributed we may remember at the outset of this essay into five divisions the first relative to the manner in which government in general was formed has already been examined in the preceding chapter the next relative to the different species or forms it may assume comes now to be considered ii the first object that strikes us in this division of our subject is the theological flourish it sets out with in god may be said though in a peculiar sense to be our authors strength in theology he has found a not unfrequent source of ornament to divert us of authority to overawe us from sounding into the shallowness of his doctrinesa iii that governors of some sort or other we must have is what he has been showing in the manner we have seen in the last chapter now for endowments to qualify them for the exercise of their function these endowments then as if it were to make them show the brighter and to keep them as much as possible from being soiled by the rough hands of impertinent speculators he has chosen should be of ethereal texture and has fetched them from the clouds all mankind he says will agree that government should be reposed in such persons in whom those qualities are most likely to be found the perfection of which are among the attributes of him who is emphatically styled the supreme being the three great requisites i mean of wisdom of goodness and of power but let us see the whole passage as it stands— iv but as all the members of society meaning natural society are naturally equal i e i suppose with respect to political power of which none of them as yet have any it may be asked continues he in whose hands are the reins of government to be entrusted to this the general answer is easy but the application of it to particular cases has occasioned one half of those mischiefs which are apt to proceed from misguided political zeal in general all mankind will agree that government should be reposed in such persons in whom those qualities are most likely to be found the perfection of which are among the attributes of him who is emphatically styled the supreme being     the three grand requisites i mean of wisdom goodness and of power wisdom to discern the real interest of the community goodness to endeavour always to pursue that real interest and strength or power to carry this knowledge and intention into action these are the natural foundations of sovereignty and these are the requisites that ought to be found in every well constituted frame of government v every thing in its place theology in a sermon or a catechism but in this place the flourish we have seen might for every purpose of instruction have much better it should seem been spared what purpose the idea of that tremendous and incomprehensible being thus unnecessarily introduced can answer i cannot see unless it were to bewilder and entrance the reader as it seems to have bewildered and entranced the writer beginning thus is beginning at the wrong end it is explaining ignotum per ignotius it is not from the attributes of the deity that an idea is to be had of any qualities in men on the contrary it is from what we see of the qualities of men that we obtain the feeble idea we can frame to ourselves of the attributes of the deity vi we shall soon see whether it be light or darkness our author has brought back from this excursion to the clouds the qualifications he has pitched upon for those in whose hands government is to be reposed we see are three wisdom goodness and power now of these three one there is which i doubt will give him some trouble to know what to do with i mean that of power which looking upon it as a jewel it should seem that would give a lustre to the royal diadem he was for importing from the celestial regions in heaven indeed we shall not dispute its being to be found and that at all junctures alike but the parallel i doubt already fails in the earthly governors in question or to speak more properly candidates for government by the very supposition there cannot at the juncture he supposes be any such thing power is that very quality which in consideration of these other qualities which it is supposed are possessed by them already they are now waiting to receive vii by power in this place i for my part mean political power the only sort of power our author could mean the only sort of power that is here in question a little farther on we shall find him speaking of this endowment as being possessed and that in the highest degree by a king a single person natural power therefore—mere organical power—the faculty of giving the hardest blows can never it is plain be that which he meant to number among the attributes of this godlike personage viii we see then the dilemma our authors theology has brought him into by putting him upon reckoning power among the qualifications of his candidates power is either natural or political political power is what they cannot have by the supposition for that is the very thing that is to be created and which by the establishment of government men are going to confer on them if any then it must be natural power the natural strength that a man possesses of himself without the help of government but of this then if this be it there is more if we may believe our author in a single member of a society than in that member and all the rest of the society put togetherb ix this difficulty if possible one should be glad to see cleared up the truth is i take it that in what our author has said of power he has been speaking as it were by anticipation and that what he means by it is not any power of either kind actually possessed by any man or body of men at the juncture he supposes but only a capacity if one may call it so of retaining and putting into action political power whensoever it shall have been conferred now of actual power the quantity that is possessed is in every case one and the same for it is neither more nor less than the supreme power but as to the capacity above spoken of there do seem indeed to be good grounds for supposing it to subsist in a higher degree in a single man than in a body x these grounds it will not be expected that i should display at large a slight sketch will be sufficient—the efficacy of power is in part at least in proportion to the promptitude of obedience the promptitude of obedience is in part in proportion to the promptitude of command command is an expression of will a will is sooner formed by one than many and this or something like it i take to be the plain english of our authors metaphor where he tells us as we shall see a little farther on† that a monarchy is the most powerful form of government of any all the sinews of government being knit together and united in the hands of the prince xi the next paragraph short as it is contains variety of matter the first two sentences of it are to let us know that with regard to the manner in which the several particular governments that we know of have been formed he thinks proper to pass it by a third is to intimate for the second time that all governments must be absolute in some hands or other in the fourth and last he favours us with a very comfortable piece     of intelligence the truth of which but for his averment few of us perhaps would have suspected this is that the qualifications mentioned by the last paragraph as requisite to be possessed by all governors of states are or at least once upon a time were actually possessed by them i e according to the opinion of somebody but of what somebody is not altogether clear whether in the opinion of these governors themselves or of the persons governed by them xii how the several forms of government we now see in the world at first actually began says our author is matter of great uncertainty and has occasioned infinite disputes it is not my business or intention to enter into any of them however they began or by what right soever they subsist there is and must be in all of them a supreme irresistible absolute uncontrolled authority in which the jura summi imperii or the rights of sovereignty reside and this authority is placed in those hands wherein according to the opinion of the founders of such respective states either expressly given or collected from their tacit approbation the qualities requisite for supremacy wisdom goodness and power are the most likely to be found xiii who those persons are whom our author means here by the word founders whether those who became the governors of the states in question or those who became the governed or both together is what i would not take upon me positively to determine for aught i know he may have meant neither the one nor the other but some third person and indeed what i am vehemently inclined to suspect is that in our authors large conception the mighty and extensive domains of athens and sparta of which we read so much at school and at college consisting each of several scores of miles square represented at the time this paragraph was writing the whole universe and the respective eras of solon and lycurgus the whole period of the history of those states xiv the words founders—opinion—approbation—in short the whole complexion of the sentence is such as brings to ones view a system of government utterly different from the generality of those we have before our eyes a system in which one would think neither caprice nor violence nor accident nor prejudice nor passion had any share a system uniform comprehensive and simultaneous planned with phlegmatic deliberation established by full and general assent such in short as according to common imagination were the systems laid down by the two sages above mentioned if this be the case the object he had in mind when he said founders might be neither governors nor governed but some neutral person such as those sages chosen as they were in a manner as umpires might be considered with regard to the persons who under the prior constitution whatever it was had stood respectively in those two relations xv all this however is but conjecture in the proposition itself neither this nor any other restriction is expressed it is delivered explicitly and emphatically in the character of an universal one in all of them he assures us this authority the supreme authority is placed in those hands wherein according to the opinion of the founders of such respective states these qualities of wisdom goodness and power are the most likely to be found in this character it cannot but throw a singular light on history i can see no end indeed to the discoveries it leads to all of them equally new and edifying when the spaniards for example became masters of the empire of mexico a vulgar politician might suppose it was because such of the mexicans as remained unexterminated could not help it no such thing—it was because either the spaniards were of opinion or the mexicans themselves were of opinion which of the two is not altogether clear that in charles v and his successors more goodness of which they had such abundant proofs as well as wisdom was likely to be found than in all the mexicans put together the same persuasion obtained between charlemagne and the german saxons with respect to the goodness and wisdom of charlemagne—between william the norman and the english saxons—between mahomet ii and the subjects of john paleologus—between odoacer and those of augustulus—between the tartar gingiskan and the chinese of his time—between the tartars changti and camghi and the chinese of their times—between the protector cromwell and the scotch—between william iii and the irish papists—between cæsar and the gauls—in short between the thirty tyrants so called and the athenians whom our author seems to have had in view—to mention these examples only out of as many hundred as might be required all this if we may trust our author he has the goodness to believe and by such lessons is the penetration of students to be sharpened for piercing into the depths of politics xvi so much for the introductory paragraph—the main part of the subject is treated of in six others the general contents of which are as follows xvii in the first he tells us how many different forms of government there are according to the division of the ancients which division he adopts these are three monarchy aristocracy and democracy xviii the next is to tell us that by the sovereign power he means that of making laws     xix in a third he gives us the advantages and disadvantages of these three different forms of government xx in a fourth he tells us that these are all the ancients would allow of xxi a fifth is to tell us that the british form of government is different from each of them being a combination of all and possessing the advantages of all xxii in the sixth and last he shows us that it could not possess these advantages if instead of being what it is it were either of those others and tells us what it is that may destroy it these two last it will be sufficient here to mention to examine them will be the task of our next chapter xxiii monarchy is that form of government in which the power of making laws is lodged in the hands of a single member of the state in question aristocracy is that form of government in which the power of making laws is lodged in the hands of several members democracy is that form of government in which the power of making laws is lodged in the hands of all of them put together these according to our author are the definitions of the ancients and these therefore without difficulty are the definitions of our author xxiv the political writers of antiquity says he will not allow more than three regular forms of government the first when the sovereign power is lodged in an aggregate assembly consisting of all the members of a community which is called a democracy the second when it is lodged in a council composed of select members and then it is styled an aristocracy the last when it is entrusted in the hands of a single person and then it takes the name of a monarchy all other species of government they say are either corruptions of or reducible to these three xxv by the sovereign power as was before observed is meant the making of laws for wherever that power resides all others must conform to and be directed by it whatever appearance the outward form and administration of the government may put on for it is at any time in the option of the legislature to alter that form and administration by a new edict or rule and to put the execution of the laws into whatever hands it pleases and all the other powers of the state must obey the legislative power in the execution of their several functions or else the constitution is at an end xxvi having thus got three regular simple forms of government this anomalous complex one of our own out of the question and just as many qualifications to divide among them of each of which by what he told us a while ago each form of government must have some share it is easy to see how their allotments will be made out each form of government will possess one of these qualities in perfection taking its chance if one may say so for its share in the two others xxvii among these three different forms of government then it should seem according to our authors account of them there is not much to choose each of them has a qualification an endowment to itself each of them is completely characterized by this qualification no intimation is given of any preeminence among these qualifications one above another should there be any dispute concerning the preference to be given to any of these forms of government as proper a method as any of settling it to judge from this view of them is that of cross and pile hence we may infer that all the governments that ever were or will be except a very particular one that we shall come to presently that is to say our own are upon a par that of athens with that of persia that of geneva with that of morocco since they are all of them he tells us corruptions of or reducible to one of these this is happy a legislator cannot do amiss he may save himself the expense of thinking the choice of a king was once determined we are told by the neighing of a horse the choice of a form of government might be determined so as well xxviii as to our own form of government however this it is plain being that which it seemed good to take for the theme of his panegyric and being made out of the the other three will possess the advantages of all of them put together and that without any of the disadvantages the disadvantages vanishing at the word of command or even without it as not being suitable to the purpose xxix at the end of the paragraph which gives us the above definitions one observation there is that is a little puzzling other species of government we are given to understand there are besides these but then those others if not reducible to are but corruptions of these now what there is in any of these to be corrupted is not so easy to understand the essence of these several forms of government we must always remember is placed by him solely and entirely in the article of number in the ratio of the number of the governors for so for shortness we will style those in whose hands is lodged this power of making laws to that of the governed if the number of the former be to that of the latter as one to all then is the form of government a monarchy if as all to all then is it a democracy if as some number between one and all to all then is it an aristocracy now then if we can conceive a fourth number     which not being more than all is neither one nor all nor any thing between one and all we can conceive a form of government which upon due proof may appear to be a corruption of some or one or other of these threec if not we must look for the corruption somewhere else suppose it were in our authors reasond xxx not but that we may meet indeed with several other hardworded names for forms of government but these names were only so many names for one or other of those three we hear often of a tyranny but this is neither more nor less than the name a man gives to our authors monarchy when out of humour with it it is still the government of number one we hear now and then too of a sort of government called an oligarchy but this is neither more nor less than the name a man gives to our authors aristocracy in the same case it is still the government of some number or other between one and all in fine we hear now and then of a sort of government fit to break ones teeth called an ochlocracy but this is neither more nor less than the name a man gives to a democracy in the same case it is still that sort of government which according to our author is the government of all xxxi let us now see how he has disposed of his three qualifications among his three sorts or forms of government upon monarchy we shall find he has bestowed the perfection of power on aristocracy of wisdom on democracy of goodness each of these forms having just enough we may suppose of the two remaining qualifications besides its own peculiar one to make up the necessary complement of qualities requisite for supremacy kings are nay were before they were kings since it was this qualification determined their subjects to make them kings as strong as so many herculess but then as to their wisdom or their goodness there is not much to say the members of an aristocracy are so many solomons but then they are not such sturdy folks as your kings nor if the truth is to be spoken have they much more honesty than their neighbours as to the members of a democracy they are the best sort of people in the world but then they are but a puny sort of gentry as to strength put them all together and apt to be a little defective in point of understanding xxxii in a democracy says he where the right of making laws resides in the people at large public virtue or goodness of intention is more likely to be found than either of the other qualities of government popular assemblies are frequently foolish in their contrivance and weak in their execution but generally mean to do the thing that is right and just and have always a degree of patriotism or public spirit in aristocracies there is more wisdom to be found than in the other frames of government being composed or intended to be composed of the most experienced citizens but there is less honesty than in a republic and less strength than in a monarchy a monarchy is indeed the most powerful of any all the sinews of government being knit together and united in the hand of the prince but then there is imminent danger of his employing that strength to improvident or oppressive purposes xxxiii thus these three species of government have all of them their several perfections and imperfections democracies are usually the best calculated to direct the end of a law aristocracies to invent the means by which that end shall be obtained and monarchies to carry those means into execution and the ancients as was observed had in general no idea of any other permanent form of government but these three for though cicero declares himself of opinion esse optimè constitutam rempublicam quæ ex tribus generibus illis regali optimo et populari sit modicè confusa yet tacitus treats this notion of a mixed government formed out of them all and partaking of the advantages of each as a visionary whim and one that if effected could never be lasting or secure xxxiv in the midst of this finespun ratiocination an accident has happened of which our author seems not to be aware one of his accidents as a logician would say has lost its subject one of the qualifications he has been telling us of is somehow or other become vacant the form of government he designed it for having unluckily slipped through his fingers in the handling i mean democracy which he and according to him the ancients make out to be the government of all now all is a great many so many that i much doubt it will     be rather a difficult matter to find these high and mighty personages power enough—so much as to make a decent figure with the members of this redoubtable commonwealth will be still worse off i doubt in point of subjects than trinculo in the play or than the potentates whom some late navigators found lording it with might and main ϰρατερῃφι βιηφι over a spanish settlement there were three members of the government and they had one subject among them alle let him examine it a little and it will turn out i take it to be precisely that sort of government and no other which one can conceive to obtain where there is no government at all our author we may remember had shrewd doubts about the existence of a state of nature† grant him his democracy and it exists in his democracyf xxxv the qualification of goodness i think it was that belonged to the government of all while there was such a government this having taken its flight as we have seen to the region of nonentities the qualification that was designed for it remains upon his hands he is at liberty therefore to make a compliment of it to aristocracy or to monarchy which best suits him perhaps it were as well to give it to monarchy the title of that form of government to its own peculiar qualification power being as we have seen rather an equivocal one or else which perhaps is as good a way of settling matters as any he may set them to cast lots chapter iii the british constitution i with a set of data such as we have seen in the last chapter we may judge whether our author can meet with any difficulty in proving the british constitution to be the best of all possible governments or indeed any thing else that he has a mind in his paragraph on this subject there are several things that lay claim to our attention but it is necessary we should have it under our eye ii but happily for us in this island the british constitution has long remained and i trust will long continue a standing exception to the truth of this observation for as with us the executive power of the laws is lodged in a single person they have all the advantages of strength and dispatch that are to be found in the most absolute monarchy and as the legislature of the kingdom is entrusted to three distinct powers entirely independent of each other first the king second the lords spiritual and temporal which is an aristocratical assembly of persons selected for their piety their birth their wisdom their valour or their property and third the house of commons freely chosen by the people from among themselves which makes it a kind of democracy as this aggregate body actuated by different springs and attentive to different interests composes the british parliament and has the supreme disposal of every thing there can no inconvenience be attempted by either of the three branches but will be withstood by one of the other two each branch being armed with a negative power sufficient to repel any innovation which it shall think inexpedient or dangerous iii here then is lodged the sovereignty of the british constitution and lodged as beneficially as is possible for society for in no other shape could we be so certain of finding the three great qualities of government so well and so happily united if the supreme power were lodged in any one of the three branches separately we must be exposed to the inconveniencies of either absolute monarchy aristocracy or democracy and so want two of the principal ingredients of good polity either virtue wisdom or power if it were lodged in any two of the branches for instance in the king and house of lords our laws might be providentially made and well executed but they might not always have the good of the people in view if lodged in the king and commons we should want that circumspection and mediatory caution which the wisdom of the peers is to afford if the supreme rights of legislature were lodged in the two houses only and     the king had no negative upon their proceedings they might be tempted to encroach upon the royal prerogative or perhaps to abolish the kingly office and thereby weaken if not totally destroy the strength of the executive power but the constitutional government of this island is so admirably tempered and compounded that nothing can endanger or hurt it but destroying the equilibrium of power between one branch of the legislature and the rest for if ever it should happen that the independence of any one of the three should be lost or that it should become subservient to the views of either of the other two there would soon be an end of our constitution the legislature would be changed from that which was originally set up by the general consent and fundamental act of the society and such a change however effected is according to mr locke who perhaps carries his theory too far at once an entire dissolution of the bands of government and the people would be reduced to a state of anarchy with liberty to constitute to themselves a new legislative power iv in considering the first of these two paragraphs in the first place a phenomenon we should little expect to see from any thing that goes before is a certain executive power that now for the first time bolts out upon us without warning or introduction the power the only power our author has been speaking of all along till now is the legislative tis to this and this alone that he has given the name of sovereign power tis this power the different distributions of which he makes the characteristics of his three different forms of government tis with these different distributions distributions made of the legislative power that according to his account are connected the several qualifications laid down by him as requisites for supremacy qualifications in the possession of which consist all the advantages which can belong to any form of government coming now then to the british constitution it is in the superior degree in which these qualifications of the legislative body are possessed by it that its peculiar excellence is to consist it is by possessing the qualification of strength that it possesses the advantage of a monarchy but how is it then that by his account it possesses the qualification of strength by any disposition made of the legislative power by the legislative powers being lodged in the hands a single person as in the case of a monarchy no but to a disposition made of a new power which comes in as it were in a parenthesis—a new power which we now hear of for the first time—a power which has not by any description given of it been distinguished from the legislative—an executive v what then is this same executive power i doubt our author would not find it a very easy matter to inform us why not says an objector is it not that power which in this country the king has in addition to his share in the legislative be it so the difficulty for a moment is staved off but that it is far enough from being solved a few questions will soon show us this power is it that only which the king really has or is it all that he is said to have is it that only which he really has and which he exercises or is it that also which although he be said to have it he neither does exercise nor may exercise does it include judiciary power or not if it does does it include the power of making as well particular decisions and orders as general permanent spontaneous regulations of procedure such as are some of those we see made by judges doth it include supreme military power and that as well in ordinary as in a time of martial law doth it include the supreme fiscal powera and in general that power which extending as well over the public money as over every other article of public property may be styled the dispensatorialb doth it include the power of granting patents for inventions and charters of incorporation doth it include the right of making byelaws in corporations and is the right of making byelaws in corporations the superior right to that of conferring the power to make them or is it that there is an executive power that is superior to a legislative this executive again doth it include the right of substituting the laws of war to the laws of peace and vice versâ the laws of peace to the laws of war doth it include the right of restraining the trade of subjects by treaties with foreign powers doth it include the right     of delivering over by virtue of the like treaties large bodies of subjects to foreign laws—he that would understand what power is executive and not legislative and what legislative and not executive he that would mark out and delineate the different species of constitutional powers he that would describe either what is or what ought to be the constitution of a country and particularly of this country—let him think of these things vi in the next place we are told in a parenthesis it being a matter so plain as to be taken for granted that each of these branches of the legislature is independent—yes entirely independent of the two others—is this then really the case those who consider the influence which the king and so many of the lords have in the election of members of the house of commons the power which the king has at a minutes warning of putting an end to the existence of any house of commons those who consider the influence which the king has over both houses by offices of dignity and profit given and taken away again at pleasure those who consider that the king on the other hand depends for his daily bread on both houses but more particularly on the house of commons not to mention a variety of other circumstances that might be noticed in the same view—will judge what degree of precision there was in our authors meaning when he so roundly asserted the affirmative vii one parenthesis more for this sentence teems with parenthesis within parenthesis to this we are indebted for a very interesting piece of intelligence nothing less than a full and true account which he has given us of the personal merits of the members of the house of lords for the time being this he is enabled to do by means of a contrivance of his own no less simple than it is ingenious to wit that of looking at their titles it is by looking at mens titles that he perceives not merely that they ought to possess certain merits not that there is reason to wish they may possess them but that they do actually possess them and that it is by possessing those merits that they come to possess these titles seeing that some are bishops he knows that they are pious seeing that some are peers he knows that they are wise rich valiantc viii the more we consider the application he makes of the commonplace notions concerning the three forms of government to our own the more we shall see the wide difference there is between reading and reflecting our own he finds to be a combination of these three it has a monarchical branch an aristocratical and a democratical the aristocratical is the house of lords the democratical is the house of commons much had our author read at school doubtless and at college of the wisdom and gravity of the spartan senate something probably in montesquieu and elsewhere about the venetian he had read of the turbulence and extravagance of the athenian mob full of these ideas the house of lords were to be our spartans or venetians the house of commons our athenians with respect then to the point of wisdom for that of honesty we will pass by the consequence is obvious the house of commons however excellent in point of honesty is an assembly of less wisdom than that of the house of lords this is what our author makes no scruple of assuring us a dukes son gets a   0 seat in the house of commons there needs no more to make him the very model of an athenian cobbler ix let us find out if we can whence this notion of the want of wisdom in the members of a democracy and of the abundance of it in those of an aristocracy could have had its rise we shall then see with what degree of propriety such a notion can be transferred to our houses of lords and commons in the members of a democracy in particular there is likely to be a want of wisdom—why the greater part being poor are when they begin to take upon them the management of affairs uneducated being uneducated they are illiterate being illiterate they are ignorant ignorant therefore and unwise if that be what is meant by ignorant they begin depending for their daily bread on the profits of some petty traffic or the labour of some manual occupation they are nailed to the workboard or the counter in the business of government it is only by fits and starts that they have leisure so much as to act they have no leisure to reflect ignorant therefore they continue—but in what degree is this the case with the members of our house of commons x on the other hand the members of an aristocracy being few are rich either they are members of the aristocracy because they are rich or they are rich because they are members of the aristocracy being rich they are educated being educated they are learned being learned they are knowing they are at leisure to reflect as well as act they may therefore naturally be expected to become more knowing that is more wise as they persevere in what degree is this the case with the members of the house of lords more than with those of the house of commons the fact is as every body sees that either the members of the house of commons are as much at leisure as those of the house of lords or if occupied in such a way as tends to give them a more than ordinary insight into some particular department of government in whom shall we expect to find so much knowledge of law as in a professed lawyer of trade as in a merchant xi but hold—our author when he attributes to the members of an aristocracy more wisdom than to those of a democracy has a reason of his own let us endeavour to understand it and then apply it as we have applied the others in aristocratical bodies we are to understand there is more experience at least it is intended by somebody or other there should be which it seems answers the same purpose as if there was in aristocracies says our author there is more wisdom to be found than in the other frames of government being composed continues he or intended to be composed of the most experienced citizens on this ground then it is that we are to take for granted that the members of the house of lords have more wisdom among them than those of the house of commons it is this article of experience that being a qualification possessed by the members of an aristocratical body as such in a superior degree to that in which it can be possessed by a democratical body is to afford us a particular ground for attributing a greater share of wisdom to the members of the upper house than to those of the lower xii how is it that a member of an aristocracy as such is of all things to have attained more experience than the number of a democracy our author has not told us nor what it is this experience is to consist of is it experience of things preparatory to but different from the business of governing this should rather go by the name of knowledge is it experience of the business itself of governing let us see for the member of the one body as of the other there must be a time when he first enters upon this business they both enter upon it suppose on the same day now then is it on that same day that one is more experienced in it than the other or is it on that day ten years xiii those indeed who recollect what we observed but now† may answer without hesitation—on that day ten years the reason was there given it is neither more nor less than that want of leisure which the bulk of the numerous members of a democracy must necessarily labour under more than those of an aristocracy but of this what intimation is there to be collected from any thing that has been suggested by our author xiv so much with respect to aristocracies in general it happens also by accident that that particular branch of our own government to which he has given the name of the aristocratical—the house of lords—has actually greater opportunities of acquiring the qualification of experience than that other branch the house of commons to which he has given the name of the democratical but to what is this owing not to any thing in the characteristic natures of those two bodies not to the ones being aristocratical and the other democratical but to a circumstance entirely foreign and accidental which we shall see presently but let us observe his reasoning the house of lords he says is an assembly that behoves to have more wisdom in it than the house of commons this is the proposition now for the proof the first is an aristocratical assembly the second a democratical an     aristocratical assembly has more experience than a democratical and on that account more wisdom therefore the house of lords as was to be proved has more wisdom than the house of commons now what the whole of the argument rests upon we may observe is this fact that an aristocratical assembly as such has more experience than a democratical one but this with aristocratical assemblies in general we see is not for any reason that our author has given us the case at the same time with respect to our house of lords in particular in comparison with the house of commons it does happen to be the case owing to this simple circumstance the members of the house of lords when once they begin to sit sit on for life those of the house of commons only from seven years to seven years or it may happen less xv in speaking however in this place of experience i would rather be understood to mean opportunity of acquiring experience than experience itself for actual experience depends upon other concurrent causes xvi it is however from superiority of experience alone that our author derives superiority of wisdom he has indeed the proverb in his favour experience it has been said of old is the mother of wisdom be it so—but then interest is the father there is even an interest that is the father of experience among the members of the house of commons though none so poor as to be illiterate are many whose fortunes according to the common phrase are yet to make the fortunes of those of the house of lords i speak in general are made already the members of the house of commons may hope to be members of the house of lords the members of the house of lords have no higher house of lords to rise to is it natural for those to be most active who have the least or those who have the most interest to be so are the experienced those who are the least or those who are the most active does experience come to men when asleep or when awake is it the members of the house of lords that are the most active or of the house of commons to speak plain is it in the house of lords that there is most business done or in the house of commons was it after the fish was caught that the successor of st peter used the net or was it beforei in a word is there most wisdom ordinarily where there is least or where there is most to gain by being wisek xvii a word or two more with respect to the characteristic qualifications as our author states them of the higher assembly of our legislature experience is in virtue of their being an aristocratical assembly to afford them wisdom thus far we were arrived before but he now pushes the deduction a step farther—wisdom is to afford them circumspection and mediatory caution qualifications which it seems as if we should see nothing of were it not for them let us now put a case the business indeed that originates in the house of lords is as things stand so little that our author seems to forget that there is any however some there is a bill then originates with the lords and is sent down to the commons as to circumspection i say nothing that let us hope is not wanting to either house but whose province is mediatory caution now xviii thus much concerning these two branches of our legislature so long as they continue what according to our authors principles they are at present the house of lords the aristocratical branch the house of commons the democratical a little while and we shall see them so but again a little while perhaps and we shall not see them so for by what characteristic does our author distinguish an aristocratical legislative body from a democratical one by that of number by the number of the persons that compose them by that and that alone for no other has he given now therefore to judge by that the house of lords at present indeed is the aristocratical branch the house of commons in comparison at least with the other the democratical thus far is well but should the list of nobility swell at the rate we have sometimes seen it there is an assignable period and that perhaps at no very enormous distance at which the assembly of the lords will be more numerous than that of the commons which will then be the aristocratical branch of our legislature     upon our authors principles the house of commons which the democratical the house of lords xix the final cause we are to observe and finishing exploit the portus et sabbatum as lord bacon might perhaps have called itl of this sublime and edifying dissertation is this demonstration he has been giving us of the perfection of the british form of government this demonstration for by no less a title ought it to be called is founded we may have observed altogether upon the properties of numbers properties newly discovered indeed and of an extraordinary complexion moral properties but properties however so it seems of numbers tis in the nature then of numbers we shall find these characteristic properties of the three forms of government if any where now the properties of numbers are universally allowed to be the proper subject of that mode of demonstration which is called mathematical the proof our author has given has therefore already in it the essence of such a demonstration to be complete at all points it wants nothing but the form this deficiency is no other than what an underrate workman might easily supply a mere technical operation does the business that humble task it shall be my endeavour to perform the substantial honour i ascribe wholly to our author to whom only it is most due xx

convenient asterisks scholium after the same manner it may be proved to be allweak allfoolish and allknavish xxi thus much for the british constitution and for the grounds of that preeminence which it boasts i trust indeed not without reason above all others that are known such is the idea our author gives us of those grounds—you are not satisfied with it then says some one—not perfectly—what is then your own—in truth this is more than i have quite yet settled i may have settled it with myself and not think it worth the giving but if ever i do think it worth the giving it will hardly be in the form of a comment on a digression stuffed into the belly of a definition at any rate it is not likely to be much wished for by those who have read what has been given us on this subject by an ingenious foreigner since it is to a foreigner we were destined to owe the best idea that has yet been given of a subject so much our own our author has copied but mr de lolme has thought the topic which our author has thus brought upon the carpet let any one judge with what necessity is in respect to some parts of it that we have seen rather of an invidious nature since however it has been brought upon the carpet i have treated it with that plainness with which an englishman of all others is bound to treat it because an englishman may thus treat it and be safe i have said what the subject seemed to demand without any fear indeed but without any wish to give offence resolving not to     permit myself to consider how this or that man might chance to take it i have spoken without sycophantical respect indeed yet i hope not without decency certainly without any party spleen i chose rather to leave it to our author to compliment men in the lump and to stand aghast with admiration at the virtues of men unknown our author will do as shall seem meet to him for my part if ever i stand forth and sing the song of eulogy to great men it shall be not because they occupy their station but because they deserve it chapter iv right of the supreme power to make laws i we now come to the third topic touched upon in the digression namely the right as our author phrases it which the supreme power has of making laws and this topic occupies one pretty long paragraph the title here given to it is the same which in the next succeeding paragraph he has found for it himself this is fortunate for to have been obliged to find a title for it myself is what would have been to the last degree distressing to entitle a discourse is to represent the drift of it but to represent the drift of this is a task which so long at least as i confine my consideration to the paragraph itself bids defiance to my utmost efforts ii tis to another passage or two a passage or two that we have already seen starting up in distant parts of this digression that i am indebted for such conjectures as i have been able to make up these conjectures however i could not have ventured so far to rely on as on the strength of them to have furnished the paragraph with a title of my own framing the danger of misrepresentation was too great a kind of danger which a man cannot but lie eminently exposed to who ventures to put a precise meaning upon a discourse which in itself has none that i may just mention however in this place the result of them what he is really aiming at i take it is to inculcate a persuasion that in every state there must subsist in some hands or other a power that is absolute i mention it thus prematurely that the reader may have some clue to guide him in his progress through the paragraph which it is now time i should recite iii having says our author thus cursorily considered the three usual species of government and our own singular constitution selected and compounded from them all i proceed to observe that as the power of making laws constitutes the supreme authority so wherever the supreme authority in any state resides it is the right of that authority to make laws that is in the words of our definition to prescribe the rule of civil action and this may be discovered from the very end and institution of civil states for a state is a collective body composed of a multitude of individuals united for their safety and convenience and intended to act together as one man if it therefore is to act as one man it ought to act by one uniform will but in as much as political communities are made up of many natural persons each of whom has his particular will and inclination these several wills cannot by any natural union be joined together or tempered and disposed into a lasting harmony so as to constitute and produce that one uniform will of the whole it can therefore be no otherwise produced than by a political union by the consent of all persons to submit their own private wills to the will of one man or of one or more assemblies of men to whom the supreme authority is entrusted and this will of that one man or assemblage of men is in different states according to their different constitutions understood to be law iv the other passages which suggested to me the construction i have ventured to put upon this shall be mentioned by and by first let us try what is to be made of it by itself v the obscurity in which the first sentence of this paragraph is enveloped is such that i know not how to go about bringing it to light without borrowing a word or two of logicians laying aside the preamble the body of it viz as the power of making laws constitutes the supreme authority so wherever the supreme authority in any state resides it is the right of that authority to make laws may be considered as constituting that sort of syllogism which logicians call an enthymeme an enthymeme consists of two propositions a consequent and antecedent the power of making laws says our author constitutes the supreme authority this is his antecedent from hence it is he concludes that wherever the supreme authority in any state resides it is the right of that authority to make laws this then is his consequent now so it is that this antecedent and this consequent for any difference at least that i can possibly perceive in them would turn out were they but correctly worded to mean precisely the same thing for after saying that the power of making laws constitutes the supreme authority to tell us that for that reason the supreme authority is or has the power or the right of making laws is giving us i take it much the same sort of information as it would be to us to be told     that a thing is so because it is so a sort of truth which there seems to be no very great occasion to send us upon discovering in the end and institution of civil states that by the sovereign power he meant the power of making laws this or something like it is no more indeed than what he had told us over and over and over again with singular energy and anxiety in his   th page in his   th and in i know not how many pages besides always taking care for precisions sake to give a little variety to the expression the words power and authority sometimes seemingly put for the same idea sometimes seemingly opposed to each other both of them sometimes denoting the fictitious being the abstract quality sometimes the real being or beings the person or persons supposed to possess that quality—let us disentangle the sense from these ambiguities let us learn to speak distinctly of the persons and of the quality we attribute to them and then let us make another effort to find a meaning for this perplexing passage vi by the supreme authority then we may suppose our author to say i mean the same thing as when i say the power of making laws this is the proposition we took notice of above under the name of the antecedent this antecedent then we may observe is a definition a definition to wit of the phrase supreme authority now to define a phrase is to translate it into another phrase supposed to be better understood and expressive of the same ideas the supposition here then is that the reader was already of himself tolerably well acquainted with the import of the phrase power of making laws that he was not at all or was however less acquainted with the import of the phrase supreme authority upon this supposition then it is that in order to his being made clearly to understand the latter he is informed of its being synonymous to the former let us now introduce the mention of the person let us add the word person to the definition it will be the same definition still in substance only a little more fully and precisely worded for a person to possess the supreme authority is for a person to possess the power of making laws this then is what in substance has been already laid down in the antecedent vii now let us consider the consequent which when detached from the context may be spoken of as making a sentence of itself wherever says he the supreme authority in any state presides it is the right of that authority to make laws—by wherever i take it for granted he means in whatever persons by authority in the former part of the sentence—power by the same word authority in the latter part of the sentence—persons corrected therefore the sentence will stand thus in whatever persons in any state the supreme power resides it is the right of those persons to make laws viii the only word now remaining undisposed of is the word right and what to think of this i must confess i know not whether our author had a meaning in it or whether he had none it is inserted we may observe in the latter part only of the sentence it appears not in the former concerning this omission two conjectures here present themselves it may have happened by accident or it may have been made by design if by accident then the case is that the idea annexed to the word right is no other than what was meant to be included in the former part of the sentence in which it is not expressed as well as in the latter in which it is in this case it may without any change in the signification be expressed in both let it then be expressed and the sentence take it all together will stand thus in whatever persons the right of exercising supreme power in any state resides it is the right of those persons to make laws if this conjecture be the true one and i am apt to think it is we see once more and i trust beyond all doubt that the consequent in this enthymeme is but a repetition of the antecedent we may judge then whether it is from any such consideration as that of the end and institution of civil states or any other consideration that we are likely to gain any further conviction of the truth of this conclusion than it presents us of itself we may also form some judgment beforehand what use or meaning there is likely to be in the assemblage of words that is to follow ix what is possible notwithstanding however improbable is that the omission we have been speaking of was designed in this case what we are to understand is that the word right was meant to introduce a new idea into this latter part of the sentence over and above any that was meant to be suggested by the former right then according to this construction in the one place is to be considered as put in contradistinction to fact in the other the sense is then that whatever persons do actually exercise supreme power or what according to the antecedent of the enthymeme is the same thing the power of making laws those persons have the right to exercise it but in this case neither does what is given as a consequence in any respect follow from the antecedent nor can any thing be made of it but what is altogether foreign to the rest of the discourse so much indeed that it seems more consonant to probability as well as more favourable to our author to conclude that he had no meaning at all than that he had this     x let us now try what we can make of the remainder of the paragraph being ushered in by the word for it seems to lay claim to the appellation of an argument this argument setting out as we have seen without an object seems however to have found something like one at last as if it had picked it up by the way this object if i mistake it not is to persuade men that the supreme power that is the person or persons in use to exercise the supreme power in a state ought in all points without exception to be obeyed what men intend he says to do when they are in a state is to act as if they were but one man but one man has but one will belonging to him what they intend therefore or what they ought to intend a slight difference which our author seems not to be well aware of is to act as if they had but one will to act as if they had but one will the way is for them to join all their wills together to do this the most obvious way would be to join them naturally but as wills will not splice and dovetail like deal boards the only feasible way is to join them politically now the only way for men to join their wills together politically is for them all to consent to submit their wills to the will of one this one will to which all others are to be submitted is the will of those persons who are in use to exercise the supreme power whose wills again when there happens to be many of them have by a process of which our author has said nothing been reduced as we must suppose into one already so far our authors argument the above is the substance of it fairly given not altogether with so much ornament indeed as he has given it but i trust with somewhat more precision the whole concludes we may observe with our authors favourite identical proposition or something like it now for the twentieth time repeated xi taking it altogether it is without question a very ingenious argument nor can any thing in the world answer the purpose better except just in the case where it happens to be wanted not but that a veteran antagonist trained up in the regular and accustomed discipline of legal fencing—such an one indeed might contrive perhaps with due management to give our author the honour of the field but should some undisciplined blunderer like the commissarys landlady thrust in quart when he should have thrust in tierce i doubt much whether he might not get within our authors guard—i intend—i consent—i submit myself—who are you i wonder that should know what i do better than i do myself as to submitting my will to the wills of the people who made this law you are speaking of—what i know is that i never intended any such thing i abominate them i tell you and all they ever did and have always said so and as to my consent so far have i been from giving it to their law that from the first to the last i have protested against it with all my might so much for our refractory disputant—what i should say to him i know but what our author could find to say in answer to him is more than i can imaginea xii let us now return and pick up those other passages which we supposed to have a respect to the same design that seems to be in view in this first comes the short introductory paragraph that ushers in the whole digression a paragraph which however short and however imperfect with respect to the purpose of giving a general view of the contents of those which follow it was in despite of method to expatiate upon this subject upon this subject indeed he does expatiate with a force of argument and energy of expression which nothing can withstand this it begins will necessarily lead us into a short inquiry concerning the nature of society and civil government this is all the intimation it gives of the contents of those paragraphs we have examined upon this before us it touches in energetic terms but more energetic than precise and the natural it continues and inherent right that belongs to the sovereignty of a state natural right observe that belongs to the sovereignty of a political society wherever that sovereignty be lodged of making and enforcing laws xiii this is not all the most emphatical passage is yet behind it is a passage in that short paragraph† which we found to contain such a variety of matter he is there speaking of the several forms of government now in being however they began says he or by what right soever they subsist there is and must be in all of them a supreme irresistible absolute uncontrouled authority in which the jura summi imperii or the rights of sovereignty reside     xiv the vehemence the δεινοτης of this passage is remarkable he ransacks the language he piles up one upon another four of the most tremendous epithets he can find he heaps ossa upon pelion and as if the english tongue did not furnish expressions strong or imposing enough he tops the whole with a piece of formidable latinity from all this agitation it is plain i think there is a something which he has very much at heart which he wishes but fears perhaps to bring out undisguised which in several places notwithstanding burst out involuntarily as it were before he is well ready for it and which a certain discretion getting at last the upper hand of propensity forces as we have seen to dribble away in a string of obscure sophisms thus oddly enough it happens that that passage of them all which if i mistake not is the only one that was meant to be dedicated expressly to the subject is the least explicit on itb xv a courage much stauncher than our authors might have wavered here a task of no less intricacy was here to be travelled through than that of adjusting the claims of those two jealous antagonists liberty and government a more invidious ground is scarcely to be found any where within the field of politics enemies encompass the traveller on every side he can scarce stir but he must expect to be assaulted with the warhoop of political heresy from one quarter or another difficult enough is the situation of him who in these defiles feels himself impelled one way by fear and another by affection xvi to return to the paragraph which it was the more immediate business of this chapter to examine—were the path of obscurity less familiar to our author one should be tempted to imagine he had struck into it on the particular occasion before us in the view of extricating himself from this dilemma a discourse thus prudently indeterminate might express enough to keep fair with the rulers of the earth without setting itself in direct array against the prejudices of the people viewed by different persons it might present different aspects to men in power it might recommend itself and that from the first under the character of a practical lesson of obedience for the use of the people while among the people themselves it might pass muster for a time at least in quality of a string of abstract scientific propositions of jurisprudence it is not till some occasion for making application of it should occur that its true use and efficacy would be brought to light the people no matter on what occasion begin to murmur and concert measures of resistance now then is the time for the latent virtues of this passage to be called forth the book is to be opened to them and in this passage they are to be shown what of themselves perhaps they would never have observed—a set of arguments curiously strung together and wrapped up in proof of the universal expedience or rather necessity of submission a necessity which is to arise not out of the reflection that the probable mischiefs of resistance are greater than the probable mischiefs of obedience not out of any such debateable consideration but out of a something that is to be much more cogent and effectual to wit a certain metaphysicolegal impotence which is to beget in them the sentiment and answer all the purposes of a natural one armed and full of indignation our malcontents are making their way to the royal palace in vain a certain estoppel being made to bolt out upon them in the manner we have seen by the force of our authors legal engineering their arms are to fall as it were by enchantment from their hands to disagree to clamour to oppose to take back in short their wills again is now they are told too late it is what cannot be done their wills have been put in hotchpot along with the rest they have united—they have consented—they have submitted—our author having thus put his hook into their nose they are to go back as they came and all is peace an ingenious contrivance this enough but popular passion is not to be fooled i doubt so easily now and then it is true one error may be driven out for a time by an opposite error one piece of nonsense by another piece of nonsense but for barring the door effectually and for ever against all error and all nonsense there is nothing like the simple truth xvii after all these pains taken to inculcate unreserved submission would any one have expected to see our author himself among the most eager to excite men to disobedience and that perhaps upon the most frivolous pretences in short upon any pretence whatsoever such however upon looking back a little we shall find him i say among the most eager for other men at least the most enlightened advocates for liberty are content with leaving it to subjects to resist for their own sakes on the footing of permission this will not content our author but he must be forcing it upon them as a point of duty xviii tis in a passage antecedent to the digression we are examining but in the same section that speaking of the pretended law of nature and of the law of revelation no human laws he says should be suffered to contradict these the expression     is remarkable it is not that no human laws should contradict them but that no human laws should be suffered to contradict them he then proceeds to give us an example this example one might think would be such as should have the effect of softening the dangerous tendency of the rule—on the contrary it is such as cannot but enhance itc and in the application of it to the rule the substance of the latter is again repeated in still more explicit and energetic terms nay says he speaking of the act he instances if any human law should allow or enjoin us to commit it we are bound to transgress that human law or else we must offend both the natural and the divine xix the propriety of this dangerous maxim so far as the divine law is concerned is what i must refer to a future occasion for more particular considerationd as to the law of nature if as i trust it will appear it be nothing but a phrasee if there be no other medium for proving any act to be an offence against it than the mischievous tendency of such act if there be no other medium for proving a law of the state to be contrary to it than the inexpediency of such law unless the bare unfounded disapprobation of any one who thinks of it be called a proof if a test for distinguishing such laws as would be contrary to the law of nature from such as without being contrary to it are simply inexpedient be that which neither our author nor any man else so much as pretended ever to give if in a word there be scarce any law whatever but what those who have not liked it have found on some account or another to be repugnant to some text of scripture i see no remedy but that the natural tendency of such doctrine is to impel a man by the force of conscience to rise up in arms against any law whatever that he happens not to like what sort of government it is that can consist with such a disposition i must leave to our author to inform us xx it is the principle of utility accurately apprehended and steadily applied that affords the only clew to guide a man through these streights it is for that if any and for that alone to furnish a decision which neither party shall dare in theory to disavow it is something to reconcile men even in theory they are at least something nearer to an effectual union than when at variance as well in respect to theory as of practice xxi in speaking of the supposed contract between king and people i have already had occasion to give the description and as it appears to me the only general description that can be given of that juncture at which and not before resistance to government becomes commendable or in other words reconcilable to just notions whether of legal or not at least of moral and if there be any difference religious duty† what was there said was spoken at the time with reference to that particular branch of government which was then in question the branch that in this country is administered by the king but if it was just as applied to that branch of government and in this country it could only be for the same reason that it is so when applied to the whole of government and that in any country whatsoever it is then we may say and not till then allowable to if not incumbent on every man as well on the score of duty as of interest to enter into measures of resistance when according to the best calculation he is able to make the probable mischiefs of resistance speaking with respect to the community in general appear less to him than the probable mischiefs of submission this then is to him that is to each man in particular the juncture for resistance xxii a natural question here is—by what sign shall this juncture be known by what common signal alike conspicuous and perceptible to all a question which is readily enough started but to which i hope it will be almost as readily perceived that it is impossible to find an answer common sign for such a purpose i for my part know of none he must be more than a prophet i think that can show us one for that which shall serve as a particular sign to each particular person i have already given one—his     own internal persuasion of a balance of utility on the side of resistance xxiii unless such a sign then which i think impossible can be shown the field if one may say so of the supreme governors authority though not infinite must unavoidably i think unless where limited by express convention f be allowed to be indefinite nor can i see any narrower or other bounds to it under this constitution or under any other yet freer constitution if there be one than under the most despotic before the juncture i have been describing were arrived resistance even in a country like this would come too soon were the juncture arrived already the time for resistance would be come already under such a government even as any one should call despotic xxiv in regard to a government that is free and one that is despotic wherein is it then that the difference consists is it that those persons in whose hands that power is lodged which is acknowledged to be supreme have less power in the one than in the other when it is from custom that they derive it by no means it is not that the power of one any more than of the other has any certain bounds to it the distinction turns upon circumstances of a very different complexion—on the manner in which the whole mass of power which taken together is supreme is in a free state distributed among the several ranks of persons that are sharers in it—on the source from whence their titles to it are successively derived—on the frequent and easy changes of condition between governors and governed whereby the interests of the one class are more or less indistinguishably blended with those of the other—on the responsibility of the governors or the right which a subject has of having the reasons publicly assigned and canvassed of every act of power that is exerted over him—on the liberty of the press or the security with which every man be he of the one class or the other may make known his complains and remonstrances to the whole community—on the liberty of public association or the security with which malcontents may communicate their sentiments concert their plans and practise every mode of opposition short of actual revolt before the executive power can be legally justified in disturbing them xxv true then it may be that owing to this last circumstance in particular in a state thus circumstanced the road to a revolution if a revolution be necessary is to appearance shorter certainly more smooth and easy more likelihood certainly there is of its being such a revolution as shall be the work of a number and in which therefore the interests of a number are likely to be consulted grant then that by reason of these facilitating circumstances the juncture itself may arrive sooner and upon less provocation under what is called a free government than under what is called an absolute one grant this—yet till it be arrived resistance is as much too soon under one of them as under the other xxvi let us avow then in short steadily but calmly what our author hazards with anxiety and agitation that the authority of the supreme body cannot unless where limited by express convention be said to have any assignable any certain bounds—that to say there is any act they cannot do—to speak of any thing of theirs as being illegal—as being void—to speak of their exceeding their authority whatever be the phrase—their power—their right—is however common an abuse of language xxvii the legislature cannot do it the legislature cannot make a law to this effect why cannot what is there that should hinder them why not this as well as so many other laws murmured at perhaps as inexpedient yet submitted to without any question of the right with men of the same party with men whose affections are already listed against the law in question any thing will go down any rubbish is good that will add fuel to the flame but with regard to an impartial bystander it is plain that it is not denying the right of the legislature their authority their power or whatever be the word—it is not denying that they can do what is in question—it is not that i say or any discourse verging that way that can tend to give him the smallest satisfaction xxviii grant even the proposition in general—what are we the nearer grant that there are certain bounds to the authority of the legislature—of what use is it to say so when these bounds are what nobody has ever attempted to mark out to any useful purpose that is in any such manner whereby it might be known beforehand what description a law must be of to fall within and what to fall beyond them grant that there are things which the legislator cannot do—grant that there are laws which exceed the power of the legislature to establish what rule does this sort of discourse furnish us for determining whether any one that is in question is or is not of the number as far as i can discover none either the discourse goes on in the confusion it began—either all rests in vague assertions and no intelligible argument at all is offered or if any such arguments as are drawn from the principle of     utility arguments which in whatever variety of words expressed come at last to neither more nor less than this that the tendency of the law is to a greater or a less degree pernicious if this then be the result of the argument why not come home to it at once why turn aside into a wilderness of sophistry when the path of plain reason is straight before us xxix what practical inferences those who maintain this language mean should be deduced from it is not altogether clear nor perhaps does every one mean the same some who speak of a law as being void for to this expression not to travel through the whole list i shall confine myself would persuade us to look upon the authors of it as having thereby forfeited as the phrase is their whole power as well that of giving force to the particular law in question as to any other these are they who had they arrived at the same practical conclusion through the principle of utility would have spoken of the law as being to such a degree pernicious as that were the bulk of the community to see it in its true light the probable mischief of resisting it would be less than the probable mischief of submitting to it these point in the first instance at hostile opposition xxx those who say nothing about forfeiture are commonly less violent in their views these are they who were they to ground themselves on the principle of utility and to use our language would have spoken of the law as being mischievous indeed but without speaking of it as being mischievous to the degree that has been just mentioned the mode of opposition which they point to is one which passes under the appellation of a legal one xxxi admit then the law to be void in their sense and mark the consequences the idea annexed to the epithet void is obtained from those instances in which we see it applied to a private instrument the consequence of a private instruments being void is that all persons concerned are to act as if no such instrument had existed the consequence accordingly of a laws being void must be that people shall act as if there were no such law about the matter and therefore that if any person in virtue of the mandate of the law should do anything in coercion of another person which without such law he would be punishable for doing he would still be punishable to wit by appointment of the judicial power let the law for instance be a law imposing a tax a man who should go about to levy the tax by force would be punishable as a trespasser should he chance to be killed in the attempt the person killing him would not be punishable as for murder should he kill he himself would perhaps be punishable as for murder to whose office does it appertain to do those acts in virtue of which such punishment would be inflicted to that of the judges applied to practice then the effect of this language is by an appeal made to the judges to confer on those magistrates a controuling power over the acts of the legislature xxxii by this management a particular purpose might perhaps by chance be answered and let this be supposed a good one still what benefit would from the general tendency of such a doctrine and such a practice in conformity to it accrue to the body of the people is more than i can conceive a parliament let it be supposed is too much under the influence of the crown pays too little regard to the sentiments and the interests of the people be it so the people at any rate if not so great a share as they might and ought to have have had at least some share in choosing it give to the judges a power of annulling its acts and you transfer a portion of the supreme power from an assembly which the people have had some share at least in choosing to a set of men in the choice of whom they have not the least imaginable share to a set of men appointed solely by the crown appointed solely and avowedly and constantly by that very magistrate whose partial and occasional influence is the very grievance you seek to remedy xxxiii in the heat of debate some perhaps would be for saying of this management that it was transferring at once the supreme authority from the legislative power to the judicial but this would be going too far on the other side there is a wide difference between a positive and a negative part in legislation there is a wide difference again between a negative upon reasons given and a negative without any the power of repeating a law even for reasons given is a great power too great indeed for judges but still very distinguishable from and much inferior to that of making oneg xxxiv let us now go back a little   0 in denying the existence of any assignable bounds to the supreme power i added unless where limited by express convention for this exception i could not but subjoin our author indeed in that passage in which short as it is he is the most explicit leaves we may observe no room for it however they began says he speaking of the several forms of government—however they began and by what right soever they subsist there is and must be in all of them an authority that is absolute to say this however of all governments without exception—to say that no assemblage of men can subsist in a state of government without being subject to some one body whose authority stands unlimited so much as by convention—to say in short that not even by convention can any limitation be made to the power of that body in a state which in other respects is supreme would be saying i take it rather too much it would be saying that there is no such thing as government in the german empire nor in the dutch provinces nor in the swiss cantons nor was of old in the achæan league xxxv in this mode of limitation i see not what there is that need surprise us by what is it that any degree of power meaning political power is established it is neither more nor less as we have already had occasion to observe† than a habit of and disposition to obedience habit speaking with respect to past acts disposition with respect to future this disposition it is as easy or i am much mistaken to conceive as being absent with regard to one sort of acts as present with regard to another for a body then which is in other respects supreme to be conceived as being with respect to a certain sort of acts limited all that is necessary is that this sort of acts be in its description distinguishable from every other xxxvi by means of a convention then we are furnished with that common signal which in other cases we despaired of finding‡ a certain act is in the instrument of convention specified with respect to which the government is therein precluded from issuing a law to a certain effect whether to the effect of commanding the act of permitting it or of forbidding it a law is issued to that effect notwithstanding the issuing then of such a law the sense of it and likewise the sense of that part of the convention which provides against it being supposed clear is a fact notorious and visible to all in the issuing then of such a law we have a fact which is capable of being taken for that common signal we have been speaking of these bounds the supreme body in question has marked out to its authority of such a demarcation then what is the effect either none at all or this that the disposition to obedience confines itself within these bounds beyond them the disposition is stopped from extending beyond them the subject is no more prepared to obey the governing body of his own state than that of any other what difficulty i say there should be in conceiving a state of things to subsist in which the supreme authority is thus limited—what greater difficulty in conceiving it with this limitation than without any i cannot see the two states are i must confess to me alike conceivable whether alike expedient—alike conducive to the happiness of the people is another question xxxvii god forbid that from any thing here said it should be concluded that in any society any convention is or can be made which shall have the effect of setting up an insuperable bar to that which the parties affected shall deem a reformation—god forbid that any disease in the constitution of a state should be without its remedy such might by some be thought to be the case where that supreme body which in such a convention was one of the contracting parties having incorporated itself with that which was the other no longer subsists to give any new modification to the engagement many ways might however be found to make the requisite alteration without any departure from the spirit of the engagement although that body itself which contracted the engagement be no more a larger body from whence the first is understood to have derived its title may still subsist let this larger body be consulted various are the ways that might be conceived of doing this and that without any disparagement to the dignity of the subsisting legislature of doing it i mean to such effect as that should the sense of such larger body be favourable to the alteration it may be made by a law which in this case neither ought to be nor probably would be regarded by the body of the people as a breach of the conventionh     xxxviii to return for a moment to the language used by those who speak of the supreme power as being limited in its own nature one thing i would wish to have remembered what is here said of the impropriety and evil influence of that kind of discourse is not intended to convey the smallest censure on those who use it as if intentionally accessary to the ill effects it has a tendency to produce it is rather a misfortune in the language than a fault of any person in particular the original of it is lost in the darkness of antiquity we inherited it from our fathers and maugre all its inconveniences are likely i doubt to transmit it to our children xxxix i cannot look upon this as a mere dispute of words i cannot help persuading myself that the disputes between contending parties—between the defenders of a law and the opposers of it would stand a much better chance of being adjusted than at present were they but explicitly and constantly referred at once to the principle of utility the footing on which this principle rests every dispute is that of matter of fact that is future fact—the probability of certain future contingencies were the debate then conducted under the auspices of this principle one of two things would happen either men would come to an agreement concerning that probability or they would see at length after due discussion of the real grounds of the dispute that no agreement was to be hoped for they would at any rate see clearly and explicitly the point on which the disagreement turned the discontented party would then take their resolution to resist or to submit upon just grounds according as it should appear to them worth their while—according to what should appear to them the importance of the matter in dispute—according to what should appear to them the probability or improbability of success—according in short as the mischiefs of submission should appear to bear a less or a greater ratio to the mischiefs of resistance but the door to reconcilement would be much more open when they saw that it might be not a mere affair of passion but a difference of judgment and that for any thing they could know to the contrary a sincere one that was the ground of quarrel xl all else is but womanish scolding and childish altercation which is sure to irritate and which never can persuade—i say the legislature cannot do this—i say that it can i say that to do this exceeds the bounds of its authority—i say it does not it is evident that a pair of disputants setting out in this manner may go on irritating and perplexing one another for everlasting without the smallest chance of ever coming to an agreement it is no more than announcing and that in an obscure and at the same time a peremptory and captious manner their opposite persuasions or rather affections on a question of which neither of them sets himself to discuss the grounds the question of utility all this while most probably is never so much as at all brought upon the carpet if it be the language in which it is discussed is sure to be warped and clouded to make it match with the obscure and entangled pattern we have seen xli on the other hand had the debate been originally and avowedly instituted on the footing of utility the parties might at length have come to an agreement or at least to a visible and explicit issue—i say that the mischiefs of the measure in question are to such an amount—i say not so but to a less—i say the benefits of it are only to such an amount—i say not so but to a greater—this we see is a ground of controversy very different from the former the question is now manifestly a question of conjecture concerning so many future contingent matters of fact to solve it both parties then are naturally directed to support their respective persuasions by the only evidence the nature of the case admits of—the evidence of such past matters of fact as appear to be analogous to those contingent future ones now these past facts are almost always numerous so numerous that till brought into view for the purpose of the debate a great proportion of them are what may very fairly have escaped the observation of one of the parties and it is owing perhaps to this and nothing else that that party is of the persuasion which sets it at variance with the other here then we have a plain and open road perhaps to present reconcilement at the worst to an intelligible and explicit issue—that is to such a ground of difference as may when thoroughly trodden and explored be found to lead on to reconcilement at the last men let them but once clearly understand     one another will not be long ere they agree it is the perplexity of ambiguous and sophistical discourse that while it distracts and eludes the apprehension stimulates and inflames the passions but it is now high time we should return to our author from whose text we have been insensibly led astray by the nicety and intricacy of the question it seemed to offer to our view chapter v duty of the supreme power to make laws i we now come to the last topic touched upon in this digression a certain duty which according to our authors account the supreme power lies under—the duty of making laws ii thus far says he as to the right of the supreme power to make laws but farther it is its duty likewise for since the respective members are bound to conform themselves to the will of the state it is expedient that they receive directions from the state declaratory of that its will but since it is impossible in so great a multitude to give injunctions to every particular man relative to each particular action therefore the state establishes general rules for the perpetual information and direction of all persons in all points whether of positive or negative duty and this in order that every man may know what to look upon as his own what as anothers what absolute and what relative duties are required at his hands what is to be esteemed honest dishonest or indifferent what degree every man retains of his natural liberty what he has given up as the price of the benefits of society and after what manner each person is to moderate the use and exercise of those rights which the state assigns him in order to promote and secure the public tranquillity iii still as obscure still as ambiguous as ever the supreme power we may remember according to the definition so lately given of it by our author and so often spoken of is neither more nor less than the power to make laws of this power we are now told that it is its duty to make laws hence we learn—what—that it is its duty to do what it does to be in short what it is this then is what the paragraph now before us with its apparatus of fors and buts and sinces is designed to prove to us of this stamp is that meaning at least of the initial sentence which is apparent upon the face of it iv complete the sense of the phrase to make laws add to it in this place what it wants in order to be an adequate expression of the import which the preceding paragraph seemed to annex to it you have now for what is mentioned as the object of the duty another sense indeed but a sense still more untenable than the foregoing thus far says our author recapitulating what he had been saying before as to the right of the supreme power to make laws—by this right we saw in the preceding chapter was meant a right to make laws in all cases whatsoever but further he now adds it is its duty likewise its duty then to do—what to do the same thing that it was before asserted to be its right to do—to make laws in all cases whatsoever or to use another word and that our authors own and that applied to the same purpose that it is its duty to be absolute a sort of duty this which will probably be thought rather a singular one v meantime the observation which if i conjecture right he really had in view to make is one which seems very just indeed and of no mean importance but which is very obscurely expressed and not very obviously connected with the purport of what goes before the duty he here means is a duty which respects i take it not so much the actual making of laws as the taking of proper measures to spread abroad the knowledge of whatever laws happen to have been made a duty which to adopt some of our authors own words is conversant not so much about issuing directions as about providing that such as are issued shall be received vi meantime to speak of the duties of a supreme power—of a legislature meaning a supreme legislature—of a set of men acknowledged to be absolute—is what i must own i am not very fond of not that i would wish the subordinate part of the community to be a whit less watchful over their governors or more disposed to unlimited submission in point of conduct than if i were to talk with ever so much peremptoriness of the duties of these latter and of the rights which the former have against thema what i am afraid of is running into solecism and confusion in discourse     vii i understand i think pretty well what is meant by the word duty political duty when applied to myself and i could not persuade myself i think to apply it in the same sense in a regular didactic discourse to those whom i am speaking of as my supreme governors that it is my duty to do which i am liable to be punished according to law if i do not do this is the original ordinary and proper sense of the word dutyb have     these supreme governors any such duty no for if they are at all liable to punishment according to law whether it be for not doing any thing or for doing then are they not what they are supposed to be supreme governorsc those are the supreme governors by whose appointment the former are liable to be punished viii the word duty then if applied to persons spoken of as supreme governors is evidently applied to them in a sense which is figurative and improper nor therefore are the same conclusions to be drawn from any propositions in which it is used in this sense as might be drawn from them if it were used in the other sense which is its proper one ix this explanation then being premised—understanding myself to be using the word duty in its improper sense the proposition that it is the duty of the legislature to spread abroad as much as possible the knowledge of their will among the people is a proposition i am disposed most unreservedly to accede to if this be our authors meaning i join myself to him heart and voice x what particular institutions our author wished to see established in this view—what particular duties he would have found for the legislature under this general head of duty is not very apparent though it is what should have appeared more precisely than it does ere his meaning could be apprehended to any purpose what increases still the difficulty of apprehending it is a practice which we have already had more than once occasion to detect him in—a kind of versatility than which nothing can be more vexatious to a reader who makes a point of entering into the sentiments of his author he sets out with the word duty in his mouth and in the character of a censor with all due gravity begins talking to us of what ought to be tis in the midst of this lecture that our proteus slips aside puts on the historian gives an insensible turn to the discourse and without any warning of the change finishes with telling us what is between these two points indeed the is and the ought to be so opposite as they frequently are in the eyes of other men that spirit of obsequious quietism that seems constitutional in our author will scarce ever let him recognise a difference tis in the second sentence of the paragraph that he observes that it is expedient that they the people receive directions from the state meaning the governing body declaratory of that its will tis in the very next sentence that we learn from him that what it is thus expedient that the state should do it does do but since it is impossible in so great a multitude to give particular injunctions to every particular man relative to each particular action therefore says he the state establishes does actually establish general rules the state generally any state that is to say that one can mention all states in short whatever do establish general rules for the perpetual information and direction of all persons in all points whether of positive or of negative duty thus far our author so that for aught appears whatever he could wish to see done in this view is done neither this state of our own nor any other does he wish to see do any thing more in the matter than he sees done already nay nor than what is sure to be done at all events so that happily the duty he is here so forward to lay on his superiors will not sit on them very heavy thus far is he from having any determinate instructive meaning in that part of the paragraph in which to appearance and by accident he comes nearest to it xi not that the passage however is absolutely so remote from meaning but that the inventive complaisance of a commentator of     the admiring breed might find it pregnant with a good deal of useful matter the design of disseminating the knowledge of the laws is glanced at by it at least with a show of approbation were our authors writings then as sacred as they are mysterious and were they in the number of those which stamp the seal of authority on whatever doctrines can be fastened on them what we have read might serve as a text from which the obligation of adopting as many measures as a man should deem subservient to that design might without any unexampled violence be deduced in this oracular passage i might find inculcated if not totidem syllabis at least totidem literis as many points of legislative duty as should seem subservient to the purposes of digestion and promulgation thus fortified i might press upon the legislature and that on the score of duty to carry into execution and that without delay many a busy project as yet either unthought of or unheeded i might call them with a tone of authority to their work i bid them go make provision forthwith for the bringing to light such scattered materials as can be found of the judicial decisions of time past—sole and neglected materials of common law—for the registering and publishing of all future ones as they arise—for transforming by a digest the body of the common law thus completed into statutelaw—for breaking down the whole together into codes or parcels as many as there are classes of persons distinguishably concerned in it—for introducing to the notice and possession of every person his respective code—works which public necessity cries aloud for at which professional interest shudders and at which legislative indolence stands aghast xii all these leading points i say of legislative economy with as many points of detail subservient to each as a meditation not unassiduous has suggested i might enforce were it necessary by our authors oracular authority for nothing less than what has been mentioned i trust is necessary in order that every man may be made to know in the degree in which he might and ought to be made to know what in our authors words to look upon as his own what as anothers what absolute and what relative duties are required at his hands what is to be esteemed honest dishonest or indifferent what degree every man retains of his natural liberty what he has given up as the price of the benefits of society and after what manner each person is to moderate the use and exercise of those rights which the state assigns him in order to promote and secure the public tranquillity in taking my leave of our author i finish gladly with this pleasing peroration a scrutinizing judgment perhaps would not be altogether satisfied with it but the ear is soothed by it and the heart is warmed xiii i now put an end to the tedious and intricate war of words that has subsisted in a more particular manner during the course of these two last chapters a logomachy wearisome enough perhaps and insipid to the reader but beyond description laborious and irksome to the writer what remedy had there been sense i should have attached myself to the sense finding nothing but words to the words i was to attach myself or to nothing had the doctrine been but false the task of exposing it would have been comparatively an easy one but it was what is worse unmeaning and thence it came to require all these pains which i have been here bestowing on it to what profit let the reader judge well then cries an objector the task you have set yourself is at an end and the subject of it after all according to your own representation teaches nothing—according to your own showing it is not worth attending to why then bestow on it so much attention in this view to do something to instruct but more to undeceive the timid and admiring student—to excite him to place more confidence in his own strength and less in the infallibility of great names—to help him to emancipate his judgment from the shackles of authority—to let him see that the not understanding a discourse may as well be the writers fault as the readers—to teach him to distinguish between shewy language and sound sense—to warn him not to pay himself with words—to show him that what may tickle the ear or dazzle the imagination will not always inform the judgment—to show him what it is our author can do and has done and what it is he has not done and cannot do—to dispose him rather to fast on ignorance than feed himself with error—to let him see that with regard to an expositor of the law our author is not he that should come but that we may be still looking for another—who then says my objector shall be that other yourself—no verily my mission is at end when i have prepared the way before him finis         principles of the civil code         introduction of all the branches of legislation the civil code is that which presents the fewest attractions to those who do not study the law as a profession this assertion is not strong enough since this branch has hitherto almost inspired a species of disgust curiosity has for a long time been ardently directed to the consideration of political economy penal law and the principles of government celebrated works have rendered these studies respectable and upon pain of acknowledging a humiliating inferiority to those around us it is necessary that these should be understood and an opinion be formed respecting them but the civil law has never yet passed the obscure bounds of the bar its commentators sleep in the dust of the libraries by the side of their opponents the public are ignorant even of the names of the sects that divide them and regard with a silent respect the numerous folios the enormous compilations ornamented with the pompous titles of body of laws and universal jurisprudence c the general dislike to this study is the result of the manner in which it has been treated all these works occupy the same place in the science of law which was once occupied by the works of the schoolmen in the natural sciences before the establishment of experimental philosophy those who attribute their dryness and their obscurity to the nature of their subject show them too great an indulgence indeed to what does this part of the laws refer it treats of every thing which is most interesting to men—of their security of their property of their reciprocal and daily transactions of their domestic condition in the relations of father husband child it is here we behold the rise of rights and obligations for all the objects of law may be reduced to these two terms and there is then no mystery the civil code is at bottom only the penal code under another aspect it is not possible to understand the one without understanding the other the establishment of rights is the granting of permissions and the issuing of prohibitions in a word it is the creation of offences to commit an offence is on the one hand to violate an obligation—on the other hand a right to commit a private offence is to violate an obligation due to an individual—a right which he has over us to commit a public offence is to violate an obligation due to the public—a right which the public have over us civil law is therefore only penal law considered under another aspect if i consider the law at the moment it confers a right or imposes an obligation i consider it in a civil point of view if i consider the law in its sanctions in its effects with respect to a violated right or broken obligation i consider it in a penal point of view what then is meant by principles of civil law we intend to express the motives of the laws—the knowledge of the true reasons which ought to guide the legislator in the distribution of the rights he confers or the obligations he imposes upon individuals in the whole library of writings upon the civil law we search in vain for one which has had for its object the exhibition of the reasons upon which it is founded philosophy has never entered there the theory of civil law by linguet which promises much is far from deserving its title it is the production of an unregulated imagination governed by a bad heart an oriental despotism is the model to which he would reduce all the european governments that he might correct all their notions of liberty and humanity which seem like mournful spectres to torment him  00 the disputes of jurisprudence have produced even in its schools a set of doubters who have doubted whether they had any principles according to them every thing is arbitrary—the law is good because it is law because a decision whatever it may be produces the great benefit of peace there is in this opinion a little truth and a great deal of error it will be seen in the following work that the principle of utility extends over this portion of the laws as well as over all the others but that its application is difficult—that it requires an intimate knowledge of human nature the first ray of light which broke in upon mr bentham in his legal studies was that the law of nature—the original compact—the moral sense—the notions of right and wrong which had been employed for the explanation of the laws were only at bottom those innate ideas whose falsehood had been so ably demonstrated by mr locke he saw that they revolved in a vicious circle familiarized with the method of bacon and of newton he resolved to introduce it into legislation he has made it an experimental science he has discarded all dogmatic words he has rejected all terms that do not express some sensation of pleasure or of pain for example he will not admit that property is an inherent right—a natural right because these terms explain nothing prove nothing the terms justice and injustice have in his eyes the same inconvenience of prejudging instead of illuminating the questions to which they refer when he proposes to establish a law he does not pretend to have discovered a corresponding law in the law of nature and by a common trick present that as already done which still remains to be done when he explains obligations he does not envelope them in mysterious reasons he admits nothing on supposition he clearly shows that every obligation ought to be founded either upon some previous service received by the person on whom it is imposed or on some superior need on the part of the person in whose favour it is imposed or upon some mutual agreement which derives all its force from its utility thus always guided by experience and observation he only considers the effects which the laws produce upon the faculties of man as a sensible being and he always assigns pains to be avoided as the only arguments of real value the civilians never leave off reasoning upon fictions and giving these fictions the same effect as realities for example they admit of contracts which never existed of quasi contracts which never had the appearance of existing in certain cases they admit a civil death in other cases they deny natural death such a dead man is not dead such another living man is not living such an one who is absent ought to be considered as present such an one who is present ought to be considered as absent a province is not where it is a country does not belong to those to whom it belongs men are sometimes only things and as such cannot possess rights things are sometimes beings which possess rights and are bound by obligations they recognise imprescriptible rights which have always been prescribed against and unalienable rights which have always been alienated and that which is not is always more distinctly visible to their eyes than that which is take away their fictions or rather their lies they know not where they are accustomed to these crutches they cannot walk without them mr bentham has rejected all these puerile arguments he has not one gratuitous supposition not one arbitrary definition—not a reason which is not the expression of a fact not a fact which is not drawn from an effect of the law either good or bad it is by this method of always reasoning consistently with his principles that he has made the civil law a new science new and even paradoxical to those who have been educated in the opinions of the ancient schools but simple natural and even familiar to those who have not been misled by false systems hence a translation of this book would have in all languages the same meaning and the same force because it appeals to the experience of all men instead of technical reasons—of reasons founded upon abstract terms upon arbitrary definitions which possess only a local value and consist only of words which disappear when no synonyms are found by which to translate them it is thus the savage africans who make use of shells for money discover their poverty immediately that they pass their own frontiers and wish to exchange their conventional riches with strangers in mr benthams mss there are frequent references to the laws of england as his observations would often have appeared to want a foundation if i had not mentioned the particular laws against which they were directed i have endeavoured for the purpose of clearness to develope that which was only an allusion to the original i may have made some mistakes these ought not to be imputed to the author these laws are in general so difficult to understand that it is dangerous for an englishman who is not a lawyer to hazard an opinion respecting them and much more so therefore for one who is not an englishman dumont  0  part i— objects of the civil law chapter i of rights and obligations every thing which the legislator is called upon to distribute among the members of the community may be reduced to two classes    st rights    d obligations rights are in themselves advantages benefits for him who enjoys them obligations on the other hand are duties burthensome charges for him who has to fulfil them rights and obligations though distinct and opposite in their nature are simultaneous in their origin and inseparable in their existence according to the nature of things the law cannot grant a benefit to any without at the same time imposing a burthen on some one else or in other words a right cannot be created in favour of any one without imposing a corresponding obligation on another in what manner is a right of property in land conferred on me by imposing upon every body except myself the obligation not to touch its produce how is the right of commanding conferred on me by imposing upon a district or a number of persons the obligation to obey me the legislator ought to confer rights with pleasure since they are in themselves a benefit he ought to impose obligations with repugnance since they are in themselves an evil in accordance with the principle of utility he ought never to impose a burthen but that he may confer a benefit of a greater value in the same proportion as it creates obligations the law curtails liberty it converts into offences acts which would otherwise be permitted and unpunishable the law creates an offence either by a positive commandment or by a prohibition these curtailments of liberty are inevitable it is impossible to create rights to impose obligations to protect the person life reputation property subsistence or liberty itself but at the expense of liberty but every restraint imposed upon liberty is liable to be followed by a natural feeling of pain more or less great independent of an infinite variety of inconveniences and sufferings which may result from the particular mode of this restraint it follows therefore that no restraint should be imposed no power conferred no coercive law sanctioned without a specific and satisfactory reason there is always one reason against every coercive law and one reason which were there no other would be sufficient by itself it is that such a law is restrictive of liberty whoever proposes a coercive law ought to be ready to prove not only that there is a specific reason in favour of this law but also that this reason is more weighty than the general reason against every law the proposition although almost selfevident that every law† is contrary to liberty is not generally recognised on the contrary the zealots of liberty more ardent than enlightened have made a conscience of combating it and how have they done it they have perverted the language and will not employ this word in its common acceptation they speak a language that belongs to no one they say liberty consists in the power of doing every thing which does not hurt another but is this the ordinary meaning of this word the liberty of doing evil is it not liberty if it is not liberty what is it then and what word should we make use of in speaking of it do we not say that liberty should be taken away from fools and wicked persons because they abuse it according to this definition then i do not know if i have the liberty of doing or not doing any action until i have examined all its consequences if it appear to me hurtful to a single individual whether the law permit or even command it i have not liberty to do it an officer of justice would not have liberty to punish a thief unless he was sure such punishment would not hurt such thief such are the absurdities implied in this definition what says unsophisticated reason let us seek from thence for true propositions the sole object of government ought to be the greatest happiness of the greatest possible number of the community the happiness of an individual is greater in proportion as his sufferings are lighter and fewer in number and as his enjoyments are greater and larger in number the care of providing for his enjoyments ought to be left almost entirely to each individual the principal function of government being to protect him from sufferings it fulfils this office by creating rights which it confers upon individuals rights of personal security rights of protection for honour rights of property rights of receiving assistance  0  in case of need to these rights correspond offences of all classes the law cannot create rights without creating the corresponding obligations it cannot create rights and obligations without creating offences it can neither command nor prohibit without restraining the liberty of individuals† the citizen therefore cannot acquire any right without the sacrifice of a part of his liberty even under a bad government there is no proportion between the sacrifice and the acquisition governments approach to perfection in proportion as the acquisition is greater and the sacrifice less chapter ii distinct objects of the civil law in this distribution of rights and obligations the legislator we have already said should have for his object the happiness of the body politic in inquiring more particularly in what this happiness consists we find four subordinate objects— subsistence abundance equality security the more perfect the enjoyment of all these particulars the greater the sum of social happiness and especially of that happiness which depends upon the laws it may be shown that all the functions of the law may be referred to these four heads to provide for subsistence to secure abundance to befriend equality to maintain security this division does not possess all the clearness and precision which could be desired the boundaries which separate these objects are not always easily determined they approach at different points and are confounded one with the other but it is enough to justify this division that it is the most complete and that we shall be called in many circumstances to consider each of the objects it contains separately and distinct from each of the others subsistence for example is included in abundance it is however properly mentioned separately because the laws ought to do for subsistence many things which they ought not to permit to be done for abundance security admits of as many distinctions as there are kinds of actions which may be opposed to it it relates to the person to the honour to property to condition actions hurtful to security when prohibited by the laws receive the character of crimes among these objects of the law security is the only one which necessarily embraces the future subsistence abundance equality may be regarded for a moment only but security implies extension in point of time with respect to all the benefits to which it is applied security is therefore the principal object i have placed equality among the objects of the law in an arrangement intended to give to every man the greatest possible amount of happiness no reason can be assigned why the law should seek to give one man more than another there are however good reasons why it should not do it the advantage acquired by the one can only exist in consequence of an equivalent disadvantage being borne by another the advantage would only be enjoyed by the favoured party the disadvantage would be felt by all those who were not thus favoured equality may be fostered both by protecting it where it exists and by seeking to produce it where it does not exist but here lies the danger a single error may overturn the whole social order‡ it may appear surprising that liberty is not placed among the principal objects of the law but in order that we may have clear notions it is necessary to consider it as a branch of security personal liberty is security against a certain species of injury which affects the person whilst as to political liberty it is another branch of security—security against the injustice of the members of the government what relates to this object belongs not to the civil but to the constitutional code chapter iii relation between these objects these four objects of the law appear very distinct to the mind but they are much less so in practice the same law may serve for several of them because they are often united what is done for example for the sake of security may be done also for the sake of subsistence and abundance but there are circumstances in which it is not possible to reconcile these objects hence a measure suggested by one of them will be  0  condemned by another equality for example would require a certain distribution of property which is incompatible with security when this contradiction exists between these objects it is necessary to find some means of deciding which ought to have the preeminence otherwise instead of guiding us in our researches their consideration will serve only to augment our confusion at the first glance it is perceived that subsistence and security rise together to the same height abundance and equality are manifestly of an inferior order indeed without security equality itself could not endure a single day without subsistence abundance cannot exist the two first ends are like life itself the two last are the ornaments of life in legislation the most important object is security if no direct laws are made respecting subsistence this object will be neglected by no one but if there are no laws respecting security it will be useless to have made laws respecting subsistence command production—command cultivation you will have done nothing but secure to the cultivator the fruits of his labour and you most probably have done enough security we have observed has many branches it is necessary that one branch of security should give way to another for example liberty which is one branch of security ought to yield to general security since it is not possible to make any laws but at the expense of liberty it is not possible then to obtain the greatest good but by the sacrifice of some subordinate good in distinguishing among these objects which on each occasion deserves the preeminence consists the difficulty of the legislative art each one claims preeminence in turn and it sometimes requires a complex calculation to determine to which the preference is due equality ought not to be favoured except in cases in which it does not injure security where it does not disturb the expectations to which the laws have given birth where it does not derange the actually established distribution if all property were to be equally divided the certain and immediate consequence would be that there would soon be nothing more to divide every thing would be speedily destroyed those who had hoped to be favoured by the division would not suffer less than those at whose expense it would be made if the condition of the industrious were not better than the condition of the idle there would be no reason for being industrious if the principle were established that all men should possess equal rights by a necessary train of consequences all legislation would be rendered impossible the laws never cease establishing inequalities since they cannot bestow rights upon any without imposing obligations upon others declare that all men that is all the human race have equal rights there is an end of all subordination the son has equal rights with his father he has the same right to direct and to punish him he has as much right in his fathers house as his father himself the maniac has the same right to shut up others as they have to shut up him the idiot has the same right to govern his family as his family have to govern him all this is included in the equality of rights it means all this or it means nothing at all it is true those who have maintained this doctrine of the equality of rights have neither been fools nor idiots they had no intention of establishing this absolute equality they had in their minds some restrictions some modifications some explanations but if they knew not how to speak in a sensible and intelligible manner was it possible that the blind and ignorant multitude should better understand what they did not understand themselves and if they proclaimed independence was it not too certain that they would be listened to chapter iv of laws relative to subsistence what can the law do relative to subsistence nothing directly all that the law can do is to create motives that is to say to establish rewards and punishments by the influence of which men shall be induced to furnish subsistence to themselves but nature has created these motives and given them sufficient energy before the idea of law was formed want and enjoyment had done in this respect every thing which could have been done by the best concerted laws want armed with every pain and even death itself had commanded labour had sharpened courage had inspired foresight had developed all the faculties of man enjoyment the companion of every satisfied want had formed an inexhaustible fund of rewards for those who had overcome the obstacles and accomplished the designs of nature the force of the physical sanction being sufficient the employment of the political sanction would be superfluous besides the motives furnished by the laws are always more or less precarious in their operation this is a consequence of the imperfection of the laws themselves or of the difficulty of establishing the necessary facts before bestowing reward or punishment the hope of impunity glides to the bottom of the heart in all the intermediate degrees through  0  which it is necessary to pass before arriving at the accomplishment of the law but those natural effects which we may consider as the rewards and punishments of nature do not admit of this uncertainty there is no evasion no delay no favour experience announces the event experience confirms it—each succeeding day repeats the lesson of the past and the uniformity of this course leaves no place for doubt what can be added by direct legislation to the constant and irresistible power of these natural motives but the law may indirectly provide for subsistence by protecting individuals whilst they labour and by securing to them the fruits of their industry when they have laboured security for the labourer—security for the fruits of labour in these cases the benefit of the law is inestimable chapter v of laws relative to abundance shall laws be made directing individuals not to be contented with subsistence alone but to seek abundance no this would be a superfluous employment of artificial means when the natural means are sufficient the attractions of pleasure the succession of wants the active desire of adding to our happiness will under the safeguard of security incessantly produce new efforts after new acquisitions wants and enjoyments these universal agents in society after having raised the first ears of corn will by degrees erect the granaries of abundance always increasing and always full desires extend themselves with the means of gratification the horizon is enlarged in proportion as we advance and each new want equally accompanied by its pleasure and its pain becomes a new principle of action opulence which is only a comparative term does not arrest this movement when once it is begun on the contrary the greater the means the greater the field of operations the greater the reward and consequently the greater the force of the motive which actuates the mind but in what does the wealth of society consist if not in the total of the wealth of the individuals composing it and what more is required than the force of these natural motives for carrying the increase of wealth to the highest possible degree we have seen that abundance is produced by degrees by the continued operation of the same causes which had provided for subsistence there is no opposition between these two objects on the other hand the greater the abundance the more secure is subsistence those who have condemned abundance under the name of luxury have never understood this connexion famines wars accidents of every kind so often attack the resources of subsistence that a society which has no superfluity would often be exposed to want necessaries this is seen among savage nations it is what has often been witnessed among all nations in the time of their ancient poverty it is what has happened in our own days in countries but little favoured by nature such as sweden and in those countries in which the government has opposed the operations of commerce instead of protecting them—whilst those countries in which luxury abounds and where the governments are enlightened are beyond the reach of famine such is the happy situation of england where commerce is free the gewgaw useless in itself obtains a value in exchange for necessaries the manufactories of luxury are offices of insurance against want the materials used in a brewery or a manufactory of starch may be converted into a source of subsistence how often has the keeping of dogs and horses been decried as destroying the food of men the profound politicians who would put down these expenses do not rise one degree above those apostles of disinterestedness who for the purpose of producing abundance of corn set fire to the granaries chapter vi propositions of pathology upon which the advantage of equality is founded pathology is a term used in medicine it has not hitherto been employed in morals but it is equally necessary there when thus applied moral pathology would consist in the knowledge of the feelings affections and passions and their effects upon happiness legislation which has hitherto been founded principally upon the quicksands of instinct and prejudice ought at length to be placed upon the immoveable base of feelings and experience a moral thermometer is required which should exhibit every degree of happiness and suffering the possession of such an instruments is a point of unattainable perfection but it is right to contemplate it a scrupulous examination of more or less in point of pleasure or pain may at first be esteemed a minute enterprise it will be said that we must deal with generalities in human affairs and be contented with a vague approximation this is however the language of indifference or incapacity the feelings of men are sufficiently regular to become the object of a science or an art and till this is done we can only grope our way by making irregular and illdirected efforts medicine is founded upon the axioms of physical pathology morals are the medicine of the soul legislation is the practical branch it ought  0  therefore to be founded upon the axioms of mental pathology in order to judge of the effect of a portion of wealth upon happiness it must be considered in three different states    st when it has always been possessed    d when it is about to be gained    d when it is about to be lost general observation—when the effect of a portion of wealth upon happiness is spoken of it is always without reference to the sensibility of the particular individual and the exterior circumstances in which he may be placed difference of character is inscrutable and there are no two individuals whose circumstances are alike if these two considerations were not laid on one side it would be impossible to form a single general proposition but though each of these propositions may be found false or inexact in each particular case it will neither militate against their speculative correctness nor their practical utility it is sufficient— st if they approach more nearly to the truth than any others which can be substituted for them and  dly if they may be employed by the legislator as the foundation of his labours with less inconvenience than any others i we proceed to the examination of the first case we have to examine—the effect of a portion of wealth when it has always been possessed   each portion of wealth is connected with a corresponding portion of happiness   of two individuals possessed of unequal fortunes he who possesses the greatest wealth will possess the greatest happiness   the excess of happiness on the part of the most wealthy will not be so great as the excess of his wealth   for the same reason the greater the disproportion between the two masses of wealth the less the probability that there exists an equally great disproportion between the masses of happiness   the more nearly the actual proportion approaches to equality the greater will be the total mass of happiness what is here said of wealth ought not to be limited to pecuniary wealth the term is used with a more extended signification and includes every thing which serves for subsistence and abundance it is for abbreviations sake that a portion of wealth is spoken of instead of a portion of the matter of wealth we have said each portion of wealth is connected with a corresponding portion of happiness strictly speaking it should have been has a certain chance of being so connected the efficacy of any cause of happiness is always precarious in other words a cause of happiness may not produce its ordinary effect nor the same effect upon every individual it is here that it is necessary to apply what has been said with respect to particular sensibility and character and the variety of circumstances in which they may be found the second proposition is derived from the first of two individuals he who possesses the most wealth will possess the greatest happiness or chance of happiness this is a truth proved by the experience of all the world i charge the man who would doubt it to give what he possesses of superfluity to the first person who asks it of him this superfluity according to his system is worth no more than the sand on which he treads it is a burden and nothing else the manna of the desert became corrupt when more was collected than could be consumed if in the same manner wealth after it had reached a certain amount did not give an increased chance of happiness no one would wish for more than this amount and the desire of accumulation would have an ascertained boundary the third proposition will be less contested place on one side one thousand labourers having enough to live upon and a tritle to spare place on the other side a king or that he may not be troubled with the cares of royalty a well apportioned prince he himself as rich as all these labourers together it is probable that his happiness will be greater than the medium happiness of each of them but not equal to the sumtotal of all their little masses of happiness or what amounts to the same thing his happiness will not be one thousand times greater than the medium happiness of a single one among them if the mass of his happiness should be found ten times or even five times greater this would still be much the man who is born in the lap of wealth is not so sensible of the value of fortune as he who is the artisan of his own fortune it is the pleasure of acquiring and not the satisfaction of possessing which is productive of the greatest enjoyment the first is a lively sensation sharpened by desire and previous privations the other is a feeble sentiment formed by habit unenlivened by contrast and borrowing nothing from imagination ii we proceed to the examination of the second case—the effect of a portion of wealth when it first comes into the hands of a new possessor observe it will be proper to consider this gain as unexpected and to suppose that this increase of wealth is received suddenly and as it were by chance   by repeated divisions a portion of wealth may be reduced to so small an amount as not to produce any happiness for any one of its copartakers this would happen if the portion of each were less than the value of the smallest known coin but it is not necessary  0  to carry the division to this extreme point in order that the proposition may be true   among copartakers of equal fortunes the more completely in the distribution of a portion of wealth this equality is allowed to remain the greater will be the total mass of happiness   among copartakers of unequal fortunes the more the distribution of a portion of wealth contributes to their equality the greater will be the total mass of happiness iii we proceed to the examination of the third case—the effect of a portion of wealth when it leaves the hands of its possessor it will be again necessary to consider this loss as unexpected to suppose that it is unlooked for a loss is almost always unexpected because a man naturally hopes to keep what he possesses this expectation is founded upon the ordinary course of things for if we look at the whole mass of men they not only keep what they have acquired but still further increase its amount the proof is in the difference between the primitive poverty of every country and its actual wealth   the loss of a portion of wealth will produce a loss of happiness to each individual more or less great according to the proportion between the portion he loses and the portion he retains take away the fourth part of his fortune and you take away the fourth part of his happiness and so of the rest but there are cases in which this proportion does not continue if in taking threefourths of my fortune you trench upon my physical wants and in taking only the half you leave these wants untouched the loss of happiness will not be simply the half but the double the quadruple the tenfold of what it is in the other case one knows not where to stop   this point being settled the greater the number of persons with equal fortunes among whom a given loss is divided the less considerable the loss which results from it to the total mass of happiness   a certain point being reached a further division would render each share impalpable the loss occasioned to the mass of happiness becomes null   among unequal fortunes the loss of happiness produced by a loss of wealth will be so much the less when the distribution of the loss is made in such manner as to cause them to approach most nearly to equality when considered without reference to the inconveniences attached to the violation of security governments profiting by the progress of knowledge have favoured in many respects the principles of equality in the distribution of losses it is thus that they have encouraged the establishment of assurance offices in these useful contracts individuals assess their shares beforehand in order to be prepared for all possible losses the principle of assurance founded upon the calculation of probabilities is only the art of distributing losses among a great number of associates so as to render them extremely light and almost null the same intention has directed princes when they have made compensation at the expense of the state to such of their subjects as have suffered from public calamities or the devastations of war nothing could have been more wise or better intended in this respect than the administration of frederick the great this is one of the most admirable points of view under which we can contemplate the social art some few attempts have been made to indemnify individuals for the losses caused by crimes on the part of malefactors the examples of this kind are however still rare it is an object which deserves the attention of legislators since by this means the evil of offences directed against property may be reduced almost to nothing but such a system would require to be regulated with great care that it might not become hurtful it ought not to favour indolence or imprudence which neglects precautions against crimes because secure of obtaining an indemnification the utility of the remedy would depend therefore upon the manner in which it was administered but it is a culpable in difference which rejects a salutary measure in order to spare itself the trouble of separating it from its inconveniences the principles laid down above will equally serve for regulating the distribution of a loss among many persons charged with a common responsibility if their respective contributions follow the quantity of their respective fortunes their relative condition will be the same as before but if it be desirable to seize this occasion to make them approach more nearly to equality a different proportion must be adopted to assess them all equally without regard to the difference of their fortunes would be a third plan which would accord neither with equality nor security in order to make this subject more clear i shall present a compound case in which there are two individuals one of whom seeks a profit at the expense of the other we shall then determine the effect of a portion of wealth which in order to pass into the hands of one individual in the shape of gain  0  must come out of the hands of another individual in the shape of loss   prop among competitors of equal fortunes if what is gained by one be lost by another the distribution which will leave the greatest sum of happiness is that which would favour the defendant to the exclusion of the plaintiff for  st the sum lost bearing a greater proportion to the reduced fortune than to the increased fortune the diminution of happiness for the one will be greater than the increase of happiness to the other in a word equality would be violated by an opposite distribution see note upon gaming the case is exactly the same  d the loser experiences the pain of disappointed expectation the other is simply in the condition of not having gained but the negative evil of not having gained is not equal to the positive evil of having lost if this were not the case every man would experience this evil with regard to every thing which he did not obtain and the causes of evil being infinite every one ought to find himself infinitely miserable  d mankind in general appear to be more sensible of grief than pleasure from an equal cause for example a loss which would diminish the fortune of an individual by one quarter would take more from his happiness than would probably be added by a gain which should double it   prop among unequal fortunes if the loser is the poorest the evil of the loss will be increased by this unequality   prop if the loser is the richest the evil caused by the attack upon security will be in part compensated by the portion of good arising from the progress made towards equality by the assistance of these axioms which have to a certain point the character and certainty of mathematical propositions it will be possible at length to produce a regular and constant rule for indemnities and satisfactions legislators have often shown a disposition to follow the counsels of equality under the name of equity to which greater latitude has been conceded than to justice but this idea of equity vague and ill developed has rather seemed a matter of instinct than of calculation it is only by much patience and order that a multitude of incoherent and confused sentiments can be reduced into rigorous propositions chapter vii of security we have now arrived at the principal object of the laws the care of security this inestimable good is the distinctive mark of civilization it is entirely the work of the laws without law there is no security consequently no abundance nor even certain subsistence and the only equality which can exist in such a condition is the equality of misery in order rightly to estimate this great benefit of the laws it is only necessary to consider the condition of savages they struggle without ceasing against famine which sometimes cuts off in a few days whole nations rivalry with respect to the means of subsistence produces among them the most cruel wars and like the most ferocious beasts men pursue men that they may feed on one another the dread of this horrible calamity destroys amongst them the gentlest sentiments of nature pity connects itself with insensibility in putting the old persons to death because they can no longer follow their prey examine also what passes at those periods during which civilized societies almost return into the savage state i refer to a time of war when the laws which give security are in part suspended every instant of its duration is fruitful in calamity at every step which it imprints upon the globe at every movement which it makes the existing mass of riches the foundation of abundance and subsistence is decreased and disappears the lowly cottage and the lofty palace are alike subject to its ravages and often the anger or caprice of a moment consigns to destruction the slow productions of an age of labour law alone has accomplished what all the natural feelings were not able to do law alone has been able to create a fixed and durable possession which deserves the name of property the law alone could accustom men to submit to the yoke of foresight at first painful to be borne but afterwards agreeable and mild it alone could encourage them in labour—superfluous at present and which they are not to enjoy till the future economy has as many enemies as there are spendthrifts or men who would enjoy without taking the trouble to produce labour is too painful for idleness it is too slow for impatience cunning and injustice underhandedly conspire to appropriate its fruits insolence and audacity plot to seize them by open force hence security always tottering always threatened never at rest lives in the midst of snares it requires in the legislator vigilance continually sustained and power always in action to defend it against his constantly reviving crowd of adversaries  0  the law does not say to a man work and i will reward you but it says to him work and by stopping the hand that would take them from you i will ensure to you the fruits of your labour its natural and sufficient reward which without me you could not preserve if industry creates it is the law which preserves if at the first moment we owe every thing to labour at the second and every succeeding moment we owe every thing to the law in order to form a clear idea of the whole extent which ought to be given to the principle of security it is necessary to consider that man is not like the brutes limited to the present time either in enjoyment or suffering but that he is susceptible of pleasure and pain by anticipation and that it is not enough to guard him against an actual loss but also to guarantee to him as much as possible his possessions against future losses the idea of his security must be prolonged to him throughout the whole vista that his imagination can measure this disposition to look forward which has so marked an influence upon the condition of man may be called expectation—expectation of the future it is by means of this we are enabled to form a general plan of conduct it is by means of this that the successive moments which compose the duration of life are not like insulated and independent points but become parts of a continuous whole expectation is a chain which unites our present and our future existence and passes beyond ourselves to the generations which follow us the sensibility of the individual is prolonged through all the links of this chain the principle of security comprehends the maintenance of all these hopes it directs that events inasmuch as they are dependent upon the laws should be conformed to the expectations to which the laws have given birth every injury which happens to this sentiment produces a distinct a peculiar evil which may be called pain of disappointed expectation the views of jurists must have been extremely confused since they have paid no particular attention to a sentiment so fundamental in human life the word expectation is scarcely to be found in their vocabulary an argument can scarcely be found in their works founded upon this principle they have followed it without doubt in many instances but it has been from instinct and not from reason if they had known its extreme importance they would not have omitted to name it to point it out instead of leaving it in the crowd chapter viii of property that we may more completely estimate the advantage of the law let us endeavour to form a clear idea of property we shall see that there is no natural property—that property is entirely the creature of law property is only a foundation of expectation—the expectation of deriving certain advantages from the thing said to be possessed in consequence of the relations in which one already stands to it there is no form or colour or visible trace by which it is possible to express the relation which constitutes property it belongs not to physics but to metaphysics it is altogether a creature of the mind to have the object in ones hand—to keep it to manufacture it to sell it to change its nature to employ it—all these physical circumstances do not give the idea of property a piece of cloth which is actually in the indies may belong to me whilst the dress which i have on may not be mine the food which is incorporated with my own substance may belong to another to whom i must account for its use the idea of property consists in an established expectation—in the persuasion of power to derive certain advantages from the object according to the nature of the case but this expectation this persuasion can only be the work of the law i can reckon upon the enjoyment of that which i regard as my own only according to the promise of the law which guarantees it to me it is the law alone which allows me to forget my natural weakness it is from the law alone that i can enclose a field and give myself to its cultivation in the distant hope of the harvest but it may be said what has served as a base to the law for the commencement of the operation when it adopted the objects which it promised to protect under the name of property in the primitive state had not men a natural expectation of enjoying certain things—an expectation derived from sources anterior to the law yes they have had from the beginning there have always been circumstances in which a man could secure by his own means the enjoyment of certain things but the catalogue of these cases is very limited the savage who has hidden his prey may hope to keep it for himself so long as his cave is not discovered so long as he is awake to defend it whilst he is stronger than his rivals but this is all how miserable and precarious is this method of possession—suppose then the slightest agreement among these savages reciprocally to respect each others booty this is the introduction of a  0  principle to which you can only give the name of law a feeble and momentary expectation only results from time to time from purely physical circumstances a strong and permanent expectation results from law alone that which was only a thread in a state of nature becomes a cable so to speak in a state of society property and law are born and must die together before the laws there was no property take away the laws all property ceases with respect to property security consists in no shock or derangement being given to the expectation which has been founded on the laws of enjoying a certain portion of good the legislator owes the greatest respect to these expectations to which he has given birth when he does not interfere with them he does all that is essential to the happiness of society when he injures them he always produces a proportionate sum of evil chapter ix answer to an objection but perhaps the laws relating to property may be good for those who possess it but oppressive to those who have none—the poor are perchance more miserable than they would be without them the laws in creating property have created wealth but with respect to poverty it is not the work of the laws—it is the primitive condition of the human race the man who lives only from day to day is precisely the man in a state of nature the savage the poor in society i acknowledge obtain nothing but by painful labour but in a state of nature what could he obtain but at the price of his toil has not hunting its fatigues fishing its dangers war its uncertainties and if man appear to love this adventurous life—if he have an instinct greedy of these kinds of perils—if the savage rejoice in the delights of an idleness so dearly purchased—ought it to be concluded that he is more happy than our day labourers no the labour of these is more uniform but the reward is more certain the lot of the woman is more gentle infancy and old age have more resources the species multiplies in a proportion a thousand times greater and this alone would suffice to show on which side is the superiority of happiness hence the laws in creating property have been benefactors to those who remain in their original poverty they participate more or less in the pleasures advantages and resources of civilized society their industry and labour place them among the candidates for fortune they enjoy the pleasures of acquisition hope mingles with their labours the security which the law gives them is this of little importance those who look from above at the inferior ranks see all objects less than they really are but at the base of the pyramid it is the summit which disappears in its turn so far from making these comparisons they dream not of them they are not tormented with impossibilities so that all things considered the protection of the laws contributes as much to the happiness of the cottage as to the security of the palace it is surprising that so judicious a writer as beccaria should have inserted in a work dictated by the soundest philosophy a doubt subversive of the social order the right of property says he is a terrible right and may not perhaps be necessary upon this right tyrannical and sanguinary laws have been founded it has been most frightfully abused but the right itself presents only ideas of pleasure of abundance and of security it is this right which has overcome the natural aversion to labour—which has bestowed on man the empire of the earth—which has led nations to give up their wandering habits—which has created a love of country and of posterity to enjoy quickly—to enjoy without punishment—this is the universal desire of man this is the desire which is terrible since it arms all those who possess nothing against those who possess any thing but the law which restrains this desire is the most splendid triumph of humanity over itself chapter x analysis of the evils resulting from attacks upon property we have already seen that subsistence depends upon the laws which secure to the labourers the products of their labour but it would be proper more exactly to analyze the evils which result from violations of property they may be reduced to four heads—   evil of nonpossession—if the acquisition of a portion of riches be a good the nonpossession of it must be an evil though a negative evil and nothing more hence although men in the condition of primitive poverty may not have felt the special privation of wealth which was unknown to them it is clear that they at least had not all the happiness which results from it and of which we are in the enjoyment the loss of a portion of good should it even remain always unknown would yet be a loss if by calumny you prevent my friend from conferring a benefit upon me which i did not expect do you not do me an injury in what consists this injury in the negative evil which results to me of not possessing what i otherwise should have possessed but for your calumny   0   pain of loss—every thing which i actually possess or which i ought to possess i consider in my imagination as about to belong to me for ever i make it the foundation of my expectation—of the expectation of those who depend upon me and the support of my plan of life each part of my property may possess in my estimation besides its intrinsic value a value in affection—as the inheritance of my ancestors the reward of my labours or the future benefit of my heirs every thing may recall to me that portion of myself which i have spent there—my cares my industry my economy—which put aside present pleasures in order to extend them over the future so that our property may become as it were part of ourselves and cannot be taken from us without wounding us to the quick   fear of loss—to regret for what is lost uneasiness respecting what is possessed joins itself and even for what it is possible to acquire for most of the objects which are necessary for subsistence and abundance being perishable matters future acquisitions form a necessary supplement to present possessions when insecurity reaches a certain point the fear of loss hinders the enjoyment of what is possessed the care of preserving condemns us to a thousand sad and painful precautions always liable to fail treasures fly away or are buried enjoyment becomes sombre stealthy and solitary it fears by the exhibition of itself to direct cupidity to its prey   destruction of industry—if i despair of enjoying the fruits of my labour i shall only think of living from day to day i shall not undertake labours which will only benefit my enemies but besides this in order to the existence of labour the will alone is not sufficient instruments are wanting whilst these are being provided subsistence is necessary a single loss may render me unable to act without depriving me of the disposition to labour—without having paralyzed my will hence the three first of these evils affect the passive faculties of the individual whilst the fourth extends to his active faculties and strikes them with numbness it is perceived in this analysis that the two first of these evils do not extend beyond the individual injured but the two latter expand themselves and occupy an indefinite space in society an attack made upon the property of one individual spreads alarm among the other proprietors this feeling is communicated from one to another and the contagion may at last spread over the whole body of the state for the development of industry the union of power and will is required will depends upon encouragement—power upon means—these means are called in the language of political economy productive capital—with regard to a single individual his capital may be destroyed without his industrious disposition being destroyed or even weakened with regard to a nation the destruction of its productive capital is impossible but long before this fatal term arrives the mischief would have reached the will and the spirit of industry would fall under a terrible marasmus in the midst of the natural resources presented by a rich and fertile soil the will however is excited by so many stimulants that it resists a multitude of discouragements and losses a passing calamity how great soever it may be does not destroy the spirit of industry this has been seen springing up again after destructive wars which have impoverished nations like a robust oak which in a few years repairs the injuries inflicted by the tempest and covers itself with new branches nothing less is requisite for freezing up industry than the operation of a permanent domestic cause such as a tyrannical government a bad legislation an intolerant religion which repels men from each other or a minute superstition which terrifies them the first act of violence will produce a certain degree of apprehension—there are already some timid minds discouraged a second outrage quickly succeeding will spread a more considerable alarm the most prudent will begin to contract their enterprises and by degrees to abandon an uncertain career in proportion as these attacks are repeated and the system of oppression assumes an habitual character the dispersion augments those who have fled are not replaced those who remain fall into a state of langour it is thus that after a time the field of industry being beaten down by storms becomes at last a desert asia minor greece egypt the coasts of africa so rich in agriculture commerce and population whilst the roman empire flourished—what have they become under the absurd despotism of the turk the palaces are changed into cabins and the cities into small towns this government hateful to all persons of reflection has never understood that a state can never become rich but by an inviolable respect for property it has possessed only two secrets for governing—to drain and to brutify its subjects hence the finest countries in the world wasted barren or almost abandoned can scarcely be recognised in the hands of their barbarous conquerors for these evils need not be attributed to remote causes civil wars invasions the scourges of nature—these might have dissipated the wealth put the arts to flight and swallowed up the cities but the ports which have been filled up would have been reopened the communications reestablished the manufactures     revived the towns rebuilt and all these ravages repaired in time if the men had continued to be men but they are not so in these unhappy countries despair the slow but fatal effect of longcontinued insecurity has destroyed all the active powers of their souls if we trace the history of this contagion we shall see that its first attacks fall upon the richest part of society wealth was the first object of depredation superfluity vanished by little and little absolute necessity must still be provided for notwithstanding obstacles man must live but when he limits his efforts to mere existence the state languishes and the torch of industry furnishes but a few dying sparks besides abundance is never so distinct from subsistence that the one can be injured without a dangerous attack upon the other whilst some lose only what is superfluous others lose what is necessary from the infinitely complicated system of economical relations the wealth of one part of the citizens is uniformly the source from which a more numerous party derives its subsistence but another and more smiling picture may be traced and not less instructive of the progress of security and prosperity its inseparable companion north america presents the most striking contrast of these two states savage nature is there placed by the side of civilization the interior of this immense region presents only a frightful solitude impenetrable forests or barren tracts standing waters noxious exhalations venomous reptiles—such is the land left to itself the barbarous hordes who traverse these deserts without fixed habitation always occupied in the pursuit of their prey and always filled with implacable rivalry only meet to attack and to destroy each other so that the wild beasts are not so dangerous to man as man himself but upon the borders of these solitudes what a different prospect presents itself one could almost believe that one saw at one view the two empires of good and evil the forests have given place to cultivated fields the morass is dried up the land has become solid—is covered with meadows pastures domestic animals smiling and healthy habitations cities have risen upon regular plans wide roads are traced between them every thing shows that men are seeking the means of drawing near to one another they no longer dread or seek to murder each other the seaports are filled with vessels receiving all the productions of the earth and serving to exchange its riches a countless multitude living in peace and abundance upon the fruits of their labours has succeeded to the nations of hunters who were always struggling between war and famine what has produced these wonders what has renovated the surface of the earth what has given to man this dominion over embellished fruitful and perfectionated nature the benevolent genius is security it is security which has wrought out this great metamorphosis how rapid have been its operations it is scarcely two centuries since william penn reached these savage wilds with a colony of true conquerors for they were men of peace who sullied not their establishment by force and who made themselves respected only by acts of benevolence and justice chapter xi security and equality—their opposition in consulting the grand principle of security what ought the legislator to direct with regard to the mass of property which exists he ought to maintain the distribution which is actually established this under the name of justice is with reason regarded as his first duty it is a general and simple rule applicable to all states adapted to all plans even those which are most opposed to each other there is nothing more diversified than the condition of property in america england hungary russia in the first country the cultivator is proprietor in the second he is a farmer in the third he is attached to the soil in the fourth he is a slave still the supreme principle of security directs the preservation of all these distributions how different soever their natures and though they do not produce the same amount of happiness for how shall a different distribution be made without taking from some one what he possesses how shall one party be stripped without attacking the security of all when your new distribution shall be disarranged which it will be the day after its establishment how will you be able to avoid making a second why should you not correct this also and in the meantime what becomes of security of happiness of industry when security and equality are in opposition there should be no hesitation equality should give way the first is the foundation of life—of subsistence—of abundance—of happiness every thing depends on it equality only produces a certain portion of happiness besides though it may be created it will always be imperfect if it could exist for a day the revolutions of the next day would disturb it the establishment of equality is a chimera the only thing which can be done is to diminish inequality if violent causes such as a revolution in government a schism a conquest produce the overthrow of property it is a great calamity but it is only transitory—it may be softened and even repaired by time industry is a vigorous plant which resists numerous     loppings and in which the fruitful sap rises immediately upon the return of spring but if property were overthrown with the direct intention of establishing equality of fortune the evil would be irreparable no more security—no more industry—no more abundance society would relapse into the savage state from which it has arisen devant eux des citiés derrière eux des déserts such is the history of fanaticism if equality ought to reign today for the same reason it ought to reign always it can only be preserved by the same violences by which it was established it would require an army of inquisitors and executioners deaf both to favouritism and complaint—insensible to the seductions of pleasure—inaccessible to personal interest—endowed with every virtue and engaged in a service which would destroy them all the level must be in perpetual motion in order to smooth down whatever would rise above the legal line watchfulness must be uninterrupted to restore the lack of those who have dissipated their portion and to strip those who by means of labour have augmented or by care have preserved theirs in such a state of things prodigality would be wisdom and none but the mad would be industrious this pretended remedy so gentle in appearance would thus be found a deadly poison it is a burning cautery which would consume every thing till it reached the last principles of life the sword of the enemy in its wildest fury is a thousand times less to be dreaded it only causes partial evils which time effaces and which industry repairs some small societies in the first effervesence of religious enthusiasm have instituted as a fundamental principle the community of goods has happiness been increased thereby the gentle motive of reward has been supplied by the doleful motive of punishment labour so easy and so light when animated by hope has been represented as a penance necessary in order to escape from eternal punishments hence so long as the religious motive preserves its force every one labours but every one groans does this motive grow weaker the society divides itself into two classes the one degraded fanatics contract all the vices of an unhappy superstition the other idle cheats cause themselves to be supported in their idleness by the dupes by whom they surround themselves whilst the cry for equality is only a pretext to cover the robbery which idleness perpetrates upon industry the prospects of benevolence and concord which have seduced so many ardent minds are under this system only the chimeras of the imagination whence should arise in the division of labour the determining motive to choose the most painful who would undertake disagreeable and dirty tasks who would be content with his lot and not esteem the burthen of his neighbour lighter than his own how many frauds would be attempted in order to throw that burthen upon another from which a man would wish to exempt himself and in the division of property how impossible to satisfy every one to preserve the appearance of equality to prevent jealousies quarrels rivalries preferences who shall put an end to the numberless disputes always arising what an apparatus of penal laws would be required to replace the gentle liberty of choice and the natural reward of the cares which each one takes for himself the one half of society would not suffice to govern the other hence this iniquitous and absurd system could only be maintained by political or religious slavery such as that of the helots among the lacedemonians and the indians of paraguay in the establishments of the jesuits sublime inventions of legislators who for the establishment of equality made two equal lots of evil and of good and put all the evil on one side and all the good upon the other chapter xii security and equality—means of reconciliation must there therefore be constant opposition an eternal war between the two rivals security and equality up to a certain point they are incompatible but with a little patience and skill they may be brought by degrees to coincide time is the only mediator between these contrary interests would you follow the counsels of equality without contravening those of security wait for the natural period which puts an end to hopes and fears—the period of death when property is vacated by the death of the proprietors the law may intervene in the distribution to be made either by limiting in certain respects the power of disposing of it by will with the design of preventing too great an accumulation of property in the hands of a single person or by making the right of succession subservient to the purposes of equality in case the deceased should not leave a husband or wife or relations in the direct line and should not have made use of his power of disposing of it by will it passes then to new possessors whose expectations are not formed and equality may produce good to all without deceiving the expectations of any the principle only is indicated here it will be more largely developed in the second book when it regards the correction of a species of civil inequality such as slavery the same     attention ought to be paid to the rights of property the operation should be gradual and the subordinate object should be pursued without sacrificing the principal object the men whom you would render free by these gradations will be much more fitted for its enjoyment than if you had led them to trample justice under foot in order to introduce them to this new social condition we may observe that in a nation which prospers by agriculture manufactures and commerce there is a continual progress towards equality if the laws do not oppose it—if they do not maintain monopolies—if they do not restrain trade and its exchanges—if they do not permit entails—large properties will be seen without effort without revolutions without shock to subdivide themselves by little and little and a much greater number of individuals will participate in the advantage of moderate fortunes this will be the natural result of the different habits formed by opulence and poverty the first prodigal and vain seeks only to enjoy without creating the second accustomed to obscurity and to privations finds its pleasures in its labours and its economy from this arises the change which is going on in europe from the progress of arts and commerce notwithstanding the obstacles of the laws the ages of feudality are not long since passed by in which the world was divided into two classes—a few great proprietors who were every thing and a multitude of slaves who were nothing these lofty pyramids have disappeared or have been lowered and their debris has been spread abroad industrious men have formed new establishments of which the infinite number proves the comparative happiness of modern civilization hence we may conclude that security by preserving its rank as the supreme principle indirectly conducts to the establishment of equality whilst this latter if taken as the basis of the social arrangement would destroy security in establishing itself chapter xiii sacrifices of security to security this title at first appears enigmatical but the enigma is soon solved an important distinction is to be made between the ideal perfection of security and that perfection which is practicable the first requires that nothing should be taken from any one the second is attained if no more is taken than is necessary for the preservation of the rest this sacrifice is not an attack upon security it is only a defalcation from it an attack is an unforeseen shock an evil which could not be calculated upon an irregularity which has no fixed principle it seems to put all the rest in danger it produces a general alarm but this defalcation is a fixed deduction—regular necessary expected—which produces an evil of the first order but no danger no alarm no discouragement to industry the same sum of money according to the manner in which it is levied upon the people will possess the one or the other of these characters and will produce in consequence either the deadening effects of insecurity or the vivifying effects of security the necessity of these defalcations is evident to work and to guard the workmen are two different and for a time incompatible operations it is therefore necessary that those who create wealth by their labour should give up a portion of it to supply the wants of the guardians of the state wealth can only be defended at its own expense society attacked by internal or external enemies can only maintain itself at the expense of the security not only of these enemies themselves but even of those in whose protection it is engaged if there are any individuals who perceive not this necessary connexion it is because in this respect as in so many others the wants of today eclipse those of tomorrow all government is only a tissue of sacrifices the best government is that in which the value of these sacrifices is reduced to the smallest amount the practical perfection of security is a quantity which unceasingly tends to approach to the ideal perfection without ever being able to reach it i shall proceed to give a catalogue of those cases in which the sacrifice of some portion of security in respect of property is necessary for the preservation of the greater mass—   general wants of the state for its defence against external enemies   general wants of the state for defence against delinquents or internal enemies   general wants of the state for the prevention of physical calamities   fines at the expense of offenders on account of punishment on account of indemnities in favour of the parties injured   incroachment upon the property of individuals for the development of the powers to be exercised against the above evils by justice by the police by the army   limitations of the rights of property or of the use which each proprietor may make of his own goods in order to prevent his injuring himself or others     chapter xiv cases subject to dispute ought provision for the poor for public worship and the cultivation of the arts and sciences to be ranked among the wants of the state for which provision ought to be made by forced contributions §   of indigence in the highest state of social prosperity the great mass of the citizens will most probably possess few other resources than their daily labour and consequently will always be near to indigence—always liable to fall into its gulf from accident from the revolutions of commerce from natural calamities and especially from disease infancy will always be unable from its own powers to provide the means of subsistence the decays of old age will often destroy these powers the two extremities of life resemble each other in their helplessness and weakness if natural instinct humanity and shame in concurrence with the laws generally secure to infants and old persons the care and protection of their family yet these succours are precarious and those who give them may stand in need of similar succours themselves a numerous family supported in abundance by the labour of a man and his wife may at any moment lose the half of its resources by the death of one of them and lose the whole by the death of both decay is still more badly provided for than childhood the love which descends has more power than that which ascends gratitude is less powerful than instinct hope attaches itself to the feeble beings who are commencing life but has nothing more to say to those who are closing it but even when the aged receive every possible comfort the idea of exchanging the part of a benefactor for that of the recipient of alms pours somewhat of bitterness into favours received especially when from decay the morbid sensibility of the mind has rendered painful changes which would otherwise be indifferent this aspect of society is most painful we picture to ourselves a long train of evils gathering round poverty and followed up by death under its most terrible forms as their ultimate effect we perceive that it is the centre towards which inaction alone makes the lot of every mortal to gravitate man can only rise by continued efforts without which he will fall into this abyss whilst these efforts are not always sufficient and we see the most diligent the most virtuous sometimes sliding into it by a fatal declivity or falling into it from inevitable reverses to put an end to these evils there are only two methods independent of the laws—economy and voluntary contributions if these two resourses were constantly sufficient it would be proper to guard against the interference of the laws for the assistance of the poor the law which offers to poverty an assistance independent of industry is so to speak a law against industry itself or at least against frugality the motive to labour and economy is the pressure of present and the fear of future want the law which takes away this pressure and this fear must be an encouragement to idleness and dissipation this is the reproach which is reasonably brought against the greater number of establishments created for the poor but these two means are insufficient as will appear upon a slight examination with respect to economy if the greatest efforts of industry are insufficient for the daily support of a numerous class still less will they be sufficient to allow of saving for the future others may be able by their daily labour to supply their daily returning wants but these have no superfluity to lay by in store that it may be used when required at a distant time there only remains a third class who can provide for every thing by economizing during the period of labour for the supply of the period in which they can no longer work it is only with respect to this last class that poverty can be esteemed a kind of crime economy it is said is a duty if they have neglected it so much the worse for them misery and death may perhaps await them but they can accuse only themselves besides their catastrophe will not be an evil wholly wasted it will serve as a lesson to prodigals it is a law established by nature—a law which is not like those of men subject to uncertainty and injustice punishment only falls upon the guilty and is proportioned exactly to their fault this severe language would     be justifiable if the object of the law were vengeance but this vengeance itself is condemned by the principle of utility as an impure motive founded upon antipathy again what will be the fruit of these evils this neglect this indigence which you regard in your anger as the just punishment of prodigality are you sure that the victims thus sacrificed will prevent by their example the faults which have led to their suffering such an opinion shows little knowledge of the human heart the distress the death of certain prodigals—of those unhappy persons who have not been able to refuse themselves the infinitely little enjoyments of their condition who have not learnt the painful art of striving by reflection against all the temptations of the moment—their distress i say even their death itself would have little influence as instruction upon the laborious class of society is it possible that this sad spectacle in which shame conceals the greater part of the details should possess like the punishment of malefactors a publicity which should strike the attention and permit no one to be ignorant of its cause would those to whom this lesson was most necessary know how to give to such an event the proper interpretation—would they always recognise the connexion between imprudence as the cause and suffering as the effect might they not attribute this catastrophe to unforeseen accidents which it was impossible to prevent instead of saying behold a man who has been the author of his own losses and whose indigence ought to excite me to labour and economy without relaxation—might it not often be said with an appearance of reason there is an unfortunate person who has taken a thousand useless cares and whose experience proves the vanity of human prudence this would doubtless be bad reasoning but ought an error in logic a simple defect in reflection among a class of men more called to the exercise of their hands than their heads to be punished thus rigorously besides what should be thought of a punishment retarded as to its execution even to the last extremity of life which ought to begin by overcoming at the other extremity that is to say in youth the ascendancy of the most imperious motives how must this pretended lesson be weakened by the distance—how small the analogy between an old and a young man—how little does the example of the one operate upon the other in the youth the idea of immediate good and evil occupies nearly all the sphere of reflection excluding the ideas of distant good and evil if you would act upon him place the motive near him show him for example in perspective a marriage or any other pleasure but a punishment placed at the extreme distance beyond his intellectual horizon is a punishment in pure waste it is sought to guide those who think little and in order to draw instruction from such a misfortune it is requisite that they should think much of what use then i ask is a political instrument distined for the least prudent class if it is of a nature to be efficacious only upon the wise recapitulation—the resource of economy is insufficient— st it is evidently so for those who do not earn a subsistence  dly for those who earn only what is strictly necessary whilst as to the  d class which embraces all those who are not included in the two former economy would not be insufficient of itself but it may become so from the imperfection natural to human prudence let us proceed to the other resource—voluntary contributions this has many imperfections—   its uncertainty it will experience daily vicissitudes according to the fortune and the liberality of the individuals upon whom it depends is it insufficient these conjunctures are marked by misery and death is it superabundant it offers a reward to idleness and profusion   the inequality of the burden this supplement to the wants of the poor is formed entirely at the expense of the most humane of the most virtuous individuals in the society often without proportion to their means whilst the avaricious calumniate the poor in order to colour their refusal with a varnish of system and reason such an arrangement is then a favour granted to egotism and a punishment against humanity the first of virtues i say a punishment for though these contributions bear the name of voluntary what is the motive from which they emanate if it be not founded on a religious or political fear it is a tender but painful sympathy which presides over these acts of generosity it is not the hope of a pleasure which is purchased at this price it is the torment of pity from which we would be set free by this sacrifice hence it has been observed in scotland where indigence is limited to this sad resource that the poor find the greatest assistance among the class the least removed from poverty   the inconveniences of the distribution if these contributions are left to chance as in the giving of alms upon the highway—if they are left to be paid on each occasion without intervention by the individual giving to the individual asking—the uncertainty of the supply is aggravated by another uncertainty how in the multitude of cases shall the degree of merit be appreciated may not the penny of the poor widow only increase the ephemeral treasure of an abandoned woman will many generous hearts be found who with sidney will put back the vivifying cup     from their parched lips saying i can wait—think first of that unfortunate soldier who has more need than i can it be forgotten that in the distribution of these fortuitous gratuities it is not modest virtue it is not honest poverty often silent and bashful which obtains the largest share to be successful upon this obscure theatre management and intrigue are as necessary as in the more brilliant theatre of fashion those who are importunate—who flatter who lie—who mingle according to the occasion boldness and baseness and change their impostures—will obtain success which indigent virtue devoid of artifice and preserving its honour in the midst of its misery will never attain   les vrais talens se taisent et senfuient   découragés des affronts quils essuient   les faux talens sont hardis effrontés   souples adroits et jamais rebutés what voltaire here says of talents may be applied to mendicity in the indiserminate distribution of voluntary contributions the share of honest and virtuous poverty will be seldom equal to that of the impudent and bold beggar shall these contributions be placed in a common fund to be afterwards distributed by chosen individuals this method would be much to be preferred since it permits a regular examination of wants and persons and tends to proportion assistance to them but it has also a tendency to diminish liberality this benefit which must be received at the hand of strangers the application of which i cannot follow from which i do not derive either the pleasure or the immediate merit has something abstract in it which chills the feelings what i give myself i give at the moment when i am moved when the cry of poverty has entered into my heart when there was no one but me to assist it what i contribute to a general collection may not have a destination conformable to my wishes this penny which is much for me and my family to contribute will only be as a drop in the ocean of contribution on the one hand and in the ocean of wants on the other hand it becomes the rich to succour the poor in this manner many will reason and it is on this account that collections succeed better when they are made for a determinate class of individuals than for an indefinite multitude as the whole mass of the poor it is however for this mass that it is necessary to secure permanent assistance from these considerations it appears that it may be laid down as a general principle of legislation that a regular contribution should be established for the wants of indigence it being well understood that those only ought to be regarded as indigent who are in want of necessaries but from this definition it follows that the title of the indigent as indigent is stronger than the title of the proprietor of a superfluity as proprietor since the pain of death which would finally fall upon the neglected indigent will always be a greater evil than the pain of disappointed expectation which falls upon the rich when a limited portion of his superfluity is taken from him with regard to the amount of a legal contribution it ought not to exceed simple necessaries to exceed this would be to punish industry for the benefit of idleness establishments which furnish more than necessaries are only good when supported at the expense of individuals because they can use discretion in the distribution of their assistance and apply it to specific classes the details of the manner of assessing this contribution and distributing its produce belong to political economy in the same manner as inquiries respecting the methods of encouraging the spirit of economy and foresight among the inferior classes of society we have upon this interesting subject instructive memoirs but no treatise which embraces the whole question† it would be necessary to commence with the theory of poverty that is to say by the classification of the indigent and the causes which produce indigence and to proceed to the adoption of precautions and remedies §   of the expense of public worship if the ministers of religion are considered as charged with the maintenance of one of the sanctions of morality the religious sanction the expense of their support ought to be referred to the same head as the expenses of police and justice—to that of internal security they are a body of inspectors and teachers of morals who form so to speak the advanced guard of the law who possess no power over crime but who combat with the vices out of which crimes spring and who render the exercise of authority more rare by maintaining good conduct and subordination if they were charged with all the functions which might suitably be assigned to them such as the education of the inferior classes the promulgation of the laws the promulgation of different public acts the utility of their services would be more manifest     the greater the number of real services they render to the state the less will they be subject to the diseases of dogmas and controversies which are engendered by a desire of distinction and the impossibility of being useful their activity and ambition being directed to useful objects would prevent their becoming mischievous in this respect even those who do not acknowledge the foundations of the religious sanction cannot complain when called upon to contribute to its support since they participate in its advantages but if there be in a country a great diversity of religious professions and the legislator is not bound by a previous establishment or by particular considerations it will be more conformable to liberty and equality to apply to the support of each church the contribution of each religious community the zeal of proselytism on the part of the clergy may it is true in this case be apprehended but it will also be probable that from their reciprocal efforts a useful emulation will result and that by balancing their influence a species of equilibrium will be established in this ocean of opinions otherwise so subject to dangerous tempests an unfortunate case may be imagined that of a people to whom the legislator has denied the public exercise of their religion and at the same time imposed upon them the obligation of supporting a religion which they consider as opposed to their own this would be double violation of security in such a people we must expect to find a sentiment formed of habitual hatred against its government a desire of change a ferocious courage a profound secrecy the people deprived of all the advantages of a public religion of known guides of acknowledged priests would be given up to ignorant and fanatical chiefs and as the support of this worship would be a school of conspiracy the use of an oath instead of being the security of the state would become a source of terror instead of binding the citizens to the government it would unite them against it so that this people would become as formidable from its virtues as its vices §   of the cultivation of the arts and sciences i do not here speak of what may be done for what may be designated the useful arts and sciences no one doubts but that objects of public utility ought to be supported by public contributions but with regard to the cultivation of the fine arts of the embellishment of a country of buildings of luxury of objects of ornament and pleasure—in a word for these works of supererogation ought forced contributions to be levied can the imposition of taxes which have no other than this brilliant but superfluous destination be justified i would not plead here for that which is agreeable in opposition to what is useful† nor justify the starving of the people to give feasts to a court or pensions to buffoons but one or two reflections may be presented by way of apology—   the amount expended and which can be expended upon these objects is commonly but little compared with the mass of necessary contributions if any one should advise that his portion of this superfluous expense should be returned to each person would it not be an impalpable object   this supererogatory part of the taxes being confounded with the mass of those which are necessary its collection is imperceptible it does not excite any distinct sensation which can give rise to any distinct complaint and the evil of the first order being limited to so trifling an amount is not sufficient to produce an evil of the second order   this luxury of pleasure may have a palpable utility by attracting a concourse of foreigners who will spend their money in the country and thus other nations will by degrees be made tributary to that which sways the sceptre of fashion a country fertile in amusements may be considered as a great theatre which is supported in part at the expense of a crowd of spectators attracted from all parts it may even happen that this preeminence in the objects of pleasure of literature and of taste may tend to conciliate to a nation the benevolence of other nations athens which has been called the eye of greece was more than once saved by this sentiment of respect which its superiority of civilization inspired a crown of glory which surrounded this land of the fine arts served for a long time to conceal its weakness and every thing which was not barbarous was interested in the preservation of this city the centre of politeness and mental enjoyment after all it must be acknowledged that this seductive object may be abandoned without risk to the single resource of voluntary contributions at least nothing essential ought to have been neglected before expenses of mere ornament are undertaken comedians     painters architects may be employed when the public credit is satisfied when individuals have been indemnified for the losses occasioned by wars by crimes and physical calamities when the support of the indigent has been provided for until then a preference accorded to these brilliant accessories over these objects of necessity cannot be justified it is even extremely contrary to the interest of the sovereign inasmuch as reproaches are always exaggerated because thought is not required in making them but only passion and temper the extent to which these topics have been employed in our days in certain writings for the purpose of exciting the people against the government of kings is well known but though every thing conspires in this respect to throw princes into the illusion have they fallen into the same excesses with regard to the luxury of amusements as many republics athens at the period of its greatest dangers disregarding equally the eloquence of demosthenes and the threats of philip recognised a want more pressing than its defence—an object more essential than the maintenance of its liberty the greatest neglect of duty consisted in diverting even for the good of the state the funds destined for the use of a theatre and at rome the passion for shows was carried almost to madness it became necessary to waste the treasures of the world and to strip the subject nations in order to captivate the suffrages of the majesty of the people terror was spread through a whole country because a proconsul had to give a fête at rome one hour of the glories of the circus threw a hundred thousand of the inhabitants of the provinces into despair chapter xv examples of attacks upon security it will not be useless to give some examples of what i call attacks upon security it will be a means of more clearly exhibiting the principle and of showing that what is called unjust in morals cannot be innocent in politics nothing has been more common than to authorize under one name that which would be odious under the other i cannot refrain from noticing here the ill effects of one branch of classical education youth are accustomed from their earliest days to see in the history of the roman people public acts of injustice atrocious in themselves always coloured under specious names always accompanied by a pompous eulogium respecting roman virtues the abolition of debts occupies a conspicuous place in the early transactions of the republic a return of the people to mount a ventine obliged the senate to pass the sponge over all the rights of creditors the historian excites all our interest in favour of the fraudulent debtors who discharged their debts by a bankruptcy and does not fail to render those odious who were thus despoiled by an act of violence what end was answered by this iniquity the usury which had served as a pretext for this theft was only augmented on the morrow by this catastrophe for the exorbitant rate of interest was only the price paid for the risks attached to the uncertainty of engagements the foundation of their colonies has been boasted of as the work of a profound policy it consisted always in stripping the legitimate proprietors in a conquered country in order to create establishments of favour or reward this exercise of power so cruel in its immediate effects was disastrous also in its consequences the romans accustomed to violate all the rights of property knew not where to stop in this course from hence arose that perpetual demand for a new division of the lands which was the perpetual firebrand of the seditious which contributed under the triumvirs to a dreadful system of general confiscations the history of the grecian republics is full of facts of the same kind always presented in a plausible manner and calculated to mislead superficial minds how has reasoning been abused respecting the division of the lands carried into effect by lycurgus to serve as a foundation of his warrior institution in which through the most striking inequality all the rights were on one side and all the servitude on the other the attacks upon security which have found so many officious defenders when made by the greeks and romans have not experienced the same indulgence when they have been made by the monarchs of the east the despotism of a single person has nothing seducing because it too evidently refers to himself alone and because there are a million chances of suffering to one of enjoying but the despotism exercised by the multitude deceives feeble minds by a false image of public good they place themselves in imagination among the great number who command instead of supposing themselves among the small number who give up and who suffer leaving therefore the sultans and viziers in peace we may reckon that their injustices will not be coloured by the flatteries of historians     their reputation serves as an antidote to their example for the same reason we need not insist upon such attacks as national bankruptcies but we may remark in passing a singular effect of fidelity to engagements with respect to the authority even of the sovereign in england since the revolution the engagements of the state have always been sacred hence the individuals who have treated with the government have never required any other pledge than their mortgage upon the revenue and the collection of the revenue has remained in the hands of the king in france under the monarchy the violations of the public faith were so frequent that those who made advances to the government were for a long time in the habit of themselves collecting the taxes and paying themselves with their own hands but their intervention was costly to the people whom they had no interest in sparing and still more to the king whom they robbed of the affection of his people when the announcement of a deficiency alarmed all the creditors of the state this class so interested in england in the maintenance of the government in france showed itself desirous of a revolution each one believed he saw his security in taking from the sovereign the administration of the finances and placing it in the hands of a national council in what manner the event corresponded with their hopes is well known but it is not the less interesting to observe that the downfal of this monarchy which appeared immoveable was owing in the first instance to mistrust founded upon many violations of public faith but amid so many attacks upon security made through ignorance from inadvertency or from false reasons we shall content ourselves with pointing out a few—   we may consider under this point of view all misseated taxes for example disproportioned taxes which spare the rich to the prejudice of the poor the weight of this evil is further aggravated by a feeling of injustice when one is obliged to pay more than would be required if all others interested paid in the same proportion statute labour is the height of inequality when it falls upon those who have only their hands for their patrimony taxes levied upon uncertain funds upon persons who may not have wherewith to pay the evil then takes another direction the individual being unable to pay the tax on account of his indigence finds himself subject to graver evils instead of the inconveniences of the tax the sufferings of privation are experienced for this reason a capitation tax is bad because a man has a head it does not follow that he has any thing else taxes which restrain trade monopolies close corporations the true method of estimating these taxes is not by considering what they yield but what they prevent the acquisition of taxes upon the necessaries of life which may be followed by physical privations diseases and even death itself and no one perceive the cause these sufferings caused by an error in government become confounded with natural evils which cannot be prevented taxes upon the sale of lands alienated during life it is want in general which leads to these sales and the exchequer by intervening at this period of distress levies an extraordinary fine upon an unfortunate individual taxes upon public sales upon goods sold by auction here the distress is clearly proved it is extreme and the fiscal injustice is manifest taxes upon law proceedings these include all kinds of attacks upon security since they amount to a refusal of the protection of the law to all those who cannot pay for them they consequently offer a hope of impunity to crime the criminal has only to choose for the object of his injustice individuals who cannot afford to furnish the advances for a judicial suit or to run its risks   the forced raising of the value of money another attack upon security this is a bankruptcy since it is not paying all that is due a fraudulent bankruptcy since there is a semblance of payment and an unskilful fraud since it deceives no one it is also proportionably an abolition of debts for the theft that the prince practises upon his creditors he authorizes every debtor to practise upon his own without producing any advantage to the public treasury is this course of injustice accomplished the operation after having weakened confidence ruined the honest citizens enriched the rogues deranged commerce disturbed the system of taxes and caused a thousand evils to individuals does not leave the least advantage to the government which is dishonoured by it expense and receipt are all altered in the same proportions   forced reduction of the rate of interest viewed as a question of political economy the reduction of the rate of interest by a law is an injury to the public wealth because it acts as a prohibition of particular premiums for the importation of foreign capital it acts as a prohibition in many cases of new branches of commerce and even of old ones if the legal rate of interest be not sufficient to balance the risks of the capitalists but viewed in relation to the more immediate question of security it is to take from the lenders to give to the borrowers when the rate of interest is reduced a fifth the effect as to the lenders is the same as if they   0 were every year stripped by robbers of the fifth part of their fortune if the legislator find it good to take from a particular class of citizens a fifth of their revenue why should he stop there—why not take another fifth—and yet another if this first reduction answer its end the last reduction will answer it in the same proportion and if the measure be good in the one case why should it be bad in the other when he stops he ought to have a reason for stopping but the reason which would hinder him from taking the second step ought to be sufficient to prevent his taking the first this operation resembles an act by which the rent of land should be diminished under pretence that the proprietors are useless consumers and the farmers productive labourers if you shake the principle of security as to one class of citizens you shake it as to all the bundle of concord is its emblem   general confiscations i refer to this head those vexations exercised upon a sect upon a party upon a class of men under the vague pretence of some political offence in such manner that the imposition of the confiscation is pretended to be employed as a punishment when in truth the crime is only a pretence for the imposition of the confiscation history presents many examples of such robberies the jews have often been the object of them they were too rich not to be always culpable the financiers the farmers of the revenue for the same reason were subjected to what were called burning chambers when the succession to the throne was unsettled every body at the death of the sovereign might become culpable and the spoils of the vanquished formed a treasury of reward in the hands of the successor in a republic torn by factions one half of the nation became rebels in the eyes of the other half when the system of confications was admitted the parties as was the case at rome alternately devoured each other the crimes of the powerful and especially the crimes of the popular party in democracies have always found apologists the greater part of these large fortunes it has been said have been founded in injustice and that was only restored to the public which had been stolen from the public to reason in this manner is to open an unlimited career to tyranny it is to allow it to presume the crime instead of proving it by means of this logic it is impossible to be rich and to be innocent ought so grave a punishment as confiscation to be inflicted by wholesale without examination without detail without proof a procedure which would be deemed atrocious if it were employed against a single person—does it become lawful when employed against an entire class of citizens can the evil which is done be disregarded because there is a multitude of sufferers whose cries are confounded together in their common shipwreck to despoil the great proprietors upon pretence that some one of their ancestors acquired their wealth by unjust methods is to bombard a city because it is suspected that it encloses some thieves   dissolution of monastic orders and convents the decree for their abolition was signed by reason itself but its execution ought not to have been abandoned to prejudice and avarice it would have been enough to prohibit these societies from receiving new members they would thus have been gradually abolished individuals would not have suffered any privation the successive savings might have been applied to useful objects and philosophy would have applauded an operation excellent in principle and gentle in execution but this slow proceeding is not that followed by avarice it seems that the sovereigns in dissolving these societies have sought to punish the individuals for wrongs which they had received from the societies instead of considering them as orphans and invalids who deserved all the compassion of the legislator they looked upon them as enemies who were treated with favour when though reduced from opulence they were allowed simple necessaries   suppression of places and pensions without indemnifying the individuals who had possessed them this kind of attack upon security deserves more particular mention because instead of being blamed as an injustice it is often approved as an act of good government and economy envy is never more at ease than when it is able to conceal itself under the mask of the public good but the public good only demands the reform of useless places—it does not demand the misery of the individuals holding the place reformed the principle of security requires that in all reforms the indemnity should be complete the only benefit that can be legitimately derived from them is limited to the conversion of perpetual into transitory charges is it said that the immediate suppression of these places is a gain to the public it would be a sophism the sum in question would without doubt considered in itself be a gain if it came from abroad if it were gained by commerce c but it is not a gain when drawn from the hands of certain individuals who form a part of the public would a family be enriched because the father had taken every thing from one of his children the better to endow the others but even in this case the stripping of one son would increase the inheritance of his brothers the     evil would not be pure loss it would produce some portion of good but when it refers to the public the profit of a suppressed place is divided among all whilst the loss presses altogether upon a single person the profit spread among the multitude divides itself into impalpable parts the whole loss is felt by him who supports it alone the result of the operation is in no respect to enrich the the party who gains but to impoverish him who loses instead of one place suppressed suppose a thousand ten thousand a hundred thousand the total disadvantage remains the same the spoil taken from thousands of individuals must be divided among millions your public places would every where present you with unfortunate citizens whom you would have plunged into indigence whilst you would scarcely see a single individual sensibly enriched by these cruel operations the groans of sorrow and the cries of despair would resound on all sides the shouts of joy if there were any such would not be the expression of happiness but of the antipathy which rejoices in the misery of its victims ministers of kings and of the people it is not by the misery of individuals that you can procure the happiness of nations the altar of the public good does not demand more barbarous sacrifices than that of the divinity i cannot yet quit this subject it appears so essential for the establishment of the principle of security to trace the error into all its retreats how do individuals deceive themselves or others with regard to such great injustice they have recourse to certain pompous maxims in which there is a mixture of truth and falsehood and which give to a question in itself simple an air of profundity and political mystery the interest of individuals it is said ought to give way to the public interest but what does this mean is not one individual as much a part of the public as another this public interest which you personify is only an abstract term it represents only the mass of the interests of indiduals they ought all to be taken account of instead of considering some as every thing and the rest as nothing if it be proper to sacrifice the fortune of one individual in order to augment the fortune of others it would be still better to sacrifice a second a third even a hundred even a thousand without it being possible to assign any limits for whatever may be the number of those you have sacrificed you always have the same reason for adding one more in a word the interest of the first is sacred or the interest of no one can be so individual interests are the only real interests take care of individuals never injure them or suffer them to be injured and you will have done enough for the public can it be conceived that there are men so absurd as to love posterity better than the present generation to prefer the man who is not to him who is to torment the living under pretence of promoting the happiness of those who are not born and who may never be born in a multitude of occasions the men who suffer by the operation of any law have not dared to make themselves heard or have not been listened to on account of this obscure and false notion that private interest ought to give way to the public interest but if this were a question of generosity who ought the rather to exercise it all towards one or one towards all who then is the greatest egotist—he who desires to preserve what he has or he who wishes to take and even to seize by force that which belongs to another an injury felt and a benefit not felt such is the result of these fine operations in which the interest of individuals is sacrificed to that of the public i conclude by a grand general consideration the more the principle of property is respected the more is it strengthened in the minds of the people small attacks upon this principle prepare for greater it has required a long period to attain to the point at which we have arrived in civilized society but fatal experience has shown with what facility security may be overturned and how the savage instinct of robbery may assume an ascendancy over the laws the people and governments are in this respect only like tame lions if they taste blood their natural ferocity is rekindled—   si torrida parvus   venit in ora cruor redeunt rabiesque furorque   admonitæque tument guscato sanguine fauces   fervet et à trepido vix abstinet ira magistro   lucan iv   chapter xvi of forced exchanges according to xenophon astyages once asked of cyrus an account of his last lesson there was said he in our school a great boy who having a little coat gave it to one of his companions who was of small stature and took from him his coat which was larger our master having made me the judge in this quarrel i decided that things should be left as they were and that the one and the other would thus be better accommodated in this respect upon which he showed me that i had decided wrongly for i had only considered what was fitting whilst i ought in the first place to have provided for what was just which would not allow any one to be forced with regard to what belonged to him montaignes essays book   ch        let us see what ought to be thought of this decision at the first glance it seems that a forced exchange is not contrary to security provided that an equal value is received how can i have lost in consequence of the law if after it has had its full effect the mass of my fortune remain the same as before if one has gained without another having lost the operation appears good no it is not he whom you consider to have lost nothing by the forced exchange has really experienced a loss as all things moveable and immoveable may have different values to different persons according to circumstances every one expects to enjoy the favourable chances which may augment the value of any part of his property if the house which peter occupies is of greater value to paul than to peter this would not be a good reason for gratifying paul by obliging peter to give it up to him for what might be of the same value to him this would be to deprive peter of the natural benefit which he might have expected to derive from this circumstance but if paul should say that for the benefit of peace he has offered a price above the ordinary value of the house and that his adversary only refuses from obstinacy it may be replied to him this surplus that you pretend to have offered is only a supposition on your part the contrary supposition is just as probable for if you have offered more than the house is worth he would have hastened to seize so fortunate a circumstance which might never recur and the bargain would have soon been concluded to his satisfaction if he does not accept it it is a proof that you have been deceived in the estimation you have made and that if you take his house from him upon the conditions you have proposed his fortune will be injured if not with reference to what he possesses at least with reference to what he has a right to require no replies paul he knows that my valuation is higher than any he can expect in the ordinary course of things but he knows my necessity and he refuses a reasonable offer in order to derive an abusive advantage from my situation the following principle may serve to remove the difficulty between peter and paul things may be distinguished into two classes those which have commonly only an intrinsic value and those which are susceptible of a value in affection ordinary houses a field cultivated in an ordinary manner a stack of corn or hay the common productions of manufactures appear to belong to this first class to the second may be referred a pleasuregarden a library statues pictures collections of natural history as to objects of this kind the exchange ought never to be forced it is not possible to appreciate the value that the feeling of affection may give them but objects of the first class may be subjected to forced exchanges if this be the only method of preventing great losses i possess an estate of considerable value to which i can only go by a road which borders on a river the river overflows and destroys the road my neighbour obstinately refuses me a passage over a strip of land which is not worth one hundredth part of my estate ought i to lose all my benefit from the caprice or the enmity of an unreasonable man but to prevent the abuse of so delicate a principle it would be proper to lay down strict rules i say then that exchanges may be forced in order to prevent great loss as in the case of land rendered inaccessible unless a passage is taken across that of a neighbour it is in england that all the scruples of the legislator in this respect should be observed in order to understand all the respect which ought to be borne to property is a new road to be opened in the first place an act of parliament is necessary and all the parties interested are heard afterwards the assignment of an equitable indemnity only to the proprietors is not considered sufficient but with regard to objects which may possess a value in affection such as houses and gardens they are protected against the law itself by being recognised as exceptions these operations may also be justified when the obstinacy of an individual or a small number of persons is manifestly injurious to the advantage of a great number it is thus that the inclosure of commons in england is not stopped by certain oppositions and that for the convenience and salubrity of towns the sale of houses is often forced by law the question discussed here relates only to forced exchanges and not to forcible removals for a removal which should not be an exchange—a removal without an equivalent were it even for the profit of the state would be a pure injustice an act of power devoid of the softening necessary to reconcile it with the principle of utility chapter xvii power of the laws over expectation the legislator is not the master of the dispositions of the human heart he is only their interpreter and their servant the goodness of his laws depends upon their conformity to the general expectation it is highly necessary therefore for him rightly to understand the direction of this expectation for the purpose of acting in concert with it such is the object in view let us proceed to the examination     of the conditions necessary for its accomplishment   the first of these conditions but at the same time the most difficult to be attained is that the laws may be anterior to the formation of the expectation if we could suppose a new people a generation of children the legislator finding no expectations formed which could oppose his views might fashion them at his pleasure as the sculptor fashions a block of marble but as there already exists among all people a multitude of expectations founded upon ancient laws or ancient usages the legislator is obliged to employ a system of conciliations and concessions which constantly restrain him the first laws themselves have always found some expectations formed for we have seen that before the laws there existed a feeble kind of property that is to say a certain expectation of keeping what each one had acquired hence the laws have received their first direction from these anterior expectations they have given birth to new ones they have excavated the bed in which desires and hopes have flowed it is no longer possible to make any change in the laws of property without more or less disturbing the established current and without its opposing a greater or less resistance do you wish to establish a law in opposition to the actual expectations of men if it is possible let it begin to have effect at a distant period the present generation will perceive no change and the rising generation will be all prepared for it you will find among its youth auxiliaries against the ancient opinions you will not injure existing interests because they will have leisure to prepare for the new order of things every thing will become smooth before you because you will have prevented the birth of expectations which would have been opposed to you   second condition—let the laws be known a law which is unknown can have no effect upon expectation it does not serve to prevent an opposite expectation this condition it may be said does not depend upon the nature of the law but upon the measures taken for its promulgation these measures may be sufficient for their object whatever may be the law this reasoning is more specious than true there are some laws naturally more easily understood than others such are laws conformable to expectations already formed laws which repose upon natural expectations this natural expectation this expectation produced by early habit may be founded upon superstition upon a hurtful prejudice or upon a sentiment of utility this is of no importance the law which is conformed to it maintains its place in the mind without effort it was there so to speak before it was promulgated it was there before it received the sanction of the legislator but a law opposed to this natural expectation is understood with much greater difficulty and is with still greater difficulty imprinted upon the memory it is another disposition of things which always presents itself to the mind whilst the new law altogether strange and without roots tends incessantly to slip from the place in which it is only artificially fixed codes of ritual observances among others possess this inconvenience that their fantastic and arbitrary rules never being well known fatigue the understanding and the memory and the subject of them always fearing always at fault always fancying himself morally diseased can never reckon upon his innocence and lives in want of perpetual absolutions natural expectation directs itself towards the laws which are most important to society and the foreigner who should be guilty of theft fraud or assassination would not be permitted to plead his ignorance of the laws of the country because he could not but have known that acts so manifestly hurtful were every where considered as crimes   third condition—that the laws should be consistent with themselves this principle has a close relation with the preceding one but it will serve to place a great truth in a new light when the laws have established a certain arrangement upon a principle generally admitted every arrangement in conformity with this principle will naturally be conformable to the general expectation—every analogous law is so to speak presumed beforehand every new application of the principle contributes to strengthen it but a law which does not possess this character dwells alone as it were in the mind and the influence of the principle to which it is opposed is a power which incessantly tends to expel it from the memory that at the death of a man his goods should be transmitted to his nearest relations is a rule generally admitted to which expectations naturally direct themselves a law respecting successions which should be consistent with this rule would obtain general approbation and would be understood by every mind but the more this principle is disregarded by the admission of exceptions the more difficult it will be to comprehend and to retain them the common law of england offers a striking example it is so complicated with regard to the descent of property it admits distinctions so singular the previous decisions which serve to regulate it are so subtilized that not only is it impossible for simple good sense to presume them it is also difficult for it to comprehend them it is a study profound as that of the most abstract sciences it belongs only to a     small number of privileged men it has been necessary even for them to subdivide themselves for no one lawyer pretends to understand the whole such has been the fruit of a too superstitious respect for antiquity when new laws happen to oppose a principle established by former laws the stronger this principle is the more hateful appears the inconsistency there results a contradiction of opinions and the disappointed expectant accuses the legislator of tyrrany in turkey when a man in office dies the sultan appropriates to himself all his fortune at the expense of his children who fall at once from opulence to misery this law which overturns all the natural expectations is probably derived from certain other eastern governments in which it is less inconsistent and less odious because the sovereign only confers office upon eunuchs   fourth condition—it is only possible to make laws truly consistent by following the principle of utility this is the general point of union for all expectations still a law conformed to utility may be found opposed to public opinion but this is only an accidental and transient circumstance it is only necessary to render this conformity sensible in order to bring back all minds as soon as the veil which hides it is withdrawn expectation will be satisfied and public opinion reconciled but the more it is certain that the laws are conformed to utility the more manifest will that utility become if a quality be attributed to a subject which does not possess it the triumph of this error may not endure for a day a single ray of light is sufficient to dissipate the illusion but a quality which really exists though unknown may be happily discovered at any instant at the first moment an innovation is surrounded by an impure atmosphere a collection of clouds formed by caprice and prejudice floats around it its form is distorted by the refractions caused by these deceptive mediums it requires time for the eye to fix itself and to separate from the object every thing which is foreign to it but by degrees just views will gain the ascendency if the first efforts are not successful the second attempts will be more fortunate because the point of difficulty to be overcome will be better known the plan which favours the greatest number of interests cannot fail at last to obtain the greatest number of suffrages and the useful novelty at first repelled with disgust will soon become so familiar that its beginning will not be recollected   fifth condition—method in the laws an error in form in a code of law may produce with respect to its influence upon expectation the same inconvenience as incoherence and inconsistency there may result from it the same difficulty of comprehension and retention every man has his determinate measure of understanding the more complex the law the greater the number of those who cannot understand it hence it will be less known it will have less hold upon men it will not occur to their minds on the occasions on which it ought or what is still worse it will deceive them and give birth to false expectations both the style and arrangement ought to be simple the law should be a manual of instruction for every individual and he ought to be able to consult it under all his doubts without requiring an interpreter the more conformable laws are to the principle of utility the more simple will be their systematic arrangement a system founded upon a single principle might be as simple in its form as in its foundation it only is susceptible of a natural arrangement and a familiar nomenclature   sixth condition—for the purpose of overcoming expectation it is also necessary that the law should be present to the mind as about to be executed or at least no reason should be perceived to lead to a contrary presumption does a man hope easily to escape from the law he forms an expectation in a manner opposed to the law the law is therefore useless it only retains its force for the purpose of punishment and these inefficacious punishments are another evil with which to reproach the law despicable in its weakness hateful in its strength it is always bad whether it reach the guilty or they enjoy impunity this principle has been often disregarded in a striking manner for example when under the banking system of the projector law people were prohibited from retaining in their own hands more than a certain sum of money every one presumed upon a successful disobedience to this law a multitude of prohibitory commercial laws are defective in this respect this multitude of easily eluded regulations forms so to speak an immoral lottery in which individuals speculate in opposition to the legislature this principle forms a good reason for placing the domestic authority in the hands of the husband if it had been given to the wife the physical power being on the one side and the legal power on the other side discord would have been eternal if equality had been established between them this nominal equality could not have been maintained because between two opposite wills one or the other must necessarily turn the scale the subsisting arrangement is therefore most favourable to the peace of families because by making both powers to act in     concert every thing has been done which is necessary for its exercise this same principle will be very useful in assisting in the resolution of some problems which have too much embarrassed lawyers such as this in a certain case ought a thing found to be considered the property of the finder the more easily he can appropriate the thing independently of the law the more desirable is it not to make a law which shall disappoint this expectation or in other words the more easy it is to elude the law the more cruel would it be to make a law which appearing to the mind almost incapable of execution could not fail to produce evil when it should chance to be executed let us illustrate this by an example suppose i find a diamond in the earth my first movement will be to say this is mine and the expectation of keeping it will naturally be formed at the same moment not only from the inclination of the desires but also from analogy with the habitual ideas of property  st i have possession of it and this possession alone is a good title when there is no opposite title  dly its discovery is due to me it is i who have drawn this diamond from the dust in which it was unknown to all the world and where it was of no value  dly i may flatter myself with keeping it without the knowledge of the law and in opposition to the laws themselves because it will be enough if i can hide it till i have a pretence for making it to be believed that i have acquired it by some other title hence when the law would dispose of it in favour of some other person than me it does not hinder this first movement this hope of keeping it and therefore by taking it from me it makes me experience that pain of disappointed expectation which is commonly called injustice or tyranny this reason would therefore be sufficient for giving a thing found to the finder unless there be a stronger opposite reason this rule might therefore vary according to the chance which the thing naturally presents of its being kept without the knowledge of the laws a vessel shipwrecked that i have been the first to discover upon the shore—a mine—an island that i may have discovered are objects respecting which a previous law might prevent in me all idea of property because it is not possible for me to appropriate them in secret the law which refuses them to me being of easy execution would have its full and entire effect upon my mind therefore upon consulting this principle alone the legislator would be at liberty either to grant or refuse the thing to the author of the discovery but there is one particular reason in his favour it is a reward given to industry it tends to augment the general wealth if all the profit of a discovery went into the public treasure this all would be but little   the seventh and last condition for regulating expectation is that the laws should be literally understood this condition depends in part upon the laws and in part upon the judges if the laws are not in harmony with the intelligence of the people—if the laws of a barbarous age are not changed in an age of civilization the tribunals will depart by degrees from the ancient principles and insensibly substitute new maxims hence will arise a kind of combat between the law which grows old and the custom which is introduced and in consequence of this uncertainty a weakening of the power of the laws over expectation to interpret has signified entirely different things in the mouth of a lawyer and in the mouth of another person to interpret a passage of an author is to show the meaning which he had in his mind to interpret a law in the sense of a roman lawyer is to neglect the clearly expressed intention in order to substitute some other by presuming that this new sense was the actual intention of the legislator with this manner of proceeding there is no security when the law is difficult obscure incoherent the citizen has always a chance of knowing it it gives a blind warning less efficacious than it might be but always useful the limits of the evil which may be suffered are at least perceived but when the judge dares to arrogate to himself the power of interpreting the laws that is to say of substituting his will for that of the legislator every thing is arbitrary—no one can foresee the course which his caprice may take it is not enough to regard this evil in itself alone how great soever it may be this is a trifle in comparison of the weight of its consequences the serpent it is said can cause its whole body to enter at the opening through which its head will pass with regard to legal tyranny it is against this subtle head that we should guard for fear of shortly seeing displayed in its train all its tortuous folds it is not only evil which should be distrusted but good also if derived from this source all usurpation of a power superior to the law though useful in its immediate effects ought to be an object of dread for the future there are limits and narrow limits to the good which may result from this arbitrary power there are none to the evil there are none to the alarm which may arise from it the danger indistinctly lowers over every head without speaking of ignorance and caprice what facilities for prevarication the judge sometimes by conforming to the law sometimes by becoming its interpreter may always give right or wrong to whom he pleases he     is always sure to save himself either by the literal or by the interpretative sense he is a conjuror who to the great astonishment of the spectators draws from the same fountain bitter waters or sweet as he pleases this is one of the noblest characteristics of the english tribunals they have generally followed the declared will of the legislator with scrupulous fidelity or have directed themselves as far as possible by previous judgments with regard to that still imperfect portion of legislation which depends on custom this rigid observation of the laws may have had some inconveniences in an incomplete system but it is the true spirit of liberty which inspires the english with so much horror for what is called an ex post facto law all the conditions which constitute the excellence of the laws have so close a connexion that the accomplishment of one alone supposes the accomplishment of the others intrinsic utility manifest utility connexion simplicity cognoscibility probability of execution—all these qualities may be considered as reciprocally cause and effect the one of the others if the obscure system called custom were no longer suffered to exist and the whole law were reduced to writing—if the laws which concern every individual were collected in one volume and those which concerned certain classes were in separate collections—if the general code were universally circulated—if it were made as among the jews a portion of the religious service one of the manuals of education—if it were required to be engraven upon the memory before admission to the exercise of political privileges—the laws would then become truly known every deviation from them would be sensible every citizen would be their guardian there would be no mystery to conceal them—no monopoly in their explanation—no fraud or chicane to elude them it is also necessary that the style of the laws should be as simple as their arrangement that the language in ordinary use should be employed that their formulas should have no scientific apparatus and in a word that if the style of the book of the laws were distinguished from the style of other books it should be by its superior perspicuity—by its greater precision—by its greater familiarity because it is intended to be understood by all and particularly by those least enlightened when one has formed a conception of this system of laws and comes to compare it with those that exist the feeling which results is far from being favourable to our existing institutions we must however distrust grievous declamations and exaggerated complaints though the laws may be imperfect he who should be so confined in his views or so unreasonable in his ideas of reform as to seek to inspire revolt or contempt against the general system of the laws would be unworthy of attention at the tribunal of an enlightened public who can enumerate their benefits—i do not say under the best but under the worst of governments do we not owe to them all that we possess of security property trade abundance do they not preserve peace among our fellowcitizens the sanctity of marriage and the gentle perpetuity of families the good which they produce is universal—it is enjoyed every day and every moment the evils which result from them are transitory but the good does not make itself felt it is enjoyed without being referred to its source as if it were in the ordinary course of nature whilst the evils are vividly perceived and in describing them there is accumulated into one moment and upon one point sufferings which are dispersed over a large space and a long tract of time there are abundant reasons for loving the laws notwithstanding their imperfections innovations in the laws should be made with great caution it is not well to destroy everything upon pretence of reconstructing the whole the fabric of the laws may be easily dilapidated but is difficult to be repaired and its alteration ought not to be entrusted to rash and ignorant operators part ii chapter i of titles which confer a right to property thus far we have shown the reasons which should lead the legislator to sanction the existence of property but we have only considered wealth in the mass it is however necessary to descend to details to take the individual objects which compose it and seek out the principles which ought to govern the distribution of property at the periods when it presents itself to the law for appropriation to such or such an individual these principles are the same that we have already laid down subsistence abundance equality security when they accord the     decision is easy when they separate it is necessary to learn to distinguish which ought to be preferred   actual possession actual possession is a title to property which may precede and supply the place of all others it will be always good against every man who has no other title to oppose to it arbitrarily to take away from him who possesses in order to give to him who possesses not would be to create a loss upon one side and a gain upon the other but the amount of the pleasure would not be equal to the amount of the pain first reason—one such act of violence would spread alarm among all proprietors by attacking their security second reason—actual possession therefore is a title founded upon the good of the first order and the good of the second order what is called the right of the first occupant or the original discoverer amounts to the same thing when the right of property is granted to the first occupant— st he is spared the pain of disappointment that pain which he would feel at finding himself deprived of the thing which he had occupied before all others  dly it prevents contests the combats which might take place between him and successive competitors  dly it gives birth to enjoyments which without it would not exist for any one the first occupier trembling lest he should lose what he had found would not dare openly to enjoy it for fear of betraying himself hence all that he could not immediately consume would be of no value to him  thly the good that is secured to him acting in the character of reward becomes a spur to the industry of others who are led to seek to procure for themselves similar advantages and the increase of the general wealth is the result of these individual acquisitions  thly if every unappropriated thing did not belong to the first occupier it would always be the prey of the strongest the weak would be subject to continual oppression all these reasons do not present themselves distinctly to the minds of men but they perceive them confusedly and feel them as by instinct hence they say reason equity justice direct it these words repeated by every body without being explained by any one express only a sentiment of approbation but this approbation founded upon solid reasons can but acquire new force from the support of the principle of utility the title of original occupation has been the primitive foundation of property it may be employed again with regard to newlyformed islands or lands newly discovered reservation being made of the right of governing—the superior right of the sovereign   ancient bonâ fide possession possession of a certain standing fixed by the law ought to be superior to all other titles if you have allowed so long a time to elapse without claiming your right it is a proof that you have not known of its existence or that you did not intend to make use of it in these two cases there has not been any attempt on your part—any desire to obtain possession of the thing but on mine there has been the attempt and the desire to preserve it to leave me in possession is not to oppose security to transfer it to you is to attack it and is to make all possessors uneasy who know of no other title to their property than ancient bonâ fide possession but what time should be requisite to produce this displacement of hope or in other words what time is requisite to legalize property in the hands of its possessors and to extinguish all opposing titles nothing can be precisely determined the lines of demarcation must be drawn at hazard according to the value of the goods to which they refer if this line of demarcation does not always prevent disappointment among those interested it will prevent at least all evils of the second order the law warns me that if during one year ten years or thirty years i neglect to claim my right the loss of this right itself will be the result of my negligence this threat the effects of which i can prevent does not injure my security i have supposed that the possession is honestly obtained in the contrary case to confirm it would be not to favour security but to reward crime the age of nestor ought not to be sufficient to secure to an usurper the wages and the price of his iniquity for why should there be a period when the malefactor should become tranquil why should he enjoy the fruits of his crimes under the protection of the laws which he has violated with respect to his heirs it is necessary to make distinctions are they honest there may be alleged in their favour the same reason as for the ancient proprietor and they have possession besides to incline the balance in their favour are they dishonest as their predecessors were they are his accomplices and impunity ought never to be the privilege of fraud second title—ancient bonâ fide possession notwithstanding opposite title this is what is commonly called prescription—reasons upon which it is founded prevention of disappointment—general security of proprietors   possession of the contents and of the produce of land property in land includes all that this land     contains and all that it produces can its value be any thing but its contents and its produce by its contents are understood every thing which is below the surface as mines and quarries by its produce every thing which belongs to the vegetable kingdom all possible reasons unite for the giving this extent to the right of property in land—security subsistence the increase of the general wealth the blessing of peace   possession of what the land nourishes and of what it receives if my land nourish animals it is to me they owe their birth and their nourishment their existence would have been a loss to me if the possession of them did not secure me an indemnity if the law give them to any one but me there will be all the loss on one side and all the gain on another—an arrangement opposed as well to equality as to security it would then be my interest to diminish their number and to prevent their increase to the detriment of the general wealth if chance have thrown upon the earth things which have not yet received the seal of property or which have lost the impression as a whale cast on shore by a tempest the scattered remains of a shipwreck or uprooted trees these things ought to belong to the possessor of the land the reason of this preference—he is so situated as to derive a profit from them without loss to any individual they cannot be refused to him without occasioning a pain of disappointment and indeed no one can take possession of them without occupying his land or without encroaching upon his rights he has in his favour all the reasons of the first occupant   possession of neighbouring lands the waters which have covered unappropriated lands leave them—to whom shall the property in these new lands be granted there are many reasons for giving them to the proprietors of the neighbouring lands  st they only can occupy them without encroaching upon the property of others  d they only can have formed any hope respecting these lands and previously considered them as belonging to themselves  d the chance of gaining by the retreat of the waters is only an indemnity for the chance of losing by their invasion  th the property in lands acquired from the waters will operate as a reward exciting to the labours necessary for this kind of conquest   amelioration of ones own things if i apply my labour to one of those things which are already considered as belonging to me my title acquires new force these vegetables which my land produces—i have sown and gathered them i have tended these cattle i have dug up these roots i have felled these trees and i have hewn them if i should have suffered on having these things taken from me in a rough state how much more shall i not suffer now since each effort of my industry has given to these objects a new value has strengthened my attachment to them and the wish i have to keep them these sources of future enjoyments continually augmented by labour would not exist without security   mutual possession and bonâ fide amelioration but if i apply my labour to a thing which belongs to another treating it as if it were my own for example if i have made cloth with your wool to which of us ought the thing produced to belong before answering this question the question of fact must be cleared up was it honestly or dishonestly that i treated the thing as my property if i have acted dishonestly to leave me possessed of the thing produced would be to reward the crime if i have acted honestly it remains to be examined which of the two values is the greater—the original value of the thing or the value added to it by the labour how long has the first possessor lost it how long have i possessed it to whom does the place belong in which it is found situated at the moment it is reclaimed—to me to the ancient possessor or to another the principle of caprice having no regard to the measure of pains and pleasures gives all to one of the parties without caring for the other the principle of utility desirous of reducing to the lowest term an inevitable inconvenience weighs the two interests seeks a method of reconciling them and prescribes indemnities it awards the article to that one of the two claimants who would lose the most if his claim were rejected but subject to the charge of giving to the other a sufficient indemnity it is after these same principles that the same question ought to be resolved with regard to an article which has been mixed and confounded with another as metal belonging     to you which has been mingled in the crucible with metal belonging to me liquor belonging to me which has been poured into the same vessel with liquor belonging to you there have been grand debates among the roman lawyers to determine to whom to give the whole the one party under the name of sabinians would give the whole to me the other party under the name of proculians would give all to you which was right neither of them their decision always left one suffering party one simple question would have prevented all these debates which of the two by losing what had been his would lose most the english lawyers have cut the gordian knot they have not taken the trouble to examine where would be the greatest injury they have neither considered honesty nor dishonesty nor the greatest real value nor the greatest desire to keep they have decided that moveable property shall always be awarded to the possessor at the time subject to the charge of indemnifying the original proprietor   exploring of mines in the lands of another your land incloses in its bosom treasures but either from want of knowledge or want of means or want of confidence in your success you will not seek for them and the treasures remain hidden if i a stranger to your property have all that you want for their exploring and i ask to do it ought the right to do so to be awarded to me without your consent why not under your land the buried wealth does good to no one in mine it will acquire great value thrown into circulation it will animate industry what injury is done to you you lose nothing the surface the only thing from which you derive any thing remains always in the same state but what the law attentive to your interests ought to do for you is to award you a greater or less considerable part of the product for though this treasure was nothing in your hands it left you a certain expectation of profiting by it some day and this chance ought not to be taken from you without indemnity such is the law of england in certain districts it permits upon certain conditions the pursuit of a vein of metal discovered in the field of another to whosoever wishes to try the adventure   liberty of fishing in great waters great lakes great rivers great bays and especially the ocean are not occupied as exclusive property they are considered as belonging to no person or to speak more correctly as belonging to all there is no reason for limiting the right of fishing in the ocean the multiplication of most kinds of fishes appears inexhaustible the prodigality the munificence of nature in this respect surpasses every thing which can be conceived the indefatigable lewenhoek has estimated the number of eggs in the roe of a single cod at above six millions what we can take and consume in this immense magazine of food is absolutely nothing compared with the destruction produced by physical causes which we neither know nor can prevent nor weaken man in the open sea with his nets and lines is only a feeble rival to the great tyrants of the ocean whilst as to the fishes of rivers lakes and little gulfs the laws take efficacious and necessary precautions for their preservation there is no reason for jealousy no danger of diminishing the sources of wealth by the number of competitors the right of the first occupant may be left for each and every species of labour encouraged which tends to increase the general abundance  0 liberty of hunting upon unappropriated lands it is the same with uncultivated and unappropriated lands wild forests in those vast countries which are not peopled in proportion to their extent these tracts form considerable spaces in which the right of hunting may be exercised without restraint man is there as yet only the rival of the carnivorous animals and the chase extends the sources of subsistence without injury to any one but in civilized societies in which agriculture has made great progress where the unappropriated lands bear only a small proportion to those which have received the seal of property there are many reasons which plead against the right of chase granted to the first occupier first inconvenience—in those countries where the population is numerous the destruction of wild animals may proceed faster than their reproduction render the chase free the kinds of animals which are its objects may be sensibly diminished and even annihilated the sportsman would then have as much trouble to procure a single partridge as he has now to procure a hundred and this would make them a hundredfold dearer he would not himself lose but he would only furnish to society one hundredth part of the value he now furnishes in other and more simple terms the pleasure of eating partridges would be reduced to a hundredth part of what it is second inconvenience—the chase without being more productive than other labours has unhappily more attractions play is there combined with labour idleness with exercise glory with danger the charm of a profession   0 so well suited to all the natural tastes of man draws into this career a great number of competitors by their rivalry they reduce the price of the labour employed upon it to the most simple subsistence and in general this class of adventurers will be poor third inconvenience—the chase having particular seasons there will be intervals in which the activity of the hunter will be chained up he will not easily return from a wandering to a sedentary life—from independence to subjection—and from a habit of idleness to a habit of labour accustomed like the gamester to live upon chances and hopes a small fixed salary will have few attractions for him his is a state which leads a man to crime from its misery and idleness fourth inconvenience—the exercise even of this profession is naturally fruitful in crimes the multitude of quarrels of lawsuits prosecutions convictions imprisonments and other punishments to which it gives rise are more than sufficient to counterbalance its pleasures the hunter tired of vainly waiting for his prey in the highroads spies out in secret the game of the neighbouring proprietors does he think himself observed he turns aside he hides himself he uses patience and cunning does he think there are no witnesses he no longer respects any bounds he passes the ditches he leaps the hedges he lays waste the inclosures and his cupidity betraying his prudence throws him into situations from which he often cannot escape without misfortune or crime if the right of chase were permitted on the highroads an army of guards would be requisite to prevent the wanderings of the hunters fifth inconvenience—if this right of chase be allowed to exist though so little advantageous when exercised in such narrow limits an assortment of laws is requisite in the civil and penal code to determine its exercise and to punish its violations this multiplication of laws is an evil because they cannot be multiplied without being weakened besides the severity necessary to prevent such easy and attractive crimes gives an odious character to property and places the rich man in a state of war with his indigent neighbours the means of cutting short this inconvenience is not to regulate but to suppress this right the prohibitory law once known no expectation will be formed of enjoying this privilege partridges will be no more coveted than fowls and in the minds of the multitude poaching will not be distinguished from theft it is true that at present popular ideas are in favour of this right of chase but if it be sometimes necessary to yield to popular ideas it is only upon those occasions in which they have great strength and in which there is no hope of changing their course when pains shall be taken to enlighten the people to discuss the motives of the law to make them consider it as a means of peace and security by showing that the exercise of this right is reduced almost to nothing—that the life of a hunter is miserable—that this ungrateful profession incessantly exposes him to criminality and his family to indigence and shame i dare affirm that popular opinion pressed by the continual and gentle force of reason will in a short time take a new direction there are some animals whose value after death does not compensate for the damages they do such are foxes wolves bears all carnivorous beasts the enemies of the species subjected to man far from preserving them it is only desirable that they should be destroyed one method is to give the property in them to the first occupant without regard to the territorial proprietor every hunter who attacks hurtful animals ought to be considered as employed by the police but this exception should only be admitted with regard to animals capable of causing great waste chapter ii another mode of acquisition—consent it may however happen that after any thing has been possessed by a legal title the individuals may wish to give it up by abandoning its enjoyment to another shall this arrangement be confirmed by the law without doubt it ought to be all the reasons which plead in favour of the ancient proprietor are no longer on his side but plead in favour of the new besides the former proprietor must have had some motive for abandoning his property he who speaks of a motive speaks of a pleasure or its equivalent pleasure of friendship or of benevolence if the thing be given for nothing pleasure of acquisition if it be made an object of exchange benefit of security if it have been given to save him from some evil pleasure of reputation if he propose by it to acquire the esteem of his fellows the sum of enjoyment as to these two interested parties is necessarily augmented by the transaction the acquirer puts himself in the place of the collater as to the ancient advantages and the collater acquires a new advantage we may therefore establish it as a general maxim that every alienation implies advantage some good always results from it     if there be an exchange there are two alienations each of which has its separate advantages this advantage for each of the contracting parties is the difference between the value which they put upon what they give up and the value of what they acquire in each transaction of this kind there are two new masses of enjoyment in this consists the advantage of commerce we may observe that in all the arts there are many things which can only be produced by the concurrence of a great number of workmen in all these cases the labour of one would possess no value either for himself or others if he could not exchange it   causes of invalidity in exchanges there are some cases in which the law ought not to sanction exchanges and in which the interests of the parties ought to be regulated as if the bargain did not exist because instead of being advantageous the exchange would be found hurtful either to one of the parties or to the public all the causes which invalidate exchanges may be ranged under the nine following heads—     undue concealment     fraud     undue coercion     subornation     erroneous supposition of legal obligation     erroneous supposition of value     interdiction—infancy—madness     things liable to become hurtful by the exchange     want of right on the part of the collator   undue concealment—if the object acquired be found to be of an inferior value to that which has served as the motive for its acquisition the new proprietor experiences regret and feels the pain of disappointment if this value be below that which he has given in exchange instead of a gain he has made a loss it is true that the other party has made a profit but the pleasure of gaining is not equal to the evil of losing i have paid ten pounds for a horse which is worth them if he were sound but since he is pursy he is not worth two the seller has gained eight pounds and i have lost the same sum when the interests of these two parties are weighed together the bargain is not advantageous but contrariwise however if at the time of the bargain this degradation in value was not known to the former proprietor why should the bargain be void—why should he be constrained to make a disadvantageous exchange the loss must fall upon some one why should it be made to fall upon him rather than the other suppose even that he knew of this circumstance which depreciated the value of the article was it his place to make it known rather than that of the buyer to inquire respecting it these two questions ought always to be asked in connexion with invalidity resulting from undue concealment—did the seller know of the existence of the defect was the case one of those in which he was obliged to reveal it the solution of these questions requires too many details and researches to have place here besides it is not possible to frame an answer which would embrace all cases and different modifications would be requisite according to the different kinds of things   fraud—this case is more simple than the preceding a fraudulent acquisition ought never to be permitted if it can be hindered it is an offence which approaches to theft you have asked of the seiler if the horse be pursy he has replied in the negative knowing the contrary to sanction the bargain would be to reward a crime the reason given in the preceding case may be added namely the evil for the buyer is greater than that for the seller and it is clear that this cause of invalidity is well founded   it is the same with undue coercion—the seller whose horse is only worth two pounds constrains you by violence and threats to buy it for ten pounds suppose that you would have been willing to pay him two pounds the surplus is so much gained by a crime it is true that this loss was an advantage to you in comparison with the evil with which you were threatened in case of refusal but neither this comparative advantage nor that of the delinquent ought to counterbalance the evil of the crime   it is the same with subornation—i understand by subornation the price of a service which consists in the commission of a crime as money offered to engage a man to take a false oath there are two advantages in the bargain—that of the suborned and that of the suborner but these two advantages are nothing equal to the evil of the crime i remark in passing that in cases of fraud undue coercion and subornation the law should not content itself with annulling the act it ought to oppose a stronger counterpoise by means of punishments   erroneous supposition of legal obligation—you have delivered your horse to a man believing that your steward had sold him and this had not happened you have delivered your horse to a man believing that he was authorized by the government to make you give him up for the service of the state but he had no such commission in a word you have believed yourself under a     legal obligation to sell and this obligation did not exist if the alienation should be confirmed after the error is discovered the buyer would find that he had made an unexpected gain the seller an unexpected loss but we have seen that the advantage of gaining cannot be compared with the evil of losing besides this case may be referred back to the head of undue cœrcion   erroneous supposition of value—if in alienating any thing i am ignorant of a circumstance which tends to increase its value when i discover my error i experience regret for the loss but is this a proper cause of invalidity on the one hand if such causes of nullity are admitted without restriction there is great risk of throwing discouragement upon exchanges for where is the security for my acquisitions if the former proprietor could break the bargain by saying i did not understand what i did on the other hand there would be a lively pain of regret if after having sold a diamond as a piece of crystal there were no method of recovering it to maintain an even balance between the parties the diversity of circumstances and things must be regarded it is necessary always to examine whether the ignorance of the seller were not the result of negligence and even in cancelling the bargain if the case demand it it is proper before every thing else to provide for the security of the buyer interested in its confirmation however it may happen that a bargain free from all these defects may at last be found disadvantageous you have bought this horse only for one journey and the journey is not made you were ready to set out the horse fell ill and died you set out the horse throws you and you break your leg you mount the horse but it is that you may go to rob upon the highway the fancy which led you to purchase it being passed you resell it at a loss cases might be multiplied to infinity where a thing whatever it may be acquired on account of its value may become useless or burthensome or dangerous either to its acquirer or to another are not these exceptions to the axiom that every alienation implies advantage—are not these as reasonable grounds of invalidity as the others no all these unfavourable events are only accidents and subsequent to the conclusion of the bargain the ordinary case is that the article is worth what it sells for the total advantage of advantageous exchanges is more than equivalent to the total disadvantage of unfavourable bargains the gains of commerce are greater than its losses since the world is richer at present than in its savage state alienations ought therefore in general to be maintained but to annul alienations for accidental losses would be to interdict alienations in general for no person would buy—no person would sell—if the bargain might at any moment be made void in consequence of some subsequent event which could neither be foreseen nor prevented   there are some cases in which foreseeing the evil of contracts the legislature has prohibited them beforehand thus in many countries prodigals are interdicted that is to say all bargains made with them are declared invalid but they begin by stating the danger that is to say the disposition which renders the prodigal unable to guide his affairs every body is or at least may be informed of the imbecility with which he is struck by the tutelary hand of justice interdiction exists every where with regard to the two analogous cases of infancy and mental imbecility i say analogous for what an infant is for a time which can be tolerably well determined though by a demarcation always more or less arbitrary a madman is for an indeterminate time or for ever the reasons are the same as in the preceding case minors and madmen are by their condition either ignorant rash or prodigal they are presumed to be so by a general indication which does not require to be supported by particular proofs it will be easily seen that in these three cases the interdiction can only extend to things of a certain importance to apply it to the trifling objects of daily consumption would be to condemn these three classes to die by hunger   the law also renders bargains invalid on account of some probable inconvenience which may result from them i have an estate situated upon the confines of the state acquired by a neighbouring power it might become the focus of certain hostile intrigues or favour dangerous preparations against my country whether i think of this effect or not the law ought to think of it for the public it ought to prevent the evil by refusing beforehand the guarantee of its seal to such bargains the restraints which it has been thought necessary to put upon the sale of drugs capable of being employed as poisons belong to this same head it is the same with the prohibition of the sale of murderous weapons     such as stilettoes of which such frequent use is made in italy in the most ordinary quarrels it is to the same motive well or ill founded that all prohibitions relative to the introduction or sale of certain kinds of merchandise must be referred in the greater number of cases the custom is to say that the bargain is null in itself it is only to open the books of law to see how much nonsense has been written upon this erroneous notion and into how much embarrassment lawyers have fallen from not having seized the only cause of nullity as respects bargains made under these circumstances which is that more evil than good results from them after saying that these conventions are null in themselves to be consistent it is necessary to conclude that they ought not to have any effect—that they ought to be destroyed—that no trace should be left of them in many cases however it is enough to modify them to correct their inequalities by compensations without altering the foundation of the primitive contract no bargain is void in itself—no bargain is valid of itself it is the law which in each case gives or refuses validity but for permitting or refusing there ought to be reasons equivocal generation is banished from sound philosophy some day perhaps it will be banished from jurisprudence this null in itself is precisely an equivocal generation   of obstacles to the alienation of land to say that the power of alienation is useful is as much as to say that the arrangements which tend to destroy it are in general pernicious it is only with regard to immoveables that this inconsistency has been exercised both by entails and unalienable foundations and yet besides the general reasons in favour of the power of alienation there are particular reasons in favour of the power of alienating lands   he who seeks to get rid of his lands shows plainly that it does not suit him to keep them he cannot or he will not employ any thing in improving them often indeed he cannot restrain himself from lowering their future value in order to satisfy a present want on the contrary he who seeks to acquire them has certainly not the intention of deteriorating them and it is probable that he purposes to increase their value it is true that the same capital which would be employed in the amelioration of land might be employed in trade but though the benefit of these two employments might be the same for the individuals it is not the same for the state the portion of wealth applied to agriculture is more fixed—that which is applied to trade is more fugitive the first is immoveable the second may be carried away at the will of the proprietor   by pledging an immoveable a productive capital may be procured thus one part of the value of an estate may be employed in ameliorating another which without this resource could not be done to hinder the alienation of lands is therefore to diminish productive capital nearly to the amount of their selling value since in order that an article may serve as a pledge it is necessary that it be capable of alienation it is true that a loan only has been here contemplated there is no new capital created by the transaction this same capital might have received a destination not less useful in the hands in which it was first found but it ought to be observed that the greater the means of employing capital the more it will flow towards the country that which is derived from abroad forms a clear addition to that which is derived from home these restraints upon alienation though condemned by the soundest notions of political economy subsist almost every where it is true that they have gradually diminished as governments have better understood the interests of agriculture and trade but there are still three causes which operate for their maintenance— the first is the desire of preventing prodigality but it is not necessary for obviating this evil to hinder the sale of lands it is sufficient to protect their value by not leaving it at the disposal of the individual in a word the specific method against this inconvenience is interdiction the second is pride of family connected with the agreeable illusion which represents the successive existence of our descendants as a prolongation of our own to leave them the same amount of wealth is not enough to satisfy the imagination we wish to secure them the same lands the same houses the same natural objects this continuity of possession appears as a continuity of enjoyment and presents a point of support to a fanciful feeling the third cause is the love of power—the desire of governing after death the preceding motive supposes posterity this does not suppose it it is to this cause must be referred as well those foundations which have in view an object of utility well or ill understood as those which repose only upon fancies if the foundation consist only in the distribution of benefits without imposing any condition—without exacting any service it seems sufficiently innocent and its continuance is not an evil it is proper to except foundations for the distribution of alms applied without discernment and adapted only     to the encouragement of mendicity and idleness the best of these establishments are those of charity for the poor of a rank already a little elevated—a means which offers to these unfortunate persons a more liberal relief than the general rule would allow whilst as to the benefices which are only granted upon the discharge of certain duties as in colleges convents churches their tendency is useful indifferent or hurtful according to the nature of the duties required one singularity which deserves to be observed is that in general these foundations these particular laws that individuals have established by the indulgence of the sovereign have experienced more respect than the public laws which originate directly with the sovereign when a legislator has desired to tie the hands of his successor this pretension has appeared either inconsistent or futile the most obscure individuals have arrogated this privilege and none have dared to disappoint them it would seem that lands left to corporations to convents churches would be liable to be deteriorated indifferent as to his successors each passing proprietor would seek to squeeze as much as possible out of the transitory possession and neglect the care of them especially in old age this may sometimes have happened justice ought however to be rendered to the religious communities they have more often been distinguished for a good than a bad economy if their situation inflame their cupidity and avarice it also represses pomp and prodigality if there be causes which excite their selfishness there are others which combat it by what is called esprit de corps there is no necessity for expatiating with regard to public property that is with regard to things used by the public such as roads churches markets to fulfil their design they ought to possess an indefinite duration with the exception of their admitting those successive changes which circumstances may require chapter iii another means of acquisition—succession after the death of an individual how ought his property to be disposed of the legislature should have three objects in view— st to provide for the subsistence of the rising generation  dly to prevent the pain of disappointment  dly to promote the equalization of fortunes man is not a solitary being with few exceptions every man is surrounded by a larger or smaller circle of companions united to him by the ties of relationship marriage friendship or services—who in fact share with him the enjoyment of the property which by right belongs exclusively to him his fortune is commonly with regard to many of them the sole source of their subsistence to prevent the calamities of which they would become the victims if death which deprives them of their friend should also deprive them of the succour which they derive from his fortune would require a knowledge of what they habitually enjoy and in what proportion they participate in it but as these are facts which it would be impossible to establish but by direct proofs—without entering upon embarrassing procedures and infinite disputes it has been found necessary to refer to general presumptions as the only base upon which a decision can be established the habitual part of each survivor in the possessions of the deceased may be presumed from the degree of affection which ought to subsist between them and this degree of affection may be presumed from the proximity of relationship if this proximity were the sole consideration the law of successions would be very simple in the first degree with respect to you are all those who are connected with you without any intermediate person—your wife your husband your father your mother and your children in the second degree all those whose connexion with you requires the intervention of a single person or a single couple of intermediate persons—your grandfathers and grandmothers your brothers or sisters and your grandchildren in the third degree come those whose connexion supposes two intermediate generations—your greatgrandfathers your greatgrandmothers your greatgrandchildren your uncles and aunts nephews and nieces but though this arrangement may possess every possible perfection on the side of simplicity and regularity it would not well answer the political and moral object it does not answer better to the degree of affection of which it might be thought to furnish a presumptive proof and would not accomplish the principal object which is to provide for the wants of the rising generations let us therefore leave this genealogical arrangement for the adoption of one founded upon utility it consists in constantly giving to the descending line however long the preference to the ascending or collateral line—in giving the preference infinitely to the descendants of each parent over all those who cannot be reached without taking another step in the ascending line it will happen however that the presumptions of affection or of necessity which serve as the foundation of these rules will often be defective in practice and that consequently the rules themselvse will diverge from their     object but the power of making a will as we shall see offers an efficacious remedy to the imperfection of the general law and this is the principal reason for preserving it thus much for general principles but how can they be applied in detail when it is necessary to decide among a crowd of competitors the model of a law upon this subject will supply the place of a multitude of discussions article i let there be no distinction between the sexes let what is said with regard to the one be understood with regard to the other the portion of the one shall always be equal to the portion of the other reason—good of equality if there be any difference it ought to be in favour of the weakest—in favour of the females who have more wants fewer means of acquisition and are less able to make use of the means they have but the strongest have had all the preference why because the strongest have made the laws article ii after the death of the husband the widow shall keep a moiety of the common property unless otherwise provided for by the marriagecontract article iii the other moiety shall be distributed in equal portions among the children reasons   equality of affection on the part of the father   equality of cooccupation on the part of the children   equality of wants   equality of all imaginable reasons on the one side and on the other differences of age temperament talent strength c may produce some difference with respect to wants in point of fact but it is not possible for the law to appreciate them it is for the father to provide for them by means of his right of making a will article iv if a child die before its father leaving children his portion shall be distributed among them in equal portions and so on for all their descendants to infinity remarks—the distribution by roots instead of by branches is preferred for two reasons—  in order to prevent the pain of disappointment that the portion of the elder should be diminished by the birth of each younger child is a natural event by which expectation ought to regulate itself however in general when one of the children begins to exercise its reproductive power that of the father is generally nearly exhausted at this period the children ought to believe themselves arrived at the boundary of the diminutions that their respective portions ought to experience but if each little grandson or little granddaughter produce a diminution equal to that produced by a son or daughter the diminution would have no limits there would be no certain grounds upon which to form a plan of life   grandchildren have for their immediate resource the property of their deceased father their custom of cooccupation detached from their grandfather has been exercised by preference if not exclusively upon the funds of paternal industry it may be added that they have in the goods of their mother and of her parents a resource in which the other children of their grandfather have no share article v if there be no descendants the property shall go in common to the father and mother remarks—why to the descendants before others—  superiority of affection every other arrangement would be contrary to the paternal feelings we love those better who depend upon us than those upon whom we depend it is more pleasant to govern than to obey   superiority of wants it is certain that our children could not exist without us or some one who should take our place it is probable that our parents might exist without us because they have existed before us why should the succession pass to the father and mother rather than to the brothers and sisters—  the relationship being more immediate a superior affection is presumed   it is a recompense for services rendered or rather an indemnity for the pains and expenses of education what forms the relationship between my brother and myself our common relation to the same father and the same mother what renders him more dear to me than any other companion with whom i have passed an equal portion of my life it is because he is more dear to those who have my first affections it is not certain that i am indebted to him for any thing but it is certain that i owe every thing to them hence upon all occasions in which the stronger titles of my children do not intervene i owe them those indemnities to which a brother cannot pretend article vi if either of the two be dead the portion of the deceased shall go to his descendants in the same manner as it would have gone to the proprietors own relations remarks—in poor families which only possess household furniture it is more desirable that the whole should pass to the surviving father or mother with the charge of providing for the support of the children the expenses of the sale and the dispersion of the property would ruin the survivor whilst the portions too small to serve as a capital would soon be dissipated article vii in default of such descendants the property shall go entirely to the survivor article viii if both be dead the property shall be divided as before directed among their descendants article ix but in such manner that the     portion of the half blood shall only be the half of the portion of the whole blood when there is any such reason—superiority of affection of the two bonds which attach me to my brother there is only one which attaches me to my half brother article x in default of relations in the foregoing degrees the property shall be applied to the revenue article xi but on condition of distributing the interest as an annuity among all the relations in the ascending line in whatever degree in equal portions remarks—this part of the law may either be established or not according to the condition of the country with regard to taxes but i have been unable to discover any solid objection against this fiscal resource the collateral relation who would be excluded it may be said may be in want but this want is an incident too casual for the foundation of a general rule they have for their natural resource the property of their respective ancestors and they cannot have fixed their expectations or their plan of life upon this foundation on the side even of the uncle the expectation of inheriting from a nephew can be but feeble and a positive law would suffice to prevent its existence or to extinguish it without violence the uncle has not the titles of the father or grandfather it is true that in case of the death of these the uncle may have taken their place and filled the place of a father to his nephew this is a circumstance which deserves the attention of the legislator the power of leaving legacies may answer the end but this means of obviating the inconveniences of the general law would be null in case the nephew should die before he became of age—before he had the faculty of making a will if therefore it be desirable to soften this fiscal regulation the first departure from the rule ought to be in favour of the uncle either in relation to the principal or the interest article xii in making division among many heirs the mass ought to be put up for public sale saving the right to make any other arrangement if they are agreed remark—this is the only method of preventing community of goods—an arrangement of which we have elsewhere shown the pernicious consequences the goods of inheritance which may possess a value in affection will find their true price from the competition of the heirs and will turn to the common advantage without occasioning those disputes which produce durable animosities in families article xiii in arranging the sale and division every thing shall be referred to the oldest male of full age saving to the law to make other arrangements for fear of misconduct upon cause stated remark—women in general are less apt in affairs of interest and embarrassment than men but a certain woman in particular may possess a superior aptitude indicated by the general wish of the relations she ought to obtain the preference article xiv in default of a male of full age every thing should be referred to the guardian of the oldest male saving the discretionary power given in the preceding article article xv the succession which falls to the revenue for want of natural heirs shall in like manner be sold by public auction remark—government is incapable of managing the greater portion of specific goods their management costs too much they yield little and are liable to be destroyed this is a truth which has been established almost to demonstration by adam smith it appears to me that this project of a law is simple concise easy to be understood that it is little favourable to fraud to diversity of interpretations in short that it is analogous to the affections of the human heart to the habitual inclinations which arise from the social relations and that consequently it is calculated to conciliate the approbation of those who judge from feeling and the esteem of those who can appreciate reason those who reproach this plan with being too simple and discover that at this price the law would no longer be a science may find wherewith to satisfy and even to astonish themselves in the labyrinth of the english common law upon successions to give to foreigners an idea of these difficulties it would be necessary to begin by a dictionary altogether new to them since when they should see the absurdities the subtleties the cruelties the frauds which abound in this system they would imagine that they were reading a satire and that it was intended to insult a nation on other accounts so justly renowned for its wisdom on the other hand it would be proper to show what has reduced this evil within sufficiently narrow limits this is the right of making a will it is only in successions upon intestacy that it is necessary to pass through the tortuous routes of the common law these wills may therefore be compared to the arbitrary pardons which correct the harshness of the penal laws chapter v of wills   the law cannot know individuals nor accommodate itself to the diversity of their wants all that can be required of it is that it shall offer the best chance of supplying     these wants it remains for each proprietor who may and who ought to know the circumstances in which those who depend upon him will be placed after his death to correct the imperfections of the law in those cases which it could not foresee the power of making a will is an instrument placed in the hands of individuals for the prevention of private calamity   this same power may also be considered as an instrument of authority confided to individuals for the encouragement of virtue and the repression of vice in the bosom of families the power of this instrument it is true may be turned in an opposite direction happily these cases would always form the exceptions to the rule the interest of each member of the family is that the conduct of each should be conformable to virtue that is to say to general utility passion may produce accidental wanderings but the law ought to regulate itself by the ordinary course of affairs virtue is the prevailing foundation of society even vicious parents are found as jealous as others of the honesty and reputation of their children the man least scrupulous in his business would be in despair if his secret conduct were known to his family among these he never ceases to be the apostle of that honesty of which he stands in need from those who serve him in this respect every proprietor may obtain the confidence of the law clothed with the power of making a will which is a branch of penal and remuneratory legislation he may be considered as a magistrate set over the little kingdom which is called a family to preserve it in good order this magistrate may do wrong and it would even seem that as he is not restrained in the exercise of his power either by responsibility or publicity he would be more liable to abuse it than any other magistrate but this danger is more than counterbalanced by the bonds of interest and affection which place his inclinations in accordance with his duties his natural attachment to his children or his relations is a pledge of his good conduct which gives as much security as can be obtained for that of the political magistrate so that every thing considered the authority of this noncommissioned magistrate besides that it is absolutely necessary for minor children will be more often found salutary than hurtful for adults themselves   the power of making a will is advantageous under another aspect it is a means of governing under the character of master not for the good of those who obey as in the preceding article but for the good of those who command the power of the present generation is thus extended over a portion of the future and the wealth of each proprietor is in some respect doubled by means of an assignment upon a time when he shall be no more he procures a multitude of advantages beyond what he actually possesses by continuing beyond the term of their minority the submission of children the indemnity for parental cares is increased an assurance is given to the parent against ingratitude and though it would be more pleasant to think that such precautions were superfluous yet if we reflect upon the infirmities of old age it will be perceived that it is necessary to leave all these factitious attractions to serve as their counterpoise in the rapid decline of life it is proper to husband every resource and it is not without advantage that interest is made to act as the monitor of duty ingratitude on the part of children and contempt for old age are not common vices in civilized societies but it ought to be recollected that more or less the power of making a will exists every where do these vices exist more frequently where this power is most limited to decide this question it would be necessary to observe what passes in the families of the poor where there is little to leave but still this ground of judgment would be defective since the influence of this power established in society by the laws tends to form the general manners and the general manners afterwards determine the sentiments of individuals this power given to parents renders parental authority more respectable and the parent who from his indigence cannot exercise it unwittingly profits by it from the general habit of submission to which it has given birth however in making the father a magistrate it is proper to guard against making him a tyrant if the children may do wrong he may do wrong also and though the power of punishing them may be given to him it does not follow that he ought to be authorized to make them die of hunger thus the institution of what is called in france a legitime is a suitable medium between domestic anarchy and tyranny even this legitime parents ought to be allowed to take from their children for causes determined by the law and judicially proved another question presents itself shall a proprietor be allowed to leave his property to whom he pleases whether distant relations or strangers in default of natural heirs in this case the fiscal resource of which we spoke under the head of successions would be much diminished it would only exist in the case of intestates here the reasons of utility divide themselves there is a medium to be taken on the one side in default of relations the services of strangers are necessary to a man and his attachment to them is almost the same it is necessary that he should be able     to cultivate the hopes and recompense the cares of a faithful servant—to soften the regrets of the friend who has grown old by his side without speaking of the female who has wanted only a ceremony in order to be called his widow and of orphans who are his children in the eyes of every body except the legislator on the other hand if to increase the inheritance of the public treasury you take from him the power of leaving to his friends do you not force him to spend all upon himself if his capital will be no longer at his disposal the moment he is dead will he not be tempted to convert it into annuities upon his own life will it not encourage his being a spendthrift and almost operate as a law against economy these reasons are without doubt to be preferred to the interest of the revenue it is necessary at least to leave to the proprietor who has no near relations the right of disposing of the half of his property after his death keeping the other half for the public to be content in this case with the smaller share would probably be a means of obtaining more but it would be still better not to attack the principle which permits every one to dispose of his property after his death and not to create a class of proprietors who should regard themselves as inferior to others on account of this legal impotence which should have struck the half of their fortune all that has been said respecting alienations among the living may be properly applied to wills upon the greater number of points we shall be instructed by their conformity and in the others by the contrast the same causes of nullity which apply to alienations among the living apply to wills except that in the case of undue concealment on the part of the receiver there must be substituted erroneous supposition on the part of the testator the following is an example—i leave a certain property to titius who is married to my daughter supposing this marriage legal and ignorant of the dishonesty of titius who before espousing my daughter had contracted another marriage which was still subsisting wills are exposed to a sufficiently unfortunate dilemma shall their validity be permitted when made upon the bed of death they are then exposed to undue coercion and fraud shall formalities incompatible with this indulgence be required testators will then be liable to be deprived of assistance at the moment of their greatest need barbarous heirs may torment them in order to hasten their death or secure the advantage of a will passed in these forms a dying person who has nothing to give or to take away is no longer to be feared in order to reduce these opposite dangers to the lowest term a multitude of details would be required chapter v of rights respecting services—means of acquiring them after things it remains to distribute services a kind of property sometimes confounded with things—sometimes presenting itself under a distinct form how many kinds of services are there as many as there are ways in which man may be useful to man either by procuring good for him or by preserving him from evil in the exchange of services which constitutes social intercourse some are free some are forced those which are required by the law constitute rights and obligations i have a right to the services of another he is in a state of obligation with regard to me these two terms are correlative in their origin all services must have been free it is only by degrees that the laws have intervened to convert the more important into positive rights it is thus that the institution of marriage has converted into legal obligations the connexion which formerly was voluntary between the husband and wife between the father and the children the law in the same manner has converted into an obligation in certain states the support of the poor a duty which still remains amongst most nations in undefined liberty these political duties are with respect to duties purely social the same as particular inclosures in a vast common in which a certain kind of cultivation is tended with precautions which insure its success the same plant might grow in the common and even be protected by certain conventions but it would always be subject to more hazards than in this particular boundary traced by the law and guaranteed by the public force still whatever the legislator may do there are a great number of services upon which he has no hold he cannot direct them because it is not possible to define them and even because constraint would change their nature and convert them into evils for the punishment of their violation such an apparatus of research and of punishments would be required as would spread terror through society besides the law does not know the real obstacles which prevent their being rendered it cannot put into activity hidden forces it cannot create that energy that superabundance of zeal which surmounts difficulties and goes a thousand times farther than commands the imperfection of the law upon this point is corrected by a species of supplemental law that is to say by the moral or social code—a code which is not written—which     consists altogether in opinion in manners customs—and which begins where the legislative code ends the duties which it prescribes—the services it imposes under the names of equity patriotism courage humanity generosity honour disinterestedness do not directly borrow the assistance of the laws but derive their strength from other sanctions which lend their punishments and rewards as the duties of this secondary code do not bear the impress of the law their discharge has more eclât—is more meritorious and this surplus in honour happily compensates for their deficiency in real strength after this digression respecting morals let us return to legislation the kind of services which occupy the most prominent place consists in the disposal of property in favour of another the kind of property which acts the greatest part in civilized society is money the almost universal representative standard it is thus that the consideration of services often leads back into that of things there are some cases in which it is necessary to require the service for the advantage of him who commands it such is the case of the master with relation to the servant there are some cases in which it is necessary to require the service for the advantage of him who obeys such is the case of the guardian and ward these two correlative states are the foundation of all others the rights which belong to them are the elements of which all the other states are composed the father ought to be in certain respects the guardian—in others the master of the child the husband ought to be in certain respects the guardian—in others the master of the wife these conditions are capable of a definite and indefinite duration and form domestic society the rights which it is proper should belong to them will be treated of separately the public services of the magistrate and the citizen constitute other classes of obligations the establishment of which belong to the constitutional code but besides these constant relations there are some transitory and occasional relations in which the law may require the services of an individual in favour of another the means of acquiring these services or in other words the causes which determine the legislator to create these obligations may be referred to three heads   superior need   former service   agreement or contract let us consider these heads in detail   superior need that is to say need of receiving the service superior to the inconvenience of rendering it every individual has for his constant occupation the care of his own welfare—an occupation no less legitimate than necessary for suppose that it were possible to reverse this principle and to give to the love of others a superiority over selflove the results of this arrangement would be most ridiculous and disastrous there are however many occasions in which it is possible to make a considerable addition to the happiness of others by a slight and almost imperceptible sacrifice of ones own to do in certain circumstances what depends upon us for preventing the evil ready to fall upon another is a service which the law may require and the omission of this service in the cases in which the law has exacted it would be a kind of offence which might be called a negative offence in order to distinguish it from a positive offence which consists in being ones self the instrumental cause of an evil but to employ ones efforts however light they may be may be an evil to be constrained to employ them is certainly one for all constraint is an evil hence in order to exact from you some service in favour of me the evil of not receiving it ought to be so great and the evil of rendering it so small that no one ought to fear to undergo the one for the prevention of the other there is no means of fixing the precise limits reference must be made to the circumstances of the parties interested by leaving to the judge the care of pronouncing upon the cases of individuals as they present themselves the good samaritan by assisting the wounded traveller saved his life it was a noble action a trait of virtue we may say more it was a moral duty ought it to have been made a political duty—ought an action of this kind to be commanded by a general law no not at least unless tempered by exceptions more or less vague it would be proper for example to establish a dispensation in this case in favour of a surgeon attending upon many wounded persons in extreme danger—or of an officer going to his post to repel the enemy—or of the father of a family going to the assistance of one of his children in danger this principle of superior need is the foundation of many obligations the duties required of a father towards his children may be burthensome to him but this evil is nothing in comparison of the evil which would result from their neglect the duty of defending the state may be still more burthensome but if the state were not defended it would not exist when the taxes are not paid the government is dissolved when public functions are not discharged the course is open for all kinds of misfortunes and all kinds of crimes it must be understood that the obligation of rendering the service falls upon a certain individual in consequence of his particular   0 situation which gives him more than any other one the power or the inclination of discharging it it is thus that a guardian for orphans is chosen from among their relations or friends to whom this duty will be less burthensome than to a stranger   former service— service rendered in consideration of which there is required of him who received the benefit an indemnity an equivalent in favour of him who has supported the burthen here the object is more simple it is only necessary to value a benefit already received in order to assign an indemnification less latitude need be left to the discretion of the judge a surgeon has given his assistance to a sick person who had lost all feeling and who was not in a condition to send for him a depositary has employed his labour or has made pecuniary advances necessary for the preservation of the deposit without being required so to do a man has exposed himself during a fire to save valuable property or to rescue persons in danger the property of an individual has been thrown into the sea to lighten the vessel and preserve the rest of the cargo in all these cases and in a thousand others which might be imagined the laws ought to secure an indemnification as the price of the service this title is founded upon the best of reasons grant the indemnification he who has supplied it will still be a gainer refuse it and you leave him who has rendered the service a loser this regulation would be less for the advantage of him who receives the indemnification than for those who may stand in need of services it would be a promise made beforehand to every man who may have the opportunity of rendering a service burthensome to himself for the purpose of preventing any opposition between his personal interest and his benevolence who shall say how many evils would be prevented by such a precaution in how many cases has not prudence arrested the legitimate desires of benevolence would it not be wisdom on the part of the legislator as much as possible to reconcile them ingratitude it is said was punished at athens as a species of fraud which obstructed the communication of benefits by weakening this kind of credit i do not propose to punish but to prevent it in many cases if the man to whom you have rendered a service is ungrateful it is of no consequence the law which does not reckon upon virtues secures you an indemnity and on essential occasions will make the indemnity rise to a reward reward this is the true means of obtaining services in comparison with this punishment is a feeble instrument in order properly to punish the omission of a service it is proper to be sure that the individual had the power of rendering it—that he had not an excuse for not rendering it all this requires a difficult and doubtful procedure besides as it acts by means of the fear of punishment that only will be done which is absolutely necessary for avoiding the punishment but the hope of reward animates the hidden powers triumphs over real obstacles and gives birth to prodigies of zeal and ardour in cases in which threats would have only produced repugnance and dejection in arranging the interest of the two parties three precautions should be observed first to prevent a hypocritical generosity from converting itself into tyranny and requiring the price of a service that would not have been received if it had not been believed to be disinterested the second is not to allow a mercenary zeal to snatch a reward for services that might have been rendered by the party to himself or obtained at a less expense the third is not to allow a man to be overwhelmed by a crowd of assistants who can only be fully indemnified by exchanging for a loss all the advantage of the service it is easily understood that former service forms a justifying base to many classes of obligations it is upon this that the rights of parents over their children are founded when in the order of nature the strength of adult age succeeds to the weakness of early years the necessity of receiving ceases and the duty of restitution begins it is upon this that the rights of wives during the period of the union is equally founded when time has effaced the attractions which were its first moving causes establishments at the public expense for those who have served the state repose upon the same principle reward for past services is an instrument for creating future services   agreement or contract that is to say the making a promise between two or more persons upon the understanding that it is regarded as legally binding all that has been said relative to consent in the disposal of property applies to consent in the disposal of services the same reasons for sanctioning this disposal as for sanctioning the other—the same fundamental axiom—every alienation of service implies advantage no one will bind himself except from a motive of utility     the same reasons which annual consent in the one case annul it in the other—undue concealment fraud coercion subornation erroneous supposition of legal obligation erroneous supposition of value interdiction infancy madness pernicious tendency of the execution of the contract without fault of the contracting parties we shall not dwell upon the following causes which produce the dissolution of a contract—  accomplishment   compensation   express or tacit remission   lapse of time   physical impossibility   intervention of superior inconvenience in all these cases the reason which had sanctioned the service no longer exists but the two last bear only upon the literal or specific accomplishment and may leave occasion for an indemnity if in a reciprocal contract one of the parties alone have performed his part or if he have only done more than the other compensation becomes necessary for the restoration of an equilibrium an exhibition of principles only is here attempted without attending to the details arrangements must necessarily vary to correspond with the diversity of circumstances at all times if a small number of rules are well understood particular arrangements will not create much difficulty and may be all directed by the same spirit the following rules appear sufficiently simple to allow their developments to be passed by—   avoid producing the pain of disappointment   when a portion of this evil is inevitable diminish it as much as possible by dividing all loss among the parties interested in proportion to their property   observe in the distribution to throw the greater part of the loss upon him who ought by his attention to have prevented the evil in such manner as to punish his negligence   avoid especially the production of an accidental injury greater than the evil of the disappointment general observation we have laid the foundation of the whole theory of obligations in utility we have supported the whole of this vast edifice upon three principles superior need former service agreement or contract who would believe that to arrive at notions so simple and even so familiar it has been necessary to open a new route consult the masters of the science—grotius puffendorf burlamqui vattel even montesquieu himself locke rousseau and the crowd of commentators do they wish to ascend to the principle of obligations they speak of a natural right of a law anterior to man of the divine law of conscience of a social contract of a tacit contract c c i know that these terms are not incompatible with the true principle because there is not one of them that may not be brought by explanations more or less long to signify some good or some evil but this oblique and winding method announces uncertainty and embarrassment and does not put an end to disputes they have not seen that a contract speaking rigorously is no reason in itself and that it requires a foundation—a first and independent reason a contract serves to prove the existence of the mutual advantage of the parties contracting it is this reason of utility which gives it force it is by this that the cases may be distinguished in which it ought to be confirmed from those in which it ought to be annulled if a contract constituted a reason in itself it would always have the same effect if its pernicious tendency render it void it is then its useful tendency which renders it valid chapter vi community of goods—its inconveniences there is no arrangement more contrary to the principle of utility than community of goods especially that kind of indeterminate community in which the whole belongs to every one   it is an inexhaustible source of discord far from being a state of satisfaction and enjoyment for all parties interested it is one of discontent and disappointment   this undivided property always loses a great part of its value to all the copartners subject on the one hand to dilapidations of every kind because it is not under the protection of personal interest on the other hand it receives no improvement why should i undertake an expense of which the burthen will be certain and will fall altogether on myself whilst the advantage will be precarious and necessarily divided   the apparent equality of this arrangement would only serve to hide a real inequality the strongest would abuse his strength with impunity the richest would enrich themselves at the expense of the poorest community of goods always recalls the idea of that kind of monster which is sometimes found to exist that is of twins attached by the back to one another—the stronger necessarily draws the weaker along reference is not here made to the community of goods between husbands and wives called to live together to cultivate their own interests and those of their children together     they ought to enjoy together a fortune often acquired and always preserved by their common cares besides if their wills cross each other the conflict will not be eternal the law having confided to the man the right of decision reference is also not made to this community between associates in commerce this community has acquisition for its object and does not extend to enjoyment now when it refers to acquisition the associates have only one and the same object one and the same interest when it refers to enjoyment and consumption each becomes independent of the other besides the associates in commerce are few in number they are freely chosen and they can separate from each other it is precisely otherwise in common property in england one of the greatest and best understood improvements is the division of commons when we pass over the lands which have undergone this happy change we are enchanted as with the appearance of a new colony harvests flocks and smiling habitations have succeeded to the sadness and sterility of the desert happy conquests of peaceful industry noble aggrandisements which inspire no alarms and provoke no enemies but who would believe it that in this island where agriculture is so well understood and so much esteemed that millions of acres of productive land are abandoned to this sad state of commonalty it is not long since that the government desirous of knowing its territorial domains has collected in each district all the facts which have made known this interesting truth so well adapted to become fruitful the inconveniences of community are not experienced in the case of servitudes that is to say in the partial rights of property exercised over immovables as a right of way or right of water except by accident these rights are in general limited the value lost by the land serving is not equal to the value acquired by the land served or in other words the inconvenience to the one is not so great as the advantage to the other in england freehold land which is worth thirty years purchase would not be worth more than twenty years purchase if it were copyhold this arises from there being in the latter case a lord of the manor possessing certain rights which establish a kind of community between him and the principal proprietor but it must not be thought that what is lost by the vassal is gained by the lord the greater part falls into the hands of the lawyers and is consumed in useless formalities or vexatious triflings these are remains of the feudal system it is a beautiful sight says montesquieu of the feudal law and he afterwards compares it to an old and majestic oak we may the rather compare it to that fatal tree the manchineel tree whose juices are poisons to man and whose shade is destructive to vegetation this unfortunate system has infused into the laws confusion and complexity from which it is difficult to deliver them as it is every where interwoven with property it requires much management to destroy the one without injuring the other chapter vii of distribution of loss things form one branch of the objects of acquisition services form another after having treated of the different methods of acquiring and losing ceasing to possess these two classes of objects the analogy between gain and loss seems to indicate as an ulterior labour the different methods of distributing the losses to which these possessions are liable this task will not be very long an article comes to be destroyed damaged lost the loss is already experienced is the proprietor known upon him the weight of this loss rests is he not known no one bears it it is as to every body as null and as if it had not happened ought the loss to be transferred to any other than the proprietor that is to say in other words is there due to him a satisfaction either from one cause or another this is a subject which will be discussed in the penal code a single particular case will here suffice as an indication of the principles when the buyer and seller of merchandise are at a distance from each other it must necessarily pass through a number more or less of intermediate hands it may be carried by land or by water the merchandise becomes destroyed damaged or lost it does not reach its destination in the condition in which it ought to be upon whom shall the loss fall upon the seller or the buyer i say upon the seller saving his recourse against the intermediate agents he may by his care contribute to the security of the merchandise it is for him to choose the moment and the manner of sending it to take the necessary precautions on him depends the proof all this ought to be more easy to the merchant who sells than to the particular individual who buys whilst as to him it is only by     accident that his cares can contribute in any manner to bring about the desired event—reason superior preventive faculty principle security particular situations may indicate the necessity of departing from this general rule by corresponding dispositions for a much stronger reason individuals may depart from it themselves by agreements made among themselves indication can here only be made of the principles their application would be out of place part iii of the rights and obligations attached to different private conditions introduction we now proceed to consider in greater detail the rights and obligations which the law attaches to the different conditions which compose the domestic or private condition these conditions may be divided into four—those of   master and servant   guardian and ward   parent and child   husband and wife if we were to follow the historical or the natural order of these relations the last in the list would become the first for the sake of avoiding repetitions beginning with the most simple object has been preferred the rights and obligations of a father and a husband are composed of the rights and obligations of a master and a guardian these two first conditions are the elements of all the others chapter i of master and servant when the question of slavery is not considered there is little to say respecting the condition of master and its correlative conditions constituted by the different kinds of servants all these conditions are the effects of contracts these contracts the parties interested may arrange to suit themselves the condition of master to which the condition of apprentice corresponds is a mixed condition the master of an apprentice is at the same time master and tutor tutor for the art which he teaches master as to the profit which he derives from him the work that the apprentice does after the period at which the produce of his labour is worth more than what it costs to develope his talent is the salary or reward of the master for his former pains and expenses this salary will naturally be greater or less according to the difficulty of the art some arts may be learnt in seven days others may require seven years the competition among the dealers regulates the price of these mutual services as well as of all other objects of commerce and here as in other cases industry finds its just reward the greater number of governments have not adopted this free system they have sought to establish what they call order among the professions that is to substitute an artificial for a natural arrangement that they might have the pleasure of regulating that which would regulate itself as they have meddled with what they did not understand they have been most frequently led by an idea of uniformity in objects of very different natures for example the ministers of elizabeth fixed the same term of apprenticeship the term of seven years for the most simple as well as for the most difficult arts the regulating mania disguised itself under a common pretext it would perfect the arts it would prevent there being any bad workmen it would secure the credit and the honour of the national manufactures for the accomplishment of this object a natural and simple method presented itself permission to every one to use his own judgment to reject the bad to choose the good to determine his preferences by merit and thus to excite emulation in all the artists by the liberty of competition but no—it determined that the public was not in a condition to judge of the quality of any work but so soon as a workman had been employed upon a certain kind of labour a certain number of years his work ought to be regarded as good that the proper question to be asked respecting an artisan is not does he work well but how long has been his apprenticeship for if it be necessary still to judge of work by its merit so much the better would it be to allow every one liberty to work at his own peril and risk one might then be a master without having served an apprenticeship another might remain all his life only an apprentice chapter ii of slavery when the habit of serving forms a condition and the obligation of continuing in this condition     with respect to a certain individual or to others who derive their titles from him embraces the whole life of the servant this condition is called slavery slavery is susceptible of many modifications and alleviations according to the greater or less certainty of the services which it is permitted to exact and according to the means of coercion which it is permitted to employ there was a great difference between the condition of a slave at athens and lacedemon there is still more between that of a russian serf and a negro in the southern states of america but whatever may be the limits as to the modes of exercising authority if the obligation of service be unlimited in point of duration i always call it slavery in drawing the line of separation between slavery and freedom it is necessary to stop at some point and this appears the most prominent and the most easily proved this characteristic mark drawn from its perpetuity is so much the more essential in as much as wherever it is found it weakens it enervates it renders more or less precarious the most prudent precautions for the initigation of authority unlimited power in this sense can with difficulty be limited in any other if we consider on the one hand the facility which the master possesses of aggravating his yoke by degrees of rigorously exacting the services which are due to him of extending his pretensions under divers pretexts of seeking out opportunities for tormenting an insolent subject who has dared to refuse that which he did not owe if we consider on the other hand how difficult it is for slaves to claim and obtain legal protection how much more distressing their domestic condition becomes after a public struggle against their master how much rather they are led to seek his favour by unlimited submission than to irritate him by refusal—we shall easily perceive that the project of mitigating slavery by law is more easily formed than executed that the fixation of services is a very feeble instrument in the mitigation of the lot of slavery that under the empire of the best laws in this respect their most flagrant infractions only will be punished whilst the ordinary course of domestic rigour will mock all tribunals i do not therefore say that slaves ought to be abandoned to the absolute power of the master that they ought not to receive any protection from the laws because this protection is insufficient but it was necessary clearly to point out this circumstance to show the evil inherent in the nature of slavery namely the impossibility of subjecting the authority of a master over his slaves to legal restraint and of preventing the abuse of his power if he be disposed to abuse it that slavery is agreeable to the masters is not doubtful—since they could in an instant cause it to cease if they wished so to do that it is disagreeable to the slaves is a fact no less certain—since they are only retained in this condition by restraint no one who is free is willing to become a slave no one is a slave but he wishes to become free it is absurd to reason as to the happiness of men otherwise than with a reference to their own desires and feelings it is absurd to seek to prove by calculation that a man ought to be happy when he finds himself miserable and that a condition into which no one is willing to enter and which every one desires to leave is in itself a pleasant condition and suited to human nature i can easily believe that the difference between liberty and slavery is not so great as it appears to be to some ardent and prepossessed minds being accustomed to the evil and much more never having experienced the better condition the interval which separates these two conditions which at first sight appear so opposed is greatly diminished but all reasonings upon probabilities are superfluous since we have proofs of the fact that this condition is never embraced from choice but on the contrary that it is always an object of aversion slavery has been compared to the condition of a scholar prolonged during life and how numerous are the persons who have said that the time passed at school was the happiest period of their life the parallel is correct only in one respect the circumstance common to the two conditions is subjection but it is any thing rather than this circumstance which produces the happiness of the scholar that which renders him happy is the freshness of spirit which gives to all his impressions the charm of novelty it is the comparison of the noisy and active pleasures in which he engages with companions of his own age with the solitude and the quiet of his fathers house and after all how many are the scholars who have sighed for the moment when this condition should cease who among them would resolve to remain a scholar always if it could be arranged in such a manner that slavery should be so established that there should be only one slave to one master there might be ground for hesitation in pronouncing beforehand which would have the advantage and which the disadvantage and it might be possible that all things considered the sum of good in this arrangement would be nearly equal to that of evil but things are not thus arranged as soon as slavery is established it becomes the lot of the greatest number a master counts his slaves as his flocks by hundreds by thousands by tens of thousands the advantage     is only on the side of a single person the disadvantages are on the side of the multitude if the evil of slavery were not great its extent alone would suffice to make it considerable generally speaking and every other consideration apart there can therefore be no ground for hesitation between the loss which would result to the masters from enfranchisement and the gain which would result from it to the slaves another strong argument against slavery may be drawn from its influence upon the wealth and power of nations a free man produces more than a slave set at liberty all the slaves which a master possesses this master would without doubt lose a part of his property but the slaves taken together would produce not only what he lost but still more but happiness cannot but be augmented with abundance whilst public power increases in the same proportion two circumstances concur in diminishing the produce of slaves the absence of the stimulus of reward and the insecurity of their condition it is easily perceived that the fear of punishment is little likely to draw from a labourer all the industry of which he is capable all the work that he can furnish fear leads him to hide his powers rather than to show them to remain below rather than to surpass himself by a work of supererogation he would prepare punishment for himself he would only raise the measure of his ordinary duties by displaying superior capacity his ambition is the reverse of that of a free man and he seeks to descend in the scale of industry rather than to ascend not only does he produce less he consumes more not in enjoyment but lavishly wastefully and by bad economy of what importance to him are interests which are not his own every thing which saves his labour is a gain for him every thing which he allows to be lost is only the loss of his master why should he invent new methods of doing more or doing better in making improvements he must think and thinking is a labour to which no one gives himself without a motive degraded to a beast of burden a slave never raises himself above a blind routine and one generation succeeds another without any progress in improvement it is true that a master who understands his own interests will not dispute with his slaves the little profits which their industry may furnish to them he will not be ignorant that their prosperity is his own and that to animate them to labour he must offer them the allurement of an immediate reward but this precarious favour dependent on the character of the individual is not sufficient to inspire in them that confidence which directs the views to the future which shows in the savings of today the foundation of future wealth and which leads to extended projects respecting the fortune of their children they well understand that the richer they are the more they are exposed to extortion if not from their master at least from his agents and all their subordinates in authority more greedy and more formidable than their master there is therefore no tomorrow for the greater number of slaves the enjoyments which are realized at the instant are those alone which can tempt them they therefore become gluttons idle dissolute without reckoning the other vices which result from their situation if they have a longer foresight they hide their little treasures all the faults destructive of industry and all the habits most mischievous to society are nourished in them by the sad feeling of insecurity without compensation and without remedy this result is not the deduction of a vain theory it is a result drawn from facts in all times and all places but it is said the free labourer in europe is very nearly upon the same footing with regard to labour as the slave he who is paid by the piece has reward for his motive and each effort has its payment he who is paid by the day has no other motive than punishment whether he does little or much he receives only his days wages therefore he has no reward if he does less than usual he may be discharged as the slave in the same case may be beaten the one and the other are excited only by fear and have no interest in the produce of their labour three things may be replied—  it is not true that the daylabourer has not the motive of reward the most skilful and the most active are better paid than others those who distinguish themselves are more constantly employed and are always preferred for the most lucrative employments here then is a real reward which accompanies all their efforts   if he were actuated by no other than penal motives there would be still more hold upon the daylabourer than upon the slave the free labourer has his point of honour as well as others in a free country shame attaches to the character of an idle or unskilful workman and in this respect the eyes of his companions are so many helpers to those of the master this punishment of the popular sanction is inflicted upon a multitude of occasions by judges who have no interest in sparing it hence they exercise reciprocal inspection and are sustained in their efforts by emulation this motive has much less force upon slaves the treatment to which they are subject renders them but little sensible of so delicate a punishment as that of shame and as the injustice of labouring for the advantage of another without indemnification     has not escaped their observation slaves have no shame in acknowledging one to another a dislike to labour which is common to them all   whatever appears to the daylabourer as a gain is a certain gain every thing which he acquires is his own and no one else has a right to touch it but we have seen that there is no real security for the slave exceptions in this respect may be cited some russian nobleman for example may possess industrious slaves who possess many thousands of roubles and who enjoy them as their master enjoys his property but these are particular cases which do not alter the ordinary rule when a judgment is to be formed respecting a general arrangement it is not necessary to stop at these singular and transient cases in this short exposition of the inconveniences of slavery no attempt has been made to excite emotion nothing has been addressed to the imagination no odious character has been thrown upon masters in general by generalizing particular abuses of power nothing has been said of the terrible methods of rigour and constraint employed in their domestic government without law without process without appeal without publicity and almost without restraint since responsibility as we have seen can only exist in extraordinary cases every thing which belongs to feeling may be easily accused of exaggeration but the simple evidence of reason cannot be gainsayed and it is so strong there can be no need to employ any suspicious colours the proprietors of slaves whom personal interest has not made insensible to feeling and humanity must acknowledge the advantages of liberty and desire the abolition of slavery if this abolition could take place without overturning their own condition and their fortunes and without attacking their personal security the injustice and the calamity which have accompanied precipitate attempts form the greatest objection against projects of emancipation this operation need not be suddenly carried into effect by a violent revolution which by displeasing every body destroying all property and placing all persons in situations for which they were not fitted might produce evils a thousand times greater than all the benefits that can be expected from it instead of rendering emancipation burthensome to the master it ought as much as possible to be rendered advantageous to him and the first means which naturally offers itself for this purpose is to fix a price at which every slave shall have the right to purchase his freedom unhappily this means is exposed to one strong objection when the interest of the master is opposed to that of the slaves he would prevent their obtaining the sum fixed for their ransom to leave them in ignorance to keep them in poverty to clip their wings in proportion as they grew—such would be his policy but there is this danger only in fixing the price the liberty of purchasing his freedom by mutual consent has no such inconvenience the interest of the slave will lead him to work well for himself that he may have a large price to offer the interest of the master will lead him to allow his slave rapidly to enrich himself that he may derive the greater ransom from him a second method consists in limiting the right of making a will in such manner that in those cases where there is no successor in the direct line emancipation should be of right the hope of inheritance is always very weak in distant successions and this hope would no longer exist when the law became known there would be no injustice when no expectation was disappointed it would be possible even to go a step further at each change of ownership even in the nearest successions a small sacrifice might be made of property in favour of liberty for example a tenth part of the slaves might be set at liberty an inheritance which has just devolved does not present to the heir a determinate value the diminution of a tenth would be scarcely sensible at this period this would be less a loss than a privation of gain upon nephews who have from another side received an inheritance from their fathers the tax in favour of liberty might be still heavier this offering to liberty ought to be determined by lot choice under the pretext of honouring the most worthy would be a source of cabals it would cause more discontent and jealousy than happiness the lot is impartial it gives all an equal chance of happiness it spreads the charm of hope among those whom it does not favour and the dread of being deprived of this chance on account of any crime committed would be another bond to the fidelity of the slaves emancipation ought to take place by families rather than by individuals a father a slave and a son free a son a slave and a father free the contrast is sad and shocking—a source of domestic grief there are other means of accelerating this     desirable object but they can only be discovered by studying the particular circumstances of each country however the bonds of slavery which the legislator cannot break by a single blow time destroys by little and little and the march of liberty though slow is not the less certain all the progress of the human mind of civilization of morality of public wealth of commerce hasten forward by degrees the restoration of individual liberty england and france were once what russia the polish provinces and part of germany are at present landowners need not be alarmed at this change those who possess the soil have a natural power over those who live by their labour the fear that the emancipated bondsmen once free would remove would abandon their native soil and leave the earth uncultivated is absolutely chimerical especially if emancipation were effected in a gradual manner because the slave escapes when he can it is not to be concluded that the free man will remove the opposite conclusion would be more correct the motive for flight no longer exists and all the motives for remaining are strengthened in poland some landowners enlightened as to their own interests or animated by a love of glory have effected a total and simultaneous emancipation in their vast seignories did this generosity cause their ruin altogether the contrary the farmer interested in his labour has been in a condition to pay more than the slave and their lands cultivated by free hands have received every year a new and increased value chapter iii of guardian and ward the weakness of infancy requires continual protection every thing must be done for the infant which can do nothing for itself the perfect development of its physical powers requires many years the development of its intellectual faculties is more slow at a certain age it has already strength and passions but it has not yet sufficient experience to regulate them too sensible of the present and too little sensible of the future it requires an authority more immediate than that of the laws it requires to be governed by rewards and punishments which do not act at long intervals but continually and which may be adapted to all the details of its conduct during the progress of its education the choice of a situation in life or of a profession for a child also requires that he should be subject to a particular authority this choice founded upon personal circumstances upon expectations upon talents or the inclinations of the young pupils upon their facility of applying to one thing in preference to another—in a word upon the probability of success this choice is too complicated to be made by the public magistrate each case requires particular consideration and its decision such an acquaintance with particular details as a public magistrate cannot possess this power of protection and government with respect to individuals considered incapable of protecting and governing themselves constitutes guardianship a kind of domestic magistracy founded upon the manifest wants of those who are subject to it and which ought to comprehend all the powers necessary for attaining its end without going beyond it the powers necessary for the education of a ward are those of choosing his station and fixing his habitation together with the means of reprimanding and correcting him without which authority would be inefficacious these means may be the more easily reduced upon the side of severity in proportion as their application is more certain more immediate and more easily varied and because domestic government possesses an inexhaustible fund of rewards since during the period in which every thing is received there is no concession which may not be made to take the shape of reward with regard to the subsistence of the ward it can only be derived from three sources either his own property or from gifts or from his labour if the ward possess property it is administered in his name and for his advantage by his guardian and all that he does in this respect according to prescribed forms is ratified by the law if the ward have no property he is supported either at the expense of the guardian as is most commonly the case where the guardianship is exercised by the father or mother of the child or at the expense of some charitable establishment or it may be by his own labour as in the case where his services are engaged in an apprenticeship in such manner that the period of his nonvalue is compensated for by the subsequent period guardianship being an office purely burthensome this service is made to fall upon those who have the greatest inclination and facility for discharging it the father and mother are eminently in this situation natural affection generally more strongly disposes them to it than the law still however the law which imposes it on them is not useless it is because children have been abandoned by the immediate authors of their being that this abandonment has been constituted a crime if the dying father have appointed a guardian     to his children it is presumed that no person has known better than he who had the means and inclination to supply his place in this respect hence his choice should be confirmed unless there be strong reasons to the contrary if the father have not provided a guardian this obligation should fall upon a relation attached by interest to the preservation of the family property and by affection or honour to the welfare and education of the children in default of a relation some friend of the orphans should be chosen who will voluntarily discharge this office or some public officer should be appointed for this purpose it is proper to pay attention to the circumstances which may render guardianship unnecessary—advanced age a numerous family infirmities or reasons of prudence and delicacy for example complication of interests c the particular precautions against the abuse of this power belong to the penal laws against offences—an abuse of authority against the person of the ward is referable to the class of personal injuries illicit gains derived from his fortune to that of fraudulent acquisitions c the only thing to be considered is the peculiar circumstance of the offence the violation of confidence but though this renders the offence more odious it is not always a reason for augmenting its punishment on the contrary we shall see elsewhere that it is often a reason for diminishing it the position of the delinquent being more particular the detection of the offence is more easy reparation is more certain and the alarm is less in the case of seduction the character of guardian is an aggravation of the offence as regards general precautions guardianship has often been subject to division by giving the administration of the property to the next of kin who is entitled to succeed to it who in character of heir will have the greatest interest in increasing its value and the care of the person to some other relation more interested in the preservation of his existence some legislators have taken other precautions such as forbidding guardians to purchase the property of their wards or of permitting to these to reenter upon their property sold within a certain number of years after attaining their majority of these two methods the first does not appear subject to great inconveniences the second can only affect the interests of the ward by diminishing the price of his lands in as much as the value is diminished to the purchaser himself in proportion as his possession is rendered precarious and he is afraid to undertake improvements which might prove disadvantageous to him by furnishing an additional motive for reentry both these methods appear useless if the sale of the property be only permitted to be made publicly and under the inspection of the magistrate the most simple method is to allow any person to act in legal matters as the friend of the infant against his guardians either in cases of malversation as to his property or of negligence or violence the law would thus put these feeble beings who are unable to protect themselves under the protection of every generous individual pupillage being a state of dependence is an evil which ought to cease as soon as it is possible without occasioning a greater evil but at what age ought this emancipation to take place this question can only be decided by general presumptions the english law which has fixed the epoch at the age of twentyone years seems much more reasonable than the roman law which has been followed in almost every country in europe and which fixed it at twentyfive years at twentyfive years old the faculties of the man are developed he is sensible of all his powers he yields to advice what he refuses to authority and will be not longer content to be restrained by the bonds of childhood hence the prolongation of domestic authority often produces a state of animosity and irritation equally hurtful to both the parties interested but there are some individuals who never reach maturity or who reach it much later than others provision may be made for these cases by interdiction which is only a prolongation of guardianship during a prolonged childhood chapter iv of parent and child we have already said that in certain respects a parent is the master of his child and in others the guardian in the character of a master he will possess the right of imposing labour upon his children and of employing their labour for his own advantage until the age at which the law establishes their independence this right which is given to parents is an indemnity for the trouble and expense of the education of their children it is desirable that parents should possess an interest and take pleasure in the education of their children whilst this advantage which they may find in rearing them is not less a benefit for the one than the other in the character of guardian a parent possesses all the rights and all the obligations of which mention has been made under that head under the first relation the advantage of the parent is considered under the second that of the child is considered these two     characters are easily reconciled in the hands of a parent in consequence of the natural affection which leads him rather to make sacrifices for his children than to make use of his rights for his own advantage it would seem at the first glance that the legislator need not interfere between parents and children and that he might rely upon the tenderness of the one and the gratitude of the others but this superficial view would be deceptive it is absolutely necessary on one side to limit the parental power and on the other to support filial respect by the laws general rule it is not proper to give any power from the exercise of which the child may lose more than the father would gain when in prussia the right was given to the father in imitation of the romans of preventing his son from marrying without limitation of age this rule was not observed political writers have fallen into opposite excesses with respect to the parental authority some have sought to render it despotic as among the romans others have sought to annihilate it some philosophers have thought that children ought not to be subject to the caprice and ignorance of parents that the state ought to educate them in common the systems of sparta crete and the ancient persians are cited in support of this plan it is forgotten that this public education was only provided for a small class of the citizens because the mass of the people was composed of slaves in this artificial arrangement beside the difficulty of apportioning the expense and the evil of making those parents support the burthen who no longer stand in need of the service and who would no longer be actuated by a feeling of tenderness for their children who would have become almost strangers to them there would also arise a greater inconvenience to the pupils they would not be early prepared for the diversity of conditions which they would be called to occupy the choice even of a profession or business depends upon so many circumstances upon which parents alone can determine that no one else can judge of what is suitable for them nor of the expectations nor of the talents and inclinations of these young pupils besides this plan in which the reciprocal affection between parents and children is reckoned as nothing would be productive of the worst effects by destroying family feeling—by weakening the conjugal union—by depriving the fathers and mothers of those pleasures which they derive from beholding this new generation which springs up around them they would not seek the future welfare of children who would no longer be their property with the same zeal they would not feel towards them a regard which they could not hope to inspire industry no longer excited by paternal affection would not possess the same activity domestic enjoyments would take a course less advantageous to general prosperity as a last reason it may be added that the natural arrangement leaving the choice the manner and the expense of education to the parents may be compared to a series of experiments having for their object the perfection of the general system every thing is advanced and developed by this emulation of individuals by the difference of views and thoughts—in a word by the variety of particular impulses but if every thing were cast in the same mould if instruction every where partook of the character of legal authority errors would be perpetuated and there would be no improvement this perhaps may be considered too long a dissertation respecting a chimera but this platonic notion has in our days led certain celebrated authors astray and an error which has entangled rousseau and helvetius may easily find other defenders chapter v of marriage   inde casas postquam ac pelles ignemque pararunt   et muher conjuncta viro concessit in unum   castaque privatæ veneris connubia læta   cognita sunt prolemque ex se videre creatam   tum genus humanum primum molescere cœpit   luc v   under whatever point of view the institution of marriage is considered the utility of this noble contract is striking it is the bond of society the foundation of civilization marriage considered as a contract has drawn women from the hardest and most humiliating servitude it has distributed the mass of the community into distinct families it has created a domestic magistracy it has trained up citizens it has extended the views of men to the future through their affection for the rising generation it has multiplied the social sympathies in order to estimate all its benefits it is only necessary to imagine for a moment what would be the condition of man without this institution the questions relative to this contract may be reduced to seven—  between what persons may it be permitted   what shall be its duration   upon what conditions shall it be made   at what age   who shall choose   between how many persons   with what formalities §   between what persons shall marriage be permitted if we here follow the guidance of historical facts we shall be greatly embarrassed or   0 rather we shall be unable to deduce a single fixed rule from among the multitude of contradictory customs respectable examples are not wanting for authorising unions which we regard as most criminal nor for prohibiting many which we consider altogether innocent every nation has pretended to follow in this respect what is called the law of nature and has viewed with a kind of horror as polluted and impure every thing not conformed to its own matrimonial laws let us suppose ourselves ignorant of all these local institutions and only consulting the principle of utility let us examine between what persons it is proper to permit and between whom to prohibit this union if we examine the interior of a family composed of persons who differ among themselves in respect of age sex and relative duties strong reasons will present themselves to our minds for prohibiting certain alliances between many individuals of this family i see one reason which directly pleads against allowing such marriages at all a father a grandfather or an uncle holding the place of a father might abuse his power in order to force a young girl to contract an alliance with him which might be hateful to her the more necessary the authority of the parent is the less temptation should be given to its abuse this inconvenience extends only to a small number of incestuous cases and it is not the most weighty it is in the corruption of manners in the evils which would result from transitory connexions without marriage that the true reasons for prohibiting certain alliances must be sought if there were not an insurmountable barrier against marriages between near relations called to live together in the greatest intimacy this close connexion these continual opportunities even friendship itself and its innocent caresses might kindle the most disastrous passions families those retreats in which repose ought to be found in the bosom of order and where the emotions of the soul agitated in the scenes of the world ought to sink to rest—families themselves would become the prey of all the inquietudes the rivalries and the fury of love suspicion would banish confidence the gentlest feelings would be extinguished and eternal enmities and revenges of which the idea alone makes one tremble would usurp their place the opinion of the chastity of young women so powerful an attraction to marriage would not know upon what to repose and the most dangerous snares in the education of youth would be found even in the asylum where they could be least avoided these inconveniences may be arranged under four heads—   evil of rivalry—danger resulting from a real or suspected rivalry between a bridegroom and certain persons of the number of his relations or connexions   hindrance of marriage—danger of depriving the daughters of the chance of forming a permanent and advantageous establishment by means of marriage by diminishing the security of those who may desire to espouse them   relaxation of domestic discipline—danger of inverting the relations among those who ought to command and those who ought to obey or at least weakening the tutelary authority which for the interests of minors ought to be exercised over them by the heads of the family or those who hold their place   physical injury—dangers which may result from premature indulgences with respect to the development of the powers and the health of the individuals table of alliances to be prohibited  a man ought not to marry       the wife or widow of his father or any other of his progenitors inconveniences          any one of his descendants inconveniences          any one of his aunts inconveniences          the wife or widow of any one of his uncles inconveniences          any one of his nieces inconveniences          any one of his sisters inconveniences         the descendants of his wife inconveniences           the mother of his wife inconvenience        the wife or widow of any one of his descendants inconvenience       0 the daughter of the wife of his father by a former husband or of the husband of his mother by a former wife inconvenience      shall a man be permitted to marry the sister of his deceased wife there are reasons for and against the condemnatory reason is the danger of rivalry during the life of the two sisters the justifying reason is the advantage of the children if the mother die what a happiness for them to find a motherinlaw in their own aunt what so likely to moderate the natural dislike to this connexion as so near a relation this last reason appears to me most weighty     but in order to obviate the danger of rivalry power ought to be given to the wife to interdict her house to her sister if the wife do not wish to have her own sister near her what legitimate motive can the husband have for admitting this stranger near to him shall a man be permitted to marry the widow of his brother there are reasons for and against in this as in the preceding case the condemnatory reason is still the danger of rivalry the justifying reason is still the advantage of the children these reasons appear to me to have little force on either side my brother has no more authority over my wife than a stranger and can only see her with my permission the danger of rivalry appears less great upon his part than that of any other the opposing reason is reduced almost to nothing on the other side what the children have to fear from a fatherinlaw is trifling if a motherinlaw be not the enemy of the children of another bed it is a prodigy but a fatherinlaw is commonly their friend their second guardian the difference of the condition of the two sexes the legal subjection of the one the legal empire of the other expose them to opposite foibles which produce contrary effects the uncle is already the natural friend of his nephews and nieces they have nothing to gain in this respect if he become the husband of their mother if they find in a strange fatherinlaw an enemy the protection of their uncle is their resource do they find in him a friend they have acquired another protector which they would not have done if their uncle had become their fatherinlaw the reasons for and the reasons against having little force on the one side or the other it seems that the benefit of liberty ought to cause the balance to incline in favour of permitting these marriages instead of the reasons that are given above for prohibiting marriages within a certain degree of relationship ordinary morality ploughs its way and decides upon all these points of legislation without the trouble of examination these marriages it says are repugnant to nature therefore they ought to be proscribed this argument alone does not furnish a justifying reason in sound logic for forbidding any one action whatsoever in those cases in which the repugnance is real the law is useless to what good purpose prohibit what no one wishes to do the natural repugnance is a sufficient prohibition but in those cases where the repugnance does not exist the reason ceases ordinary morality has nothing further to say respecting the prohibition of the act in question since all its argument founded upon natural distaste is destroyed by the opposite supposition if it be proper to conform to nature that is to say to the inclination of the desires it is proper equally to conform to its decisions whatever they may be if it be proper to prohibit these marriages when they are disliked it is proper to permit them when they are approved nature deserves not more regard when it hates than when it loves and desires it is very seldom that the passion of love developes itself within the circle of individuals among whom it ought properly to be prohibited a certain degree of surprise seems necessary for exciting this sentiment a sudden effect of novelty and it is this which the poets have cleverly expressed by the ingenious allegory of the bow and arrows and the blindfolding of cupid individuals accustomed to be seen and to be known from the age which is incapable of conceiving or inspiring desire will be seen with the same eyes to the end of life—this inclination will find no determinate period for its commencement the affections have taken another course they are so to speak a river which has dug its own bed and which cannot change it nature therefore agrees sufficiently well with the principle of utility still it is not proper to trust to it alone there are circumstances which may give birth to the inclination and in which the alliance might become an object of desire if it were not prohibited by the laws and branded by public opinion among the grecian dynasty of the egyptian sovereigns the heir to the throne commonly espoused one of his sisters this was apparently to avoid the danger of an alliance with the family of a subject or with the family of a stranger in such a rank such marriages may be exempt from the inconveniences attendant upon them in private life royal opulence admits a separation and a seclusion which could not be maintained in a medium station policy has produced some examples almost similar in modern times in our days the kingdom of portugal has approximated to the egyptian custom the reigning queen has had for her husband her nephew and subject but in order to efface the stain of incest catholic princes and nobles can apply to an experienced chemist who changes at pleasure the colour of certain actions protestants to whom this laboratory is shut have not the faculty of marrying their aunts the lutherans have however given the example of an extension of privileges the inconveniences of these alliances are not felt by those who contract them the evil is altogether in the example a permission granted to one makes every body else     feel the prohibition as tyrannical where the yoke is not the same for all it appears more weighty to those who bear it it has been said that these marriages into the same blood cause the race to degenerate and that there is a necessity of crossing the race among men as well as among animals this objection might have some value if under the empire of liberty marriages among relations should become the most common but it is enough to refute bad reasons and even this would be too much if a good cause were not served when the feeble and fallacious arguments by which it is sought to support it are destroyed some wellintentioned persons think that they ought not to take from good morals any of its supports even when they are founded in falsehood this error is related to that of the devotees who have thought to serve the cause of religion by pious frauds instead of strengthening they have weakened it by exposing it to the derision of its adversaries when a depraved mind has triumphed over a false argument it reckons that it has triumphed over morality itself §   for what period examination of divorce if the law had not determined any thing respecting the duration of the marriage contract if individuals were permitted to form this engagement like every other for a longer or shorter term—what would be the most common arrangement under the auspices of liberty would it be very different from the established rules the object of the man in this contract might be only to satisfy a transient passion and this passion satisfied he would have had all the advantage of the union without any of its inconveniences it cannot be the same with the woman this engagement has for her durable and burthensome consequences after the inconveniences of pregnancy after the perils of childbirth she is charged with the cares of maternity hence the union which confers upon the man pleasures only is for the woman the commencement of a long circle of pains whose inevitable termination would be death if she were not beforehand assured of the cares and protection of a husband both for herself and the germ which she ought to nourish in her bosom i give myself to you she says to him but you shall be the guardian of my condition of weakness and you shall provide for the preservation of the fruit of our love such is the beginning of a society which would be prolonged during many years if we suppose the birth of only a single child but other births would form other ties in proportion as years advance the engagement is prolonged the limits which might have been first assigned will have disappeared and a new career will have opened itself to the pleasures and reciprocal duties of the married persons when the mother can no longer hope for more children when the father has provided for the support of the youngest of the family will the engagement be dissolved after a cohabitation of many years will it be supposed that the married persons will separate habit will have entwined around their hearts a thousand and a thousand ties which death only could destroy the children will form a new centre of union they will create a new source of pleasures and hopes they will render the father and mother necessary the one to the other by the cares and charms of a common affection which no one could share with them the ordinary course of the conjugal union would therefore be for the duration of life and if it is natural to suppose in the woman sufficient prudence thus to stipulate with respect to her dearest interests ought less to be expected from a father or a guardian who possesses more maturity of experience the woman has also a particular interest in the indefinite duration of the connexion time pregnancy suckling cohabitation itself—all conspire to diminish the effect of her charms she must expect to see her beauty decline at a time when the strength of the man still goes on increasing she knows that after having spent her youth with one husband she would with difficulty find a second whilst the man would not experience a similar difficulty in finding a second wife hence this new clause which foresight would dictate to her i give myself to you you shall not leave me without my consent the man demands the same promise and hence on both sides a legitimate contract is founded upon the happiness of the two parties marriage for life is therefore the most natural marriage the best suited to the wants and circumstances of families the most favourable for individuals and for the generality of the species if there were no laws to ordain it that is to say no other laws than those which sanction contracts this arrangement would be always the most common because it is that which is most suitable to the reciprocal interests of the persons marrying love on the part of the man love and foresight on the part of the woman all concur with enlightened prudence and affection on the part of parents in impressing the character of perpetuity upon the contract of this alliance but what should we think if the woman should add this clause it shall not be lawful for me to be separated from you should we come to hate each other as much as we now love one another such a condition     would appear to be an act of madness it is something contradictory and absurd which shocks at the first glance every body would agree to regard such a vow as rash and to think that humanity ought to cause it to be abolished but this cruel and absurd clause is not demanded by the woman is not sought for by the man it is imposed upon them both as a condition from which they cannot escape the law unexpectedly intervenes between the contracting parties it surprises them in the transports of their youth in the moments which open all the vistas of happiness it says to them you unite yourselves in the hope of being happy but i tell you that you enter into a prison whose door will be closed against you i shall be inexorable to the cries of your grief and when you dash yourselves against your fetters i shall not permit you to be delivered to believe in the perfection of the beloved object to believe in the eternity of the passion which is felt and which is inspired—such are the illusions which may be pardoned to two children in the blindness of love but aged lawyers legislators whose heads are whitened by years ought not to give place to this chimera if they believe in this eternity of these passions to what good purpose interdict a power which no one would ever wish to use but no they have foreseen inconstancy they have foreseen hatred they have foreseen that the most violent love may be succeeded by the most violent antipathy and it is with all the coolness of indifference that they have pronounced the eternity of this vow even when the sentiment which has dictated it shall be effaced by the contrary feeling if there were a law which permitted an associate a guardian a superintendent a companion only on condition of never separating from them every one would exclaim against such tyranny and such folly a husband is a companion a guardian a superintendent a partner and still more all at once and yet it is only possible in the greatest number of civilized countries to have eternal husbands to live under the constant authority of a man that one detests is already a species of slavery to be constrained to receive his embraces is a misery too great to be tolerated even in slavery itself it has been said the yoke is reciprocal—the reciprocity only doubles the misery if marriage commonly present to men the only means of fully and peaceably satisfying the imperious desires of love to deter them from it is to deprive them of its sweets is to produce an evil proportionably great but what greater bugbear can there be than the indissolubility of this contract marriage service country whatsoever condition there is a prohibition against quitting—there is a prohibition against entering in conclusion when death is the only means of deliverance what horrible temptations what crimes may not result from a position so terrible the unknown instances are perhaps more numerous than those which are known but that which will most frequently take place in this respect is the negative offence when the crime is easy even to hearts which are not perverted—when nothing more is necessary for its accomplishment than inaction—if a detested wife and an adored mistress are exposed to the same danger—will the same efforts be made as sincerely as generously for the first as for the second it is not proper to dissimulate there are objections against the dissolubility of marriages we shall endeavour to collect and to answer them first objection—permit divorce neither of the parties will regard their lot as irrevocably fixed the husband will cast his eyes around him to find a wife who would be more advantageous the woman would make similar comparisons and form projects for changing her husband hence perpetual and reciprocal insecurity would result with respect to this precious kind of property with regard to which the whole plan of life is arranged answer  —this same inconvenience exists in part under other names when marriages are indissoluble according to the supposition reciprocal attachment is extinct it is not a new wife that is sought but a new mistress it is not a second husband but another lover the duties of hymen and its prohibitions too easily eluded may perhaps serve to excite inconstancy rather than to prevent it it is well known that prohibitions and constraint serve to stimulate the passions it is a truth deduced from experience that even obstacles by occupying the imagination by directing the mind to the same object serve only to strengthen the desire of overcoming them the reign of liberty produces less wandering fancies than that of conjugal captivity render marriages dissoluble there will be more apparent but there will be fewer real separations   the inconveniences need not be considered alone the advantages ought to be regarded also each one knowing what he was liable to lose would cultivate those means of pleasing which originally produced the reciprocal affection each will more carefully study the others character and the means of managing it each will feel the necessity of making some sacrifices of caprice and selflove in a word care attention complaisance will be continued in the married state and that which was done only to obtain love will be done to preserve it       marriageable young persons would be less frequently sacrificed by the avarice and cupidity of their relations it would be necessary properly to consult their inclinations before forming bonds which would be broken by repugnancies the real suitability upon which happiness reposes—the relations of age education and taste—would then enter into the calculations of prudence it would be no longer possible to marry the property as has been said without marrying the person before an establishment were formed there would be an examination whether it would be durable second objection—each party regarding the connexion as transitory would only espouse with indifference the interests and especially the pecuniary interests of the other hence would arise profusion negligence and every species of bad management answer—the same danger exists in commercial partnerships and yet the danger is very rarely realized a dissoluble marriage has a bond which these partnerships have not the strongest the most durable of all moral ties affection for their common children which cements the reciprocal affection of married persons among indissoluble marriages is not this bad management more frequently found than in commercial partnerships why it is an effect of the indifference and distaste which give to married persons who are tired of each other a continual desire to escape from themselves and to seek for new distractions the moral tie of their children is dissolved their education the care of their future welfare is scarcely a secondary object the charm of their common interest has vanished each one in the pursuit of his own pleasures troubles himself but little with what will happen after him hence a principle of disunion among married persons introduces negligence and disorder by a thousand channels into their domestic affairs and the ruin of their fortune is often an immediate consequence of the estrangement of their hearts under the reign of liberty this evil would not exist before there was a disunion of interests disgust would have separated the persons the facility of divorce tends rather to prevent than to give birth to prodigality it would produce a dread of giving so legitimate a reason for discontent to an associate whose esteem it is desirable to conciliate economy appreciated at its full value by the interested prudence of both parties would always have so much merit in their eyes as would cover many faults and in its favour they would pardon many wrongs it must also be perceived that in case of a divorce that one of the two parties who shall have the character of having behaved ill and been extravagant would have much less chance of forming other more advantageous connexions third objection—the dissolubility of marriage will give the stronger of the two parties an inclination to maltreat the feebler for the purpose of constraining its consent to the divorce answer—this objection is well founded it deserves the greatest attention on the part of the legislator a single precaution however is happily sufficient to diminish the danger in case of maltreatment liberty to the party maltreated and not to the other in this case the more a husband desired a divorce for the purpose of marrying again the more he would avoid behaving ill towards his wife for fear lest certain acts should be construed as acts of violence intended to constrain her consent gross and brutal methods being forbidden there remain only gentle methods of engaging her to a separation fourth objection—this is drawn from the interest of the children what will they do when the law has dissolved the union between the father and the mother answer—that which they would have done if death had dissolved it but in the case of divorce their disadvantage is not so great the children may continue to live with the parent whose cares are most necessary for them for the law consulting their interest would not fail to entrust the boys to the father and the daughters to the mother the great danger to which children are exposed after the death of a parent is that of passing under the government of a father or motherinlaw who shall look upon them with the eyes of an enemy daughters especially are exposed to the most vexatious treatment under the habitual despotism of a stepmother in the case of a divorce this danger does not exist the boys will have their father for their governor and the daughters will have their mother their education will suffer less than it would have suffered from their domestic strifes and quarrels if then the interest of the children were a sufficient reason for prohibiting second marriages in case of a divorce it is a still stronger reason for prohibiting them in case of death in conclusion the dissolution of a marriage is an act sufficiently important to be submitted to some formalities which would at least have the effect of preventing caprice and allowing the two parties time for reflection the intervention of a magistrate is necessary not only for proving that there has been no violence on the part of the man in forcing the consent of the wife but also for the purpose of interposing a greater or less delay between the demand for a divorce and the divorce itself     this is one of those questions upon which opinions will be always divided every one will be led to approve or condemn divorce according to the good or evil which he has seen resulting from particular cases or according to his particular interest in england a marriage may be dissolved in case of adultery but it is necessary to seek for a divorce through many tribunals and an act of parliament upon this subject costs at least five hundred pounds sterling divorce is therefore accessible only to a very limited class in scotland adultery is a sufficient ground for a divorce the law is mild in this respect but it has a rigorous side it does not permit the culpable party to contract another marriage with the accomplice of his guilt in sweden divorce is permitted for adultery on both sides this amounts to the same as if it were permitted upon mutual consent the man allows himself to be accused of adultery and the marriage is dissolved in denmark the law is the same at least when collusion cannot be proved under the code frederick parties might separate by agreement and afterwards be remarried upon condition of remaining single a whole year it would seem that this interval or a part of this interval would have been better employed in delay before granting the divorce at geneva adultery was a sufficient reason but the separation might also be effected on account of simple incompatibility of character a woman by quitting the house of her husband and retiring to that of her friends and relations afforded grounds for a demand which had always the legal effect of a divorce divorces were however rare but as they were proclaimed in all the churches this proclamation acted as a species of punishment or public censure which was always dreaded when marriages were rendered dissoluble in france at the will of the parties there were between five and six hundred divorces at paris in two years but these took place whilst the institution was new and when therefore it would not be possible to judge of its usual operation divorces are not common in those countries in which they have been long authorized the same reasons which hinder legislators from permitting them deter individuals from availing themselves of them when they are permitted the government which interdicts them takes upon itself to decide that it understands the interests of individuals better than they do themselves the effect of the law is evil or null in all civilized countries the woman who has experienced illtreatment on the part of her husband has obtained from the tribunals what is called a separation there does not result from this permission to either of the parties to remarry the ascetic principle the enemy of pleasure has permitted the mitigation of punishment but the injured wife and her tyrant are subjected to the same condition this apparent equality covers great real inequality opinion allows great liberty to the stronger sex but imposes great restraint upon the weaker one §   on what conditions the only inquiry at present is what are the matrimonial conditions which according to the principle of utility are suitable to the greatest number for it ought to be lawful for the parties interested in these contracts to make their own particular stipulations in other words the conditions ought to be left to their own will saving the ordinary exceptions— first condition—the wife should submit to the laws of the husband saving recourse to justice master of the wife as to what regards his own interests he ought to be guardian of the wife as to what regards her interests between the wishes of two persons who pass their life together there may at every moment be a contradiction the benefit of peace renders it desirable that a preeminence should be established which should prevent or terminate these contests but why is the man to be the governor because he is the stronger in his hands power sustains itself place the authority in the hands of the wife every moment will be marked by revolt on the part of the husband this is not the only reason it is also probable that the husband by the course of his life possesses more experience greater aptitude for business greater powers of application in these respects there are exceptions but the question is what ought to be the general law i have said saving recourse to justice for it is not proper to make the man a tyrant and to reduce to a state of passive slavery the sex which by its weakness and its gentleness has the greatest need of protection the interests of females have too often been neglected at rome the laws of marriage were only the code of the strongest and the shares were divided by the lion but those who from some vague notion of justice and of generosity would bestow upon females an absolute equality would only spread a dangerous snare for them to set them free as much as it is possible for the laws so to do from the necessity of pleasing their husbands would be in a moral point of view to weaken instead of strengthen their empire the man secure of his prerogative has no uneasiness arising from his selflove and derives enjoyment even from sacrificing it     substitute to this relation a rivalry of powers the pride of the strongest would be continually wounded and would prove a dangerous antagonist for the more feeble and placing a greater value upon what was taken than upon what was still possessed it would direct all its efforts to the reestablishment of its preeminence second condition—the administration should belong to the man alone this is a natural and immediate consequence of his empire besides it is commonly by his labour that the property is acquired third condition—the right of enjoyment should be in common this condition is admitted  st for the benefit of equality  d in order to give to both parties the same degree of interest in the domestic prosperity but this right is necessarily modified by the fundamental law which subjects the wife to the authority of the husband the diversity of conditions and the nature of property would require many details on the part of the legislator but this is not the place for stating them fourth condition—the wife shall observe conjugal fidelity the reasons which direct that adultery should be considered as a crime need not be exposed here they belong properly to the penal code fifth condition—the husband shall observe similar conjugal fidelity the reasons for considering the adultery of the husband as criminal will also belong to the penal code they have less weight but there are still sufficient reasons for establishing this legal condition §   at what age at what age should it be lawful to marry it ought not to be before the age at which the contracting parties can be considered capable of understanding the value of this engagement and more regard should be paid to this particular in those countries in which marriages are considered indissoluble how many are the precautions which ought to be taken in order to prevent a rash engagement when repentance would be useless the right ought not in this case to have a period anterior to that at which the individual enters upon the administration of his property it would be absurd that a man should be able to dispose of himself for ever at an age at which it is not lawful for him to sell a field of the value of ten crowns §   who shall choose upon whom shall the choice of a husband or a wife depend this question presents an apparent if not a real absurdity as if such a choice could belong to any other than the party interested the laws ought never to entrust this power to the parents—they want two things requisite for its beneficial exercise the requisite knowledge and a will directed to the right end the manner in which parents and children see and feel is not the same they have not the same interests love is the moving principle of youth the old scarcely feel it fortune in general is a feeble consideration among children it is an important one with parents what the child wishes is to be happy what the parent wishes is that he may also appear to be so the child would sacrifice every thing for love but the parents would often sacrifice this interest to every other to receive into their family a soninlaw or a daughterinlaw whom they dislike is a disagreeable circumstance but is it not much more cruel for the children to be deprived of the husband or the wife which would make them happy compare the sufferings on both sides is there any equality compare the probable duration of the life of the parent and the child see if you ought to sacrifice that which is just commencing to that which is drawing to a close thus much for the simple right to prevent what shall be said if under the mask of a parent an unpitying tyrant should seek to abuse the gentleness and timidity of his child in order to compel a union with a person that was detested the connexions of children depend greatly upon those of their parents this is partly true as respects the sons and entirely as respects the daughters if the parents neglect to use this right if they do not strive to direct the inclinations of their family if they leave the choice of their acquaintances to chance—to whom are the imprudences of their youth to be ascribed in conclusion in taking from them the right to bind or to compel it is not necessary to take from them that of modifying and retarding two periods may be distinguished in the marriageable age during the first want of consent on the part of the parents ought to suffice for annulling the marriage during the second they should still have the right to retard for some months the completion of the contract this time should be given them that they might make use of their advice there exists a custom sufficiently singular in one country in europe renowned for the wisdom of its institutions the consent of the parents is necessary to the marriage of minors unless the lovers can travel a hundred leagues without being stopped but if they have the good fortune to cross a small stream ascend a slight hill and reach a certain village they may in a moment pronounce the nuptial vow before the first comer though he ask them no question—and the marriage is valid and the parental authority is overthrown     is it for the encouragement of adventurers that a privilege of this kind is allowed to subsist is it from a secret desire to weaken the power of parents or to favour what are otherwise called unequal matches §   how many contracting parties between how many persons ought this contract to subsist at one time—in other words ought polygamy to be tolerated—polygamy is either simple or double it is simple where there is polygynia a multiplicity of wives or polyandria a multiplicity of husbands is polygynia useful or hurtful every thing which it has been possible to say in its favour has only related to certain particular cases to certain transitory circumstances when a man by the sickness of his wife is deprived of the sweets of marriage or when by his profession he is obliged to divide his time between two residences as the commander of a vessel c that such an arrangement may sometimes be desirable to the man is possible but it never can be so to the wives for every man there would always be two wives whose interest would be sacrificed   the effect of such a license would be to aggravate the inequality of conditions the superiority of wealth has already too great an ascendancy and this institution would make it still greater a rich man forming an alliance with a woman without fortune would take advantage of her position to prevent his having a rival each of his wives would find herself in possession only of the moiety of a husband whilst she might have constituted a source of happiness to another man who in consequence of this iniquitous arrangement would be deprived of a companion   what would become of the peace of families the jealousies of the rival wives would spread among the children they would form opposed parties little armies having each at their head an equally powerful protectrix at least with respect to her rights what a scene of contentions what fury what animosity from the relaxation of the fraternal bonds there would result a similar relaxation of filial respect each child would behold in his father a protector of his enemy all his actions of kindness or severity being interpreted by opposite prejudices would be attributed to unjust feelings of hatred or affection the education of the children would be ruined in the midst of these hostile passions under a system of favour or oppression which would corrupt the one party by its rigours and the other by its indulgences in the east polygamy and peace are found united but it is slavery which prevents discord one abuse palliates another every thing is tranquil under the same yoke there results from it an increase of authority to the husband what eagerness to satisfy him what pleasure in supplanting a rival by an action which is likely to please him would this be an evil or a good those who from a low opinion of women imagine that they cannot be too submissive ought to consider polygamy admirable those who think that the ascendancy of this sex is favourable to suavity of manners—that it augments the pleasures of society—that the gentle and persuasive authority of women is salutary in a family—ought to consider this institution as very mischievous there is no need of seriously discussing polyandria nor double polygamy perhaps too much has been said upon this first subject if it were not well to show the true foundations upon which manners are seated §   with what formalities the formalities of this contract ought to refer to two objects  st to ascertain the fact of the free consent of the two parties and of the lawfulness of their union  dly to notify and ascertain the celebration of the marriage for the future it would also be proper to exhibit to both the contracting powers the rights they are about to acquire and the obligations with which they will be chargeable according to law most nations have attached a great solemnity to this act and it is not to be doubted but that ceremonies which strike the imagination serve to impress the mind with the importance and dignity of the contract in scotland the law much too easy does not require any formality the reciprocal declaration of the man and the woman in the presence of a witness is sufficient to render a marriage valid hence it is to a village upon the frontier of scotland named gretna green that minors impatient of the yoke of their parents or guardians hasten to emancipate themselves by an offhand marriage in instituting these forms two dangers ought to be avoided  st the rendering them so embarrassing as to prevent a marriage when neither freedom of consent nor the necessary knowledge are wanting  dly the giving to the persons who ought to concur the power of abusing this right and of employing it to a bad purpose in many countries it is necessary to tarry long in the vestibule of the temple before advancing to the altar under the title of affiances the chains of the engagement are borne without its advantages what purpose does this work of supererogation answer except the multiplication of embarrassments and snares the code frederick is justly     chargeable in this respect with useless restraints the english law on the contrary has on this occasion chosen the part of simplicity and clearness every one knows to what he is bound a man is either married or he is not appendix of the levelling system all human creatures are born and remain says the declaration of rights equal in rights it has hence been argued that they ought to be equal in property and that all the distinctions which have grown up in society in this respect should be swept away and every individual placed on the same level in point of actual possessions such a system would however be destructive both of security and wealth it would be destructive of security what a man has inherited from his ancestors—what he has himself earned he hopes to keep and this hope cannot be interrupted without producing a pain of disappointment but if of two persons the one is to take from the other a portion of the property he possesses today because he is the poorer for the same reason a third should take a portion of such property from both tomorrow as being poorer than either and so on till all security in the possession of property—all hope of retaining it were altogether abolished as no man could at this rate be secure of enjoying any thing for two moments together no man would give himself the trouble to improve any thing by his labour all men would live from hand to mouth while the levelling process is going on it is destructive to security when completed it is destructive and that for ever of national opulence the wealth of a nation is the sum of the fortunes of individuals but the sum of the fortunes of individuals is reduced by the levelling system in an infinity of ways whatever be the quantum of wealth allowed of to reduce fortunes to this standard the community must be emptied of all articles of wealth which cannot exist but in a quantum superior to that standard the english nation is for a nation of any considerable size generally acknowledged to be the richest in proportion to the number of the people of any nation under the sun but in this richest nation those who have reckoned its wealth at the highest have not set down the annual expenditure of its inhabitants taking even the very richest into the account at more than £ 0 ayear each if then the whole wealth of the nation were divided with the most perfect equality among its inhabitants and were all of it capable of being thus divided it would scarcely be more than sufficient to enable every one of them so long as the stock of it was kept up at the same level to spend more than £ 0 ayear but were such a distribution to be made an immense multitude of articles—wealth to an immense amount—must necessarily be struck out as being incapable of division and thence incapable of entering into the distribution at  0 years purchase a perpetual income of £ 0 ayear corresponds to a capital or principal sum of £ 00 all articles therefore of a value superior to £ 00 must either be destroyed at once or left to perish sooner or later for want of being kept up that is kept in repair and properly taken care of the following then are the articles to the existence of which the system in question would be fatal and that not only in the first instance but for ever after during its continuance and of which the aggregate value must therefore be struck out of the aggregate amount of the national wealth   all buildings above the mark that is all that would now be thought to come under the name of considerable buildings—all considerable dwellinghouses warehouses manufactories   all furniture except what is now of the meanest kind—all furniture suitable to the circumstances of a family having more than £ 0 ayear ahead to live on   all horses except a few of those at present kept for husbandry no one nor two in a family could afford to keep a horse since the expense of that article alone would exceed the family income all horses fit for military service consequently a great part of the manure which is supplied by that valuable species of cattle would be lost in the earliest and what are vulgarly called the purest times of the roman commonwealth those whose wealth enabled them to serve on horseback formed an order of men distinct from and superior to those who served on foot a commonwealth that admitted of such distinctions could never be tolerated under this system of equalisation   all considerable libraries all libraries     the value of which depended upon their completeness in regard to any particular branch of literature and of which the characteristic value would be destroyed by the degree of dispersion which the execution of the equalisation plan would necessitate   all considerable collections of natural history and hence all means of prosecuting that branch of study to advantage would cease   all considerable laboratories and establishments for the prosecution of experimental inquiries with a view to the advancement of agriculture manufactures or arts hence all means of promoting the advancement or even preventing the decay of experimental science would cease   all fortunes capable of affording funds sufficient for the purchase of the constant supply of publications relative to any branch of knowledge at the rate of abundance at which the literary market is supplied with these productions in the present state of things   all fortunes capable of affording funds applicable to the improvement of land mines or fisheries upon an extensive and advantageous scale   all fortunes capable of affording at an early period of life a fund in store sufficient for the maintenance of the numbers of children of which the marriage union may in every instance and in many instances will eventually be productive  0 the whole value of the labours of those whose industry is at present employed in supplying the productions adapted to the demands of persons in easy circumstances—of all those at present employed as workmen in the different branches of the arts and of the finer manufactures—all musicians architects painters sculptors engravers carvers gilders embroiderers weavers of fine stuffs florists and the like all these finding nobody rich enough to deal with them must immediately betake themselves to husbandry or other coarse labour which their habits of life have disqualified them from exercising to any advantage    the whole of that property which consists in annuities payable by government out of the produce of taxes imposed on the fruits of industry as those taxes are imposed almost exclusively on superfluities and all superfluities will be expunged from the book of national wealth national bankruptcy will be among the necessary and immediate consequences of such a change    whether it be of advantage or of detriment to the state or a matter of indifference that small farms should be laid into large ones is a controverted point upon which it is not necessary here to touch but what can not admit of controversy is that in a multitude of instances farms large or small would suffer much in value by being broken down into smaller ones a spring or pond a convenient communication with the highway or bridge serves at present for the whole of a farm divide this farm among a number of proprietors and only a small part of the original farm or perhaps no part at all will now derive any benefit from that conveniency which before the division was enjoyed by the whole a certain portion of land fit for one sort of culture requires certain other portions of land fit for other sorts of culture to be employed with most advantage—to so much arable so much wood so much meadow land under the division one man has wherewithal to buy the meadow land only another the woodland only and the arable must be divided into several little plots to come within the quantum of purchasemoney which the equalisation plan allows there are fields each of them too large for any one purchaser and which without new inclosures correspondent to the number of the purchasers must lose the benefit of inclosure but the purchasers capital is all of it expended in the purchase he has nothing no fund left for the expenses of inclosure one house one set of outhouses serves for the whole of the farm in its undivided state divide it into the £ 0 ayear portions he who gets the dwellinghouse is perhaps unable to get the outhouses if he get the house and outhouses he perhaps is unable to get any of the land if he get a small scrap of the land and it can be but a small one none of the other fragments of farms carved out of the entire farm has any building belonging to it but without buildings they will be worth little or nothing and as to erecting the buildings it is impossible what capital each man had is expended in the purchase of the naked land but as every man must have a house to live in and every man who cultivates a farm must have outhouses of some kind or other to lodge the stock and produce of it a fund for these articles of indispensable necessity must be provided in the first instance and the fragments of farms must consequently be reduced to the miserable and unproductive pittance the annual value of which corresponds to the small remnant of capital that remains to buy them thus great is the part of the existing mass of wealth which would therefore be destroyed by the division as being in its own nature incapable of division but of that which remained as not being in its own nature incapable of division a great part again would be consumed in the process the whole mass of national property would have to come under the hammer and every time either the sale of an estate or a division of the produce of the sale came to be made every sale   0 and every distribution would afford a fresh source of disputes between the plundered and the plundered between plunderers and plunderers and between plunderers and plundered and a fresh demand for the labours and a fresh harvest for the men of law auctioneers with their retainers are already in the present system of things in no small number men of law in greater number than most people would wish to see on the system in question the populousness of these predatory professions would be multiplied beyond all measure an effective tithe of the national property not to speak of a nominal tithe like the present ecclesiastical one would scarcely be sufficient for the payment of this enormous mass of unproductive and disastrous services present time it may be said is but a point it is as nothing in comparison with futurity admitting that the existing generation might upon the whole be losers by such a change those whose ardent zeal would prompt them to attempt it may still think or affect to think the change an advantageous one for the human species upon the whole but futurity would have as little reason to rejoice in it as present time opulence is valuable not merely on its own account but as a security for subsistence the rich were they to deserve proscription because of their riches deserve to be saved from proscription in quality of bankers to the poor estates broken down to the scantling in question or to any thing like that scantling would afford no resource against scarcity or any other calamity such as fire famine or pestilence that required a considerable treasure in store to be employed to alleviate the load of it they would afford no fund for the expenses of a war even of a defensive one along with the whole stock of opulence would go that branch of security which depends upon the means of national defence in war the measure of raising within the year supplies for the service of the year—desirable as such a measure would in the opinion of every one be if it were practicable has always been given up as attended with too much difficulty and even danger to be attempted and this even in the present state of opulence when the number of those capable of contributing and contributing largely is so great how would it be when those who were best able to contribute had but £ 0 ayear to live on it is now looked upon as impracticable then it would be beyond measure more so even though every man had his £ 0 ayear much more when that pittance is reduced to perhaps twothirds perhaps half by the various causes of reduction which would be in operation at the same time to raise the supplies otherwise than within the year would be still more palpably impracticable it would be physically impossible at present if so many millions are raised with so much ease within the year by way of loan it is because there are so many thousands of persons who have each so many thousands of pounds to lend so many thousands more than they have need to employ otherwise upon the equalisation scheme all these monied men would be no more nobody would have any thing he could spare for any length of time much less for ever no man would have any thing but from hand to mouth as to the gainers—i speak always of the immediate and momentary gainers for ultimately as we shall see there would scarcely be a real gainer left in the nation—as to the real gainers if they were to be looked for any where it would be in the class of the present daylabourers in husbandry their employment need not be changed they would continue labourers in husbandry with this comfortable difference as it would be thought of labouring upon and for the benefit of their own property instead of other peoples but even these would for the most part gain nothing but ruin by the change their fragments of farms having no buildings on them would be useless to them till buildings could be erected a man might farm profitably and live comfortably a year or two hence if he were then alive but in the meantime he would not be able to farm or live at all the immense multitude of new created farms all of them without buildings would require an immense and instant multiplication of the number of workmen concerned in building but this number instead of being multiplied or so much as increased would be as immediately and permanently reduced for they too would have their portions as well as the labourers in husbandry if they laboured any longer it would be upon their own property not upon other peoples if they laboured at all what inducement would they have to labour upon other peoples property or indeed for other people what would they get by it an addition to their respective portions but that by the supposition is not to be suffered no sooner was it become property than it would come to be divided no sooner had they got it than it would be taken from them this supposes every body daylabourers and mechanics devoted to industry disposed to frugality proof against all temptation to excess even in the midst of a sudden and unexpected influx of the momentary means of excess and dissipation but even in the present system of things this extraordinary degree of moderation is under such circumstances hardly to be expected from one in ten among those classes and under the proposed     new system industry and frugality would be but folly as we shall presently have occasion to observe who would be the losers—i mean the immediate losers—by such a change those and at first sight it might seem those only whose present fortunes are above the mark but these would be but a small part of the real and effective losers to the list of present proprietors must be added that of all those sons of industry whose present annual earnings are to a certain amount superior in value to the intended common portion—all professional men in any tolerable practice—physicians surgeons lawyers artists factors and the like—many handicrafts of the superior kind such as mathematicalinstrument makers millwrights shipwrights musicalinstrument makers c and even mere labourers where the labour is severe as coalheavers c earn from £ 0 to £ 00 ayear which the greater part of them are in the habit of spending as it comes what would be either their present feelings or even their future advantage on changing their £ 0 or £ 00 ayear for life into a perpetuity even of £ 0 ayear supposing the common portion could amount to so much instead of falling widely short of that mark as it will soon be seen to do equalisation laws made at the expense of existing rights and expectations are alike destructive to present security in respect to property and to permanent security in respect of subsistence the desire to establish such laws or to cause them to be established—the love the passion for equality has its root not in virtue but in vice not in benevolence but in malevolence a law of this complexion is a mere act of robbery—but of robbery upon a large scale in the nature and quality of its effects it is undistinguishable from the crime that goes by that name but in point of extent the mischief of it is as much greater as the power of the government is greater than that of the private robber the power of the ordinary robber goes not beyond a few moveables and such moveables as may easily and speedily be conveyed away the power of the legislating robber extends to immoveables—to every thing—to the future as well as to the present the power of the ordinary robber extends not beyond the few whom chance may throw in his way the power of the authorised robber extends over the whole territory of the state the passion for equality has no root in the benevolent affections its root is either simply in the selfish affections or in the selfish combined with the malevolent you being superior to me in wealth or power my wish is that we may be equal what is the object of that wish in what possible way can it have its gratification in one or other and only in one or other of two ways either by raising myself to your level or by pulling you down to mine if it be the first only that is in my thoughts selfinterest and that only is my ruling motive if the first and the second envy conjoined with selfishness are the passions that govern me the man of benevolence is the man to whom the spectacle of anothers happiness is delightful the lover of equality in its most refined form is the man to whose eyes the spectacle of anothers prosperity is intolerable what is the envious man but the same what then is this so much boasted passion for equality it is a propensity which begins in vice and leads to ruin in the scale of merit it is as much below selfishness as selfishness is below the virtue of benevolence equality were it brought to the highest pitch of perfection to which the hearts of the most sanguine votaries of the equalisation plan could wish to carry it would still be but the semblance of equality in effect if equality in point of wealth be desirable it can only be so in the quality of an efficient cause of equality in point of happiness at least in as far as the quantum of happiness depends on that of wealth but of equality in point of wealth nothing like equality in point of happiness can be the result not even in so far as happiness depends on wealth equality in point of wealth is equality in point of means of happiness but what does equality of means in favour of happiness where equality in point of wants is wanting the allotments in point of wealth to be productive of equality in point of happiness must be not equal but proportional not equal to one another but all of them proportioned to mens respective wants it is only from proportionality not from equality in point of wealth that equality in point of happiness can arise where is the equality between me and my robust and healthy neighbour if i am dying for want of that relief in the way of medicine seabathing or change of air which a portion of his allotment out of the estate that was all of it mine but is now shared with him and others would have enabled me to procure inequality is the natural condition of mankind subjection is the natural state of man it is the state into which he is born it is the state in which he always has been born and always will be so long as man is man it is the state in which he must continue for some of the first years of his life on pain of perishing absolute equality is absolutely impossible absolute liberty is directly repugnant to the existence of every kind of government all human creatures are born and remain says the declaration of rights equal in rights     the child of two years old has as much right to govern the father then as the father has to govern the child without the subjection of either the wife to her husband or the husband to the wife no domestic society as between man and wife could subsist without the subjection of the children to the parent no domestic society as between parent and child could subsist all children under a certain age must soon perish and the species become extinct but the persons thus placed under subjection by nonage are at least half of the species and those placed in a similar state by marriage not less than a third of the remaining half subjection then is the natural and unavoidable state of at least twothirds of the species and if it were possible that any thing like independence could subsist among any part of it it could only be among the remaining third as the doctrine of universal independence is repugnant to possibility and the nature of things so is the doctrine of universal equality absolutely repugnant to the existence of general independence in as far as independence is possible those who are exempt from domestic subjection can in no intelligible sense be said to be equal in point of rights to those who are under it if universal equality then were the object that ought to be in view universal subjection as strict as domestic subjection would be the only means of obtaining it universal equality by independence you cannot possibly have equality as universal as you please by subjection as universal as you please you may have if you desire to have it with one exception only that of the monarch the great point is to get any government at all it is the most useful point and the most difficult when once you have got your government and got it tolerably settled then is the time to temper it but why combat shadows it may be said and expatiate upon a scheme of equalisation which you are representing as impracticable it is only for equality so far and so far only as it is practicable and practicable to advantage that we contend for the lopping off the superfluities of overgrown and excessive opulence for alleviating the sufferings of excessive misery for planting and maintaining the virtuous race of industrious proprietors for planting and maintaining plenty without luxury and independence without insolence to push any system to an absurd excess and then give the abuse of the system as the system itself—what can be more uncandid or more inconclusive your objections would be just enough if applied to the abuse of the system proposed but have no force against a moderate and prudent application of it my answer is that it admits not of any moderate or prudent application that the principle admits not of your stopping anywhere in the application of it that on pain of abandoning and passing condemnation on the principle when once the process of forced equalisation is begun it must go on and be pursued all lengths even to the lengths that have been described that the principles publicly avowed by the professed partisans of equality go all these lengths in the very words as well as according to the spirit of their most public and most boasted productions that the doctrine of equal rights is laid down without reserve that no line is drawn or attempted to be drawn that the words employed exclude the drawing of any such line and that if any line had been drawn or were to be attempted to be drawn the attempt would not so much as palliate much less remedy the evil and that to the imputation of error it would only add the reproach of inconsistency and dereliction of principle to stop at any one point in the career of forced equalisation would neither afford security to such of the rich as it left unplundered nor satisfaction to the poor whom it left unenriched an object being avowed which can never be attained so long as i have a penny more than the beggar that plies before my door what assurance can i give myself any day says the rich man who hath as yet been spared that it may not be my turn the next will the vagabonds that have as yet got no share be satisfied with the plunder that has fallen to the lot of their brother vagabonds that are consuming theirs where is the justice where the equality of this pretended equalisation plan cries the expectant beggar whom the division has not yet reached why have my wants been so long neglected while those of my neighbour have been so long satisfied am i less a citizen than he is my happiness less a part of the happiness of the community than his so far from gaining by the change i am as yet a loser by it till now only the few now the many are above me till now my superiors were out of my sight now they are incessantly at my elbow till now my superiors were all strangers to me now my equals my familiars swell the list not a step can i stir without falling in with an acquaintance revelling in enjoyments of which it seems i am destined never to partake as these discontents will arise at every step made in the progress so will they at every other that can be made and always with equal reason—or rather with superior and accumulating reason every preceding step will have afforded a precedent and the commencement of a justification of the succeeding ones what at first was theory will have been settled into practice what at first was innovation will have become establishment     till at length the original race of proprietors having been reduced to nothing and all hope or possibility of repairing an injustice done to them being annihilated the opposition made by justice will have ceased justice will have become indifferent and as it were neutral the injustice of going on will not be exceeded by the injustice of stopping name who can the point at which the line of stoppage can be drawn no such line hath as yet been drawn by any man no such line attempted to be drawn by any man let arbitrary power have decreed and what but power the most arbitrary could decree that a line of this sort shall be drawn that bounds of this sort shall be set to the process of equalisation—what but caprice can draw it what but corruption will be said or will be thought to have set them the argument that turns on the difficulty of stopping is a common one it is become commonplace it is open to abuse and few have been more abused it has been employed against salutary measures and the more frequently and the more eagerly employed as it is one of those general arguments which may be produced against measures which admit of no particular objections it is more to the taste of the ignorant fool and of the cowardly than of the knowing or the brave it is more apt to be employed in the defence of old abuses than in the combating of novelties really pernicious it is one of those objections that is much better calculated to confirm partisans already gained than to gain new ones still more than to make proselytes from partisans engaged on the other side to say to me after admitting that as yet i am in a right track to say to me you will find it impossible or difficult to stop is to say to me either prudence or fortune will be wanting to you it is to say to me that will happen which you are persuaded will not happen it is to gall in a multitude of tender points at once the irritable frame of human vanity it is to turn a disbelieving ear to my pretensions of present judgment and present forecast it is to prophesy to me and my friends a future deficiency in point of prudence and good fortune in the present instance the argument wears a very different complexion and strikes with a very different degree of force it is—not that you will find it difficult to stop at a proper place but that you ought not to stop anywhere it is—not that you may be drawn on into the road to ruin but that you can not in the nature of things so long as you pursue your intent stop anywhere short of ruin it is—not that you may be led on by heat of temper or untoward accidents beyond the bounds which the principle you set out upon has prescribed to you but that you can not stop anywhere short of ruin without the dereliction of your principle without a confession by action more humiliating than any confession by words that your whole system was from the first on the whole and in every part of it a pernicious one and the most pernicious of all political systems that ever were or can be devised not only the good expected from such a change would be too expensive but were it ever so desirable it would be altogether unattainable—at least unmaintainable for two instants together past equality does not answer the intention—present equality is the object and whatever reason there may be for aiming at it at any one period of time the same reason will there be for maintaining it at every other period of time a fresh division must therefore be made upon every division that happened in the number of the sharers a fresh division upon every birth and upon every death a fresh division or the inutility and folly of the original division must stand confessed of this perpetual necessity of fresh divisions what would be the result nobody would have any thing he could call his own all property would in effect be destroyed—all present property and all prospect of security in respect of property in future all idea of subsistence except from hand to mouth all incentive to labour beyond the satisfaction of the necessities of the day for why should i bestow my labour today in the improvement of that property which may be torn from me tomorrow a fresh division would again require to take place every time a person became helpless to such a degree as to be unable to make his own little property his £   his £ 0 ayear or whatever the original portion of £ 0 was redued to suffice for his own maintenance—a fresh division or some other arrangement capable of answering the same purpose every birth adds during the age of helplessness to the sum of burthens every death by taking from the sum of burthens adds relatively to the sum of benefits but the addition made to the sum of burthens by infirmity happening to a grown person is much greater than that made by the birth of an infant the adult requires many times as much as the infant for his sustenance the portion of the adult now become helpless was too small to afford him subsistence without the benefit of his labour to improve it being now incapable of all labour he must either perish or to keep him alive the portion of other people must be laid under contribution to make up the difference here then comes the necessity of a system to answer the purpose of the present poorlaws with this difference—that for maintaining     the growing increase of the poor there remain none but what are poor already the dispensations of equality have brought back the age of virtue—be it so but virtue however it may diminish disease will not destroy it virtue will not extirpate the smallpox nor the contagious fever virtue will not prevent legs nor arms from breaking virtue will not give robustness nor agility to the extremity of old age equality amongst the members of a community—equality whatever be the standard portion—includes two points that no member shall have more than that portion and that no one shall have less the first of these points is attainable by the equalisation system to great perfection the latter not to the latter this pure and exalted system is not more competent than the present abusive and corrupt one it is even much less so to industry it affords no new encouragement on the contrary it takes from it whatever encouragement it has at present to what purpose should i earn more than the poorest of my fellowcitizens when so much as i earn more than them so much will be taken from me neither to idleness or to dissipation does it administer any new discouragement on the contrary it gives to both of these dispositions encouragement and that the greatest they can receive putting idleness upon a footing of equality in point of future advantage with industry and dissipation with frugality it gives to each the portion of present pleasure with which it is attended clear why so long as i have a penny left should i refuse the most expensive desire its gratification—when whatever i dissipate of my own present stock must be made up to me from that of other people to what purpose while i have a penny left should i plague myself with working—when so long as i have any thing to pay others will work for me with pay and when i have no longer pay to give them they must work for me without it here then is a perpetual race between dissipation and idleness on the one hand and that plan of division whatever it be by which the law of equalisation is carried into execution on the other dissipation and idleness continually widening the gap division of property using its best endeavours to fill it up but the pace of dissipation is the pace of the racer the pace of legal division that of the tortoise all this while the members of the community are divided into two classes the industrious and frugal slaves toiling for others the idle and prodigal lords and masters enjoying for themselves such would be the fruit of the equalisation system while the execution of it was going on until a certain portion of the national wealth having been destroyed in a variety of ways and a certain portion of the national population destroyed by a mixture of famine and excess the miserable would awaken from their delirium curse the system and its inventors and join their endeavours to bring back the former state of things     principles of penal law     part i political remedies for the evil of offences chapter i subject of this book after naving considered offences as diseases in the body politic† analogy leads us to regard as remedies the means of preventing and repairing them these remedies may be arranged under four classes—     preventive remedies     suppressive remedies     satisfactive remedies     penal remedies or simply punishments preventive remedies—the different methods of preventing a crime may be thus called of these there are two sorts direct methods applying immediately to a particular offence indirect methods consisting in general precautions against a whole class of offences suppressive remedies—these are means which tend to cause an offence to cease—an offence begun but not completed and consequently to prevent at least a portion of the evil satisfactive remedies are those by which reparation is made or indemnification given to an innocent person on account of the evil he has suffered by an offence penal remedies or simply punishments when the evil has been made to cease when the party injured has been indemnified it is still necessary to prevent the recurrence of similar offences both on the part of the offender and of every one else there are two methods by which this end may be obtained the one by correcting the will the other by taking away the power to injure the will is influenced by fear power is taken away by physical restraint to take away from an offender the will to offend again is to reform him to take away the power of offending is to incapacitate him a remedy which ought to act by means of fear is it called a punishment has it or has it not the effect of incapacitating this depends upon its nature the principal end of punishments is to prevent like offences the past offence is only as one point the future is infinite the past offence concerns only one individual similar offences may affect every one in many cases the evil committed is irreparable but the will to do evil may always be taken away because how great soever the advantage of the offence may be the evil of the punishment may be made to surpass it these four classes of remedies may sometimes require different operations sometimes the same operation will suffice for all we shall treat in this book of direct preventive remedies—of suppressive remedies—and of satisfactitive remedies the second part will treat of punishments and the third of indirect preventive remedies chapter ii of direct methods of preventing offences before an offence is consummated it may announce itself in various manners it may pass through degrees of preparation which often allow of its being stopped before it reaches its catastrophe this part of police may be exercised either by powers conferred on all persons or by special powers delegated to persons in authority the powers conferred on all persons for their protection are such as may be exercised before justice intervenes and may for this reason be called antejudicial methods such is the right of opposing by force the execution of an apprehended offence the seizing a suspected person and keeping him in custody the taking him before the judge the using force the sequestering in responsible     hands any thing supposed to be stolen or which may be expected to be destroyed the arresting all the assistants as witnesses the requiring the aid of every one in order to conduct before the magistrates those who may be suspected of evil designs the obligation of rendering such services might be imposed and every citizen required to render them as one of the most important duties in society it might also be well to establish rewards for those who have assisted in preventing an offence and delivering the offender into the hands of justice will it be said that these powers may be abused and that individuals might use them for the purposes of depredation such danger is imaginary this affectation of order and publicity could only oppose their designs and expose them too manifestly to punishment general rule—there is not much danger in granting rights which can only be enjoyed by an exposure to all the inconveniences of their exercise in case they should not be recognised to refuse to justice the assistance it may derive from all these means would be to suffer an irreparable evil from the fear of an evil which could be repaired independently of these powers which ought to belong to all there are others which only belong to magistrates and which may be of great use in preventing offences which are apprehended   admonition—it is a simple lesson but given by a judge cautioning the suspected individual showing that he is observed and recalling him to his duty by a respectable authority   threatening—this is the same method but enforced by the menace of the law in the first it is the paternal voice which uses the language of persuasion in the second it is the magistrate who intimidates by the language of severity   promises required of keeping from a certain place—this method applicable to the prevention of many offences is particularly so to quarrels personal offences and seditious practices   partial banishment—prohibition to the suspected individual to present himself before the threatened party to be in the same dwellinghouse or in any other place intended as the theatre of the crime   bail—obligation to furnish bondsmen who will engage to pay a fine in case of contravention of the separation required   establishment of guards for the protection of persons or things threatened   seizure of arms or other instruments intended to be employed in the apprehended offence besides these general methods there are some which apply specially to certain offences we shall not here enter into these details of police and administration the choice of these methods the occasion the manner of applying them depend upon a great number of circumstances on the other hand they are sufficiently simple and almost always pointed out by the nature of the case in case of injurious defamation the writings may be seized before publication with respect to unwholesome eatables liquors or medicines they may be destroyed before they are made use of judicial visits and inspections may serve to prevent frauds clandestine acts and smuggling these kinds of cases rarely admit of precise rules much must necessarily be left to the discretion of the public officers and judges but the legislator ought to give them instructions to hinder the abuse of their arbitrary powers these instructions should be framed upon the following maxims the more rigorous the means employed the more scrupulous should they be in their use more may be done in proportion to the grandeur of the offence apprehended and its apparent probability—in proportion also as the offender appears more or less dangerous and as he has greater or less means of accomplishing his evil designs there is one limit which ought never to be neglected no method of prevention should be employed which is likely to cause a greater mischief than the offence itself chapter iii of chronic offences having treated of suppressive remedies that is to say of the methods of causing offences to cease let us see what are the offences which can thus be made to cease for all have not this capacity and those which have have it not in the same manner the possibility of causing an offence to cease supposes a duration sufficiently great to admit of the intervention of justice but all offences have not this duration some have a transient effect the effect of others is permanent homicide and rape are irreparable theft may last only a moment it may also last for ever if the thing stolen have been consumed or lost it is necessary to distinguish the circumstances under which offences have a greater or less duration because they affect the suppressive methods which are applicable to them respectively   an offence acquires duration by the simple continuance of an act capable of ceasing at each moment without ceasing to have been an offence the detention of a person     the concealment of any thing are offences of this nature first class of chronic offences ex actu continuo   is the design to commit an offence regarded as an offence it is clear that the continued design will be a continued offence this class of offences may coincide with the former ex intentione persistente among other offences which possess duration are the greater number of negative offences of those which consist of omissions not to provide for the nourishment of a child with which one is chargeable not to pay his debts not to surrender to justice not to discover his accomplices not to put an individual into possession of a right which belongs to him third class of chronic offences ex actu negativo   there are some corporeal works of which the existence is a prolonged offence a manufacture injurious to the health of a neighbourhood a building which obstructs a road a bank which contracts the course of a river c fourth class of chronic offences ex opere manente   the productions of the mind may possess the same character through the intervention of printing such are libels pretended histories alarming prophecies obscene prints in a word every thing which presents to the eyes of the citizens under durable signs ideas which ought not to be presented to them fifth class of chronic offences ex scripto et similibus   a train of actions may possess a character of unity in virtue of which he who performs them is said to have contracted a habit such are the coining of money of the processes prohibited in a manufacture smuggling in general sixth class of chronic offences ex habitu   there is a kind of duration in certain offences the which though they differ among themselves take a character of unity from the one having been the occasion of the other a man having committed waste in a garden beats the proprietor who comes to oppose him he follows him into the house insults his family destroys his furniture kills his favourite dog and continues his depredations thus an indefinite series of offences is formed during the continuance of which opportunity may occur for the intervention of justice seventh class of chronic offences ex occasione   there is a kind of duration in the case of many offenders who either with or without concert pursue the same object thus of a confused mixture of acts of destruction threats verbal and personal injuries insulting cries and provoking clamours is formed the sad and terrible compound called tumult riot insurrection—forerunners of rebellion and civil wars eighth class of chronic offences ex cooperatione chronic offences are liable to have their catastrophe the projected offence terminates in the consummated offence simple corporal injuries have for their natural termination irreparable corporal injuries and homicide with respect to imprisonment there is no crime which it may not have for its object to unloose an inconvenient matrimonial connexion—to accomplish a project of seduction—to suppress a testimony—to extort a secret—to hinder the reclaiming of property—to obtain forced assistance in an outrageous enterprise—in a word imprisonment may always have some particular catastrophe according to the design of the offender in the course of a criminal enterprise the end may be changed as well as the means a thief surprised may from fear of punishment or regret for having lost the fruit of his crime become an assassin it belongs to the foresight of the judge to represent to himself in each case the probable catastrophe of the offence commenced in order to prevent it by a prompt and welldirected interposition in order to determine the punishment he ought to regard the intentions of the offenders in applying preventive or suppressive remedies he ought to regard all the probable consequences as well those which have been intended as those which have been neglected or unforeseen chapter iv of suppressive remedies for chronic offences the different kinds of chronic offences require different suppressive remedies these suppressive means are the same as the preventive means of which we have already given a catalogue the difference lies only in the time of their application in some cases the preventive means correspond so exactly with the nature of the offence that it is scarcely necessary to point them out it is clear that injurious imprisonment requires liberation—that theft requires restoration in kind the only difficulty is to know where to find the thing or the person detained there are other offences such as seditious mobs and certain negative offences—in particular the nonpayment of debts which require more farfetched means for their suppression we shall have occasion to examine these under their proper heads the evil of dangerous writings is more difficult to suppress they hide themselves—they reappear they spring up with new   0 vigour after the most rigorous proscriptions we shall find among the indirect methods those which are most efficacious in opposing them greater latitude must be left to the magistrate with respect to suppressive means than with respect to preventive means the reason is clear is an offence to be suppressed there is a crime already proved and a punishment appointed in consequence nothing is risked in making it cease so long as what would be done for its punishment is not exceeded is an offence to be prevented too many scruples can hardly be felt there may be no such offence in agitation it may be attributed to the wrong person it may be that the individual suspected acts only with a good intention and instead of becoming culpable will stop of himself all these possibilities require a more gentle and regulated procedure in proportion as the apprehended crime is problematical particular means for preventing or suppressing illegal detention or deportation these means may be reduced to the following precautions—   the keeping a register of all places in which persons are confined without their consent prisons hospitals for the insane and idiots and private houses into which invalids of this class are received   the keeping a register of the cause of the detention of each prisoner the not permitting the detention of a madman but after a judicial consultation of physicians signed by them these two registers preserved in the tribunals of each district should be publicly exposed or at least allowed to be freely consulted by every body   to determine upon some signal which should as much as possible be in the power of every person who is carried off to the effect of authorizing the passers by to call the ravishers to account to accompany them if they declare that they wish to carry the prisoner before the judges or to take them thither themselves if they have a different intention   to grant to every one the right to apply for the opening of every house in which he suspects that the person he seeks for is detained against his will chapter v of martial law in england in the case of seditious mobs they do not begin with military assassination warning precedes punishment martial law is proclaimed and the soldier cannot act till after the magistrate has spoken the intention of this law is excellent but does the execution correspond with it the magistrate is to go into the midst of the tumult and read a long and tiresome formula which no one understands and woe be to those who an hour afterwards are in that place they are declared convicted of a capital offence this statute dangerous to the innocent difficult to be executed against the guilty is a compound of weakness and violence at the moment of disorder the presence of the magistrate ought to be announced by some extraordinary sign the red flag so famous in the french revolution had a great effect upon the imagination in the midst of clamour the ordinary means of language do not suffice a multitude can only use their eyes their eyes should therefore be addressed a speech requires attention and silence but visible signs have a rapid and powerful operation they speak the whole at once they have only one meaning which cannot be equivocal an intentional noise a concerted report cannot prevent their effect besides words lose their influence from a crowd of unforeseen circumstances is the speaker hated the language of justice becomes hateful when uttered by him his character his behaviour his first appearance are these ridiculous this ridicule extends to his functions and degrades them—another reason for speaking to the eyes by respectable symbols which are not subject to the same caprices but as it may be necessary to add words to signs a speaking trumpet is essentially necessary even the singularity of this instrument would contribute to give more eclât and dignity to the orders of justice by removing all idea of familiar conversation by impressing the conviction that it was not the simple individual himself who was heard but a privileged minister the herald of the laws this method of making ones self heard at a distance has been long employed at sea where distance the noise of the winds and the waves have made the weakness of the voice sensible poets have often compared a people in commotion to the sea in a storm ought this analogy to be acknowledged only as a source of amusement it would be of much greater importance in the hands of justice the orders should be in few words—nothing which appears like ordinary discourse or discussion—no reference to the king—but to justice alone the head of the state may be justly or unjustly an object of aversion—this aversion may even be the cause of the tumult to recal this idea would be to inflame the passions instead of calming them if he be not odious why expose him     to the liability of becoming so every favour every thing which bears the character of benevolence ought to be represented as the work of the father of his people all rigour all acts of severity need be attributed to no one the hand which acts may be artfully hidden they may be thrown upon some creature of the imagination some animated abstraction—such as justice the daughter of necessity and mother of peace whom men ought always to fear but never to hate and who always deserve their first homage chapter vi of the nature of satisfaction what is satisfaction a benefit received in consideration of an injury if it refer to an offence satisfaction is an equivalent given to a party injured on account of the injury he has suffered satisfaction is plenary when upon adding up the two sums—the one of the evil suffered the other of the good received—the value of the second appears equal to the value of the first in such manner that if the injury and the reparation could be repeated the event would appear indifferent to the party injured does the reparation want any thing in value to make it equal in value to the evil the satisfaction is only partial and imperfect satisfaction has two aspects or two branches the past and the future satisfaction for the past is called indemnification satisfaction for the future consists in making the evil of the offence to cease does the evil cease of itself nature exercises the functions of justice and the tribunals have nothing in this respect to do has a sum of money been stolen so soon as it is restored to its owner satisfaction for the future is complete it remains only to indemnify him for the past for the temporary loss he has experienced during the continuance of the crime but with respect to a thing wasted or destroyed satisfaction for the future can only have place by giving to the party injured something similar or equivalent satisfaction for the past consists in indemnifying him for the temporary privation chapter vii reasons upon which the obligation to make satisfaction is founded satisfaction is necessary in order to cause the evil of the first class to cease and reestablish every thing in the condition it was in before the offence to replace the individual who has suffered in the lawful condition in which he would have been if the law had not been violated satisfaction is still more necessary in order to cause the evil of the second class to cease punishment alone does not effect this it tends without doubt to diminish the number of offenders but this number though diminished cannot be considered as null the examples of crimes committed more or less publicly will excite more or less of apprehension each observer will there see a chance of suffering in his turn is it wished that this feeling of dread should disappear it is necessary that satisfaction should follow as constantly as punishment if the crime be followed by punishment without satisfaction so many offenders punished so many proofs that the punishment is inefficacious and consequently so much alarm which presses on society but we must make one essential observation here in order to take away the alarm it is sufficient that the satisfaction should appear complete to the eyes of the observers when it may not be so to the eyes of the persons interested how shall we judge if the satisfaction be perfect with respect to him who receives it the balance in the hands of passion will always incline to the side of interest to the miser you can never give enough to the revengeful the humiliation of his adversary never appears sufficiently great it is necessary then to imagine an impartial observer and to regard as sufficient the satisfaction which would make him think that for such a price he would hardly regret to receive such an injury chapter viii of the different kinds of satisfaction six kinds of satisfaction may be distinguished   pecuniary satisfaction—the means of procuring almost all pleasures money is an efficacious compensation for many evils but it is not always in the power of the offender to furnish it nor agreeable to the party offended to receive it offer an offended man of honour the mercenary price for an insult it is a new affront   restitution in kind—this satisfaction consists either in restoring the thing which has been taken away or in giving a like thing or an equivalent for that which has been taken away or destroyed   attestative satisfaction—if the evil result from a falsehood from a false opinion with respect to a point of fact the satisfaction is completed by a legal attestation of its truth   honorary satisfaction—an operation     which has for its object either to maintain or reestablish in favour of an individual a portion of honour that the offence of which he has been the object has made him lose or run the risk of losing   vindictive satisfaction—every thing which inflicts a manifest pain upon the offender may yield a pleasure of vengeance to the party injured   substitutive satisfaction—or satisfaction at the expense of a third party as when a person who has not committed a crime finds himself responsible in his fortune for him who has committed it in determining the choice of the kind of satisfaction to be granted to an injured party three things should be considered the facility of furnishing it the nature of the evil to be compensated and the feelings which may be supposed to belong to him we shall soon recur to these different heads for the purpose of considering them more at large chapter ix of the quantity of satisfaction to be granted so much as the satisfaction wants of being complete so much evil remains without remedy what is required to prevent deficiency in this respect may be reduced to two rules—   the evil of the offence must be followed in all its parts—in all its consequences that the satisfaction may be proportioned to it with respect to irreparable corporal injuries two things should be considered a means of enjoyment a means of subsistence has been taken away for ever it is not possible to bestow compensation in kind but it is possible to apply to the evil a perpetually recurring gratification with respect to homicide it is necessary to consider the loss sustained by the heirs of the deceased and to make compensation for it by a gratification once paid or periodically paid during a longer or shorter time with respect to an offence against property we have seen in treating of pecuniary satisfaction all that it is necessary to observe to make the reparation rise to the amount of the loss   in case of doubt make the balance incline in favour of him who has suffered the injury rather than of him who has done it all the accidents should be placed to the account of the offender every satisfaction ought to be rather superabundant than defective if superabundant the excess can only serve to prevent like offences in the character of punishment if defective the deficiency always leaves some degree of alarm and in crimes of enmity all the evil not compensated is a subject of triumph for the offender laws have every where been imperfect upon this point on the side of punishment excess has been little dreaded on the side of satisfaction little trouble has been taken with reference to deficiency punishment an evil which when in excess is purely mischievous is scattered with a lavish hand whilst satisfaction which altogether produces good is given with a grudging parsimony chapter x of the certainty of satisfaction the certainty of satisfaction is an essential branch of security whatever diminution there is in this respect is so much security lost what should be thought of those laws which to the natural causes of uncertainty add factitious and voluntary ones it is to obviate this defect that we lay down the two following rules—   the obligation of satisfying shall not be extinguished by the death of the party injured what was due to the deceased on account of satisfaction remains due to his heirs to make the right of receiving satisfaction depend upon the life of the individual injured would be to take from this right a part of its value it is the same as if a perpetual rent was reduced to a life annuity its enjoyment can only be obtained by a process which may occupy a long time as regards an aged or infirm person the value of this right declines with himself as regards a dying person this right is worth nothing besides if you diminish the certainty on the side of satisfaction you increase in the delinquent the hope of impunity you show him in perspective a period at which he may enjoy the fruit of his crime you give him a motive for retarding by a thousand obstacles the judgments of the tribunals or even for hurrying on the death of the party injured you at least put out of the protection of the laws the persons who have need of the greatest care—the sick and the dying it is true that supposing the obligation to render satisfaction extinct by the death of the party injured the offender may be subjected to another punishment but what punishment would be so suitable as this   the right of the party injured shall not be extinguished by the death of the offender or of the author of the damage what was due from him on account of satisfaction shall be due from his heirs to determine otherwise would be again     to diminish this right and to encourage crime that a man because his death is near should commit an injustice without any other object than the advantage of his children is a case which is not very rare it may be said that if the party injured be satisfied after the death of the offender it is by an equal suffering imposed upon his heir but there is a wide difference the expectation of the party injured is a clear precise decided expectation firm in proportion to his confidence in the protection of the laws the expectation of the heir is only a vague hope what is its object is it the entire inheritance no it is only the unknown net produce after all legitimate deductions that which the deceased might have spent upon his pleasures he has spent upon his misdeeds chapter xi of pecuniary satisfaction there are some cases in which pecuniary satisfaction is demanded by the nature of the offence itself there are other cases in which it is the only one allowed by the circumstances it ought to be preferred on the occasions in which it promises to have its greatest effect pecuniary satisfaction is at its highest point of suitability in the cases in which the damage sustained by the party injured and the advantage reaped by the offender are equally of a pecuniary nature as in theft peculation and extortion the evil and the remedy are homogeneous—the compensation may be exactly measured by the loss and the punishment by the profit of the offence this species of satisfaction is not so well founded when there is a pecuniary loss on one side without any pecuniary profit on the other as in waste on account of enmity by negligence or by accident it is still less well founded in the cases in which neither the evil suffered by the party injured nor the advantage reaped by the author of the crime can be valued in money as in injuries which relate to honour the more a method of satisfaction is found incommensurable with the damage—the more a method of punishment is found incommensurable with the advantage of the offence—the more are they respectively liable to lose their aim the ancient roman law which awarded a crown as an indemnification for a box on the ear did not provide for the security of honour the reparation had no common measure with the outrage its effect was precarious whether as satisfaction or as punishment there still exists an english law which is a remnant of barbarous times manent vestigia ruris a daughter is considered as the servant of her father is she seduced the father can obtain no other satisfaction than a sum of money the price of the domestic services of which it is considered that he may be deprived by the pregnancy of his daughter in personal injuries a pecuniary indemnification may be suitable or not according to the fortunes on the one side and the other in regulating a pecuniary satisfaction the two branches of the past and of the future ought not to be forgotten satisfaction for the future consists simply in making the evil of the offence to cease satisfaction for the past consists in indemnification for the wrong suffered the payment of a sum due is satisfaction for the future the payment of the interest accrued on this sum is satisfaction for the past interest ought to accrue from the moment the mischief which it is intended to compensate happens from the moment for example from which the payment due has been delayed—or the thing has been taken destroyed or damaged—or the service which ought to have been rendered has been neglected interests granted on account of satisfaction ought to be higher than the ordinary rate of commerce at least when evil intention is suspected this excess is highly necessary if the interest were only equal there would be many cases in which the satisfaction would be incomplete and other cases in which a profit would remain to the delinquent a pecuniary profit if he have wished to procure a forced loan at the ordinary rate of interest a pleasure of vengeance or enmity if he have wished to hold the injured party in a state of want and to enjoy his distress for the same reason compound interest ought to be calculated that is to say the interest ought to be added to the capital each time that the interest ought according to custom to become due since the capitalist at the expiration of every such term might convert his interest into capital or derive some equivalent advantage from it leave this part of the damage without satisfaction there will be on the part of the proprietor a loss and on the part of the delinquent a gain among codelinquents the expense of the satisfaction ought to be divided among them according to their fortunes except when this division ought to be modified according to the different degrees of their criminality in truth the obligation to make satisfaction is a punishment and this punishment would be on the pinnacle of inequality if codelinquents of unequal fortunes were taxed equally     chapter xii of restitution in kind restitution in kind is principally of importance with regard to things which possess a value in affection but it ought to be made on all occasions if possible the law ought to ensure to me every thing which is mine without forcing me to accept equivalents which are not even such so soon as i dislike them without restitution in kind security is not complete what security is there for the whole when there is no security for any part a thing taken away either honestly or dishonestly may have passed into the hands of an honest acquirer shall it be restored to the first proprietor shall it be continued in the possession of the second the rule is simple it ought to remain with him who may be presumed to have the greatest affection for it now this superior degree of affection may be easily presumed from the relation which has been borne to it from the time that it has been possessed from the services which have been drawn from it from the care and expense which it has cost these indications commonly unite in favour of the true original proprietor† the preference is equally due to him in the cases in which there is any doubt for these reasons—  the last proprietor may have been an accomplice without the proofs of this complicity having been obtained is the suspicion unjust formed by the law and not by the man bearing upon the species and not upon the individual it does not produce any impeachment of honour   if the acquirer be not an accomplice he may be culpable from negligence or temerity either by omitting the ordinary precautions for verifying the title of the vender or by giving too easy a belief to slight indications   with respect to weighty offences such as violent robbery it is proper to give the preference to the first possessor in order to strengthen the motives which engage him in pursuit of the offender   has the spoliation arisen from malice to leave the thing in the possession of any one besides the stript proprietor would be to leave the offender in possession of the profit of his crime a purchase at a low price ought always to be followed by restitution on the price being repaid this circumstance if it do not prove complicity is at least a strong presumption of dishonesty the buyer could not hide from himself the probability of an offence on the part of the seller for that which causes the low price of stolen goods is the danger of taking them to an open market when the acquirer being deemed innocent is obliged on account of the dishonesty of the seller to restore any article to the original proprietor this ought to be accompanied by the payment of a pecuniary equivalent regulated by the judge the simple expense of keeping—for still stronger reasons improvements and extraordinary expenses—ought to be liberally repaid to the posterior acquirer this is not only a means of promoting the general wealth it is also the interest even of the original proprietor according as this indemnity is granted or refused the improvement of the article is either promoted or hindered‡ neither the original proprietor nor the posterior acquirer ought to gain at the expense the one of the other the loser ought to have recourse for his indemnity in the first instance to the delinquent afterwards to the subsidiary funds of which we shall hereafter speak∥     when identical restitution is impossible restitution of a similar thing ought as far as possible to be substituted suppose two rare medals of the same die the possessor of one of them after having got possession of the other either by negligence or design destroys or loses it the best satisfaction in this case is to transfer the medal which belongs to him to the party injured pecuniary satisfaction in offences of this kind is apt to be found insufficient or even null value in affection is rarely appreciated by third persons it requires a highly enlightened benevolence an uncommon philosophy in order to sympathize with tastes which are not our own the dutch florist paying in pounds of gold for a tulip bulb smiles at the antiquary who purchases at a great price a rusty lamp legislators and judges have often thought like the vulgar they have applied unpolished rules to what demanded a delicate discernment to offer in certain cases an indemnification in money is no satisfaction—it is insult would gold be taken for the portrait of a beloved object if stolen by a rival simple restitution in kind leaves a deficiency in the satisfaction proportioned to the value of the enjoyment lost during the continuance of the offence how shall this value be estimated this will be made clear by an example a statue has been illegally taken away this statue sold by auction would fetch one hundred pounds according to the opinion of the best judges between the taking away and the restitution a year has elapsed the interest of money is five per cent place to the head of satisfaction for the past ordinary interest five pounds for penal interest according to chap xi say two and a half total seven pounds ten shillings per cent in valuing interests the deterioration whether accidental or necessary that the object may have undergone in the interval between the commission of the offence and the fact of restitution ought not to be neglected the statue may not necessarily have lost any thing but a horse of the same price would necessarily have diminished in value a collection of tables of natural deterioration year by year according to the nature of the object is one of the articles needed in the library of justice chapter xiii of attestative satisfaction this method of satisfaction is particularly adapted to crimes of falsehood from which any opinion results prejudicial to an individual without its being possible to estimate the amount of the damage or its extent or even the existence of its effects so long as the error exists it is a constant source of actual or probable evil there is only one method of stopping it that is establishing the contrary truth by evidence the enumeration of the principal offences of falsehood will naturally find a place here   simple mental injuries consisting in spreading false alarms for example tales of apparitions ghosts vampires sorcery demoniacs possessions c false reports of a nature to fill any individual with fear or sorrow pretended deaths bad conduct of parents and relations conjugal infidelity loss of goods c falsehoods likely to alarm a more or less numerous class as reports of pestilence invasion conspiracy incendiarism c   offences against reputation among which may be distinguished many kinds positive defamation by facts set down or by ingenious libels weakening of reputation which consists in weakening what cannot be destroyed in hiding from the public for example a circumstance which would add to the eclât of a celebrated action interruption of reputation which consists in suppressing a fact concealing a work honourable to a certain individual or in taking from him the opportunity of distinguishing himself by causing an enterprise to be regarded as impossible or accomplished usurpation of reputation all plagiarism whether by authors or artists are examples of this   fraudulent acquisition—examples—false reports for the purpose of stockjobbing false reports to influence the price of the negotiable securities of any commercial company   disturbance of the enjoyment of the rights attached to a domestic or civil condition—example the denying to the right possessor the possession of his condition of a husband with regard to a certain woman—of wife with respect to a certain man—of child with regard to a certain man or woman the attributing falsely a like condition to     ones self the acting a falsehood of the same kind with respect to any civil condition or privilege   hindering acquisition—hindering a man from acquiring or selling by false reports disputing the value of any thing or the right to sell it hindering a person from acquiring a certain condition as marriage by false reports which cause it to be deferred or not to take place in all these cases the arm of justice would be powerless forcible methods would be in vain or imperfect the only efficacious remedy is an authentic declaration which destroys the falsehood to destroy the error—to publish the truth—these are functions worthy of the highest tribunals what form ought to be given to attestative satisfaction it may be varied according to all the methods of publicity printing and publication of the judgment at the expense of the delinquent placards distributed at the choice of the party injured publication in the national and foreign journals c the idea of this satisfaction so simple and so useful has been derived from french jurisprudence when a man had been calumniated the parliaments almost always ordained that the sentence which reestablished his reputation should be printed and placarded at the expense of the calumniator but why oblige the delinquent to declare that he has uttered a lie and publicly to recognise the honour of the party injured this plan was bad in many respects it was wrong to prescribe to a man the expression of certain sentiments which might not be his own and to risk the judicially commanding a lie it was also wrong to weaken the reparation by an act of constraint for finally what does a retractation made at the command of justice prove but the weakness and the fear of him who pronounces it the delinquent may be the organ of his own condemnation if it is judged proper to augment his punishment but this may be done without deviating from the exact truth provided that the formula which is prescribed to him expresses the sentiments of justice as being those of justice and not as his own the court has judged that i have advanced a falsehood—the court has judged that i have swerved from the character of an honest man—the court has judged that in all this affair my adversary has behaved as a man of honour this is all that concerns the public and the party injured it is a sufficiently brilliant triumph for the truth a humiliation sufficiently great for the guilty what would be gained by obliging him to say—i have uttered a falsehood—i have swerved from the character of an honest man—my adversary has behaved as a man of honour this declaration stronger than the first in appearance is much less so in reality the fear which dictates such disavowals does not change the real sentiments and whilst the mouth pronounces them before a numerous auditory the cry of the heart is heard so to speak disavowing them with reference to a fact justice is less liable to be deceived and the direct avowal of falsehood required from the condemned party in his own name would be almost always conformed to his inward conviction but with reference to an opinion to the opinion of the delinquent the disavowal commanded of him will be almost always opposed to his inward conviction in such contests impartial persons would condemn an individual ten times for each once that he condemned himself is he for a moment sufficiently calm to give place to reflection the triumph of his adversary is before his eyes he is himself the instrument of its publication and the irritation of wounded pride would augment the prejudices of his mind he may be honestly deceived and you oblige him to accuse himself of falsehood you place him in a cruel position in which the more honest he is the more he will suffer in which he will be punished the more the less he deserves it chapter xiv of honorary satisfaction we have seen in what manner those offences against reputation which have falsehood for their instrument may be remedied but there are other offences of this class more dangerous enmity has more certain methods of deeply attacking honour it does not always hide itself in a timid calumny it openly attacks its enemy but it attacks him not with violence which puts him in personal danger humiliation is the object in view the proceeding least painful in itself is often most weighty in its consequences by doing more mischief to the person less injury is done to honour a sentiment of pity must not be excited in favour of the sufferer since this would produce a feeling of antipathy towards his adversary he must be made an object of contempt hatred has exhausted all its refinements in this species of offences it is necessary to oppose to them peculiar remedies which we have distinguished by the name of honorary satisfaction to perceive this necessity the nature and tendency of these offences must be examined the causes of their gravity the remedies which have at present been found for them in duels and the imperfection of these remedies these researches which relate to all that is most delicate in the human heart have been almost entirely neglected by those     who have made the laws they are however the original foundations of all good legislation in matters of honour in the actual state of manners among the most civilized nations the ordinary the natural effect of these offences is to take away from the offended party a more or less considerable portion of his honour that is to say he no longer enjoys the same esteem among his fellows he has lost a proportional part of the pleasures the services the good offices of all kinds which are the fruits of such esteem and he may find himself exposed to the disagreeable consequences of their contempt but since the evil essentially consists in this change which is produced in the opinions of men in general it is these who ought to be regarded as its immediate authors the nominal delinquent makes only a slight scratch which left to itself would soon heal it is these other persons who by the poisons they pour into it make it a dangerous and often incurable wound at first sight the rigour of public opinion against an insulted individual appears a revolting injustice a stronger or more courageous man abuses his superiority and ill treats in a certain manner one whose weakness ought to have protected him all the world as by a mechanical movement instead of being indignant against the oppressor ranges itself on his side and ungenerously causes sarcasm and contempt often more bitter than death itself to fall upon its victim at the given signal by an unknown individual the public emulously precipitates itself upon the devoted innocent as a ferocious dog waits only the signal from his master to tear a passenger it is thus that a scoundrel who wishes to deliver an honest man to the torments of opprobrium employs those whom the men of the world calls honest people as the executioners of his tyrannical injuries and as the contempt which an injury attracts is in proportion to the injury itself this domination of evil doers is so much the more inexcusable as the abuse is more atrocious whether a flagrant injury has been deserved or not no one deigns to inquire nor whether its insolent author is triumphant but how it may be aggravated it is made a point of honour to oppress the unhappy the affront he has received has separated him from his equals and rendered him unclean as by a social excommunication thus the true evil the ignominy with which he is covered is much more the work of other men than of the first offender he only points out the prey it is they who tear it he directs the punishment they are the executioners should a man for example be so far carried away as to spit in the face of another in public what would be the mischief in itself a drop of water forgotten as soon as shed but this drop of water may be converted into a corrosive poison which shall torment him all his life what produces this metamorphosis public opinion—the opinion which distributes at its own pleasure honour and shame the cruel adversary well knew that this affront would be the forerunner and the symbol of a torrent of contempt a churl a villain may at his own will dishonour a virtuous man he may fill with chagrin and regret the close of the most respectable career how does he maintain this terrible power he maintains it because an irresistible corruption has subjugated the first and the purest of the tribunals that of the popular sanction by a train of deplorable collusion all the citizens individually depend for their honour upon the most wicked among them and are collectively under their orders to execute their decrees of proscription upon each one in particular such is the process which might be instituted against public opinion and these imputations would not be without foundation mere admirers of strength are often guilty of injustice towards the feeble but when the effects of offences of this kind are examined to the bottom it is perceived that they produce an evil independent of opinion and that the sentiments of the public with respect to affronts received and tolerated are not in general so contrary to reason as is believed on the first glance i say in general because many cases would be found in which public opinion is unjustifiable in order to understand all the evil which results from these offences they must be considered without reference to any remedies it must be supposed that there are none according to this supposition these offences might be repeated at will an unlimited career would thus be opened to insolence the person insulted today might be insulted tomorrow and the day after every day and every hour each new affront would facilitate the next and render more probable a succession of outrages of the same class but in the idea of a corporal insult is comprehended every act offensive to the person which can be offered without causing a durable physical evil—every thing which produces disagreeable sensation uneasiness or sorrow but an act which would be scarcely sensible if unique may produce by repetition a very painful degree of uneasiness or even an intolerable torment i have somewhere read that from water distilled drop by drop and falling from a certain height upon the shaven crown of the uncovered head the most cruel tortures have been produced a constant dropping wears away stones says     the proverb thus the individual obliged by his relative weakness to submit at the pleasure of his persecutor to similar vexations and deprived as we have supposed of legal protection would be reduced to the most miserable condition nothing more is required for establishing on the one part an absolute despotism and on the other an entire slavery but he is not the slave of one but of all who choose to make use of him he is the puppet of the first comer who knowing his weakness is tempted to abuse it like a spartan helot dependent upon every body always in fear and suffering—the object of general laughter and of a contempt which is not even softened by compassion—he is in a word below those slaves because their misfortune was forced upon them and was the subject of complaint whilst his degradation is connected with the baseness of his character these little vexations these insults have even for another reason a sort of preeminence in tyranny above more violent measures violent acts of anger often suffice to extinguish at once the enmity of the offender and are frequently promptly followed by feelings of repentance and thus present a termination to the suffering they produce but a malignant and humiliating insult far from exhausting the hatred which has produced it seems on the contrary to serve to nourish it so that it presents itself to the imagination as the avant courier of a train of injuries so much the more alarming as it is undefined what has been said of corporal insults may be applied to threats since even the first are of no importance except as threatening acts offences by words have not altogether the same character this is only a vague species of defamation an employment of injurious terms of which the signification is not determined and which varies according to the situation of the persons† what is shown by these injuries to the party injured is that he is believed worthy of the public contempt without pointing out on what account the probable evil which may result is the renewal of similar reproaches it may also be feared that a profession of contempt publicly expressed will lead others to join in it it is indeed an invitation to which they willingly yield the pride of censuring—of raising ones self at the expense of the others—the influence of example—the disposition to believe all strong assertions give weight to these kinds of injuries but it appears that they principally owe their weight to the neglect with which they are treated by the laws and to the practice of duelling a subsidiary remedy by which the popular sanction has sought to supply the silence of the laws it is not astonishing that legislators fearing to give too much importance to trifles have left in a state of nearly universal neglect this part of security the physical evil naturally enough taken as a measure of the importance of the crime was nearly nothing and the distant consequences escaped the inexperience of those who established the laws the duel presented itself to supply this omission this is not the place for inquiring into the origin and examining the changes and whimsicalities apparent in this practice‡ it is enough that the practice of duelling exists and that in fact it applies itself as a remedy and serves to restrain the enormity of the disorder which without it would result from the negligence of the laws this practice once established the following are its direct consequences— the first effect of duelling is to make the evil of the offence in a great measure to cease that is to say the shame which results from the insult the offended person is no longer in that miserable condition in which his weakness exposes him to the outrages of the insolent and the contempt of all he is delivered from a condition of continual fear     the stain which the affront had imprinted on his honour is effaced and if the challenge have immediately followed the insult this stain will not even have made any impression it will have had no time to fix itself for the dishonour consists not in receiving an insult but in submitting to it the second effect of duelling is to act as a punishment and to oppose itself to the reproduction of like offences each new example is a promulgation of the penal laws of honour and reminds every one that he cannot be guilty of such offensive proceedings without exposing himself to the consequences of a private combat that is to say to the danger of undergoing according to the event of the duel either different degrees of afflictive punishments or even the punishment of death hence the courageous individual who during the silence of the laws exposes himself in order to punish an insult secures the general security by exposing his own but considered as a punishment duelling is extremely defective   it is not a method which can be employed by every body there are numerous classes who cannot participate in the protection which it yields as women children old persons invalids and those who from defect in courage cannot resolve to free themselves from the shame at the price of so great danger on the other hand by a peculiarity with respect to this point of honour worthy of its feudal origin the superior classes have not admitted those below them to the equality of duelling the countryman outraged by a gentleman cannot obtain this satisfaction the insult in this case may have less weighty effects but it is yet an insult and an evil without a remedy in all these respects duelling considered as a punishment is found inefficacious   it is not always even a punishment because opinion attaches to it a reward which may appear to many superior to all its dangers this reward is the honour attached to this proof of courage an honour which has often given greater attractions to duelling than its inconveniences have had power to overcome there has been a period during which it formed part of the character of a gallant man to have fought at least once a look an inattention a preference a suspicion of rivalry—any thing was sufficient to men who only sought a pretence and esteemed themselves a thousand times repaid for the perils they had run by the applause they obtained from both sexes with whom from different reasons bravery is equally in favour in this respect the punishment amalgamated with the reward loses its true penal character and in another manner becomes inefficacious   duelling considered as a punishment is also defective from its excess or according to the proper expression which will be explained elsewhere it is too expensive a punishment it is true that it is often null but it may be capital between these extremes of every thing and nothing the individual is exposed to all the intermediate degrees—wounds scars mutilations maiming or loss of limbs it is clear that if a choice could be made with respect to satisfaction for offences of this kind a preference would be given to a punishment less uncertain and less hazardous which should not extend to the loss of life nor be altogether null there is another peculiarity in this penal justice which belongs only to duelling costly to the aggressor it is no less so to the party injured the offended party cannot avail himself of the right to punish the offender without exposing himself to the punishment which he prepares for him and even with a manifest disadvantage for the chance is naturally in favour of him who has been able to choose his man before exposing himself hence this punishment is at the same time expensive and ill founded   another particular inconvenience of this duelling jurisprudence is that it aggravates the evil of the offence itself in all cases in which the revenge is not sought unless the impossibility of seeking it is acknowledged has the offended party refused to have recourse to it he is forced to convict himself of two capital faults—want of courage and want of honour want of that virtue which protects society and without which it could not maintain itself—and want of sensibility to the love of reputation one of the grand foundations of morality the offended party finds himself therefore under the laws of duelling in a worse situation than if it did not exist because if he refuse this sad remedy it is converted into poison for him   if in certain cases duelling in quality of punishment be not so inefficacious as it seems it ought to be it is only because an innocent individual exposes himself to a punishment which consequently is ill founded such are the cases of persons who from some infirmity arising from sex age or health cannot employ this means of defence they have no resource in this condition of individual weakness except as chance gives them a protector who has at the same time the will and the power to expose his own   0 person and combat in their stead it is thus that a husband a lover a brother may take upon themselves the injury done to a wife a mistress a sister and in this case if the duel becomes an efficacious protection it is only by compromising the security of a third person who finds himself charged with a quarrel for a matter to which he is a stranger and with respect to which he could exercise no influence it is certain that considering duelling as a branch of penal justice it is an absurd and monstrous practice but altogether absurd and altogether monstrous as it is it cannot be denied but that it accomplishes its principal object—it entirely effaces the stain which an insult imprints upon honour ordinary moralists in condemning public opinion upon this point only serve to confirm the fact but whether on account of this result duelling be justifiable or not is of no importance the practice exists and it has its cause it is essential to the legislator to discover it a phenomenon so interesting ought not to remain unknown to him the insult we have said causes him who is the object of it to be considered as degraded by his weakness and his cowardice always placed between an affront and a reproach he can no longer march with an equal step with other men and pretend to the same regards but when after this insult i present myself to my adversary and consent to risk in a combat my life against his i rise by this act from the humiliation into which i had fallen if i die i am thereby at least set free from the public contempt and from the insolent domination of my enemy if he die i am thereby free and the guilty is punished if he be only wounded it is a sufficient lesson for him and those who may be tempted to imitate him am i wounded myself or are neither of us wounded the combat is not useless it always produces its effect my enemy finds that he cannot reiterate his injuries but at the risk of his life i am not a passive being which can be outraged with impunity my courage protects me nearly as much as the law would have done if it had punished such offences with an afflictive or capital punishment but if when this method of satisfaction is open to me i patiently endure an insult i render myself despicable in the eyes of the public because by such conduct there is discovered on my part a fund of timidity and timidity is one of the greatest imperfections in the character of a man a coward has always been an object of contempt but ought this defect of courage to be classed among the vices the opinion which despises cowardice is it a hurtful or useful prejudice it will be doubted by few but that this opinion is conformed to the general interest if it be considered that the first wish of every individual is for his own preservation courage is more or less a factitious quality—a social virtue which owes to public esteem more than to any other cause its birth and its increase a momentary ardour may be kindled by anger but a tranquil and sustained courage is only formed and nourished under the happy influences of honour the contempt which is felt for cowardice is not then a useless sentiment the suffering which rebounds upon cowards is not a punishment lavished in pure loss the existence of the body politic depends upon the courage of the individuals who compose it the external security of the state against its rivals depends on the courage of its warriors the internal security of the state against these warriors themselves depends upon the courage spread among the mass of the other citizens in a word courage is the public soul the tutelary genius the sacred palladium by which alone a people can secure itself from all the miseries of servitude can retain the condition of manhood and not fall below the brutes themselves but the more courage shall be honoured the greater will be the number of courageous men the more will cowardice be despised and the fewer cowards will there be this is not all he who being able to fight endures an insult not only discovers his timidity—he also rebels against the popular sanction which has established the law and shows himself in an essential point indifferent to reputation but the popular sanction is the most active and faithful servant of the principle of utility the most powerful and least dangerous ally of the political sanction if then the laws of the popular sanction agree in general with the laws of utility the more a man is sensible of reputation the more his character is ready to conform itself to virtue—the less his sensibility in this respect the more liable is he to the seduction of every vice what is the result of this discussion in the state of neglect in which the laws till the present time have left the honour of the citizens he who endures an insult without having recourse to the satisfaction which public opinion prescribes to him by thus acting exhibits himself as reduced to a state of humiliating dependence and exposed to receive an indefinite series of affronts he exhibits himself as devoid of the sentiment of courage which produces general security and indeed as devoid of sensibility to reputation—sensibility protectrix of all the virtues and safeguard against all the vices in examining the progress of public opinion with regard to insults it appears to me generally speaking to be good and useful and     the successive changes which it has made in the practice of duels have brought them more and more into conformity with the principle of utility the public would do wrong or rather its folly would be manifest if being the spectator of an insult it immediately passed a decree of infamy against the party insulted but this it does not do this degree of infamy takes place only when the party insulted rebels against the laws of honour and himself signs the decision of his degradation from manhood the public is in general right in this system the real wrong is on the side of the laws first wrong the allowing this anarchy to subsist with regard to insults which has rendered a recurrence to this whimsical and mischievous method necessary second wrong the having wished to oppose themselves to the practice of duelling—an imperfect but the only remedy third wrong the having opposed it only by disproportioned and inefficacious means chapter xv remedies for offences against honour we shall begin with the methods of satisfaction for offended honour the reasons which justify them will follow offences against honour may be divided into three classes verbal insults—corporal insults—insulting threats the punishment analogous to the offence ought to operate at the same time as a means of satisfaction for the party injured   list of these punishments      simple admonition     reading of the sentence against the offender by himself in a loud voice     the offender kneeling before the party injured     speech of humiliation which is prescribed to him     emblematical robes with which he may be dressed in particular cases     emblematical masks with a snakes head in cases of fraud—with a magpies or a parrots head in cases of temerity     the witnesses of the insult summoned to be witnesses of the reparation     the individuals whose good opinion is of importance to the offender summoned to the execution of the sentence     publicity of the judgment by the choice of the place concourse of spectators the printing the placarding the distribution of the sentence    0 banishment more or less long whether from the presence of the party injured or from that of his friends—for an insult offered in a public place as a market theatre or church banishment from these places      for a corporal insult similar infliction either by the party injured or at his choice by the hand of the executioner      for an insult offered to a woman the man might be muffled up in the headdress of a woman and the like insult might be inflicted on him by the hand of a woman many of these methods are new and some of them may appear singular but new methods are necessary since experience has shown the insufficiency of the old ones whilst as to their apparent singularity it is by this that they are adapted to their end and designed by their analogy to transfer to the insolent offender the contempt which he wished to fix upon the innocent these methods are numerous and varied that they may correspond with the number and variety of offences of this kind—that they may be adapted to the gravity of the cases and furnish suitable reparations to the different social distinctions for it is not proper to treat in the same manner an insult offered to a common person and to a magistrate to an ecclesiastic and to a military man to a young and to an old person all this parade of speeches attitudes emblems forms solemn or grotesque according to the difference of the cases in a word these public satisfactions converted into shows would furnish to the injured party actual pleasures and pleasures of remembrance which would compensate for the mortification of the insult observe that the injury having been caused by some mechanical means it is proper that similar mechanical means should be employed in the reparation otherwise it will not strike the imagination in the same manner and will be incomplete has the offender employed a certain kind of injury for turning the public contempt upon his adversary it is proper to employ an analogous kind of injury to turn this contempt upon himself the seat of the evil     is in opinion it is in opinion that the remedy must be found the wounds of this lance of telepheus can only be cured by the touch of the same lance it is an emblem of the operations of justice in matters of honour has the mischief arisen from an affront it is only by an affront that it can be repaired let us trace the effect of a satisfaction of this kind the party injured is reduced to a state of intolerable inferiority before his aggressor can no longer meet him with security in the same place and sees in the future only a prospect of repeated injuries but immediately after the legal reparation he regains what he had lost he walks with security erect and acquires even a positive superiority over his adversary how is this change produced it is because he is no longer seen as a feeble and miserable being who may be trampled under foot the power of the magistrate is become his no one will be tempted to repeat the insult of which the punishment has had so much eclât his oppressor who appeared for a moment to overtop him has fallen from his car of triumph the punishment he has undergone in the presence of so many witnesses proves that he is not more to be feared than another man and there remains nothing of his violence but the remembrance of its chastisement what can the offended party desire more if he had the strength of a gladiator where would be the advantage if legislators had always properly applied this system of satisfactions there would have been no duels which have only been and still are a supplement to the insufficiency of the laws in proportion as this void in legislation is filled up by measures suited to the protection of honour the use of duels will diminish and they will cease entirely when these honorary satisfactions agree exactly with opinion and are faithfully administered in former times duels have been employed as a means of decision in a great number of cases in which it would be most highly ridiculous now to employ them a lawyer who should send a challenge to his antagonist in order to prove a title or establish a right would be esteemed a fool in the twelfth century this method would have been esteemed valid whence arises this change from the same cause which has by degrees been operating in jurisprudence justice by becoming enlightened and establishing laws and forms of procedure has offered methods of redress preferable to that of duelling the same cause will produce the same effects so soon as the law shall offer a remedy for offences against honour there will be no temptation to have recourse to an equivocal and dangerous proceeding does any one love suffering and death certainly not this sentiment is equally a stranger to the heart of the coward and of the hero it is the silence of the laws—it is the neglect of justice which obliges the wise man to protect himself by this sad but sole resource in order that honorary satisfaction may have all the extent and force of which it is susceptible the definition of offences against honour should have sufficient latitude to embrace them all it should follow public opinion step by step—should be its faithful interpreter every thing which it regards as an attack upon honour should be regarded as such a word a gesture a look is either of them regarded by the public as an insult this word this gesture this look should suffice in justice to constitute it an offence the intention to injure constitutes the injury every thing directed toward a man to express or to attract contempt towards him is an insult and ought to have its reparation it is said that these insulting signs doubtful in their nature fugitive and often imaginary would be too difficult to be described and that some suspicious characters seeing an insult where there was none would cause the innocent to undergo undeserved punishments this danger is null because the line of demarcation is easily traced between real and imaginary injury it is sufficient on the requisition of the complainant to interrogate the defendant respecting his intention did you design by what you have said or done to mark such an one with contempt if he deny it his answer true or false is sufficient to clear the honour of him who has been or believes himself to have been offended for has the injury itself been only slightly equivocal to deny it is to have recourse to a lie to acknowledge his fault to disclose his fear and his weakness—in a word it is to perform an act of inferiority and to humiliate himself before his adversary in forming the catalogue of offences which possess the character of insults there are necessary exceptions care must be taken not to include in the decree of proscription useful acts of public censure—the exercise of the power of the popular sanction the authority necessary for correction and reprimand must be reserved to friends and superiors the freedom of history and of criticism must be secured chapter xvi of vindictive satisfaction this subject does not demand many particular rules—every species of satisfaction     naturally bringing in its train a punishment to the defendant a pleasure of vengeance for the party injured this pleasure is a gain it recals the riddle of samson it is the sweet which comes out of the strong it is the honey gathered from the carcase of the lion produced without expense net result of an operation necessary on other accounts it is an enjoyment to be cultivated as well as any other for the pleasure of vengeance considered abstractedly is like every other pleasure only good in itself it is innocent so long as it is confined within the limits of the laws it becomes criminal at the moment it breaks them it is not vengeance which ought to be regarded as the most malignant and most dangerous passion of the human heart it is antipathy it is intolerance these are the enmities of pride of prejudice of religion and of politics in a word that enmity is not dangerous which has foundation but that which is without a legitimate cause useful to the individual this motive is also useful to the public or to speak more correctly necessary it is this vindictive satisfaction which often unties the tongue of the witnesses it is this which generally animates the breast of the accuser and engages him in the service of justice notwithstanding the trouble the expenses the enmities to which it exposes him it is this which overcomes the public pity in the punishment of the guilty take away this spring the machinery of the laws will no longer move or at least the tribunals will only obtain services for money—a means which is not only burthensome to society but also exposed to very strong objections some commonplace moralists always the dupes of words cannot understand this truth the desire of vengeance is odious all satisfaction drawn from this source is vicious forgiveness of injuries is the noblest of virtues doubtless implacable characters whom no satisfaction can soften are hateful and ought to be so the forgiveness of injuries is a virtue necessary to humanity but it is only a virtue when justice has done its work when it has furnished or refused a satisfaction before this to forgive injuries is to invite their perpetration—is to be not the friend but the enemy of society what could wickedness desire more than an arrangement by which offences should be always followed by pardon what then ought to be done with the intention of yielding this vindictive satisfaction it is proper to do every thing which justice requires to answer the ends of the other satisfactions and for the punishment of the offence nothing more is required the least excess set apart for this object would be an evil in pure waste inflict the punishment which is deserved and the injured party may draw from it the degree of enjoyment which his situation yields and of which his nature is susceptible however without adding any thing to the gravity of the punishment on this particular account certain modifications may be given to it in accordance with what may be supposed the feelings of the injured party regard being had to his situation and the species of offence examples of this kind have been exhibited in the preceding chapter others will be shown in connexion with the choice of punishments chapter xvii of substitutive satisfaction or at the expense of a third party in the most common case it is upon the author of the evil that the expense of satisfaction ought to be fixed why because when fixed in this manner it tends in quality of punishment to prevent the evil by diminishing the frequency of the offence fixed upon another individual it would not have this effect does this reason no longer exist with regard to the first respondent does it apply to another in default of the first the law of responsibility ought to be modified in consequence or in other terms a third person ought to be called upon to pay instead of the author of the mischief when he cannot furnish the satisfaction and when the obligation imposed upon this third party tends to prevent the offence this may happen in the following cases—   responsibility of a master for his servant   responsibility of a guardian for his ward   responsibility of a father for his children   responsibility of a mother for her children in quality of tutor   responsibility of a husband for his wife   responsibility of an innocent person who profits by the offence   responsibility of a master for his servant this responsibility is founded upon two reasons the one of security the other of equality the obligation imposed upon the master acts as a punishment and diminishes the chance of similar misfortunes he is interested in knowing the character and watching over the conduct of those for whom he is answerable the law makes him an inspector of police a domestic magistrate by rendering him answerable for their imprudence besides the condition of master almost necessarily supposes a certain fortune the circumstance of being the party injured the     object of the misfortune supposes no such thing when there is an inevitable evil to be borne by one of two persons it is most desirable that its weight should be thrown upon him who is best able to bear it this responsibility may have certain inconveniences but if it did not exist the inconveniences would be still greater did a master wish to commit waste on the lands of his neighbour—to expose him to some accident—to wreak his vengeance on him—to make him live in continual uneasiness he need only choose some vicious servants whom he might instigate to serve his passions and his enmities without commanding any thing without being their accomplice or without it being possible to find proofs of it always ready to urge them on or to disavow them he might make them the instruments of his designs and run no risk himself by showing them a little more than ordinary confidence—by taking advantage of their attachment and devotedness of their servile vanity there is nothing which he may not obtain by general instigations without exposing himself to the danger of directing any thing in particular and he would rejoice with impunity over the evil which he had done by the hand of others unhappy that i am cried henry the second one day vexed with the haughtiness of an insolent prelate what so many servants who boast of their zeal and not one who will avenge me the effect of this imprudent or criminal apostrophe was the murder of the archbishop but that which essentially diminishes for the master the danger of his responsibility is the responsibility of the servant the real author of the mischief according to circumstances ought to be the first to bear its disagreeable consequences as far as he is able that the negligent or vicious servant may not be able coolly to say when doing mischief it is my masters affair and not mine besides the responsibility of the master is not always the same it ought to vary according to many circumstances which ought to be examined with attention the first thing to be considered is the degree of connexion which subsists between the master and the servant is he a daylabourer or a man engaged by the year—a workman out of doors or one dwelling in the house—an apprentice or a slave it is clear that the stronger the connexion is the more his responsibility ought to be increased an agent is less dependent upon his principal than a lackey upon his master the second thing to be considered is the nature of the work on which the servant is employed the presumptions against the master are less strong with regard to work in which his interest would be liable to suffer from the fault of his agents and they would be stronger in the contrary case in the first case the master has already a sufficient motive for exercising his superintendence in the second he cannot have this motive the law must supply it   the responsibility of the master is much greater if the mischief have happened on account of his service or during such service because it is to be presumed that he may have directed it that he ought to have foreseen the event and that he might have watched over his servants at this time more easily than during the hours of their liberty there is one case which seems exceedingly to reduce even if it does not altogether destroy the strongest reason for responsibility when the mischief has for its cause a serious offence accompanied consequently by a proportional punishment if my servant for example having a personal quarrel with my neighbour set fire to his granaries ought i to be answerable for a damage that i could not hinder if the madman do not dread being hanged will he dread being driven from my service such are the presumptions which serve as a foundation for responsibility presumption of negligence on the part of the master presumption of superior wealth on the part of the master above the party injured c but it ought not to be forgotten that these presumptions are nothing when they are contradicted by facts an accident for example has happened by the overturning of a carriage nothing is known of the party injured it is presumed that he is in a situation to receive an indemnity from its owner who it is presumed is in a condition to bear the loss but what becomes of this presumption when it is known that this owner is a poor farmer and the party injured a wealthy noble that the first would be ruined if he had to pay the indemnity which is of little consequence to the other hence presumptions ought to guide but they ought never to enslave the legislator ought to consult them in establishing general rules but he ought to allow the judge to modify their application according to individual cases the general rule establishes the responsibility of the master but the judge according to the nature of the circumstances should change this arrangement and cause the weight of the loss to fall upon the true author of the evil by leaving to the judge the greatest latitude     with respect to this reparation the greatest abuse which can result will be the occasional introduction of the inconvenience which the general rule would necessarily produce on whichever side it may be fixed if the judge favour the author of the mischief on one occasion and the master on another he who is improperly treated by the free choice of the judge is not worse off than if he had been thus improperly treated by the inflexible choice of the law in our systems of jurisprudence these modifications have not been observed the burden of the entire loss is thrown sometimes upon the servant sometimes upon the master from which it results that sometimes security and at other times equality have been neglected whilst the one or the other ought to have been preferred according to the nature of the case   responsibility of a guardian for his ward the ward is not among the number of the goods of the guardian he is on the contrary among the number of his charges has the pupil sufficient fortune to furnish the satisfaction it is not necessary that another should pay it for him has he not the means the guardianship is in this case too weighty a burthen to be surcharged with factitious responsibility all that ought to be done is to attach to the negligence of the guardian proved or even presumed a fine larger or smaller according to the nature of the proofs but which ought not to exceed the expense of satisfaction to the party injured   responsibility of a father for his children if a master ought to be responsible for the faults of his servants much more ought a father to be so for the faults of his children is it possible and ought the master to watch over those who depend upon him it is a much more pressing duty upon a father and much more easy to be fulfilled he exercises over them not only the authority of a domestic magistrate but he possesses all the ascendancy of affection he is not only the guardian of their physical existence he may command all the sentiments of their souls the master may not have been able to restrain or to watch a servant who announces dangerous dispositions but the father who might have fashioned at his own will the character and the habits of his children may be considered the author of all the dispositions which they manifest are they depraved it is almost always the effect of his negligence or of his vices he ought therefore to bear the consequences of an evil which he ought to have prevented if it be necessary to add a new reason after so strong a one it may be said that the children with the exception of the rights which belong to them as sentient beings are part of a mans property and ought to be considered as such he who enjoys the advantages of the possession ought to bear its inconveniences the good much more than compensates for the evil it would be very singular if the loss or destruction occasioned by children should be borne by an individual who knows nothing of them but their malice or their imprudence rather than by him who finds in them the greatest source of his happiness and may indemnify himself by a thousand hopes for the actual cares of their education but this responsibility has a natural limit the majority of a son or the marriage of a daughter putting an end to the authority of the father causes the responsibility which the law throws upon a father to cease he ought no longer to bear the punishment of an action which he has no longer the power to hinder to perpetuate during his whole life the responsibility of a father as the author of the vicious dispositions of his children would be cruel and unjust for in the first place it is not true that all the vices of an adult may be attributed to the defects of his education different causes of corruption after the period of independence may triumph over the most virtuous education and besides this the condition of a father is sufficiently unhappy when the evil dispositions of a child arrived at the age of manhood have broken out into crime after all that he has already suffered in the bosom of his family the pain which he experiences from the misconduct or dishonour of his child is a species of punishment which nature itself inflicts upon him and which it is not necessary that the law should aggravate this would be to spread poison over his wounds without hope either of repairing the past or guarding against the future those who would justify this barbarous jurisprudence by the example of the chinese have not recollected that the authority of the father in that country ceases only with his life and that it is just that his responsibility should continue as long as his power   responsibility of the mother for her child the obligation of the mother in similar cases is naturally regulated by the rights she possesses is the father still alive the responsibility of the mother as well as her power remain absorbed in that of her husband is he deceased as she takes in hand the reins of domestic government she becomes responsible for those who are subject to her empire       responsibility of the husband for his wife this case is as simple as the preceding the obligation of the husband depends on his rights the administration of their goods belongs to him alone unless the husband were responsible the party injured would be without remedy as to the rest the order generally established is supposed here that order so necessary to the peace of families the education of children and the maintenance of manners that order so ancient and so universal which places the wife under the authority of the husband as he is her head and guardian he answers for her before the law he is even charged with a more delicate responsibility before the tribunal of public opinion but this observation does not belong to our present subject   responsibility of an innocent person who has profited by the offence it often happens that a person without having had any share in an offence derives from it a sensible profit is it not proper that this person should be called upon to indemnify the party injured if the guilty party cannot be found or if he be not able to furnish an indemnity this proceeding would be conformable to the principles we have laid down—in the first place with regard to security for he may have been an accomplice without its having been proved also with regard to equality for it is more desirable that one person should be simply deprived of a gain rather than that another should suffer an equal loss a few examples will suffice to explain this subject by piercing a dike the land of one party has been deprived of the benefit of the water which he formerly possessed and it has been given to another he who comes into the enjoyment of this unexpected advantage owes at least a part of his gain to him who has suffered loss a tenant in possession whose estate passes to a stranger by entail has been killed and has left a family in want the tenant in tail who thus comes into a premature enjoyment of the estate ought to be accountable for a certain satisfaction to the family of the deceased a benefice has become vacant because its possessor has been killed it matters not how if he have left a wife and children in poverty the successor owes them an indemnity proportioned to their necessity and the enjoyment they had anticipated chapter xviii of subsidiary satisfaction at the expense of the public treasure the best source from which satisfaction can be taken is the property of the delinquent because it fulfils as we have seen with a superior degree of suitableness the functions of a punishment but if the delinquent have no fortune ought the injured individual to remain without satisfaction no for the reasons which we have already set down satisfaction is almost as necessary as punishment it ought to be made at the expense of the public treasure because it is an object of public benefit the security of all is concerned the obligation upon the public treasure to provide satisfaction is founded upon a reason which has the clearness of an axiom a pecuniary burthen divided among the whole number of individuals is nothing for each one in comparison with what it would be for each one or a small number is insurance useful in commercial enterprises it would be no less so in the great social enterprise where the associates find themselves united by a train of chances without knowing each other without choice without the power of avoiding it or guarding themselves by their prudence against the multitude of snares which they may mutually prepare calamities which arise from crimes are not less real evils than those which arise from natural causes if the sleep of the master be sweeter in a house insured against fire it would be still more so if he were insured against theft abstraction made of its abuses too great extent could hardly be given to a method so perfectible and so ingenious which renders real losses so light and which gives so much security against eventual evils however all insurances are exposed to great abuses from fraud or negligence fraud on the part of those who in order to obtain unlawful indemnities feign or exaggerate their losses negligence whether on the part of the assurers who do not take all necessary precautions or on the part of the assured who use less vigilance in guarding against losses which are not to be borne by them in a system of satisfactions at the expense of the public treasure there is reason to fear—   a secret connivance between the party pretending to be hurt and the pretended author of the offence in order to obtain an undue indemnity   too great security on the part of individuals who having no longer to fear the same consequences of crimes would not make the same efforts to prevent them     this second danger is little to be dreaded no one would neglect his actual possessions a good certain and present with the hope of recovering in case of loss only an equivalent for the thing lost and even at the most an equivalent to this let it be added that this recovery would not be obtained without care and expense that there must be a transient privation that he must bear the burthen of prosecution and act the always disagreeable part of an accuser and that after all under the best system of procedure success is still doubtful there would remain therefore sufficient motives for each individual to watch his property and not to encourage offences by his negligence on the side of fraud the danger is much greater it cannot be prevented but by detailed precautions which will be explained elsewhere as examples it will be sufficient to point out two opposite cases one in which the utility of the remedy exceeds the danger of the abuse the other in which the danger of the abuse exceeds the utility of the remedy when the damage is occasioned by an offence the punishment of which is weighty and its author is judicially convicted of the crime it seems that fraud is very difficult all that the impostor who pretends to have been hurt can do to procure an accomplice is to give him a part of the profits of the fraud but unless the clearest principles of proportion between crimes and punishments have been neglected the punishment which the accomplice will have to undergo would be more than an equivalent to the total profit of the fraud observe the offender ought to be convicted before the satisfaction is awarded without this precaution the public treasure would be pillaged nothing would be more common than the tale of imaginary thefts of pretended robberies committed in a clandestine manner or during the darkness of the night or by unknown persons who have escaped but when it is necessary to have apprehended the guilty complicity is not easy the part which it would be necessary to act is not one of those which is easily performed in as much as besides the certainty of punishment for the individual charged with the pretended offence there would also be a particular punishment in case the imposture should be detected—a punishment to be shared by the two accomplices and if it be considered how difficult it is to invent a plausible story of an offence altogether imaginary it may be believed that such frauds would be very rare if they ever happened the danger most to be apprehended is the exaggeration of a loss resulting from a real offence but it is necessary that the offence should be susceptible of this species of falsehood and this is a case sufficiently rare it appears therefore that it may be laid down as a maxim that in all cases in which the punishment of an offence is weighty it need not be feared that an imaginary offender will be willing to charge himself with an offence for a doubtful profit but for the opposite reason when the mischief results from an offence of which the punishment is slight or none the danger of abuse would be at its height if the public treasure were responsible for it the insolvability of a debtor is an example where is the beggar who would not be trusted if the public were security for him what treasury would be able to pay every creditor whose debtors did not actually pay them and how many false debts would it not be possible easily to suppose this indemnification would not only be abusive it is unnecessary since in the transactions of commerce the risk of loss enters into the price of merchandise or the interest of money if the merchant were sure never to lose he would sell at a lower price hence to seek from the public an indemnification for a loss which had been compensated for beforehand would be to seek to be paid twice over there are other cases in which satisfaction ought to be made at the public expense   cases of physical calamity such as inundations fires c aids granted by the state in such cases are not only founded upon the principle that the weight of the evil divided among all becomes more light they rest also upon this other that the state as protector of the national wealth is interested in preventing the deterioration of the national domain and ought to reestablish the means of reproduction in those parts which have suffered such were what have been called the liberalities of frederick the great to those provinces which had been desolated by certain calamities they were acts of prudence and preservation   losses and misfortunes the consequences of hostilities those who have been exposed to the invasions of the enemy have a right so much the more particular to a public indemnification as they may be considered as having sustained the attack which threatened all parties as being by their situation the point the most exposed for the common defence       evils resulting from unblameable errors of the ministers of justice an error in justice is already by itself a subject of grief but that this error once known should not be repaired by proportional indemnification is an overturning of the social order ought not the public to follow the rules of equity which are imposed on individuals is it not shameful that it should employ its power in severely exacting what is due to itself and should refuse to restore what it owes but this obligation is so evident that it becomes obscure by endeavouring to prove it   responsibility of a community for an offence of violence committed in a public place in its territory it is not properly the public treasure which ought to be employed in this case it is the funds of the district or province which ought to be taxed for the reparation of a negligence of police in case of competition the interests of an individual ought to have place before those of the revenue what is due to the injured party on account of satisfaction ought to be paid in preference to what is due to the public treasure on account of fine ordinary jurisprudence does not decide thus but it is thus that reason decides the loss suffered by an individual is an evil felt the profit to the revenue is a good not felt by any person what is paid by the offender as a fine is a punishment and nothing more what he pays as a satisfaction is also a punishment and a punishment even more than ordinarily strong besides this it is a satisfaction for the party injured that is to say a good when i pay to the revenue a creature of reason with whom i have no quarrel i feel only the same regret for the loss as i should do had i dropt the sum into a well when i pay it to my adversary when i am thus obliged to confer a benefit on him whom i wished to injure there is connected with the payment a degree of humiliation which gives to the punishment thus inflicted the most desirable character part ii— rationale of punishment advertisement the following account is given by m dumont of his labours with respect to the two volumes published by him at paris in      under the title of théorie des peines et des récompenses of this work three editions have been printed in france and one in england when i published in paris in   0  les traités de legislation civile et pénale in three volumes i announced other works of the same kind which i had in the same manner extracted from the manuscripts of mr bentham but which were not then ready for the press success has encouraged my labours three thousand copies were distributed more rapidly than i had dared to hope would be the case with the first work of a foreign author but little known upon the continent i have reason also to think that all recent as this work is it has not been without its influence since it has been frequently quoted in many official compositions relating to civil or criminal codes but circumstances which prevented these new volumes from entering upon the same course of circulation as the preceding have sometimes cooled my zeal and i should willingly have resigned the task i had imposed upon myself if the author would have undertaken it himself unhappily he is as little disposed so to do as ever and if these works do not appear in the french dress which i have given them it is most probable that they will remain shut up in his cabinet they have lain there thirty years the manuscripts from which i have extracted la théorie des peines were written in      those which have supplied me with la théorie des récompenses are a little later they were not thrown aside as useless but laid aside as roughhewn materials which might at a future day be polished and form part of a general system of legislation—or as studies which the author had made for his own use these manuscripts though much more voluminous than the work i have presented to the public are very incomplete they offered to me often different essays upon the same subject of which it was necessary to take the substance and unite them into one in some chapters i had nothing but marginal notes to direct me for the fourth book of la théorie des peines i was obliged to collect     and prepare a variety of fragments the discussion upon the punishment of death was unfinished at one time the author intended to treat of this subject anew but this intention has not been carried into effect he had prepared nothing upon transportation—nothing upon penitentiaries the idea of the panopticon was as yet unformed i have derived the foundations of these two important chapters from a work of mr benthams since published letters to lord pelham c c i have taken all that suited my general method of treating the subject by separating it from all controversy after these explanations it will not be matter of surprise if the facts and allusions do not always accord with the date of the original manuscripts i have freely used the rights of an editor according to the nature of the text and the occasion i have translated commented abridged or supplied but it need hardly be repeated after what was said in the preliminary discourse to the former publication that this cooperation on my part has had reference to the details only and ought not to diminish the confidence of the readers it is not my work that i present to them it is as faithfully as the nature of things will permit the work of mr bentham it has been said that these additions these changes should bear some distinctive mark but though this species of fidelity is desirable it is impossible it is only necessary to imagine what is the labour of finishing a first sketch—of completing unfinished and unreviewed manuscripts sometimes consisting of fragments and simple notes in order to comprehend that it required a continued freedom a species of imperceptible infusion if i may so speak which it is scarcely possible for the individual himself to remember this is however of no importance it may be believed that the author has not found his ideas disfigured or falsified since he has continued to entrust me with his papers i must however declare that he has altogether refused to share my labour and that he will not in any manner be responsible for it as he has never been satisfied with a first attempt and has never published anything which he has not written at least twice over he has foreseen that the revision of so old an essay would lead him too far away from and be incompatible with his present engagements in this manner he has justified his refusal but he has authorised me to add that any change which he might make would bear only upon the form as respects the principles his opinions have not changed on the contrary time and reflection have given them additional strength that mr bentham who is too particular about his productions should not deem these worthy of the public notice will not astonish those who know all that he requires of himself and the ideas which he has formed for himself of a complete work a perfect book would be that which should render useless all which had been written in time past or that could be written in future time upon the same subject with respect to the second condition it is not possible to decide when it is accomplished without pretending to measure the power of the human mind with respect to the first we can more easily decide by a comparison with the works which have gone before this comparison has supported me against a just distrust of my own powers after the author had refused me all assistance and had expressed his doubts upon the merit of his own work i was led to reperuse and reconsider the most celebrated works upon this subject and even those which had been less distinguished and then i could hesitate no longer i was tempted at one time to collect every thing dispersed through lesprit des lois upon the subject of rewards and punishments this collection would have been contained in ten or a dozen pages by thus collecting the whole together it would have been possible to judge of the correctness of that expression of dalembert so often repeated in france that montesquieu had said all that he had abridged all because he had seen all among a multitude of vague and undefined thoughts upon these subjects of which some are erroneous there are certainly some which are judicious and profound as in every thing we possess of this illustrious writer but he has not developed the rationale of rewards and punishments—indeed this was not his design and nothing would be more unjust than to criticise him for not having done what he did not intend to perform beccaria has done more he first examined the efficacy of punishments by considering their effect upon the human heart by calculating the force of the motives by which individuals are impelled to the commission of crimes and of those opposite motives which the law ought to present this species of analytical merit was however less the cause of his great success than the courage with which he attacked established errors and that eloquent humanity which spreads so lively an interest over his work but after this i scruple not to say that he is destitute of method that he is not directed by any general principle that he only glances at the most important questions that he carefully shuns all practical discussions in which it would have been evident that he was unacquainted with the science of jurisprudence he announces   0 two distinct objects—crimes and punishments he adds to these occasionally procedure and these three vast subjects with difficulty furnish out matter for one little volume after montesquieu and beccaria we may leave in peace a whole library of books more or less valuable but which are not distinguished by any great character of originality not but that we should find in them correct and judicious views interesting facts valuable criticisms upon laws many of which no longer exist and to the disappearance of which these works have contributed i intend not here to enter in detail either upon their criticism or eulogium it is enough for me to observe that none have laid down the rationale of rewards and punishments or could be employed as a general guide in the volumes formerly published the rationale of punishment was only sketched out—a general map only was given of the department of criminal law of which this work exhibits the topography to prevent frequent reference and to render this work complete in itself i have borrowed some chapters from the preceding work making considerable additions to them and giving them a different form at the risk however of inspiring my readers with a prejudice unfavourable to my work i must acknowledge that its object how important soever it may be in relation to its consequences is any thing but interesting in its nature i have been sensible of this during the progress of my labour and i have not completed it without having often to conquer myself a philosophical interest alone must suffice the descriptions of punishments and the examination of punishments which follow each other without cessation in a didactic order do not allow of a variety of style do not present any pictures upon which the imagination can repose with pleasure    felices ditant hæc ornamenta libellos   non est conveniens luctibus ille color happily the subject of rewards by its novelty and by the ideas of virtues talents and services which it causes to pass in review will conduct the readers by more agreeable routes the tartarus and elysium o legislation so to speak are here disclosed but in entering into this tartarus it is only to lighten its torments and we are careful not to engrave upon its portal the terrible inscription of the poet lasciate speranza voi ch entrate book i general principles chapter i definitions and distinctions to afford a clear apprehension of the subject of the following work which subject is punishment it is necessary that what punishment is and what punishment is not should be clearly understood for this purpose it will be proper to distinguish it from those objects with which it is in danger of being confounded and also to point out the different shapes which it may assume punishment whatever shape it may assume is an evil the matter of evil therefore is the sort of matter here in question the matter of evil in almost all the shapes of which it is susceptible in considering this matter two objects constant accompaniments one to the other will require to be distinguished viz   the act by which the evil is considered as being produced and   what is considered as being the result of that same act the evil itself which is thus produced the english language affords but one singleworded appellative in common use for designating both these objects viz punishment punishment may be defined—an evil resulting to an individual from the direct intention of another on account of some act that appears to have been done or omitted the propriety of this definition will appear and its use be manifested by taking it to pieces and examining its several constituent parts punishment then is an evil—that is a physical evil either a pain or a loss of pleasure     or else of that situation or condition of the party affected which is the immediate cause of such pain or loss of pleasure it is an evil resulting from the direct intention of another it is not punishment if it be obliquely intentional on the part of the person from whose agency it results but an evil of some other nature but which however is not in all cases distinguished by a specific name it is an evil resulting to a person from the direct intention of another on account of some act that has been done or omitted an evil resulting to an individual although it be from the direct intention of another if it be not on account of some act that has been done or omitted is not a punishment if out of wantonness for the sake of sport or out of illwill resulting from an antipathy you entertain against a mans person without having any particular act of his to ground it upon you do him a mischief the evil produced in this case is what nobody would understand to come under the name of punishment but so it be on account of some act that has been done it matters not by whom the act was done the most common case is for the act to have been done by the same person by whom the evil is suffered but the evil may light upon a different person and still bear the name of punishment in such case it may be styled punishment in alienam personam in contradistinction to the more common case in which it may be styled punishment in propriam personam whether the act be ultimately or only mediately intentional it may consistently enough with common usage bear the name of punishment though according as it was in the one or other way that the intention happened to regard it the act will assume a different name as we shall have occasion to mention presently it must be on account of some act that at least appears to have been done but whether such an act as appears to have been done or any act actually was done is not material by the denomination thus given to the act by the word punishment taken by itself no limitation is put to the description of the person of the agent but on the occasion of the present work this person is all along considered as a person invested for this purpose with the authority of the state a legislator appointing the species of evil to be inflicted in a species of case or a judge appointing the individual lot of evil to be inflicted in this or that individual case vengeance antipathy amendment disablement determent selfdefence selfpreservation safe custody restraint compulsion torture compensation in the sense in which it means a particular mode of satisfaction for injury or damage—burthen in any such phrase as that of imposition of a burthen and taxation by all these several words ideas are presented which will require in each instance to be compared and in most instances to be distinguished from the ideas presented by the word punishment take whatever portion of the matter of evil is upon the carpet whether the term punishment shall or shall not with propriety be applied depends upon the position in which the actual result stands with reference to the time in which the will or intention of the agent acts intention or unintentional if intentional directly or indirectly or to use another word collaterally intentional if directly ultimately or but mediately intentional such are the modifications which the matter of evil may be considered as receiving when considered in the character of an object to which the will or intention turns itself in some cases the man in power or some person or persons having as he supposes received at the hands of some person or other evil in some shape or other the object which he has in view in the affliction of the evil in question is an enjoyment of a certain kind which he derives or expects to derive from the contemplation of the evil thus sustained in this case the act in question is termed an act of vengeance so far as this and this alone is his object this evil thus produced is not only directly but ultimately intentional whether in the character of a sole object a result of this nature be a fit object for the man in power to propose to himself is indeed a very important question but one which has no place here punishment by being misapplied is not the less punishment laying out of the above case the supposed antecedent evil you have no longer an act of vengeance but an act performed for the mere gratification of antipathy but by the supposition having for its author or agent the legislator or the judge it is still not the less an act of punishment of the cases in which the act productive of the evil intentionally produced by the hand of power is termed an act of punishment the most common class is that which is composed of those in which on the part of the agent the evil thus produced is though intentional and even directly intentional yet not ultimately but only mediately intentional in this case the ultimately intentional object—the object in relation to which the act of punishment is intended to minister in the character of a means to an end—may be either an act of the negative or the positive cast when the act to which the punishment is     annexed is of the positive cast the ultimately intentional object aimed at by the act of punishment is of the opposite cast and so when the offence is negative the result the production of which is aimed at by the punishment is positive if the offence be of the positive cast then come the following string of appellatives expressive of the results the production of which is in different ways aimed at viz   amendment or reformation   disablement   determent   selfdefence   selfpreservation   safe custody and   restraint if the offence be of the negative cast then comes another string of appellatives expressive as above of the results aimed at viz   compulsion or restraint   torture   compensation in the sense in which it is equivalent to satisfaction rendered in consideration of injury resulting from an offence or in consideration of damage produced without intentional injury   taxation whether the result aimed at be of the negative or positive cast the terms coercion obligation burthen or the phrase imposition of a burthen are competent to the designation of it amendment or reformation and disablement are words expressive of the result aimed at in so far as the conduct of the supposed delinquent is concerned in the case of amendment or reformation the obnoxious act is regarded as being of such a nature that by a single instance of its being committed such a degree of disorder in the moral constitution is indicated as requires a general change to remove it and bring the patient to a state of ordinary purity few if any offences of the negative class being to be found which exhibit any such degree of malignity—the use of the terms amendment and reformation is nearly confined to the case when the obnoxious act the prevention of which is the ultimate end of the punishment is of the positive kind disablement is a term for which with reference to an act of the negative kind a place is hardly to be found doing nothing is a sort of offence to which every man is so competent that all endeavours on the part of government to disable a man from committing it may be set at defiance determent is a result equally applicable to the case either of a positive or negative offence it is moreover equally applicable to the situation of the alreadypunished delinquent and that of other persons at large nor does it involve on the part of the punished delinquent the supposition of any such general disorder as is implied by the words amendment or reformation when the ultimately intentional result is amendment or reformation it is by the impression made by the action of the evil on the will of the offender that in so far as it is produced the result is considered as being produced in this case the act of punishment is also termed an act of correction when the ultimately intentional result is disablement it is by depriving the offender of the power of committing obnoxious acts of the like description that in so far as it is produced the result is considered as being produced in this case the course taken to produce the result may either be such the nature of which is to produce it only for a time as is done by temporary imprisonment confinement or deportation or for ever as would in some cases be done by mutilation in so far as by the act of punishment exercised on the delinquent other persons at large are considered as deterred from the commission of acts of the like obnoxious description and the act of punishment is in consequence considered as endued with the quality of determent it is by the impression made on the will of those persons an impression made in this case not by the act itself but by the idea of it accompanied with the eventual expectation of a similar evil as about to be eventually produced in their own instances that the ultimately intentional result is considered as produced and in this case it is also said to be produced by the example or by the force of example between selfdefence and punishment the relation is of this sort viz that to the same act which ministers to the one of those purposes it may happen to minister to the other this coincidence may have place in either of two ways an act which has selfdefence for its direct object and result may have punishment for its collateral result or an act which has punishment for its direct object and result may have selfdefence for its collateral result in repelling a personal assault it may happen to an individual intentionally or unintentionally to inflict on the assailant a suffering by any amount greater than that of any which by the assault was inflicted on himself if unintentionally selfdefence was not only the sole ultimately intentional but the sole intentional result but the suffering of the assailant though not the collaterally intentional was not in effect less truly the collateral result on the other hand in inflicting punishment on a delinquent it may happen to the man in authority to be exercising on his own behalf an act of selfdefence in regard to all offences such as rebellion and treason which have for their object or their effect the subversion of the government or the weakening of its powers but it is only in reference to such offences that an act of punishment can with reference to the constituted authorities be with propriety called an act of selfdefence but if in lieu of the constituted authorities     the members of the community at large be considered as the persons by whom the punishment is inflicted then is all punishment an act of selfdefence in relation to the particular species of evil with which the offence thus punished is pregnant an act tending to defend the community against offences of the sort in question with their attendant evils viz by means of reformation disablement and determent one or more of them as above in the signification of the word selfdefence it is implied that the evil against which the party is endeavouring to guard himself has for its cause an act done by some sentient being with the intention of producing that same evil the word selfpreservation is alike applicable whatsoever be the source or quarter from which the evil is considered as about to come in so far therefore as the act of punishment is with propriety capable of being termed an act of selfdefence it is with the same propriety capable of being termed an act of selfpreservation between safe custody and punishment the relation is of this sort—to one and the same operation or factitious state of things it may happen to be productive of both of these effects but in the instance of the same individual it is only to a limited degree that there can be a sufficient reason for making provision for both at the same time to a considerable extent imprisonment with propriety may be and every where is applied under the name and to the purpose of punishment in this case safe custody is in part the same thing with the intended punishment itself in part a concomitant necessary to the existence and continuance of whatsoever inflictions it may be deemed proper to add to those which are inseparable from the safe custody itself but in another case imprisonment or an infliction of the same name at least as that which is employed as above for the purpose of punishment is to a great extent administered ultimately for the purpose of eventual forthcomingness and mediately for the purpose of safe custody though no such thing as punishment is or at least ought to be intended because no ground for punishment has as yet been and perhaps never may be established between restraint and punishment the relation is of this sort in some shape or other restraint is the directly intentional result of every prohibitive law the evil whatever it be that constitutes an inseparable accompaniment of the state thus denominated is a collaterally intentional result of that same law the evil of the restraint may be very moderate but still by every general prohibitive law evil in some shape or other in some quantity or other must come at the same time restraint is in a great variety of shapes capable of being employed in the character of a punishment as a punishment restraint is not incapable of being employed for the purpose of securing submission to restraint but in this case the coincidence is but verbal and arises from the generality of the word restraint in the character of a punishment we cannot employ the restraint collaterally resulting from the negative act the production of which is the object of the prohibition in the character of the eventual punishment to secure obedience to that same prohibitive law to prevent a man from stealing a law threatening to prevent him from stealing would be but an indifferent resource to secure by means of eventual punishment restraint in this shape you must employ restraint in some other shape for example the restraint attached to imprisonment between compulsion and punishment the relation is of this sort in the case of compulsion as in the case of restraint the act in question is the act which is regarded as the efficient cause of the evil the prevention of which is the ultimate object of the act of punishment what restraint is in the case when the act in question is of the positive cast compulsion is in the case when the act is of the negative cast between torture and punishment the relation is of this sort the term torture is employed and perhaps with nearly equal frequency in two different senses in its most extended sense it is employed to designate pain especially pain of body when considered as being intense in its degree and this without reference to the cause by which it is produced in its more restricted sense being that in which it is most apt to be employed when considered as the result of law it is employed to signify pain of body in its degree intense as above employed in due course of law or at any rate by the hand of power in the character of an instrument of compulsion but the account given of it when employed in this sense wants much as yet of being complete the compulsion or constraint may be produced by the mere apprehension of the punishment which is denounced by this circumstance torture stands distinguished not only from compulsion itself but from any lot of punishment considered as applied to the purpose of compulsion in the ordinary mode the notion of torture is not included in a punishment attached to an act of disobedience of which no remission is allowed but suppose the same lot of pain attached to the same offence with power to remit any part of it in case of and immediately upon compliance with the requisition of the law and     here the punishment comes under the notion and denomination of torture between compensation or satisfaction and punishment the relation is of this sort in all cases if compensation be the end in view so far as concerns pecuniary compensation by whatsoever is done for the purpose of compensation the effect of pecuniary punishment is produced likewise more suffering however will in general be produced by what is taken for the purpose of compensation than if the same amount were taken for the purpose of punishment it will be accompanied by the regret produced by the idea of the advantage not only reaped by an adversary but reaped at ones own expense on the other hand by the contemplation of the suffering inflicted by punishment on the delinquents good in the shape of compensation or say vindictive satisfaction is administered to the party injured between taxation and punishment of the pecuniary kind for it is only in this form that they can be compared the relation is of this sort they both consist in the application of compulsion to the extracting out of the pocket in question a certain sum the difference between them consists in the end in view in the case of taxation the object is the obtainment of a certain sum in the case of punishment the object is the prevention of the obnoxious act to the commission of which the obligation of paying the money is attached in the character of a punishment in the case of taxation the wish of the legislator is that the money may be paid and consequently if it be to the performance of a certain act that the obligation of paying the money is annexed his wish is that the act may be performed as in the two cases the result intended is opposite the actual results are accordingly incompatible in so far as either result is obtained the other is missed whether the effect of any given law shall be taxation or effectual prohibition depends in the instance of each individual upon the value which in the case in question he is called upon to pay compared with the value in his estimation of the advantage which stands annexed to the exercise of the act if the advantage appear the greater he pays the money and exercises the act if the value of the money to be eventually paid appear the greater he obeys the prohibitory law and abstains from the performance of the act when the face assumed by any law is that of a prohibition if the penalty be nothing but pecuniary and the amount is fixed while the profits of the offence are variable the probability is that in many instances the penalty even if levied which could not be without detection prosecution and conviction would but operate as a taxed licence this circumstance is so obvious that one would have thought it could not have been overlooked had it however been observed with any tolerable steadiness in england the law of that country would wear a face widely different from that which it wears at present in relation to all these several results or concomitants of punishment one observation useful to be borne in mind that it may     operate as a preservative against much error is—that it is but in very few if any of these instances that from the name by which the object is here designated any true judgment can be formed on any such question as whether and how far the object is a fit object of pursuit or aim in the character of an end take any one of them for example—if taken by itself that object be of the nature of good yet in the first place that good may be in any degree minute in the next place to the quantity of evil with which it may happen to it to be followed there are no limits and thus it is that false must be that proposition which without leaving room for exceptions should pronounce the attainment of that object to be universally an end fit to be aimed at whether through the intervention of punishment or any other means and conversely of the distinctions here pointed out between punishment and the several objects that are of kin to it five distinguishable practical uses may be made   they may serve as a memento to the legislator to see on every occasion that for the several objects which may have place and present a demand for legislative provision due and adequate provision is accordingly made   to preserve him from the delusion which would have place wheresoever it happens that by one and the same lot of evil due and adequate provision may be made for two or more of these purposes if by the difference of their respective denominations he were led to give birth to two or more lots of evil for the purpose of effecting the good for the effectuation of which one of them would suffice   that in each instance in comparing the end he has in view with the means which he proposes to employ for the attainment of it the view he takes of such proposed means may be sufficiently clear correct and complete to enable him to form a correct judgment of the mode and degree in which they promise to be conducive to the attainment of the end   that he may be upon his guard against that sort of rhetorical artifice which operates by substituting for the proper name of the object or result in question according to the purpose in view the name of some other object or result the name of which is either more or less popular than the proper one   that while in pursuit of any one of these objects in the character of an end he employs such means as to his conception appear conducive to that end he may be correctly and completely aware of any tendency which such arrangements may have to be conducive or obstructive with reference to any other of these same ends chapter ii classification in a former work it has been shown that offences against individuals may be ranged under four principal heads offences against the person property reputation and condition the same division may be applied to punishments an individual can only be punished by affecting his person his property his reputation or his condition the circumstance which renders these two classifications similar is this—punishments and offences are both evils caused by the free agency of man in as many points as we are liable to be injured by the hand of an offender in so many points is the offender himself exposed to the sword of justice the difference between punishments and offences is not then in their nature which is or may be the same but in the legality of the one and the illegality of the other offences are prohibited punishments are instituted by the laws their effects also are diametrically opposite an offence produces an evil both of the first and second order† it causes suffering in an individual which he was unable to avoid and it spreads an alarm more or less general a punishment produces an evil of the first order and a good of the second order it inflicts suffering upon an individual who has incurred it voluntarily and in its secondary effects it produces only good it intimidates the illdisposed it reassures the innocent and becomes the safeguard of society those punishments which immediately affect the person in its active or passive powers constitute the class of corporal punishments they may be divided into the following different kinds—     simply afflictive punishments     complexly afflictive punishments     restrictive punishments     active or laborious punishments     capital punishments punishments which affect property reputation     or condition possess this quality in common they deprive the individual of some advantage which he before enjoyed such are privative punishments losses and forfeitures the punishments of this class are very various they extend to every possible kind of possession hence we perceive that all punishments may be reduced to two classes   corporal punishments   privative punishments or punishments by loss or forfeiture chapter iii of the ends of punishment when any act has been committed which is followed or threatens to be followed by such effects as a provident legislator would be anxious to prevent two wishes naturally and immediately suggest themselves to his mind first to obviate the danger of the like mischief in future secondly to compensate the mischief that has already been done the mischief likely to ensue from acts of the like kind may arise from either of two sources—either the conduct of the party himself who has been the author of the mischief already done or the conduct of such other persons as may have adequate motives and sufficient opportunities to do the like hence the prevention of offences divides itself into two branches particular prevention which applies to the delinquent himself and general prevention which is applicable to all the members of the community without exception pain and pleasure are the great springs of human action when a man perceives or supposes pain to be the consequence of an act he is acted upon in such a manner as tends with a certain force to withdraw him as it were from the commission of that act if the apparent magnitude or rather value of that pain be greater than the apparent magnitude or value of the pleasure or good he expects to be the consequence of the act he will be absolutely prevented from performing it the mischief which would have ensued from the act if performed will also by that means be prevented with respect to a given individual the recurrence of an offence may be provided against in three ways—   by taking from him the physical power of offending   by taking away the desire of offending   by making him afraid of offending in the first case the individual can no more commit the offence in the second he no longer desires to commit it in the third he may still wish to commit it but he no longer dares to do it in the first case there is a physical incapacity in the second a moral reformation in the third there is intimidation or terror of the law general prevention is effected by the denunciation of punishment and by its application which according to the common expression serves for an example the punishment suffered by the offender presents to every one an example of what he himself will have to suffer if he is guilty of the same offence general prevention ought to be the chief end of punishment as it is its real justification if we could consider an offence which has been committed as an isolated fact the like of which would never recur punishment would be useless it would be only adding one evil to another but when we consider that an unpunished crime leaves the path of crime open not only to the same delinquent but also to all those who may have the same motives and opportunities for entering upon it we perceive that the punishment inflicted on the individual becomes a source of security to all that punishment which considered in itself appeared base and repugnant to all generous sentiments is elevated to the first rank of benefits when it is regarded not as an act of wrath or of vengeance against a guilty or unfortunate individual who has given way to mischievous inclinations but as an indispensable sacrifice to the common safety with respect to any particular delinquent we have seen that punishment has three objects incapacitation reformation and intimidation if the crime he has committed is of a kind calculated to inspire great alarm as manifesting a very mischievous disposition it becomes necessary to take from him the power of committing it again but if the crime being less dangerous only justifies a transient punishment and it is possible for the delinquent to return to society it is proper that the punishment should possess qualities calculated to reform or to intimidate him after having provided for the prevention of future crimes reparation still remains to be made as far as possible for those which are passed by bestowing a compensation on the party injured that is to say bestowing a good equal to the evil suffered this compensation founded upon reasons which have been elsewhere developed† does not at first view appear to belong to the subject     of punishments because it concerns another individual than the delinquent but these two ends have a real connexion there are punishments which have the double effect of affording compensation to the party injured and of inflicting a proportionate suffering on the delinquent so that these two ends may be effected by a single operation this is in certain cases the peculiar advantage of pecuniary punishments chapter iv cases unmeet for punishment all punishment being in itself evil upon the principle of utility if it ought at all to be admitted it ought only to be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater evil it is plain therefore that in the following cases punishment ought not to be inflicted—  where it is groundless   where it must be inefficacious because it cannot act so as to prevent the mischief   where it is unprofitable or too expensive   where it is needless because the mischief may be prevented or cease of itself without it i cases in which punishment is groundless   where there has never been any mischief as in the case of consent such consent provided it be free and fairly given being the best proof that can be obtained that at least no immediate mischief upon the whole has been done to the party who gives it   where the mischief is outweighed by the production of a benefit of greater value as in precautions against instant calamity and the exercise of domestic judicial military and supreme powers ii cases in which punishment must be inefficacious these are   where the penal provision is not established until after the act is done such are the cases of an ex post facto law and of a sentence beyond the law   where the penal provision though established is not conveyed to the notice of the person on whom it is intended to operate as from want of due promulgation   where the penal provision though it were conveyed to the individuals notice could produce no effect with respect to preventing his engaging in the act prohibited as in the cases of extreme infancy insanity and intoxication   where the penal provision though present to the partys notice does not produce its effect because he knows not the act he is about to engage in is of the number of those to which the penal provision relates   where though the penal clause might exert a full and prevailing influence were it to act alone yet by the predominant influence of some opposite cause upon the will such as physical danger or threatened mischief it must necessarily be ineffectual   where though the penal clause may exert a full and prevailing influence over the will of the party yet his physical faculties owing to the predominant influence of some physical cause are not in a condition to follow the determination of his will insomuch that the act is absolutely involuntary as through compulsion or restraint iii cases where punishment is unprofitable if the evil of the punishment exceed the evil of the offence the punishment will be unprofitable the legislator will have produced more suffering than he has prevented he will have purchased exemption from one evil at the expense of a greater the evil resulting from punishment divides itself into four branches—  the evil of coercion or restraint or the pain which it gives a man not to be able to do the act whatever it be which by the apprehension of the punishment he is deterred from doing   the evil of apprehension or the pain which a man who has exposed himself to punishment feels at the thoughts of undergoing it   the evils of sufferance or the pain which a man feels in virtue of the punishment itself from the time when he begins to undergo it   the pain of sympathy and the other derivative evils resulting to the persons who are in connexion with those who suffer from the preceding causes iv cases where punishment is needless a punishment is needless where the purpose of putting an end to the practice may be attained as effectually at a cheaper rate by instruction for instance as well as by terror by informing the understanding as well as by exercising an immediate influence on the will this seems to be the case with respect to all those offences which consist in the disseminating pernicious principles in matters of duty of whatever kind the duty may be whether political moral or religious and this whether such principles be disseminated under or even without a sincere persuasion of their being beneficial i say even without for though in such a case it is not instruction that can prevent the individual from endeavouring to inculcate his principles yet it may prevent others from adopting them without which the endeavours to inculcate them will do no harm in such a case the sovereign will commonly have little occasion to take an active part if it be the interest of one individual to inculcate opinions that are pernicious it will surely be the interest of other individuals to expose them but if the sovereign must needs take a part in the controversy the pen is the proper weapon wherewith to combat error and not the sword on the other hand as to the evil of the     offence this will of course be greater or less according to the nature of each offence the proportion between the one evil and the other will therefore be different in the case of each particular offence the cases therefore where punishment is unprofitable on this ground can by no other means be discovered than by an examination of each particular offence these considerations ought at all times to be present to the mind of the legislator whenever he establishes any punishment it is from them that he will derive his principal reasons for general amnesties on account of the multitude of delinquents for the preservation of a delinquent whose talents could not be replaced or whose punishment would excite the public displeasure or the displeasure of foreign powers chapter v expense of punishment expense of punishment—this expression which has not yet been introduced into common use may at first sight be accused of singularity and pedantry it has however been chosen upon reflection as the only one which conveys the desired idea without conveying at the same time an anticipated judgment of approbation or disapprobation the pain produced by punishments is as it were a capital hazarded in expectation of profit this profit is the prevention of crimes in this operation every thing ought to be taken into the calculation of profit and loss and when we estimate the profit we must subtract the loss from which it evidently results that the diminution of the expense or the increase of the profit equally tend to the production of a favourable balance the term expense once admitted naturally introduces that of economy or frugality the mildness or the rigour of punishments is commonly spoken of these terms include a prejudice in the one case of favour in the other of disfavour which prevents impartiality in their examination but to say that a punishment is economic is to use the language of reason and calculation we should say then that a punishment is economic when the desired effect is produced by the employment of the least possible suffering we should say that it is too expensive when it produces more evil than good or when it is possible to obtain the same good by means of a less punishment in this place distinction should be made between the real and the apparent value of a punishment by the real value i mean that which it would be found to have by one who like the legislator is in a condition accurately to trace and coolly to estimate it through all its parts exempt from the delusions which are seen to govern the uninformed and unthinking part of mankind knowing beforehand upon general principles what the delinquent will know afterwards by particular experience by the apparent value of a punishment i mean that which it appears to a delinquent to have at any time previous to that in which he comes to experience it or to a person under temptation to become a delinquent previous to the time at which were he to become so he would experience it the real value of the punishment constitutes the expense the apparent value influences the conduct of individuals it is the real punishment that is the expense—the apparent punishment that gives the profit the profit of punishments has reference to the interests of two parties—the public and the party injured the expense of the punishment adds to this number a third interest that of the delinquent it ought not to be forgotten although it has been too frequently forgotten that the delinquent is a member of the community as well as any other individual—as well as the party injured himself and that there is just as much reason for consulting his interest as that of any other his welfare is proportionably the welfare of the community—his suffering the suffering of the community it may be right that the interest of the delinquent should in part be sacrificed to that of the rest of the community but it never can be right that it should be totally disregarded it may be prudent to hazard a great punishment for the chance of obtaining a great good it would be absurd to hazard the same punishment where the chance is much weaker and the advantage much less such are the principles which direct men in their private speculations why should they not guide the legislator ought any real punishments to be inflicted most certainly why for the sake of producing the appearance of it upon the principle of utility except as to so much as is necessary for reformation and compensation for this reason and for no other whatever every particle of real punishment that is produced more than what is necessary for the production of the requisite quantity of apparent punishment is just so much misery run to waste hence the real punishment ought to be as small and the apparent punishment as great as possible if hanging a man in effigy would produce the same salutary impression of terror upon the minds of the people it would be folly or cruelty ever to hang a man in person     if delinquents were constantly punished for their offences and nobody else knew of it it is evident that excepting the inconsiderable benefit which might result in the way of disablement or reformation there would be a great deal of mischief done and not the least particle of good the real punishment would be as great as ever and the apparent would be nothing the punishment would befal every offender as an unforeseen evil it would never have been present to his mind to deter him from the commission of crime it would serve as an example to no one delinquents may happen to know nothing of the punishment provided for them in either of two cases—  when it is inflicted without having been previously made known   when though promulgated it has not been made known to the individual the latter of these cases may be the case where the punishment is appointed by statute or as it is called written law the former must happen in all new cases where the punishment is appointed in the way of common or unwritten law the punishment appointed by the law may be presented to the mind in two ways—  by its legal denunciation and description   by its public execution when it is inflicted with suitable notoriety the notion entertained of a punishment ought to be exact or as the logicians would say adequate that is it should present to the mind not only a part but the whole of the sufferings it includes the denunciation of a punishment ought therefore to include all the items of which it is composed since that which is not known cannot operate as a motive hence we may deduce three important maxims—   that a punishment that is more easily learnt is better than one that is less easily learnt   that a punishment that is more easily remembered is better than one that is less easily remembered   that a punishment that appears of greater magnitude in comparison of what it really is is better than one that appears of less magnitude chapter vi measure of punishment           adsit   regula peccatis quæ pœnas irroget æquas   ne scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello   hor l i sat iii   establish a proportion between crimes and punishments has been said by montesquieu beccaria and many others the maxim is without doubt a good one but whilst it is thus confined to general terms it must be confessed it is more oracular than instructive nothing has been accomplished till wherein this proportion consists has been explained and the rules have been laid down by which it may be determined that a certain measure of punishment ought to be applied to a certain crime punishments may be too small or too great and there are reasons for not making them too small as well as for not making them too great the terms minimum and maximum may serve to mark the two extremes of this question which require equal attention with a view of marking out the limits of punishment on the side of the first of these extremes we may lay it down as a rule— i that the value of the punishment must not be less in any case than what is sufficient to outweigh that of the profit of the offence by the profit of the crime must be understood not only pecuniary profit but every advantage real or apparent which has operated as a motive to the commission of the crime the profit of the crime is the force which urges a man to delinquency the pain of the punishment is the force employed to restrain him from it if the first of these forces be the greater the crime will be committed if the second the crime will not be committed if then a man having reaped the profit of a crime and undergone the punishment finds the former more than equivalent to the latter he will go on offending for ever there is nothing to restrain him if those also who behold him reckon that the balance of gain is in favour of the delinquent the punishment will be useless for the purposes of example the anglosaxon laws which fixed a price upon the lives of men— 00 shillings for the murder of a peasant six times as much for that of a nobleman and thirtysix times as  00 much for that of the king—evidently transgressed against this rule in a great number of cases the punishment would appear nothing compared with the profit of the crime the same error is committed whenever a punishment is established which reaches only to a certain fixed point which the advantage of the crime may surpass authors of celebrity have been found desirous of establishing a rule precisely the reverse they have said that the greatness of temptation is a reason for lessening the punishment because it lessens the fault because the more powerful the seduction the less reason is there for concluding that the offender is depraved those therefore who are overcome in this case naturally inspire us with commiseration this may all be very true and yet afford no reason for departing from the rule that it may prove effectual the punishment must be more dreaded than the profit of the crime desired besides an inefficacious punishment is doubly mischievous—mischievous to the public since it permits the crime to be committed—mischievous to the delinquent since the punishment inflicted upon him is just so much misery in waste what should we say to the surgeon who that he might save his patient a small degree of pain should only half cure him what should we think of his humanity if he should add to his disease the torment of a useless operation it is therefore desirable that punishment should correspond to every degree of temptation at the same time the power of mitigation might be reserved in those cases where the nature of the temptation itself indicates the absence of confirmed depravity or the possession of benevolence—as might be the case should a father commit a theft that he might supply his starving family with bread† rule ii—the greater the mischief of the offence the greater is the expense it may be worth while to be at in the way of punishment this rule is so obvious in itself that to say any thing in proof of it would be needless but how few are the instances in which it has been observed it is not long since that women were condemned to be burnt alive for uttering bad money the punishment of death is still lavished on a multitude of offences of the least mischievous description the punishment of burning is still in use in many countries for offences which might safely be left to the restraint of the moral sanction if it can be worth while to be at the expense of so terrible a punishment as that of burning alive it ought to be reserved for murder or incendiarism it will be said perhaps that the intention of legislators has always been to follow this rule but that their opinions as well as those of the people have fluctuated respecting the relative magnitude and nature of crimes at one period witchcraft was regarded as the most mischievous offence sorcerers who sold their souls to the devil were objects of abhorrence a heretic the enemy of the almighty drew down divine wrath upon a whole kingdom to steal property consecrated to divine uses was an offence of a more malignant nature than ordinary theft the crime being directed against the divinity a false estimate being made of these crimes an undue measure of punishment was applied to them rule iii—when two offences come in competition the punishment for the greater offence must be sufficient to induce a man to prefer the less two offences may be said to be in competition when it is in the power of an individual to commit both when thieves break into a house they may execute their purpose in different manners by simply stealing by theft accompanied with bodily injury or murder or incendiarism if the punishment is the same for simple theft as for theft and murder you give the thieves a motive for committing murder because this crime adds to the facility of committing the former and the chance of impunity when it is committed the great inconvenience resulting from the infliction of great punishments for small offences is that the power of increasing them in proportion to the magnitude of the offence is thereby lost‡  0  rule iv—the punishment should be adjusted in such manner to each particular offence that for every part of the mischief there may be a motive to restrain the offender from giving birth to it thus for example in adjusting the punishment for stealing a sum of money let the magnitude of the punishment be determined by the amount of the sum stolen if for stealing ten shillings an offender is punished no more than for stealing five the stealing of the remaining five of those ten shillings is an offence for which there is no punishment at all the last object is whatever mischief is guarded against to guard against it at as cheap a rate as possible therefore— rule v—the punishment ought in no case to be more than what is necessary to bring it into conformity with the rules here given rule vi—that the quantity of punishment actually inflicted on each individual offender may correspond to the quantity intended for similar offenders in general the several circumstances influencing sensibility ought always to be taken into the account the same nominal punishment is not for different individuals the same real punishment let the punishment in question be a fine the sum that would not be felt by a rich man would be ruin to a poor one the same ignominious punishment that would fix an indelible stigma upon a man of a certain rank would not affect a man of a lower rank the same imprisonment that would be ruin to a man of business death to an old man and destruction of reputation to a woman would be as nothing or next to nothing to persons placed in other circumstances the law may by anticipation provide that such or such a degree of mitigation shall be made in the amount of the punishment in consideration of such or such circumstances influencing the sensibility of the patient such as age sex rank c but in these cases considerable latitude must be left to the judge of the above rules of proportion the four first may serve to mark out the limits on the minimum side—the limits below which a punishment ought not to be diminished the fifth will mark out the limits on the maximum side—the limits above which it ought not to be increased the minimum of punishment is more clearly marked than its maximum what is too little is more clearly observed than what is too much what is not sufficient is easily seen but it is not possible so exactly to distinguish an excess an approximation only can be attained the irregularities in the force of temptations compel the legislator to increase his punishments till they are not merely sufficient to restrain the ordinary desires of men but also the violence of their desires when unusually excited the greatest danger lies in an error on the minimum side because in this case the punishment is inefficacious but this error is least likely to occur a slight degree of attention sufficing for its escape and when it does exist it is at the same time clear and manifest and easy to be remedied an error on the maximum side on the contrary is that to which legislators and men in general are naturally inclined antipathy or a want of compassion for individuals who are represented as dangerous and vile pushes them onward to an undue severity it is on this side therefore that we should take the most precautions as on this side there has been shown the greatest disposition to err by way of supplement and explanation to the first rule and to make sure of giving to the punishment the superiority over the offence the three following rules may be laid down— rule vii—that the value of the punishment may outweigh the profit of the offence it must be increased in point of magnitude in proportion as it falls short in point of certainty rule viii—punishment must be further increased in point of magnitude in proportion as it falls short in point of proximity the profit of a crime is commonly more certain than its punishment or what amounts to the same thing appears so to the offender it is generally more immediate the temptation to offend is present the punishment is at a distance hence there are two circumstances which weaken the effect of punishment its uncertainty and its distance suppose the profit of a crime equal to £ 0 sterling suppose the chance of punishment as one to two it is clear that if the punishment supposing that it were to take place is not more than £ 0 sterling its effect upon a mans mind whilst it continues uncertain is not equal to a certain loss of £ 0 sterling it is only equal to a certain loss of £  sterling that it may be rendered equal to the profit of the crime it must be raised to £ 0 unless men are hurried on by outrageous  0  passion they do not engage in the career of crime without the hope of impunity if a punishment were to consist only in taking from an offender the fruit of his crime and this punishment were infallible there would be no more such crimes committed for what man would be so insensate as to take the trouble of committing a crime with the certainty of not enjoying its fruits and the shame of having attempted it but as there are always some chances of escape it is necessary to increase the value of the punishment to counterbalance these chances of impunity it is therefore true that the more the certainty of punishment can be augmented the more it may be diminished in amount this is one advantage resulting from simplicity of legislation and excellence of legal procedure for the same reason it is necessary that the punishment should be as near in point of time to the crime as possible because its impression upon the minds of men is weakened by distance and because this distance adds to the uncertainty of its infliction by affording fresh chances of escape rule ix—when the act is conclusively indicative of a habit such an increase must be given to the punishment as may enable it to outweigh the profit not only of the individual offence but of such other like offences as are likely to have been committed with impunity by the same offender severe as this conjectural calculation may appear it is absolutely necessary in some cases of this kind are fraudulent crimes using false weights or measures and issuing base coin if the coiner was only punished according to the value of the single crime of which he is convicted his fraudulent practice would upon the whole be a lucrative one punishment would therefore be inefficacious if did not bear a proportion to the total gain which may be supposed to have been derived not from one particular act but from a train of actions of the same kind there may be a few other circumstances or considerations which may influence in some small degree the demand for punishment but as the propriety of these is either not so demonstrable or not so constant or the application of them not so determinate as that of the foregoing it may be doubted whether they are worth putting on a level with the others rule x—when a punishment which in point of quality is particularly well calculated to answer its intention cannot exist in less than a certain quantity it may sometimes be of use for the sake of employing it to stretch a little beyond that quantity which on other accounts would be strictly necessary rule xi—in particular this may be the case where the punishment proposed is of such a nature as to be particularly well calculated to answer the purpose of a moral lesson rule xii—in adjusting the quantum of punishment the circumstances by which all punishment may be rendered unprofitable ought to be attended to and lastly as too great a nicety in establishing proportions between punishment and crime would tend to defeat its own object by rendering the whole matter too complex we may add— rule xiii—among provisions designed to perfect the proportion between punishments and offences if any occur which by their own particular good effects would not make up for the harm they would do by adding to the intricacy of the code they should be omitted the observation of rules of proportion between crimes and punishments has been objected to as useless because they seem to suppose that a spirit of calculation has place among the passions of men who it is said never calculate but dogmatic as this proposition is it is altogether false in matters of importance every one calculates each individual calculates with more or less correctness according to the degrees of his information and the power of the motives which actuate him but all calculate it would be hard to say that a madman does not calculate happily the passion of cupidity which on account of its power its constancy and its extent is most formidable to society is the passion which is most given to calculation this therefore will be more successfully combated the more carefully the law turns the balance of profit against it chapter vii of the properties to be given to a lot of punishment it has been shown what rules ought to be observed in adjusting the proportion between punishment and offences the properties to be given to a lot of punishment in every instance will of course be such as it stands in need of in order to be capable of being applied in conformity to those rules the quality will be regulated by the quantity i variability the first quality desirable in a lot of punishment is variability that it be susceptible of degrees both of intensity and duration an invariable punishment cannot be made to correspond to the different degrees of the scale of punishment it will be liable to err either by excess or defect in the first case it would be too expensive in the second inefficacious acute corporeal punishments are extremely  0  variable in respect of intensity but not of duration penal labour is variable in both respects in nearly equal degrees chronic punishments such as banishment and imprisonment may be easily divided as to their duration they may also be varied as to their intensity a prison may be more or less severe banishment may be directed to a genial or ungenial clime ii equability a second property intimately connected with the former may be styled equability it will avail but little that a mode of punishment proper in all other respects has been established by the legislature and that capable of being screwed up or let down to any degree that can be required if after all whatever degree of it be pitched upon that same degree shall be liable according to circumstances to produce a very heavy degree of pain or a very slight one or even none at all an equable punishment is free from this irregularity an unequable one is liable to it banishment is unequable it may either prove a punishment or not according to the temper the age the rank or the fortune of the individuals this is also the case with pecuniary or quasi pecuniary punishment when it respects some particular species of property which the offender may or may not possess by the english law there are several offences which are punished by a total forfeiture of moveables not extending to immoveables in some cases this is the principal punishment in others even the only one the consequence is that if a mans fortune happen to consist in moveables he is ruined if in immoveables he suffers nothing in the absence of other punishment it may be proper to admit an unequable punishment the chance of punishing some delinquents is preferable to universal impunity one mode of obviating the evil of inequality consists in the providing of two different species of punishment not to be used together but that the one may be substituted for and supply the defects of the other for example corporeal may be substituted for pecuniary punishment when the poverty of the individual prevents the application of the latter an uncertain punishment is unequable complete certainty supposes complete equability that is to say that the same punishment shall produce in every case the same degree of suffering such accuracy is however evidently unattainable the circumstances and sensibility of individuals being so variable and so unequal all that can be accomplished is to avoid striking and manifest inequality in the preparation of a penal code it ought constantly to be kept in view that according to circumstances of condition fortune age sex c the same nominal is not the same real punishment a fixed fine is always an unequable punishment and the same remark is applicable to corporeal punishments whipping is not the same punishment when applied to all ages and ranks of persons in china indeed every one is submitted to the bamboo from the watercarrier to the mandarin but this only proves that among the chinese the sentiments of honour are unknown iii commensurability punishments are commensurable when the penal effects of each can be measured and a distinct conception formed of how much the suffering produced by the one falls short of or exceeds that produced by another suppose a man placed in a situation to choose between several crimes—he can obtain a sum of money by theft by murder or by arson the law ought to give him a motive to abstain from the greatest crime he will have that motive if he see that the greatest crime draws after it the greatest punishment he ought therefore to be able to compare these punishments among themselves and measure their different degrees if the same punishment of death is denounced for these three crimes there is nothing to compare the individual is left free to choose that crime which appears most easy of execution and least liable to be detected punishments may be made commensurable in two ways   by adding to a certain punishment another quantity of the same kind for example to five years of imprisonment for a certain crime two more years for a certain aggravation   by adding a punishment of a different kind for example to five years of imprisonment for a certain crime a mark of disgrace for a certain aggravation iv characteristicalness punishment can act as a preventative only when the idea of it and of its connexion with the crime is present to the mind now to be present it must be remembered and to be remembered it must have been learnt but of all punishments that can be imagined there are none of which the connexion with the offence is either so easily learnt or so efficaciously remembered as those of which the idea is already in part associated with some part of the offence which is the case when the one and the other have some circumstance that belongs to them in common the law of retaliation is admirable in this respect an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth the most imperfect intelligence can connect these ideas this rule of retaliation is however rarely practicable it is too unequable  0  and too expensive recourse must therefore be had to other sources of analogy we shall therefore recur to this subject in the next chapter v exemplarity a mode of punishment is exemplary in proportion to its apparent not to its real magnitude it is the apparent punishment that does all the service in the way of example a real punishment which should produce no visible effects might serve to intimidate or reform the offender subjected to it but its use as an example to the public would be lost the object of the legislator ought therefore to be so far as it may be safely practicable to select such modes of punishment as at the expense of the least real shall produce the greatest apparent suffering and to accompany each particular mode of punishment with such solemnities as may be best calculated to further this object in this point of view the autodafés would furnish most useful models for acts of justice what is a public execution it is a solemn tragedy which the legislator presents before an assembled people—a tragedy truly important truly pathetic by the sad reality of its catastrophe and the grandeur of its object the preparation for it the place of exhibition and the attendant circumstances cannot be too carefully selected as upon these the principal effect depends the tribunal the scaffold the dresses of the officers of justice the religious service the procession every kind of accompaniment ought to bear a grave and melancholy character the executioners might be veiled in black that the terror of the scene might be heightened and these useful servants of the state screened from the hatred of the people care must however be taken lest punishment become unpopular and odious through a false appearance of rigour vi frugality if any mode of punishment is more apt than another to produce superfluous and needless pain it may be styled unfrugal if less it may be styled frugal the perfection of frugality in a mode of punishment is where not only no superfluous pain is produced on the part of the person punished but even that same operation by which he is subjected to pain is made to answer the purpose of producing pleasure on the part of some other person pecuniary punishments possess this quality in an eminent degree nearly all the evil felt by the party paying turns to the advantage of him who receives there are some punishments which with reference to the public expense are particularly unfrugal for example mutilations applied to offences of frequent occurrence such as smuggling when an individual is rendered unable to work he must be supported by the state or rendered dependent upon public charity and thus fixed as a burthen upon the most benevolent if the statement of filangieri is correct there were constantly in the stateprisons of naples more than forty thousand idle prisoners what an immense loss of productive power the largest manufacturing town in england scarcely employs a greater number of workmen by the military laws of most countries deserters are still condemned to death it costs little to shoot a man but every thing which he might be made to produce is lost and to supply his place a productive labourer must be converted into an unproductive one vii subserviency to reformation all punishment has a certain tendency to deter from the commission of offences but if the delinquent after he has been punished is only deterred by fear from the repetition of his offence he is not reformed reformation implies a change of character and moral dispositions hence those punishments which are calculated to weaken the seductive and to strengthen the preserving motives have an advantage over all others with respect to those offences to which they can be applied there are other punishments which have an opposite tendency and which serve to render those who undergo them still more vicious punishments which are considered infamous are extremely dangerous in this respect particularly when applied to slight offences and juvenile offenders diligentius enim vivit cui aliquid integri superest nemo dignitati perditæ parcit impunitatis genus est jam non habere pœnæ locum of this nature also in a high degree is the punishment of imprisonment when care is not taken to prevent the indiscriminate association of prisoners but the juvenile and the hoary delinquents are allowed to meet and to live together such prisons instead of places for reform are schools of crime viii efficacy with respect to disablement a punishment which takes away the power of repeating the crime must be very desirable if not too costly imprisonment whilst it continues has this effect in a great measure mutilation sometimes reduces the power of committing crimes almost to nothing and death destroys it altogether it will however be perceived that whilst a man is disabled from doing mischief he is also in great  0  measure disabled from doing good to himself or others in some extraordinary cases the power of doing mischief can only be destroyed by death as for example the case of civil war when the mere existence of the head of a party is sufficient to keep alive the hopes and exertions of his partisans in such a case however the guilt of the parties is often problematic and the punishment of death savours more of vengeance than of law there are however cases in which the ability to do mischief may be taken away with great economy of suffering has the offence consisted in an abuse of power—in an unfaithful discharge of duty it is sufficient to depose the delinquent to remove him from the employment the administration the guardianship the trust he has abused this remedy may equally be employed in domestic and political government ix subserviency to compensation a further property desirable in a lot of punishment is that it may be convertible to profit when a crime is committed and afterwards punished there have existed two lots of evil—the evil of the offence and the evil of the punishment whenever then the evil of the offence falls upon a specific person if the punishment yield a profit let the profit arising from it be given to that person the evil of the offence will be removed and there will then only exist one lot of evil instead of two when there is no specific party injured as when the mischief of the crime consists in alarm or danger there will be no specific injury to be compensated still if the punishment yield a profit there is a clear balance of good gained this property is possessed in a more eminent degree by pecuniary than by any other mode of punishment x popularity in the rear of all these properties may be introduced that of popularity—a very fleeting and indeterminate kind of property which may belong to a lot of punishment one moment and be lost by it the next this property in strictness of speech ought rather to be called absence of unpopularity for it cannot be expected in regard to such a matter as punishment that any species or lot of it should be positively acceptable and grateful to the people it is sufficient for the most part if they have no decided aversion to the thoughts of it the use of inserting this property in the catalogue is that it may serve as a memento to the legislator not to introduce without a cogent necessity any mode or lot of punishment towards which any violent aversion is entertained by the body of the people since it would be productive of useless suffering—suffering borne not by the guilty but the innocent and among the innocent by the most amiable by those whose sensibility would be shocked whose opinions would be outraged by the punishment which would appear to them violent and tyrannical the effect of such injudicious conduct on the part of a legislator would be to turn the tide of popular opinion against himself he would lose the assistance which individuals voluntarily lend to the execution of the laws which they approve the people would not be his allies but his enemies some would favour the escape of the delinquent the injured would hesitate to prosecute and witnesses to bear testimony against him by degrees a stigma would attach to those who assisted in the execution of the laws public dissatisfaction would not always stop here it would sometimes break out into open resistance to the officers of justice and the execution of such laws successful resistance would be considered a victory and the unpunished delinquent would rejoice over the weakness of the laws disgraced by his triumph the unpopularity of particular punishments almost always depends upon their improper selection the more completely the penal code shall become conformed to the rules here laid down the more completely will it merit the enlightened approbation of the wise and the sentimental approval of the multitude xi simplicity of description a mode of punishment ought also to be as simple as possible in its description it ought to be entirely intelligible and that not only to the enlightened but to the most unenlightened and ignorant it will not always be proper however to confine punishments to those of a simple description there are many offences in which it will be proper that the punishment should be composed of many parts as of pecuniary fine corporal suffering and imprisonment the rule of simplicity must give way to superior considerations it has been placed here that it may not be lost sight of the more complex punishment is the greater reason is there to fear that it will not be present as a whole to the mind of an individual in the time of temptation of its different parts he may never have known some—he may have forgotten others all the parts will be found in the real punishment but they have not been perceived in the apparent the name of a punishment is an important object enigmatical names spread a cloud over the mass of punishments which the mind cannot dissipate the english laws  0  are frequently defective in this respect a capital felony includes different lots of punishment the greater part unknown and consequently inefficacious a felony with benefit of clergy is equally obscure the threatening of the law does not convey any distinct idea to the mind—the first idea which the term would offer to an uninstructed person would be that it had some reference to a reward a præmunire is not more intelligible even those who understand the latin word are far from comprehending the nature of the punishment which it denounces riddles of this kind resemble those of the sphynx those are punished who do not decypher them xii remissibility remissibility is the last of all the properties that seem to be requisite in a lot of punishment the general presumption is that when punishment is applied punishment is needful that it ought to be applied and therefore cannot be remitted but in very particular and those very deplorable cases it may be accident happen otherwise punishment may have been inflicted upon an individual whose innocence is afterwards discovered the punishment which he has suffered cannot it is true be remitted but he may be freed from as much of it as is yet to come there is however little chance of there being any yet to come unless it be so much as consists of chronical punishment such as imprisonment banishment penal labour and the like so much as consists in acute punishment where the penal process itself is over presently however permanent the punishment may be in its effects may be considered as irremissible this is the case for example with whipping branding mutilation and capital punishment the most perfectly irremissible of any is capital punishment in all other cases means of compensation may be found for the sufferings of the unfortunate victim but not in this the foregoing catalogue of properties desirable in a lot of punishment is far from unnecessary on every occasion before a right judgment can be formed it is necessary to form an abstract idea of all the properties the object ought to possess unless this is done every expression of approbation or disapprobation can arise only from a confused feeling of sympathy or antipathy we now possess clear and distinct reasons for determining our choice of punishments it remains only to observe in what proportion a particular punishment possesses these different qualities if a conclusion is drawn from one of these qualities alone it may be subject to error attention ought to be paid not to one quality alone but to the whole together there is no one lot of punishment which unites all these desirable qualities but according to the nature of the offences one set of qualities is more important than another for great crimes it is desirable that punishments should be exemplary and analogous for lesser crimes the punishments should be inflicted with a greater attention to their frugality and their tendency to moral reformation as to crimes against property those punishments which are convertible to profit are to be preferred since they may be rendered subservient to compensation for the party injured  0  chapter viii of analogy between crimes and punishments analogy is that relation connexion or tie between two objects whereby the one being present to the mind the idea of the other is naturally excited likeness is one source of analogy contrast another that a punishment may be analogous to an offence it is necessary that the crime should be attended with some striking characteristic circumstances capable of being transferred upon the punishment these characteristic circumstances will be different in different crimes in some cases they may arise from the instrument whereby the mischief has been done in others from the object to which the mischief is done in others from the means employed to prevent detection the examples which follow are only intended clearly to explain this idea of analogy i shall point out the analogy between certain crimes and certain punishments without absolutely recommending the employment of those punishments in all cases it is not a sufficient reason for the adoption of a punishment that it is analogous other considerations ought to be always regarded §   first source of analogy the same instrument used in the crime as in the punishment—incendiarism inundation poisoning in these crimes the instrument employed is the first circumstance which strikes the mind in their punishment the same instrument may be employed with respect to incendiarism we may observe that this crime should be considered as limited to those cases in which some individual has perished by fire if no life has been lost nor any personal injury been suffered the offence ought to be treated as an ordinary waste whether an article of property has been destroyed by fire or any other agent does not make any difference the amount of the damage ought to be the measure of the crime does a man set fire to a solitary and uninhabited house this would be an act of destruction and ought not to be ranked under the definition of incendiarism† if the punishment of fire had been reserved for incendiaries the law would have had in its favour both reason and analogy but in the legislation of barbarous times it has been generally employed throughout europe for the crimes of magic and heresy the first an offence purely imaginary the second a simple difference of religious opinion perfectly innocent often useful and with respect to which the only effect of punishment is to produce insincerity fire may be employed as an instrument of punishment without occasioning death this punishment is variable in its nature through all the degrees of severity of which there can be any need it would be necessary carefully to determine in the text of the law the part of the body which ought to be exposed to the action of the fire the intensity of the fire the time during which it is to be applied and the paraphernalia to be employed to increase the terror of the punishment in order to render the description more striking a print might be annexed in which the operation should be represented inundation is an offence less common than incendiarism in some countries it is altogether unexampled it can only be perpetrated in countries that are intersected by water confined by artificial banks it is susceptible of every degree of aggravation from the highest to the lowest if the offence consist merely in inundation in effect it amounts only to a simple destruction of property it is by the destruction of life that this crime is raised to that degree of atrocity which requires severe punishment a most evident analogy points out the means of punishment that is the drowning  0  of the criminal with such accompanying circumstances as will add to the terror of the punishment in a penal code which should not admit the punishment of death the offender might be drowned and then restored to life this might be made a part of the punishment it may be asked ought poison to be employed as a means of punishment for a poisoner in some respects there is no punishment more suitable poisoning is distinguished from other murders by the secrecy with which it may be perpetrated and the cool determination which it supposes of these two circumstances the first increases the force of temptation and the evil of the crime the second proves that the criminal attentive to his own interest is capable of serious reflection upon the nature of the punishment the idea of perishing by the same kind of death which he prepares is the more frightful for him in every step of his preparations his imagination will represent to him his own lot in this point of view the analogy would produce its full effect there are however many difficulties poisons are uncertain in their operation it would be necessary therefore to fix a time after which the punishment should be abridged by strangulation if the effect of the poison should be to produce sleep the punishment may not be sufficiently exemplary if it produce convulsions and distortions it may prove hateful if the poison administered by the criminal has not proved fatal he may be made to take an antidote before the penal poison has produced death the dose and the time may be fixed by the judges according to the report of skilful physicians the horror attached to this crime would most probably render this punishment popular and if there is one country in which this crime is more common than others it is there that this punishment which possesses so striking an analogy with the crime would be most suitable §   second source of analogy for a corporal injury a similar corporal injury—an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth in crimes producing irreparable bodily injuries the part of the body injured will afford the characteristic circumstance the analogy will consist in making the offender suffer an evil similar to that which he has maliciously and wilfully inflicted it will however be necessary to provide for two cases that in which the offender does not possess the member of which he has deprived the party he has attacked and that in which the loss of the member would be more or less prejudicial to him than to the party injured if the injury has been of an ignominious nature without permanent mischief similar ignominy may be employed in the punishment when the rank of the party and other circumstances permit §   third source of analogy punishment of the offending member—in crimes of deceit the tongue and the hand are the usual instruments an exact analogy in the punishment may be drawn from this circumstance in punishing the crime of forgery the hand of the offender may be transfixed by an iron instrument fashioned like a pen and in this condition he may be exhibited to the public previously to undergoing the punishment of imprisonment in the utterance of calumny and the dissemination of false reports the tongue is the instrument employed the offender might in the same manner be publicly exposed with his tongue pierced these punishments may be made more formidable in appearance than in reality by dividing the instruments in two parts so that the part which should pierce the offending member need not be thicker than a pin whilst the other part of the instrument may be much thicker and appear to penetrate with all its thickness punishments of this kind may appear ridiculous but the ridicule which attaches to them enhances their merit this ridicule will be directed against the cheat whom it will render more despicable whilst it will increase the respect due to upright dealing §   fourth source of analogy imposition of disguise assumed—some offences are characterized by the assumption of a disguise to facilitate their commission a mask or crape over the face has commonly been used this circumstance constitutes an aggravation of the offence it increases the alarm produced and diminishes the probability of detection and hence arises the propriety of additional punishment analogy would recommend the imprinting on the offender a representation of the disguise assumed this impression might be made either evanescent or indelible according as the imprisonment by which it may be accompanied is to be either temporary or otherwise if evanescent it might be produced by the use of a black wash if indelible by tatooing the utility of this punishment would be most particularly felt in cases of premeditated murder rape irreparable personal injury and theft when accompanied with violence and alarm §   other sources of analogy there are other characteristic circumstances which do not like the foregoing fall  0  into classes which may however according to the nature of the different offences be employed as a foundation for analogy in the fabrication of base coin the art of the delinquent may furnish an analogous source of punishment he has made an impression upon the metal he has employed—a like impression may be made on some conspicuous part of his face this mark may be either evanescent or indelible according as the imprisonment by which it is to be accompanied is either temporary or perpetual at amsterdam vagabonds and idle persons are committed to the house of correction called the rasp house it is said that among other species of forced labour in which such characters are employed there is one reserved for those who are incorrigible by other means which consists in keeping a leaky vessel in which the idle prisoner is placed dry by means of a pump at which he must work if he would keep himself from being drowned whether this punishment is in use or not it is an example of an analogous punishment carried to the highest degree of rigour if such a method of punishment is adopted it ought to be accompanied with precise regulations for adjusting the punishment to the strength of the individual undergoing it the place in which a crime has been committed may furnish a species of analogy catherine ii condemned a man who had committed some knavish trick at the exchange to sweep it out every day that it was used during six months chapter ix of retaliation if the law of retaliation were admissible in all cases it would very much abridge the labours of the legislators it would make short work of the business of laying out a plan of punishment—a word would supply the place of a volume before we say any thing as to the advantage of the rule it will be proper to state with precision what is meant by it the idea given of it in blackstones commentaries seems to be a correct one—it is that rule which prescribes in the way of punishment the doing to a delinquent the same hurt he has done one might perhaps add or attempted to do to another if the injury were done to the person the delinquent should be punished in his person if to property in his property if to the reputation in his reputation this is the general scheme but this however in itself is not quite enough to make the punishment come incontestibly under the law of retaliation the identity between the subject of the offence and that of the punishment should be still more specific and   0 determinate if for example the injury were to a mans house—for instance by the destruction of his house then the delinquent should have his house destroyed if to his reputation by causing him to lose a certain rank then the delinquent should be made to lose the same rank if to the eyes then the criminal should be made to lose his eyes if to his lip then to lose his lip and in short the more specific and particular the resemblance between the subject of the offence and of the punishment the more strictly and incontestibly it would appear to come under the rule it is when the person is the subject of the injury that the resemblance is capable of being rendered the most minute for it is in this case that by means of the strict identity of the part affected the hurt is capable of being rendered the most accurately the same an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth are the familiar instances that are put of the law of retaliation in this case too the identity may be pushed still further by affecting the same part in the same manner the sameness of the hurt depending on the identity of the one circumstance as well as of the other thus if the injury consisted in the burning out of an eye the punishment will be more strictly the same if it be effected by burning rather than cutting out the eye of the delinquent the great merit of the law of retaliation is its simplicity if it were capable of universal adoption the whole penal code would be contained in one law—let every offender suffer an evil similar to that which he has inflicted no other imaginable plan can for its extent find so easy an entrance into the apprehension or sit so easy on the memory the rule is at once so short and so expressive that he who has once heard it is not likely to forget it or ever to think of a crime but he must think also of its punishment the stronger the temptation to commit an offence the more likely is its punishment to be an object of dread thus the defence is erected on the side of danger one advantage that cannot be denied to this mode of punishment is its popularity requiring little expense of thought it will generally be found to possess the judgment of the multitude in its favour should they in any instance be disposed to quarrel with it they will still be ready enough probably to own it to be consonant to justice but that justice they will say is rigid justice or to vary the jargon justice in the abstract all this while with these phrases on their lips they would perhaps prefer a milder punishment as being more consonant to mercy and upon the whole more conducive to the general happiness—as if justice and especially penal justice were something distinct from and adverse to that happiness when however it happens not to give disgust by its severity nothing can be more popular than this mode of punishment this may be seen in the case of murder with respect to which the attachment to this mode of punishment is warm and general blood as the phrase is will have blood unless a murderer be punished with death the multitude of speculators can seldom bring themselves to think that the rules of justice are pursued the law of retaliation is however liable to a variety of objections one of which so far as it applies is conclusive against its adoption in a great variety of cases it is physically inapplicable without descending far into detail a few instances may suffice as examples in the first place it can never be applied when the offence is merely of a public nature—the characteristic quality of such offences being that no assignable individual is hurt by them if a man has been guilty of high treason or has engaged in criminal correspondence with an enemy or has from cowardice abandoned the defence of a post entrusted to him how would it be possible to make him suffer an evil similar to that of which he has been the cause it is equally inapplicable to offences of the semipublic class—to offences which affect a certain district or particular class of the community the mischief of these offences often consists in alarm and danger which do not affect one individual alone and therefore do not present any opportunity for the exercise of retaliation with respect to selfregarding offences consisting of acts which offend against morality the application of this law would be absurd the individual has chosen to perform the act to do the same thing to him would not be to punish him in offences against reputation consisting for instance in the propagation of false reports affecting the character it would be useless as a punishment to direct a similar false report to be propagated affecting the character of the delinquent the like evil would not result from the circulation of what was acknowledged to be false in offences against property the punishment of retaliation would at all times be defective in point of exemplarity and efficacy and in many cases altogether inapplicable those who are most apt to injure others in this respect being by their poverty unable to suffer in a similar manner for a similar reason it cannot be constantly applied to offences affecting the civil condition of individuals to say nothing of the reasons that might render it ineligible if it were possible to be applied these exceptions reduce its possible field of action to a very small extent the only     classes of offences to which it will be found applicable with any degree of constancy are those that affect the person and even here must be assumed what scarcely ever exists a perfect identity of circumstances even in this very limited class of cases it would be found to err on the side of excessive severity its radical defect is its inflexibility the law ought so to apportion the punishment as to meet the several circumstances of aggravation or extenuation that may be found in the offence retaliation is altogether incompatible with any such apportionment the class of people among whom this mode of punishment is most likely to be popular are those of a vindictive character mahomet found it established among the arabians and has adopted it in the koran with a degree of approbation that marks the extent of his talent for legislation—o you who have a heart you will find in the law of retaliation and in the fear that accompanies it universal security—vol i ch ii on the law either from weakness or ignorance he encouraged the prevailing vice which he ought to have checked chapter x of popularity to prove that an institution is agreeable to the principle of utility is to prove as far as can be proved that the people ought to like it but whether they will like it or no after all is another question they would like it if in their judgments they suffered themselves to be uniformly and exclusively governed by that principle by this principle they do govern themselves in proportion as they are humanized and enlightened accordingly the deference they pay to its dictates is more uniform in this intelligent and favoured country than perhaps in any other i speak here taking the great mass of the people upon this occasion as they ought to be taken upon every occasion into the account and not confining my views as is too commonly the case to men of rank and education even in this country however their acquiescence is far from being as yet altogether uniform and undeviating in some instances their judgments are still warped by antipathies or prejudices unconnected with the principle of utility and therefore irreconcilable to reason they are apt to bear antipathy to certain offences without regard to even their imputed mischievousness and to entertain a prejudice against certain punishments without regard to their eligibility with respect to the ends of punishment the variety of capricious objections to which each particular mode of punishment is exposed has no other limits than the fecundity of the imagination with some slight exceptions they may however be ranged under one or other of the following heads—liberty—decency—religion—humanity what i mean by a capricious objection is an objection which derives the whole of its apparent value from the impression that is apt to be made by the use of those hallowed expressions the caprice consists in employing them in a perverted sense   liberty—under this head there is little to be said all punishment is an infringement on liberty no one submits to it but from compulsion enthusiasts however are not wanting who without regarding this circumstance condemn certain modes of punishment as for example imprisonment accompanied with penal labour as a violation of the natural rights of man in a free country like this say they it ought not to be tolerated that even malefactors should be reduced to a state of slavery the precedent is dangerous and pernicious none but men groaning under a despotic government can endure the sight of galleyslaves when the establishment of the penitentiary system was proposed this objection was echoed and insisted on in a variety of publications that appeared on that occasion examine this senseless clamour it will resolve itself into a declaration that liberty ought to be left to those that abuse it and that the liberty of malefactors is an essential part of the liberty of honest men   decency—objections drawn from the topics of decency are confined to those punishments of which the effect is to render those parts which it is inconsistent with decency to expose the objects of sight or of conversation who can doubt that in all punishments care should be taken that no offence be given to modesty but modesty like other virtues is valuable only in proportion to its utility when the punishment is the most appropriate though not either in its description or its execution altogether reconcileable with modesty this circumstance ought not as it appears to me to stand in the way of the attainment of any object of greater utility castration for example seems the most appropriate punishment in the case of rape that is to say the best adapted to produce a strong impression on the mind at the moment of temptation is it expedient then on account of such scruples of modesty that another punishment as for example death should be employed which is less exemplary and consequently less efficacious       religion—among christians there are some sects who conceive that the punishment of death is unlawful life say they is the gift of god and man is forbidden to take it away we shall find in the next book that very cogent reasons are not wanting for altogether abolishing capital punishment or at most for confining it to extraordinary cases but this pretence of unlawfulness is a reason drawn from false principles unlawful means contrary to some law those who upon the occasion in question apply this expression to the punishment of death believe themselves or endeavour to make others believe that it is contrary to some divine law this divine law is either revealed or unrevealed if it be revealed it must be to be found in the texts of those books which are understood to contain the expressions of gods will but as there exists no such text in the new testament and as the jewish law expressly ordains capital punishment the partisans of this opinion must have recourse to some divine law not revealed—to a natural law that is to say to a law deduced from the supposed will of god but if we presume that god wills anything we must suppose that he has a reason for so doing a reason worthy of himself which can only be the greatest happiness of his creatures in this point of view therefore the divine will cannot require anything inconsistent with general utility if it can be pretended that god can have any will not consistent with utility his will becomes a fantastic and delusive principle in which the ravings of enthusiasm and the extravagancies of superstition will find sanction and authority in many cases religion has been to such a degree perverted as to become a bar to the execution of penal laws as in the case of sanctuaries opened for criminals in the romish churches theodosius i forbade all criminal proceedings during lent alleging as a reason that the judges ought not to punish the crimes of others whilst they were imploring the divine forgiveness for their own transgressions valentinian i directed that at easter all prisoners should be discharged except those that were accused of the most malignant offences constantine prohibited by law the branding criminals on the face alleging that it is a violation of the law of nature to disfigure the majesty of the human face—the majesty of the face of a scoundrel the inquisition says bayle that it might not violate the maxim ecclesia non novit sanguinem condemned its victims to be burnt alive religion has had its quibbles as well as the law   humanity—attend not to the sophistries of reason which often deceive but be governed by your hearts which will always lead you to right i reject without hesitation the punishment you propose it violates natural feelings it harrows up the susceptible mind it is tyrannical and cruel such is the language of your sentimental orators but abolish any one penal law merely because it is repugnant to the feelings of a humane heart and if consistent you abolish the whole penal code there is not one of its provisions that does not in a more or less painful degree wound the sensibility all punishment is in itself necessarily odious if it were not dreaded it would not effect its purpose it can never be contemplated with approbation but when considered in connexion with the prevention of the crime against which it is denounced i reject sentiment as an absolute judge but under the control of reason it may not be a useless monitor when a penal dispensation is revolting to the public feeling this is not of itself a sufficient reason for rejecting it but it is a reason for subjecting it to a rigorous scrutiny if it deserves the antipathy it excites the causes of that antipathy may be easily detected we shall find that the punishment in question is misseated or superfluous or disproportionate to the offence or that it has a tendency to produce more mischief than it prevents by this means we arrive at the seat of the error sentiment excites to reflection and reflection detects the impropriety of the law the species of punishment that command the largest share of public approbation are such as are analogous to the offence punishments of this description are commonly considered just and equitable but what is the foundation of this justice and equity i know not the delinquent suffers the same evil he has caused ought the law to imitate the example it condemns ought the judge to imitate the malefactor in his wickedness ought a solemn act of justice to be the same in kind as an act of criminality this circumstance satisfies the multitude the mouth of the criminal is stopped and he cannot accuse the law of severity without at the same time being equally selfcondemned fortunately the same bent of the imagination that renders this mode of punishment     popular renders it at the same time appropriate the analogy that presents itself to the people presents itself at the moment of temptation to the delinquent and renders it a peculiar object of dread it is of importance to detect and expose erroneous conceptions even when they happen to accord with the principle of utility the coincidence is a mere accident and whoever on any one occasion forms his judgment without reference to this principle prepares himself upon any other to decide in contradiction to it there will be no safe and steady guide for the understanding in its progress till men shall have learnt to trust to this principle alone to the exclusion of all others when the judgment is to decide the use of laudatory or vituperative expressions is the mere babbling of children they ought to be avoided in all philosophical disquisitions where the object ought to be to instruct and convince the understanding and not to inflame the passions book ii of corporal punishments chapter i simple afflictive punishments a punishment is simply afflictive when the object aimed at is to produce immediate temporary suffering and is so called to distinguish it from other classes of corporeal punishments in which the suffering produced is designed to be more permanent simple afflictive punishments are distinguished from one another by three principal circumstances the part affected the nature of the instrument and the manner of its application to enumerate all the varieties of punishment which might be produced by the combination of these different circumstances would be an useless as well as an endless task to enumerate the several parts of a mans body in which he is liable to be made to suffer would be to give a complete body of anatomy to enumerate the several instruments by the application of which he might be made to suffer would be to give a complete body of natural history to attempt to enumerate the different manners in which those instruments may be applied to such a purpose would be to attempt to exhaust the inexhaustible variety of motions and situations among the indefinite multitude of punishments of this kind that might be imagined and described it will answer every purpose if we mention some of those which have been in use in this and other countries the most obvious method of inflicting this species of punishment and which has been most commonly used consists in exposing the body to blows or stripes when these are inflicted with a flexible instrument the operation is called whipping when a less flexible instrument is employed the effects are different but the operation is seldom distinguished by another name in italy and particularly in naples there is a method not uncommon of punishing pickpockets called the strappado it consists in raising the offender by his arms by means of an engine like a crane to a certain height and then letting him fall but suddenly stopping his descent before he reaches the ground the momentum which his body has acquired in the descent is thus made to bear upon his arms and the consequence generally is that they are dislocated at the shoulder to prevent the permanent evil consequences a surgeon is then employed to reset them there were formerly in england two kinds of punishment of this class discarded now even from the military code in which they were longest retained the one called picketing which consisted in suspending the offender in such manner that the weight of his body was supported principally by a spike on which he was made to stand with one foot the other the wooden horse as it was called was a narrow ledge or board on which the individual was made to sit astride and the inconvenience of which was increased by suspending weights to his legs another species of punishment formerly practised in this country but now rarely used consisted in subjecting the patient to frequent immersions in water called ducking the individual was fastened to a chair or stool called the duckingstool and plunged repeatedly in this case the punishment was not of the acute but of the uneasy kind the physical uneasiness arises partly from the cold partly from the temporary stoppage of respiration it has something of the ridiculous     mixed with it and was most generally applied to scolding women whose tongues disturbed their neighbours it is a relic of the simplicity of the olden time it is still occasionally resorted to when the people take the administration of the laws into their own hands and is not uncommonly the fate of the pickpocket who is detected at a fair or other place of promiscuous resort the powers of invention have been principally employed in devising instruments for the production of pain by those tribunals which have sought to extort proofs of his criminality from the individual suspected they have been prepared for all parts of the body according as they have wished to stretch to distort or to dislocate them screws for compressing the thumbs straight boots for compressing the shins with wedges driven in by a mallet the rack for either compressing or extending the limbs all of which might be regulated so as to produce every possible degree of pain suffocation was produced by drenching and was practised by tying a wet linen cloth over the mouth and nostrils of the individual and continually supplying it with water in such manner that every time the individual breathed he was obliged to swallow a portion of water till his stomach became visibly distended in the infamous transactions of the dutch at amboyna this species of torture was practised upon the english who fell into their power it would be useless to pursue this afflicting detail any further how variously soever the causes may be diversified the effect is still one and the same viz organical pain whether of the acute or uneasy kind this effect is common to all these modes of punishment there are other points in which they may differ—  one of them may carry the intensity of the pain to a higher or lower pitch than it could be carried by another   one may be purer from consequences which for the purpose in question it may or may not be intended to produce these consequences may be—  the continuance of the organical pain itself beyond the time of applying the instrument   the production of any of those other ill consequences which constitute the other kinds of corporeal punishment   the subjecting the party to ignominy in the choice of punishment these circumstances how little soever they are attended to in practice are of the highest importance it would be altogether useless not to say mischievous to introduce into the penal code a great variety of modes of inflicting this species of punishment whipping—the mode which has been most commonly in use—would if proper care were taken to give to it every degree of intensity be sufficient if it were the only one analogy however in certain cases recommends the employment of other modes the multiplication of the instruments of punishment when not thus justified tends only to render the laws odious among other works undertaken by order of the empress maria theresa for the amelioration of the laws a description was compiled of the various methods of inflicting torture and punishment in the austrian dominions it formed a large folio volume in which not only all the instruments were described and represented by engravings but a detailed account was given of the manipulations of the executioners this book was only exposed for sale for a few days prince kaunitz the prime minister having caused it to be suppressed he was apprehensive and certainly not without reason that the sight of such a work would only inspire a horror of the laws this objection fell with its whole force upon the instruments for the infliction of torture which has since been abolished in all the austrian dominions it is highly probable that the publication of this work contributed to produce this happy event if so few books have done more good to the world if compared with the time they continued in it a valuable service would be rendered to society by the individual who being properly qualified for the task should examine the effects produced by these different modes of punishment and should point out the greater or smaller evil consequences resulting from contusions produced by blows with a rope or lacerations by whips c in turkey punishment is inflicted by beating the soles of the feet whether the consequences are more or less severe i know not it is perhaps from some notion of modesty that the turks have confined the application of punishment to this part of the human body if the suffering produced by a punishment of this class is rendered but little more than momentary it will neither be sufficiently exemplary to affect the spectators nor sufficiently efficacious to intimidate the offenders there will be little in the chastisement but the ignominy attached to it and this would have but little effect upon that class of delinquents upon whom such punishments are generally inflicted the quantity of suffering ought therefore if possible to be regulated by the laws of all these different modes of punishment whipping is the most frequently in use but in whipping not even the qualities of the instrument are ascertained by written law     while the quantity of force to be employed in its application is altogether entrusted to the caprice of the executioner he may make the punishment as trifling or as severe as he pleases he may derive from this power a source of revenue so that the offender will be punished not in proportion to his offence but to his poverty if he has been unfortunate and not able to secure his plunder or honest and has voluntarily given it up and thus has nothing left to make a sop for cerberus he suffers the rigour—perhaps more than the rigour—of the law good fortune and perseverance in dishonesty would have enabled him to buy indulgence the following contrivance would in a measure obviate this inconvenience—a machine might be made which should put in motion certain elastic rods of cane or whalebone the number and size of which might be determined by the law the body of the delinquent might be subjected to the strokes of these rods and the force and rapidity with which they should be applied might be prescribed by the judge thus everything which is arbitrary might be removed a public officer of more responsible character than the common executioner might preside over the infliction of the punishment and when there were many delinquents to be punished his time might be saved and the terror of the scene heightened without increasing the actual suffering by increasing the number of the machines and subjecting all the offenders to punishment at the same time §   examination of simple afflictive punishments the examination of a punishment consists in comparing it successively with each of the qualities which have been pointed out as desirable in a lot of punishment that it may be observed in what degree some are possessed and the others wanted and whether those which it possesses are more important than those which it wants that is to say whether it is well adapted for the attainment of the desired end it will be remembered that the several qualities desirable in a lot of punishment are—variability equability commensurability characteristicalness exemplarity frugality subserviency to reformation efficiency with respect to disablement subserviency to compensation popularity and remissibility that any species of punishment does not possess the whole of these qualities is not a sufficient reason for its rejection they are not all of equal importance and indeed no one species of punishment will perhaps ever be found in which they are all united simple afflictive punishments are capable of great variability they may be moderated or increased at will their effects however are far from equable the same punishment will not produce the same effects when applied to both sexes—when applied to a stout young man and an infirm old man these punishments are almost always attended with a portion of ignominy and this does not always increase with the organic pain but principally depends upon the condition of the offender for this reason there is scarcely a punishment of this description which would be esteemed slight if inflicted upon a gentleman it was inattention to this circumstance that was one cause of the dissatisfaction occasioned by the stat  0 geo iii called the dog act passed to restrain the stealing of dogs among the punishments appointed was that of whipping there is one thing in the nature of this species of property which renders the stealing of it less incompatible with the character of a gentleman than any other kind of theft it is apt therefore to meet with indulgence from the moral sanction for the same reason that enticing away a servant is not considered as a crime on account of the rational qualities of the subject of property in these cases an individual also may be innocent notwithstanding appearances are against him a dog is susceptible of volition and even of strong social affections and may have followed a new master without having been enticed the same inattention has been observed to be remarkably prevalent throughout the whole system of penal jurisprudence in russia in the reign which preceded that of the mild and intelligent catherine ii neither rank nor sex bestowed an exemption from the punishment of whipping the institutions of poland were also chargeable with the same roughness and it was no uncommon thing for the maid of honour of a polish princess to be disciplined in public by the maître d hôtel nothing more completely proves the degradation of the chinese than the whips which are constantly used by the police the mandarins of the first class the princes of the blood are subjected to the bamboo as well as the peasant the principal merit of simple afflictive punishments is their exemplarity all that is suffered by the delinquent during their infliction may be exhibited to the public and the class of spectators which would be attracted by such exhibitions consists for the     most part of those upon whom the impression they are calculated to produce would be most salutary such are the most striking points to be observed with respect to these punishments there is little particular to be remarked under the other heads they are of little efficiency as to intimidation or reformation with the exception of one particular species—penitential diet which well managed may possess great moral efficacy but as this is naturally connected with the subject of imprisonment the consideration of it is deferred for the present chapter ii of complex afflictive punishments under the name of complex afflictive punishments may be included those corporeal punishments of which the principal effect consists in the distant and durable consequences of the act of punishment they cannot be included under one title they include three species very different the one from the other in their nature and their importance the permanent consequences of an afflictive punishment may consist in the alteration the destruction or suspension of the properties of a part of the body the properties of a part of the body consist of its visible qualities as of colour and figure and its uses of these three distinct kinds of punishments the first affects the exterior of the person its visible qualities the second affects the use of the organic faculties without destroying the organ itself the third destroys the organ itself §   of deformation or punishments which alter the exterior of the person it was an ingenious idea in the first legislator who invented these external and permanently visible punishments—punishments which are inflicted without destroying any organ—without mutilation—often without physical pain in all cases without any other pain than what is absolutely necessary—which affect only the appearance of the criminal and render that appearance less agreeable—which would not be punishments if they were not indications of his crimes the visible qualities of an object are its colour and figure there are therefore two methods of altering them   discolouration   disfiguration   discolouration may be temporary or permanent when temporary it may be produced by vegetable or mineral dyes i am not acquainted with an instance of its use as a punishment it has always appeared to me that it might be very usefully employed as a precaution to hinder the escape of certain offenders whilst they are undergoing other punishments permanent discolouration might be produced by tatooing the only method at present in use is branding† tatooing is performed by perforating the skin with a bundle of sharppointed instruments and subsequently filling the punctures with coloured powder of all methods of discolouration this is the most striking and the least painful it was practised by the ancient picts and other savage nations for the purpose of ornament judicial branding is effected by the application of a hot iron the end of which has the form which it is desired should be left imprinted on the skin this punishment is appointed for many offences in england and among other european nations how far this mark is permanent and distinct i know not but every one must have observed that accidental burnings often leave only a slight cicatrix—a scarcely sensible alteration in the colour and texture of the skin if it is desired to produce deformity a part of the body should be chosen which is exposed to view as the hand or the face but if the object of the punishment is only to mark a conviction of a first offence and to render the individual recognisable in case of a relapse it will be better that the mark should be impressed upon some part of the body less ordinarily in view whereby he will be spared the torment of its infamy without taking away his desire to avoid falling again into the hands of justice   disfigurement may in the same manner be either permanent or transient it may be performed either on the person or only on its dress when confined to the dress it is not properly called disfigurement but by a natural association of ideas it has the same effect to this head may be referred the melancholy robes and frightful dresses made use of by the inquisition to give to those who suffer in public a hideous or terrible appearance some were clothed in cloaks painted to represent flames others were covered with     figures of demons and different emblems of future torments shaving the head has been a punishment formerly used it was part of the penance imposed upon adulterous women by the ancient french laws the chinese attach great importance to the length of their nails cutting them might therefore be used as a penal disfigurement shaving the beard might be thus employed among the russian peasants or a part of the jews the permanent means of disfigurement are more limited the only ones which have been in use and which may yet be employed in certain countries were applied to certain parts of the head which may be altered without destroying the functions which depend on those parts the common law of england directs the nostrils to be slit or the ears cut off as the punishment for certain offences the first of these punishments has fallen into disuse the second has been rarely employed in the last century in the works of pope and his contemporary writers may be seen how far their malignity was pleased by allusions to this species of punishment which had been applied to the author of a libel in their times the cutting off and slitting of the nose the eyelids and the ears were once in common use in russia without distinction of sex or rank they were the common accompaniments of the knout and exile but it ought to be observed that the punishment of death was very rare §   of disablement or punishments consisting in disabling an organ to disable an organ is either to suspend or destroy its use without destroying the organ itself it is not necessary here to enumerate all the organs nor all the methods by which they may be rendered useless we have already seen that it would not be useful to have recourse to a great variety of afflictive punishments and that there would be many inconveniences in so doing if we were to follow the law of retaliation the catalogue of possible punishments would be the same as that of the possible offences of this kind   the visual organ—the use of which may be suspended by chemical applications or by mechanical means as with a mask or bandage the visual faculty may also be destroyed by chemical or mechanical means no jurisprudence in europe has made use of this punishment it has heretofore been employed at constantinople under the greek emperors less as a punishment it is true than as a politic method of rendering a prince incapable of reigning the operation consisted in passing a red hot plate of metal before the eyes   the organ of hearing—this faculty may be destroyed by destroying the tympanum a temporary deafness may be produced by filling the passage of the ears with wax as a legal punishment i know of no instance of its use   the organ of speech—gagging has more often been employed as a means of precaution against certain delinquents rather than as a method of punishment general lally was sent to his punishment with a gag in his mouth and this odious precaution perhaps only served to turn public opinion against his judges when his character was reestablished it has sometimes been employed in military prisons it has the merit of analogy when the offence consists in the abuse of the faculty of speech gagging is sometimes performed by fixing a wedge between the jaws which are rendered immoveable sometimes by forcing a ball into the mouth c   the hands and feet—i shall not speak of the various methods by which these members may be rendered for ever useless if it were necessary to be done it would not be difficult to accomplish handcuffs are rings of metal into which the wrists are thrust and which are connected together with a bar or chain this apparatus completely hinders a certain number of movements and might be employed so as to prevent them all fetters are rings of metal into which the legs are fixed united in the same manner by a chain or bar according to the species of restraint which it is desired to produce handcuffs and fetters are often employed conjointly universal use is made of these two methods sometimes as a punishment properly so called but more frequently to prevent the escape of a prisoner the pillory is a plank fixed horizontally upon a pivot on which it turns and in which plank there are openings into which the head and the hands of the individual are put that he may be exposed to the multitude i say to the gaze of the multitude—such is the intention of the law but it not unfrequently happens that persons so exposed are exposed to the outrages of the populace to which they are thus delivered up without defence and then the punishment changes its nature—its severity depends upon the caprice of a crowd of butchers the victim—for such he then becomes—covered with filth his countenance bruised and bloody his teeth broken his eyes puffed up and closed no longer can be recognised the police at least in england used to see this disorder nor seek to restrain it and perhaps would have been unable to restrain it a simple iron trellis in     the form of a cage placed around the pillory would however suffice for stopping at least all those missiles which might inflict any dangerous blows upon the body the carcan a kind of portable pillory is a species of punishment which has been used in many countries and very frequently in china it consists of a wooden collar placed horizontally on the shoulders which the delinquent is obliged to carry without relaxation for a longer or shorter time §   of mutilations i understand by mutilation the extirpation of an external part of the human body endowed with a distinct power of movement or a specific function of which the loss is not necessarily followed by the loss of life as the eyes the tongue the hands c the extirpation of the nose and of the ears is not properly called mutilation because it is not upon the external part of these organs that the exercise of their functions depends they protect and assist that exercise but they do not exercise these functions there is therefore a difference between that mutilation which causes a total loss of the organ and that which only destroys its envelope the latter is only a disfigurement which may be partly repaired by art every body knows how frequently mutilations were formerly employed in the greater number of penal systems there is no species of them which has not been practised in england even in times sufficiently modern the punishment of death might be commuted for that of mutilation under the common law by a statute passed under henry viii the offence of maliciously drawing blood in the palace where the king resided was punished by the loss of the right hand by a statute of elizabeth the exportation of sheep was punished by the amputation of the left hand since that time however all these punishments have fallen into disuse and mutilations may now be considered as banished from the penal code of great britain examination of complex afflictive punishments the effects of simple afflictive punishments are easily estimated because their consequences are all similar in quality and immediately produced the effects of all other punishments are not ascertained without great difficulties because their consequences are greatly diversified are liable to great uncertainty and are often remote simple afflictive punishments must always be borne by the parties on whom they are inflicted all other punishments are deficient in point of certainty the more remote their consequences the more these consequences escape the notice of those who are deficient in foresight and reflection around a simple afflictive punishment a circle may be drawn which shall inclose the whole mischief of the punishment around all other punishments the mischief extends in circles the extent of which is not and cannot be marked out it is mischief in the abstract mischief uncertain and universal which cannot be pointed out with precision when the effects of punishments are thus uncertain there is much less ground for choice for the effects of one punishment may be the same with those of another the same consequences often resulting from very different punishments the choice must therefore be directed by probability and be governed by the presumption that certain punishments will more probably produce certain penal consequences than any other independently of the bodily sufferings resulting from them punishments which affect the exterior of the person often produce two disadvantageous effects the one physical—the individual may become an object of disgust the other moral—he may become an object of contempt they may produce a loss of beauty or a loss of reputation one of these punishments which has a greater moral than physical effect is a mark producing only a change of colour and the impression of a character upon the skin but this mark is an attestation that the individual has been guilty of some act to which contempt is attached and the effect of contempt is to diminish goodwill the principle that produces all the free and gratuitous services that men render to one another but in our present state of continual dependence upon each other that which diminishes the goodwill of others towards us includes within itself an indefinite multitude of privations when such a mark is inflicted on account of a crime it is essential that a character should be given to it which shall clearly announce the intention with which it was imposed and which cannot be confounded with cicatrices of wounds or accidental marks     a penal mark ought to have a determinate figure and the most suitable as well as the most common is the initial letter of the name of the crime among the romans slanderers were marked on the forehead with the letter k in england for homicide committed after provocation offenders were marked in the hand with the letter m for manslaughter and thieves with the letter t in france the mark for galleyslaves was composed of the three letters gal in poland it was the custom to add a symbolical expression the initial letter of the crime was inclosed in the figure of a gallows in india among the gentoos a great number of burlesque symbolical figures are employed a more lenient method which may be referred to the same head is a practice too little used of giving to offenders a particular dress which serves as a livery of crime at hanau in germany persons condemned to labour on the public works were distinguished by a black sleeve in a white coat it is an expedient which has for its object the prevention of their escape as a mark of infamy it is an addition to the punishment on the score of frugality deforming punishments are not liable to any objection disablement and mutilation are if the effect of either is to prevent a man getting his livelihood by his own labour and he has no sufficient income of his own he must either be left to perish or be supplied with the means of subsistence if he were left to perish the punishment would not be mere disablement or mutilation but death if he be supported by the labour of others that labour must either be bestowed gratis as would be the case if he were supported on the charity of relations and friends or paid for at public cost in either case it is a charge upon the public this consideration might of itself be considered a conclusive objection against the application of these modes of punishment for offences that are apt to be frequently committed such as theft or smuggling the objection applies however in its full force to such of these modes of punishment only as have the effect of depriving the particular individual in question of the means of gaining his livelihood in respect of remissibility they are also eminently defective—a consideration which affords an additional reason for making a very sparing use of them in respect also of variability these punishments are scarcely in a less degree defective the loss of the eyes or of the hand is not to a man who can neither read or write the same degree of punishment as it would be to a painter or an author yet however different in each instance may be the degree of suffering produced by the mass of evil to which the infliction of the punishment in question gives birth all who are subject to it will find themselves more or less affected of these inequalities and therefore of the aggregate amount of the punishment in each particular instance it is impossible to form any estimate it depends on the sensibility of the delinquent and other circumstances which cannot be foreseen by a slothful man the loss of a hand might not be regarded as a very severe punishment it has not been uncommon for men to mutilate or disable themselves to avoid serving in the army in point of variability the several classes of punishment now before us when considered all together are not liable to much objection there is a gradation from less to more which runs through the whole of them the loss of one finger is less painful than the loss of two or of the whole hand the loss of the hand is less than the loss of an arm but when these punishments are considered singly the gradation disappears the particular mutilation directed by the law can neither be increased or diminished that it may be accommodated to the different circumstances of the crime or of the delinquent this objection recurs again under the head of equability the same nominal punishment will not always be the same real punishment in respect of exemplarity the punishments in question possess this property in a higher degree than simple afflictive punishments this latter species of punishment not being naturally attended with any distant consequences their infamy excepted the whole quantity of pain it is calculated to produce is collected as it were into a point and exposed at once to the eyes of the spectator while of the other on the contrary the consequences are lasting and are calculated perpetually to awaken in the minds of all to whose eyes any person that has suffered this species of punishment may happen to present himself the idea of the law itself and of the sanction by which its observance is enforced for this purpose it is necessary however as has been already observed that the penal mark should be such as at first glance to be distinguished from any mark that may have been the result of accident—that misfortune may be protected from the imputation of guilt the next property to be desired in a mode of punishment is subserviency to reformation in this respect the punishments under consideration when temporary have nothing in themselves that distinguishes them from any other mode of punishment their subserviency to reformation is as their experienced magnitude it is the infamy attendant on them that gives them those effects which are   0 apt in this respect to distinguish them to their disadvantage infamy when at an intense pitch is apt to have this particular bad effect it tends pretty strongly to force a man to persist in that depraved course of life by which the infamy was produced when a man falls into any of those offences that the moral sanction is known to treat with extreme rigour men are apt to suppose that the moral sanction has no hold upon him his character they say is gone they withdraw from him their confidence and goodwill he finds himself in a situation in which he has nothing to hope for from men and for the same reason nothing to fear he experiences the worst already if then he depend upon his labour for subsistence and his business is of such sort as requires confidence to be reposed in him by losing that necessary portion of confidence he loses the means of providing himself with subsistence his only remaining resources are then mendicity or depredation from these observations it follows that mutilations ought to be reserved as punishments for the most mischievous offences and as an accompaniment of perpetual imprisonment an exception to this rule may perhaps be found in the case of rape for which analogy most strongly recommends a punishment of this kind chapter iii of restrictive punishments—territorial confinement restrictive punishments are those which restrain the faculties of the individual by hindering him from receiving agreeable impressions or from doing what he desires they take from him his liberty with respect to certain enjoyments and certain acts restrictive punishments are of two sorts according to the method used in inflicting them some operate by moral restraint others by physical restraint moral restraint takes place when the motive presented to the individual to hinder him from doing the act which he wishes to perform is only the fear of a superior punishment for in order to be efficacious it is necessary that the punishment with which he is threatened must be greater than the simple pain of submitting to the restraint imposed upon him the punishment of restraint is applicable to all sorts of actions in general but particularly to the faculty of locomotion everything which restrains the locomotive faculty confines the individual that is to say shuts him up within certain limits and may be called territorial confinement in this kind of punishment the whole earth in relation to the delinquent is divided into two very unequal districts the one of which is open to him and the other interdicted if the place in which he is confined be a narrow space surrounded with walls and the doors of which are locked it is imprisonment if the district in which he be directed to remain is within the dominions of the state the punishment may be called relegation if it be without the dominions of the state the punishment is called banishment the term relegation seems to imply that the delinquent is sent out of the district in which he ordinarily resides this punishment may consist in his confinement in that district where he ordinarily resides and even in his own house it may then be called quasi imprisonment if it refers to a particular district which he is prohibited from entering it is a sort of exclusion which has not yet a proper name but which may be called local interdiction territorial confinement is the genus which includes five species—imprisonment quasi imprisonment relegation local interdiction and banishment chapter iv imprisonment imprisonment makes a much more extensive figure than any other kind of hardship that can be inflicted in the way of punishment every other kind of hardship death alone excepted may be inflicted for two purposes—punishment and compulsion imprisonment besides these two purposes may be employed for another—safe custody when thus employed it is not a punishment properly so called it is intended only to insure the forthcomingness of an individual suspected of having committed an offence that he may be present to undergo the punishment appointed for that offence if he be found guilty when thus employed it ought not to be more severe than is necessary to insure forthcomingness whatever exceeds this is so much misery in waste when imprisonment is intended to operate as a punishment it may be rendered more or less severe according to the nature of the offence and the condition of the offender it may be accompanied by forced labour which may be imposed upon all but it ought not to be so imposed without reference to the age the rank the sex and the physical powers of the individuals other punishments which may be employed in addition to hard labour and of which we shall have occasion to speak in a future chapter are—diet solitude and darkness when imprisonment is inflicted for the     purpose of compulsion the severer it is the better and that for various reasons when it is protracted but slight the danger is that the prisoner may come by degrees to accommodate himself to it till at last it ceases in a manner to operate upon him this is found not uncommonly to be the case with insolvent debtors in many of our gaols there are so many comforts to be had by those who have money to purchase them that many a prisoner becomes in time tolerably well reconciled to his situation when this is the case the imprisonment can no longer be of use in any view the severer it is—i mean all along in point of intensity—the less of it in point of magnitude will be consumed upon the whole that is in point of intensity and duration taken together the more favourable in short will it be to the sufferer it will produce its effects at a cheaper rate the same quantity of painful sensations which under the milder imprisonment are diffused through a large mass of sensations indifferent or pleasurable being in the severer imprisonment brought together will act with collected force and produce a stronger impression the same quantity of pain will therefore go farther this way than in any other add to this that in this way the same quantity of suffering will not have so pernicious an influence on his future life in the course of a tedious confinement his mental faculties are debilitated his habits of industry are weakened his business runs into other channels and many of those casual opportunities which might have afforded the means of improving his fortune had he been at liberty to embrace them are irrecoverably gone these evils which though they may come eventually to be felt are too distant and contingent to contribute anything beforehand to the impression it is intended to produce are saved by placing the magnitude of the punishment in intensity rather than in duration by the fundamental constitution of mans nature without anything being done by any one to produce a change in his situation if left to himself in a situation in which he is debarred from exercising the faculty of locomotion he will in a short time become a prey to various evils to the action of various causes producing various organical pains which sooner or later are sure to end ultimately in death if duration and neglect be added to imprisonment it necessarily becomes a capital punishment since therefore it is followed by an infinite variety of evils which the individual is unable himself to guard against and against which precautions must be taken by others to preserve him it follows that to form a just notion of imprisonment it must be considered not simply by itself but in connexion with its different modes and consequences we shall then see that under the same name very different punishments may be inflicted under a name which presents to the mind only the single circumstance of confinement in a particular place imprisonment may include every possible evil from those which necessarily follow in its train rising from one degree of rigour to another from one degree of atrocity to another till it terminates in a most cruel death and this without being intended by the legislator but altogether arising from absolute negligence—negligence as easy to be explained as it is difficult to be palliated we shall class under three heads the penal circumstances which result from this condition—  necessary inconveniences which arise from the condition of a prisoner and which form the essence of imprisonment   accessory inconveniences which do not necessarily but which very frequently follow in its train   inconveniences arising from abuses i negative evils inseparable from imprisonment   privation of the pleasures which belong to the sight arising from the diversity of objects in town and country   privation of the liberty of taking pleasurable exercises that require a large space such as riding on horseback or in a carriage hunting shooting c   privation of those excursions which may be necessary even for health   privation of the liberty of partaking of public diversions   abridgment of the liberty of going out to enjoy agreeable society as of relations friends or acquaintance although they should be permitted to come to him   privation of the liberty in some cases of carrying on business for a livelihood and abridgment of such liberty in all cases   privation of the liberty of exercising public offices of honour or trust   privation of accidental opportunities of advancing his fortune obtaining patrons forming friendships obtaining a situation or forming matrimonial alliances for himself or children although these evils may in the first instance be purely negative that is to say privation of pleasures it is evident that they bring in their train of consequences positive evils such as the impairing of the health and the impoverishment of the circumstances ii accessory evils commonly attendant on the condition of a prisoner   confinement to disagreeable diet the want of sufficient food for the purpose of nourishment is a distinct mischief which will come under another head       want of comfortable accommodations for repose—hard bedding or straw or nothing but the bare ground this hardship alone has been thought to have been productive in some instances of disease and even death   want of light—by the exclusion of the natural light of the sun by day and the not furnishing or not permitting the introduction of any artificial means of producing light by night   total exclusion from society this evil is carried to its height when a prisoner is not permitted to see his friends his parents his wife or his children   forced obligation of mixing with a promiscuous assemblage of his fellowprisoners   privation of the implements of writing for the purposes of correspondence a useless severity since everything which is written by a prisoner may be properly submitted to inspection if ever this privation be justifiable it is in cases of treason and other party crimes   forced idleness by the refusal of all means of necessary occupation as of the brushes of a painter the tools of a watchmaker or of books c this has sometimes been carried to such a degree of rigour as to deprive prisoners of all amusement these different evils which are so many positive evils in addition to the necessary evils of simple imprisonment may be useful in penal and penitential imprisonment we shall hereafter show in what manner they ought to be used but with respect to the fifth evil the forced obligation of mixing with a promiscuous assemblage of prisoners it is always an evil and an evil which cannot be obviated without a change in the system and construction of prisons we proceed to the consideration of evils purely abusive of those which exist only by the negligence of the magistrates but which necessarily exist where precautions have not been taken to prevent their existence we shall present two catalogues one of the evils the other of their remedies— evils   pains of hunger and thirst general debility—death   sensation of cold in various degrees of intensity stoppage of the circulation—mortification of the extremities†—death   sensation of heat habitual debility—death   sensation of damp and wetness fevers and other disorders—death   noisome smells collections of putrifiable matter habitual debility—falling off of the members by gangrene—gaolfever—contagious diseases—death   pain or uneasiness resulting from the bites of vermin cutaneous diseases—want of sleep—debility—inflammation—fever—death   various diseases   painful sensations arising from indelicate practices   tumultuous noises—indecent practices—indelicate conversations  0 evils resulting from the religious sanction—from the nonexercise of the ceremonies prescribed by it remedies   sufficient nourishment   sufficient clothing adapted to the climate and the season—fire   shelter from the sun in hot weather—fresh air   the ground everywhere covered with boards or bricks or stone—fresh air—tubes for conveying heated air   fresh air—change of clothes—water and other implements of washing—fumigations—whitewashing the walls—medicines and medical assistance   chemical applications to destroy them—cleanliness—a person with proper implements for their destruction and removal   medicines and medical advice   partitions to keep the prisoners separate during the hour of rest at least those of the one sex from those of the other       keepers to be directed to punish those guilty of such practices the punishment to be made known to the prisoners by being fixed up in the prison  0 in protestant countries a chaplain to perform divine service in roman catholic countries a priest to perform mass and to confess the prisoners c chapter v imprisonment—fees another way in which a man is often made to suffer on the occasion of imprisonment is the being made to pay money under the name of fees this hardship on the very first inspection when deduced as a consequence from a sentence or warrant of imprisonment can be classed under no other title than that of an abuse for naturally it has just as much to do with imprisonment as hanging has this abuse is coeval with the first barbarous rudiments of our ancient jurisprudence when the magistrate had little more idea of the ends of justice than the freebooter and the evils he inflicted were little more than a compensation for the evils he repressed in those times of universal depravity when the magistrate reaped almost as much profit from the plunder of those who were or were pretended to be guilty as from the contributions of those who were acknowledged innocent no pretext was too shallow to cover the enterprises of rapacity under the mask of justice all the colour which this abuse is capable of receiving seems to have been taken from a quibbling and inhuman sarcasm since you have lodging found you says the gaoler to the prisoner it is fit like other lodgers you should pay for it fit it certainly would be if the lodger came there voluntarily—the only circumstance in the case which is wanting to make it a just demand instead of a cruel insult but the gaoler like every other servant of the state it will be said and with perfect truth must be satisfied for his trouble and who more fit than the person who occasions it i answer any person whatever—if contrary to the most obvious principles of justice some one person must bear the whole charge of an institution which if beneficial to any is beneficial to all i say anybody because there is no person whose clear benefit from the punishment of the criminal i am speaking here of the judicial appointed punishment the imprisonment and i mean clear benefit after inconvenience has been deducted is not greater than the criminals this would hold good were the peculiar circumstances of the criminal out of the question but when these come to be considered they add considerable force to the above conclusion in the case of nineteen delinquents out of twenty the utter want of all means of satisfying their lawful debts was the very cause and motive to the crime now then whereas it is only possible in the case of a man taken at random that he has not wherewithal to pay it is certain that in nineteen cases out of twenty the delinquent has not so powerful is the force of custom that for a long series of years judges of the first rank and country magistrates none of whom but would have taken it ill enough to have had their wisdom or their humanity called in question stand upon record as having given their allowance to this abuse if any one of these magistrates had ever had the spirit to have refused this allowance the gaoler would for a moment have remained unpaid and from thenceforward the burthen would have been taken up by that public hand which from the beginning ought to have borne it† so far is this hardship from being justifiable on the score of punishment that in most if not in all our prisons it is inflicted indiscriminately on all who enter innocent or guilty it is inflicted at all events when it is not known but they may be innocent for it is inflicted on them at first entrance when committed only for safe custody this is not all it is inflicted on men after they have been proved to be innocent even this is not all to fill up the measure of oppression it is inflicted on them because they have been proved innocent prisoners after they have     been acquitted are as if to make them amends for the unmerited sufferings they have undergone loaded with a heavy fine professedly on the very ground of their having been acquitted in some gaols of a person acquitted of murder a sum of money is exacted under the name of an acquittal equal to what it costs an ordinary working man to maintain himself for a quarter of a year a sum such as not one man in ten of that class that is of the class which includes a great majority of the whole people is ever master of during the course of his whole life chapter vi imprisonment examined we now proceed to examine the degree in which imprisonment possesses the several properties desirable in a lot of punishment   imprisonment possesses the property of efficacy with respect to disablement in great perfection the most dangerous offender so long as his confinement continues is deprived of the power of doing mischief out of doors his vicious propensities may continue at their highest pitch but he will have no opportunity of exercising them   imprisonment is generally exceptionable on the score of frugality none of the inconveniences resulting from it being convertible to profit it is also generally accompanied with expense on account of the maintenance of the persons confined in these calculations of expense that loss ought not to be forgotten which results from the suspension of the lucrative labours of the prisoner a loss which is often continued beyond the period of his imprisonment owing to the habits of idleness it has induced   imprisonment is objectionable in respect of equality if we recur to the catalogue of privations of which it consists it will be seen that the inequality is extreme when one prisoner is sickly and the other healthy when one is the father of a family and the other has no relations when the one is rich and accustomed to all the enjoyments of society and the other poor and his usual condition is one of misery one party may be deprived of his means of subsistence another may be scarcely affected in this respect it may be said is not this loss merely temporary may it not be considered as a forfeiture which forms a part of the punishment if the individual belong to a profession the exercise of which cannot be interrupted without great risk of its total loss the consequence may be his absolute ruin this is one of those cases in which a latitude may properly be left to the judge of commuting this punishment for another a pecuniary punishment may frequently with propriety be substituted the greater number of offenders however are not in a condition to furnish this equivalent it would therefore be necessary to have recourse to simply afflictive punishments the degree of infamy attached to these punishments would however not be an objection in case the offender consented to the exchange and this consent might be made a necessary condition among the inconveniences which may be attached to imprisonment there is one which is particularly inequable take away paper and ink from an author by profession and you take away his means of amusement and support you would punish other individuals more or less according as a written correspondence happened to be more or less necessary for their business or pleasure a privation so heavy for those whom it affects and at the same time so trifling for the greater number of individuals ought not to be admitted in quality of a punishment why should an individual who has received instruction in writing be punished more than another this circumstance ought rather to be a reason for indulgence his sensibility has been augmented by education and the instructed and cultivated man will suffer more from imprisonment than the ignorant and the clownish on the other hand though the punishment of imprisonment is inequable it should be observed that it naturally produces an effect upon every one there is no individual insensible to the privation of liberty—to the interruption of all his habits and especially of all his social habits   imprisonment is eminently divisible with respect to its duration it is also very susceptible of different degrees of severity   under the present system the exemplarity of imprisonment is reduced to the lowest term in the panopticon the facility afforded to the admission of the public adds much to this branch of its utility however if the prisoners are not seen the prison is visible the appearance of this habitation of penitence may strike the imagination and awaken a salutary terror buildings employed for this purpose ought therefore to have a character of seclusion and restraint which should take away all hope of escape and should say this is the dwellingplace of crime   simplicity of description—under this head there is nothing to be desired this punishment is intelligible to all ages and all capacities confinement is an evil of which every body can form an idea and which all     have more or less experienced the name of a prison at once recalls the ideas of suffering as connected with it let us here stop to examine three auxiliary punishments that under special circumstances and for a limited time only may be usefully made to accompany afflictive imprisonment these auxiliaries are solitude darkness and hard diet their distinguishing merit consists in their subserviency to reformation that the three hardships thus named have a peculiar tendency to dispose an offender to penitence seems to be the general persuasion of mankind the fact seems to be pretty generally acknowledged but the reasons are not altogether obvious nor do they seem to be very explicitly developed in the minds of those who show themselves strenuously convinced of the fact an imperfect theory might naturally enough induce one to deny it what is it it may be said that is to produce in the offender that aversion to his offence which is styled penitence it is the pain which he experiences to be connected with it the greater then that pain the greater will be his aversion but of what kind the pain be or from what source it issues are circumstances that make no difference solitude darkness and hard diet in virtue of a certain quantity of pain thus produced will produce a certain degree of aversion to the offence be it so but whipping or any other mode of punishment that produced a greater pain would produce a stronger aversion now the pain of whipping may be carried to as high a pitch as the pain produced by this group of hardships altogether in what respect then can these have a greater tendency to produce penitence than whipping the answer is that the aversion to the offence depends not merely upon the magnitude of the pain that is made to stand connected with it but it depends likewise upon the strength of the connexion which is made to take place between those two incidents in the patients mind now that solitude darkness and hard diet have a greater tendency than any other kind of hardship to strengthen this connexion i think may be satisfactorily made out acute punishment such as whipping at the time it is inflicted leaves no leisure for reflection the present sensation with the circumstances that accompany it is such as engrosses the whole attention if any mental emotion mix itself with the bodily sensation it will rather be that of resentment against the executioner the judge the prosecutor or any person whose share in the production of the suffering happens to strike the sufferer most than any other the anguish is soon over and as soon as it is over the mind of the patient is occupied in the eager pursuit of objects that shall obliterate the recollection of the pain that he has endured while all the objects by which he is surrounded contribute to repel those salutary reflections upon which his reformation depends indeed as soon as the anguish is over a new emotion presents itself—an emotion of joy which the patient feels at the reflection that his suffering is over the gradual and protracted scene of suffering produced by the combination of punishments we are now considering is much more favourable to the establishment of the wishedfor effect by solitude a man is abstracted from those emotions of friendship or enmity which society inspires from the ideas of the objects their conversation is apt to bring to view from the apprehension of the disagreeable situations their activity threatens to expose him to or the pleasures in which they solicit him to engage by confinement he is abstracted from all external impressions but such as can be afforded him by the few and uninviting objects that constitute the boundaries or compose the furniture of a chamber in a prison and from all ideas which by virtue of the principle of association any other impressions are calculated to suggest by darkness the number of the impressions he is open to is still further reduced by the striking off all those which even the few objects in question are calculated to produce upon the sense of sight the mind of the patient is by this means reduced as it were to a gloomy void leaving him destitute of all support but from his own internal resources and producing the most lively impression of his own weakness in this void the punishment of hard diet comes and implants the slow but incessant and corroding pain of hunger while the debility that attends the first stages of it for the phrensy that is apt to accompany the last stages is to be always guarded against banishes any propensity which the patient might have left to try such few means of activity as he is left undeprived of to furnish himself with any of the few impressions he is still open to receive meantime that pain and this debility however irksome are by no means so acute as to occupy his mind entirely and prevent altogether its wandering in search of other ideas on the contrary he will be forcibly solicited to pay attention to any ideas which in that extreme vacancy of employment are disposed to present themselves to his view the most natural of all will be to retrace the events of his past life the bad advice he received his first deviations from rectitude which have led to the commission of the offence for which he is at the time undergoing punishment—a crime all the pleasures derived from which have been already reaped     and of which all that remains is the melancholy suffering that he endures he will recall to his recollection those days of innocence and security which were formerly his lot and which contrasted with his present wretchedness will present themselves to his imagination with an increased and factitious degree of splendour his penitent reflections will naturally be directed to the errors of which he has been guilty if he have a wife or children or near relations the affection that he once entertained for them may be renewed by the recollection of the misery that he has occasioned them another advantage attendant on this situation is that it is peculiarly fitted to dispose a man to listen with attention and humility to the admonitions and exhortations of religion left in this state of destitution in respect of all external pleasures religious instructions are calculated to take the stronger hold of his mind oppressed by the state of wretchedness in which he finds himself and by the unlookedfor or unknown events that have led to the detection of his crime the more he reflects upon them the more firmly will he be convinced of the existence of a providence which has watched over his actions and defeated his best concerted contrivances the same god that punishes him may also save him and thenceforward the promises of eternal bliss or torment will more anxiously engage his attention—promises of happiness in another state of being in case of repentance and denunciations of torments prepared for the guilty in the regions of eternal night of which his present situation seems a prelude and a foretaste will fix his regard in a frame of mind such as this to turn a deaf ear to the admonitions and consolations afforded by religion a man must be very different from the ordinary caste of men darkness too has in circumstances like this a peculiar tendency to dispose men to conceive and in a manner to feel the presence of invisible agents whatever may be the reason the fact is notorious and undisputed when the external senses are restrained from action the imagination is more active and produces a numerous race of ideal beings in a state of solitude infantine superstitions ghosts and spectres recur to the imagination this of itself forms a sufficient reason for not prolonging this species of punishment which may overthrow the powers of the mind and produce incurable melancholy the first impressions will however always be beneficial if at such a time a minister of religion qualified to avail himself of these impressions be introduced to the offender thus humiliated and cast down the success of his endeavours will be almost certain because in this state of abandonment he will appear as the friend of the unfortunate and as his peculiar benefactor this course of punishment thus consisting of solitude darkness and hard diet is as has been observed when embodied a sort of discipline too violent to be employed except for short periods if greatly prolonged it would scarcely fail of producing madness despair or more commonly a stupid apathy this is not however the place for fixing the duration of the punishment proper for each species of offence it ought to vary according to the nature of the offence the degree of obstinacy evinced by the offender and the symptoms of repentance which he exhibits what has been already said is sufficient to show that the mass of punishments in question may be employed with the greatest advantage simultaneously they mutually aid each other in order to produce the desired effect most speedily even the sort of food allowed may be rendered unpalatable as well as scanty otherwise there would be danger lest to a young and robust person the constantly recurring gratification afforded to the palate might render him insensible to the loss of all other pleasures if any punishment can in itself be popular this i think promises to be so it bears a stronger resemblance than any other to domestic discipline the tendency which it has to lead the offender to acknowledge the evil of his offence and the justice of his sentence is the same which an indulgent father desires his punishments to possess when he inflicts them upon his children and there is no aspect which it is more desirable the law should assume than this the effects produced by solitary confinement are not matters of mere conjecture they have been ascertained by experience and are reported upon the best authorities speaking of the cells in newgate i was told says mr howard by those who attended me that criminals who had affected an air of boldness on their trial and appeared quite unconcerned at the pronouncing sentence upon them were struck with horror and shed tears when brought to these darksome solitary abodes i remember an instance says mr hanway† some years before the law for proceeding to sentence upon evidence of a notorious malefactor who would not plead it was a question whether he should be brought to the press but the jailor privately recommended to the magistrates to try solitary confinement in prison this produced the effect for in less than twentyfour hours the daring artful felon chose to hold up his hand at the bar and quietly submit to the laws rather than remain in such a solitary state without hope     the same gentleman mentions a set of cells provided for the purpose of solitary confinement in clerkenwell bridewell by order of the justices of the peace for that division one of those magistrates he says assured him that every person committed to those solitary apartments had been in a few days reformed to an amazing degree the apartments though solitary were not dark nor is any thing said about the circumstance of diet directly opposed to solitary imprisonment is the promiscuous association of prisoners the suffering which results from this circumstance is not the result of direct intention on the part of the magistrate it is an evil acknowledged and yet suffered still to exist to a very considerable extent it is evidently not so much inflicted as admitted from the supposed inability of government to exclude it the great and only objection to its exclusion being the expense of the arrangement necessary to the accomplishment of that purpose the advantage by which it is recommended is that of frugality it is less expensive to shut up prisoners in one room than to provide separate apartments for each one or even to keep them divided into classes† this promiscuous assemblage of prisoners considered as part of the punishment has no penal effect upon the most audacious and the most perverse on the contrary with reference to them it renders imprisonment less painful the tumult with which it surrounds them diverts them from the misery of their situation and from the reproaches of their consciences it is therefore an evil most severe for the prisoner of refinement and sensibility it is an addition to the punishment of imprisonment evidently unequable unexemplary and unprofitable producing a variety of unknown sufferings such that those only who have experienced them can be fully acquainted with their extent but the great and decisive objection to the promiscuous association of prisoners considered as a punishment is that it is directly opposed to their reformation instead of rendering a delinquent better its evident tendency is to make him worse the ill effect which in the instance of indelible infamy is only problematical is in the instance of this species of hardship certain it obliterates the sense of shame in the mind of the sufferer in other words it produces insensibility to the force of the moral sanction this ill effect of the promiscuous association of prisoners is too obvious not to strike even the most superficial spectator criminals confined together are corrupted it is said by the society of each other there are a thousand ways of diversifying the expression and it is generally set off with great exuberance of metaphor the word corruption and the greater part of the terms that compose the moral vocabulary are not calculated of themselves to convey any precise import but serve rather to express the disapprobation which he who uses them happens to entertain of the practices in question than the tendency to produce mischief which is or at least ought to be the ground of it in order then to form a precise idea of the phenomena in which this corruption displays itself let us examine the mischievous habits produced by this promiscuous intercourse and the way in which it tends to produce mischief in society the ill consequences of the association in question may be comprised under the following heads—   it strengthens in the minds of all parties concerned the motives which prompt to the commission of all sorts of crimes   it diminishes the force of the considerations which tend to restrain them   it increases their skill and by that means the power of carrying their obnoxious propensities into practice crimes are the sort of acts here in question now the names of crimes are words for which precise ideas have or might at least be found they are evils of a certain description the names of the motives that prompt a man to the commission of a crime are also the names of pains and pleasures in examining therefore the consequences of the association of delinquents under the foregoing heads we tread upon clear and palpable ground unobscured by metaphor and declamation   as to the motives by which men are prompted to the commission of crimes these are the expectation of the pleasures which are the fruit of them by far the greater number of the offences which bring men to a prison are the offspring of rapacity crimes issuing from any other motive are so few as scarcely to demand in this view any separate notice the bulk of offenders will be of the poorer sort among them the produce of a little plunder will go in the purchase of pleasure much beyond that which the ordinary produce of their labour would enable them to purchase such as more food more delicate liquors in greater plenty and more delicious—finer clothes and more expensive pleasures these things naturally form the subject of conversation among the prisoners and an inexliaustible subject of boasting on the part of those who by their skill or good fortune have acquired the means of enjoying them these recitals give a sort of superiority which those who possess it are fond     from a principle of vanity to display and magnify to the humble and admiring crowd of their less fortunate associates they inflame the imagination of the hearers and in a word their propensity to gratify their rapacity by all sorts of crimes is increased by the prospect of the pleasures of which the means are furnished by these crimes the more numerous the association the more varied the exploits to be recounted and what subject more naturally the subject of conversation than the circumstances which have brought them together   while on the one hand as has been just observed all the vicious propensities are nourished and invigorated—on the other hand all considerations tending to restrain the commission of offences are repelled and enfeebled these considerations belong to the one or the other of the three sanctions—the political the moral or the religious those derived from the political sanction are the various punishments appointed by law amongst these that which they are actually undergoing have undergone or are about to undergo of these sufferings it will naturally be the study of them all to make as light as possible to which end the society of each other will afford them many powerful assistances from pride each man will endeavour to make his own sense of his own sufferings appear to others as slight as possible he will undervalue the afflicting circumstances of his situation he will magnify any little comforts which may attend it and as the common phrase is will put as good a face upon the matter as he can thus the most intrepid and proud becomes a patron for all the others the sensibilities of all are gradually elevated to the same pitch it would be matter of shame to them not to bear their misfortunes with equanimity even from mere sympathy many will derive a powerful motive to soothe the sufferings of their partners in affliction—to congratulate them on the termination of such as are past to relieve them under such as are present and to fortify them against such as may be to come it may possibly be observed that to ascribe to persons of the class in question any such benevolent affections is to attribute to them virtues to which they are altogether strangers but to suppose that men consist only of two classes the altogether good and the altogether bad is a vulgar prejudice the crime which subjects a man to the lash of the law may leave him possessed of a thousand good qualities and more especially of sympathy for the misfortunes of others daily experience may convince us of this and lead us to believe that the criminal are not always altogether vicious the considerations derived from the moral sanction are the various evils positive and negative apprehended from the illwill of such persons with whom the person in question is in society whilst a man remains in general society though his character may be the subject of general suspicion he will be obliged to keep a guard upon his actions that he may not too strongly confirm these suspicions and render himself altogether despicable but in a prison the society is unmixed having interests of its own opposite to the former governed by habits and principles opposite to those which are approved in general society the habits and practices which were odious there because they were mischievous there—not being mischievous are not odious here theft is not odious among thieves who have nothing to be stolen it is in vain for them to make pretensions to probity they agree therefore by a tacit convention to undervalue this virtue the mixed qualities of patience intrepidity activity ingenuity and fidelity which are beneficial or not according as they are subservient to the other will be magnified to the prejudice of the former a man will be applauded for his patience though it were exerted in lying in wait for a booty for his intrepidity though manifested in attacking the dwelling of a peaceable householder or in defending himself against the ministers of justice for his activity though employed in seizing the unwary traveller for his ingenuity though displayed in working upon the sympathetic feelings of some deluded compassionate benefactor for his fidelity though employed in screening his associates in some enterprise of mischief from the pursuit of the injured these are qualities which enjoy the highest estimation in such society and by their possession that thirst for sympathy and applause is gratified of which every man in whatever situation he is placed is desirous the probity which is held in honour in such society is not intended to be useful to mankind at large its rules may be strictly observed in the society in which it is established and disregarded to the prejudice of all persons not connected with that society the arabs who live by plunder are remarkable for their honesty towards the members of their own tribe thus also that there is honour among thieves has become proverbial     the considerations derived from the religious sanction are the sufferings apprehended from the immediate will of the deity in some degree perhaps in the present but chiefly in a future life this displeasure is under the christian religion and particularly the protestant invariably believed to be annexed with few or no exceptions to all those malpractices which bring men into prisons the considerations therefore which that sanction affords are to be numbered among the considerations which tend to restrain men from committing crimes now the force of this sanction acting in opposition to that of the local moral sanction which is generated and governs in a prison will naturally have the whole force of this latter exerted against it to overthrow it not that a prison is the region of acute and scrupulous philosophy the arguments there made use of will be addressed to the passions rather than the judgment the being of a god the authority of revelation will not be combated by reason the force of this sanction will be eluded rather than opposed the attention will be diverted from the idea of gods displeasure to the improbability of its being manifested the authority of revelation will be combated by satires upon its ministers and that man will be pronounced brave who shall dare to deny the one and despise the other and arguments of this kind will be found to have most influence upon the members of such societies   the third and last of the ways in which the association of malefactors in prisons contributes to corrupt them is by increasing their skill and by that means their power of carrying their mischievous propensities whatever they may be into practice that their conversation will naturally turn upon their criminal exploits has been already observed each malefactor will naturally give a detail of the several feats of ingenuity which in the course of those exploits the occasion led him to practise these facts will naturally be noted down were it only on the score of curiosity but as means of gratifying those propensities which the situation in question has a strong tendency to strengthen and confirm they will make a much more forcible impression an ample mass of observations will be soon collected drawn from the experience of the whole society and each particular member of it will soon be wise with the wisdom of the whole prisons therefore have commonly and very properly been styled schools of vice in these schools however the scholar has more powerful motives for and more effectual means of acquiring the sort of knowledge that is to be learnt there than he has of acquiring the sort of knowledge that is taught in more professed schools in the professed school he is stimulated only by fear he strives against his inclination in these schools of vice he is stimulated by hope acting in concert with his natural inclination in the first the knowledge imparted is dispensed only by one person the stock of knowledge proceeds from one person in the others each one contributes to the instruction of all the others the stock of knowledge is the united contribution of all in professed schools the scholar has amusements more inviting to him than the professed occupations of the school in these he has no such amusements the occupation in question is the chief of the few pleasures of which his situation admits to the most corrupt this promiscuous association is mischievous to those committed for a first offence who have yielded to the temptations of indigence or have been misled by evil example who are yet young and not hacknied in crimes punishment properly applied might work reformation this association can only render such more vicious they will pass from pilfering to greater thefts till they are guilty of highway robbery and murder such is the education yielded by promiscuous association of criminals in prison chapter vii general scheme of imprisonment let there be three kinds of imprisonment differing one from another in the degree of their severity the first for insolvents in case of rashness or extravagance in lieu of satisfaction the second for malefactors whose imprisonment is to be temporary these may be styled secondrate malefactors the third for malefactors whose imprisonment is perpetual these may be styled firstrate malefactors  st let all insolvents be upon the footing of bankrupts compellable to discover under pain of death or other heavy penalty on discovery not liable to imprisonment of course but liable in case of rashness or extravagance or else let rashness or extravagance be presumed in the first instance and let it lie upon the insolvent to exculpate himself to the same prison let such persons be committed as are arrested upon mesne process on persons of this class the imprisonment comes in before judgment to enforce—after judgment to stand in lieu of satisfaction here let there be no mark of infamy nor let there be here any rigour either real or apparent   0 the second kind of imprisonment is designed for correction as well as for example the real therefore and the apparent punishment ought to be upon a par here let labour be added to imprisonment and for the last week or fortnight or month solitude darkness and spare diet here let a stigma be inflicted but let that stigma be a temporary one it will answer two purposes first that of example as increasing the apparent punishment second that of security by preventing escape the third kind of imprisonment is destined for example only the end of correction is precluded since the delinquent is never to mix with society again here too for the same purposes as in the former case let a stigma be inflicted and let that stigma be perpetual here let the apparent condition of the delinquent be as miserable and the real as comfortable as may be let the gentleman occupy himself as he pleases let the yeoman who has an art exercise his art and let him be a sharer in the profits let the labour of the yeoman who knows no art be more moderate than in the temporary prison the diet in many prisons is in part provided for by private benefactions such benefactions are of use only upon supposition of that gross negligence on the part of government of which they are a pregnant testimony the demand a man in the situation in question has for food is not at all varied by the happening or not happening of a casual act of humanity by a chance individual whatever be the proper allowance he ought to have as much although no private benefaction were given for that purpose he ought not to have more were the amount of such benefactions ever so considerable if ever the legislature should fulfil this obvious and necessary duty all such private benefactions should be taken into the hands of the public such resumption far from being a violation of the wills of the benefactors would be a more complete execution of them than any they could have hoped for for the same reason all casual benefactions of particular persons to particular delinquents should be prevented the way to do this is not to prevent the moneys being given but to prevent its being spent at least in food and liquors the introduction of money could not be prevented without establishing a search too troublesome and humiliating to be executed with the strictness requisite to answer the purpose but articles so bulky as those of food and liquors might easily be excluded such an institute would tend in no inconsiderable degree to promote restitution at present in all offences of rapacity that is in nineteen out of twenty of the crimes that are committed the greater a mans guilt has been—the more mischief he has done the better he fares while he is in prison it is seldom that the whole produce of the crime is found upon the delinquent at the time of his being apprehended and though it be found on him if it consist in money it is seldom that it can be identified in such manner as to warrant the restitution of it against the consent of the delinquent commonly if it be not spent it is in the hands of some friend of the delinquent an associate in iniquity a wife or mistress thus secured it is disposed of at his direction and either lavished in debauchery or in feeing lawyers to obstruct the course of justice when therefore the plunder is of no use to him it will require a much less effort on his part to restore it to the right owner the workings of conscience will be powerfully seconded by such an institution whatever therefore is found upon the person or in the possession of any one who by virtue of a charge upon oath is apprehended for a felony should be impounded in the hands of the officer as much of it as consists in money or other articles that include a considerable value in a small compass should be sealed up with the seal of the magistrate who should have it in his option to keep it in his own custody or commit it to that of the ministerial officer giving in either case a receipt to the suspected felon an objection to imprisonment when all are upon an equal footing with respect to entertainment is that the punishment is apt to be disproportionate the rich are punished more than the poor or in other words those who have been accustomed to good living more than those who have been accustomed to hard living on the other hand to allow those who are committed for crimes of rapacity to give in to any expense while any part of the booty they may have made remains unrestored is to allow them to enjoy the profit of their crimes to give the criminal an indulgence at the expense of those whom he has injured here then arises a difference in the treatment proper to be given in this respect to different crimes persons committed for crimes of rapacity should in the case where the profit of the crime has been reaped be debarred until complete restitution shall have been made of the liberty of procuring themselves those indulgences that are to be had for money persons committed for any other crimes may be allowed it with respect to restitution a further caution is to be observed it will happen very frequently that a person apprehended for one offence has been guilty of many others for this reason it is not the restitution of the booty gained by the first offence for which     the malefactor is apprehended that ought to be deemed sufficient to entitle him to the liberty of purchasing indulgences a time ought to be limited suppose a month or six weeks and notice given for any persons who within a certain time suppose a year have been sufferers by him to come in and oppose the allowance of such liberty very light proof in such case ought to be held sufficient let us return for a moment to the different kinds of prisons the different purposes for which they are destined ought to be very decidedly marked in their external appearance in their internal arrangements and in their denomination the walls of the first sort ought to be white—of the second grey—of the third black on the outside of the two last kinds of prisons may be represented various figures emblematical of the supposed dispositions of the persons confined in them a monkey a fox and a tiger representing mischief cunning and rapacity the sources of all crimes would certainly form more appropriate decorations for a prison than the two statues of melancholy and raving madness formerly standing before bedlam in the interior let two skeletons be placed one on each side of an iron door the occasional aspect of such objects is calculated to suggest to the imagination the most salutary terrors a prison would thus represent the abode of death and no youth that had once visited a place so decorated could fail of receiving a most salutary and indelible impression i am fully aware that to the man of wit these emblematical figures may serve as matter for ridicule he admires them in poetry he despises them when embodied in reality fortunately however they are more assailable by ridicule than by reason distinguishing the several species of prisons by characteristic denominations is far from being a useless idea justice and humanity to insolvent debtors and to persons detained upon suspicion require that they ought to be screened even from the apprehension of being confounded with delinquents a risk to which they are naturally exposed where all places of confinement bear the same appellation if no such sentiment were found to be already in existence the legislator ought to make it his business to create it but the truth is that it does exist and it is the most valuable classes of the community that are most severely wounded by this want of discrimination a difference in the situation and name affords another means of aggravating one of the most important parts of the punishment—the apparent punishment the first sort of prison may be called the house for safe custody—the second the penitentiary house—the third the black prison the first of these names does not convey any idea of misconduct the second does but at the same time presents the idea of reformation the third is calculated to inspire terror and aversion with a view to reformation in the case of offences punished by temporary imprisonment part of the punishment may consist in learning by heart a certain part of the criminal code including that part which relates to the offence for which the party is punished it might be digested into the form of a catechism in secondrate felonies and misdemeanors where after being punished the offender is returned into society it is of importance to lighten as much as possible the load of infamy he has been made to bear the business is to render infamous not the offender but the offence the punishment undergone upon the presumption of his being reclaimed he ought not if he is returned into society to have his reputation irretrievably destroyed the business is then for the sake of general prevention to render the offence infamous and at the same time for the sake of reformation to spare the shame of the offender as much as possible these two purposes appear at first to be repugnant how can they be reconciled the difficulty perhaps is not so great as it at first appears let the offender while produced for the purpose of punishment be made to wear a mask with such other contrivances upon occasion as may serve to conceal any peculiarities of person this contrivance will have a farther good effect in point of exemplarity without adding anything to the force of the real punishment—on the contrary serving even to diminish it it promises to add considerably to the force of the apparent the masks may be made more or less tragical in proportion to the enormity of the crimes of those who wear them the air of mystery which such a contrivance will throw over the scene will contribute in a great degree to fix the attention by the curiosity it will excite and the terror it will inspire chapter viii of other species of territorial confinement—quasi imprisonment—relegation—banishment quasi imprisonment consists in the confinement of an individual to the district in which his ordinary place of residence is situated     relegation consists in the banishment of an individual from the district in which his ordinary place of residence is situated and his confinement to some other district of the state banishment consists in the expulsion of a man from the country in which he has usually resided and the prohibition of his return to it these three species of punishment may be either temporary or perpetual relegation and banishment are punishments unknown to the english law transportation as we shall presently have occasion to observe is in its nature totally different the exclusion of papists from a certain district about the court is to be considered rather as a measure of precaution than of punishment it is true that the condition of persons living within the rules of a prison corresponds pretty accurately with the idea of territorial confinement but this kind of territorial confinement is not inflicted in a direct way as a punishment the punishment inflicted by the law is that of imprisonment which the prisoner is allowed to commute upon paying for it a man is not committed to the rules he is committed to the prison and upon paying what the jailor chooses or is permitted to demand he has the liberty of the rules that is of being in any part of a certain district round about the jail the several inhabitable districts which are privileged from arrest may be considered as scenes of territorial confinement with respect to offenders who resort to them to escape being arrested and sent to prison a man in such cases voluntarily changes the severer species of restraint into a milder in france instances of relegation were not unfrequent under the old regime a man was ordered to confine himself to his estate or to quit his estate and go and live at another place a punishment however of this sort almost always fell upon a man of rank and generally was rather an arbitrary expression of the personal displeasure of the sovereign than a regular punishment inflicted in the ordinary course of justice the person on whom it fell was commonly a disgraced minister or a member of parliament it has repeatedly happened that a whole parliament has been relegated for refusing to register a particular edict in these cases however it was often employed not so much as a punishment as a means of prevention—to prevent what were called intrigues the exercise of such an act of authority was a symptom of apprehension and weakness on the part of the minister when a man is banished from all the dominions of his own state he has either the whole world besides left for him to range in or he is confined to a particular part of it in the first case it may be said to be indefinite with respect to the locus ad quem in the other definite† it might seem at first sight as if the defining the locus ad quem in banishment would be an operation nugatory and impracticable for banishment is one of those punishments that are to be carried into effect if at all only by the terror of ulterior punishment now to be liable to ulterior punishment at the hands of his own state a man must be still in the power of that state which by the supposition it would appear as if he could not be there are three cases however in which he may be so still—  where the banishment is only temporary   where though his person is out of the dominions of his own state his property or some other possession of his is still within its power   where the foreign state to which he is exiled is disposed on any account to cooperate with his own and either to punish or give up to punishment such persons as the latter shall deem delinquents the inconveniences of territorial confinement whether by relegation or banishment are for the most part of the same description as those of simple imprisonment they are apt in some respects to be greater in others less severe than simple imprisonment territorial confinement is however susceptible of such infinite diversity arising from the nature of the place—the extent of the district—the circumstances of the delinquent—that nothing like uniformity can be met with     and scarce any proposition can be laid down respecting it that shall be generally true in case of relegation the liberty of beholding the beauties of nature and of the arts of enjoying the company of ones friends and relations of serving them and advancing ones own fortune is liable to be more or less abridged the liberty of exercising any public power and of taking journies for the sake of health or of pleasure are subject to be entirely taken away the liberty of carrying on business for a livelihood will be subject to be more or less abridged according to its nature and in respect of some particular species of business or trade the opportunity of exercising it will be subject to be entirely taken away in respect to banishment the inconveniences are liable to vary to such a degree both in quality and species that nothing can be predicated of this mode of punishment that shall be applicable to all cases the sort of evils with which it will be found to be most generally accompanied may be arranged under the following heads— separation from ones friends relations and countrymen loss of the liberty of enjoying objects of pleasure or of amusement to which one has been accustomed as public diversions or the beauties of nature or art loss of the opportunity of advancement in the way of life in which one had engaged as in the military line or in public offices loss of the opportunity of advancing ones fortune and derangement in ones affairs whether of trade or any other lucrative profession but under this head scarce anything can with certainty be said till the business of each delinquent is known and the country to which he is relegated all opportunity of advancing ones fortune may be totally taken away or may be changed more or less for the worse but it may even be improved a workman acquainted with only one branch of a complicated manufacture if relegated to a country in which no such manufacture was carried on would lose the whole of his means of subsistence so far as it depended upon that manufacture a man engaged in his own country in the profession of the law relegated to a country governed by different laws would find his knowledge altogether useless a clergyman of the church of england would lose the means of subsistence derivable from his profession if relegated to a country in which there were no members of that sect to be found the quantity of suffering incident to banishment and in some cases to relegation will depend upon the individuals acquaintance or want of acquaintance with foreign languages for this purpose it ought to be borne in mind that in every country the great majority of the people know no other language than their own a great deal will depend upon the language a man speaks a german or an italian merely by being banished his own state would suffer nothing in this respect because in other states he will find the bulk of the people speaking precisely the same language next to a german or an italian a frenchman would be least exposed to suffer on account of the popularity of the french language in other european nations an englishman except in america a swede a dane and a russian would find themselves worse off in this respect than inhabitants of other european countries a man being among people with whose language he is unacquainted is liable to be exposed to the most serious evils a difficulty in conversation imports a difficulty in making known all ones wants in taking the necessary steps for procuring all sorts of pleasures of warding off all sorts of pains though so much of the rudiments of a language should be acquired as may be sufficient for the common purposes of life a man rarely acquires it in such perfection as to enable him to enjoy unembarrassed the pleasure of conversation he will feel himself condemned to a perpetual state of inferiority which must necessarily interfere with and obstruct his engaging in any profitable employment to some people banishment may be rendered in the highest degree irksome by the manners and customs of the people among whom the individual is cast the words manners and customs are here employed in their greatest latitude and are considered as comprising every circumstance upon which a state of comfortable existence depends the principal objects to which they refer are diet clothing lodging diversions and every thing depending on difference of government and religion which last has among the lower classes at least no inconsiderable influence upon the sympathies and antipathies of persons in general throughout europe especially among persons in the higher ranks of life a certain degree of conformity in manners and customs prevails but a gentoo banished from his own country would be rendered extremely wretched especially on the score of religion change of climate is another circumstance of importance the change may be for the better but the bulk of mankind from the effects of long habit with difficulty accustom themselves to a climate different from that of their native country the complaints of expatriated persons usually turn upon the injuries their health sustains from this cause with respect to all these several evils which are thus liable to arise out of the punishment     of banishment no one of them is certain to have place they may or may not exist in respect of severity they are liable to unlimited variation and it may even happen that the good may preponderate over the evil in point of frugality it seems as if these several punishments were all of them more eligible than imprisonment at least than the system of imprisonment as at present managed and that quasiimprisonment and relegation are more frugal than banishment under imprisonment a man must at all events be maintained simple imprisonment adds nothing to the facility which any man has of maintaining himself by his labour it takes from that facility in many cases by imprisonment some people will always be altogether debarred from maintaining themselves these must be maintained at the expense of the public an imprisoned man therefore is on an average a burthen his value to the state is negative a man at liberty is at an average a profit his value to the state is positive for each man at an average must produce more than he consumes else there would be no common stock a banished man is neither a burthen nor a profit his value to the state is 0 it is greater therefore than that of an imprisoned man the value of a man under quasiimprisonment and relegation may it should seem be taken as equivalent or not in any assignable degree less than that of a man at large in the only instances in which these modes of punishment occur in england the sufferer instead of receiving anything from the public pays† in point of certainty they have none of them anything to distinguish them from other punishments in point of equality they are all of them deficient‡ but especially the two latter and most of all the last to be confined to within the circuit of a small town can scarcely but be a punishment in some degree to almost all though to some more to others less to live out of ones own province or out of ones own country is a very severe punishment to many but to many it is none at all it is impossible to state with any accuracy the difference in this respect between relegation and banishment in one point of view it should seem as if banishment were the more penal for the difference in point of laws language climate and customs between ones own province and another province of ones own state is upon an average not likely to be so great as between ones own province and a foreign state in nations however that have colonies it will generally happen that there are provinces more dissimilar to one another upon the whole in those respects than some of those provinces may be to other provinces of neighbouring nations how small a change for instance would an englishman find in crossing from dover to dunkirk and how great a change in going from the first of those places to the east or west indies in point of variability except in respect of time no punishment of the chronical kind can be more ineligible than these but in point of intensity although the degrees of suffering they are liable to produce in different persons are so numerous yet they are not by any means subject to the regulation of the magistrate it is not in his power to fix the quantity of punishment upon the whole to anything near the mark he may pitch upon in his own mind in point of exemplarity they all yield to every other mode of punishment and banishment to the other two as to banishment what little exemplarity it possesses it possesses upon the face of the description the descriptions of orators and poets have rendered it in some degree formidable upon paper on the score of execution it is the essential character of it to have none at all removed out of the observation of his countrymen his sufferings were they ever so great can afford no example to his countrymen this is the lowest degree of inexemplarity a punishment can possess when even the person of the sufferer is out of the reach of observation     the two others are upon a footing with pecuniary punishment in which the person of the sufferer is under observation and occasionally perhaps his sufferings but there is no circumstance to point out the derivation of the latter from the punishment that produced them they are inferior to imprisonment because there the main instrument of punishment the prison is continually before his eyes to quasiimprisonment and relegation there belongs no such instrument—the punishment as we have observed being produced in the first instance not by any material but merely by moral means on the score of subserviency to reformation there seems to be a considerable difference among these three punishments quasi imprisonment is apt to be disserviceable in this view relegation and banishment rather serviceable than otherwise more especially the latter   quasi imprisonment is apt to be disserviceable the reasons have been already given under the head of imprisonment the property which we mentioned as being incident to imprisonment i mean of corrupting the morals of the prisoners by the accumulating if one may so say of the peccant matter is incident to quasi imprisonment only in a somewhat less degree under the former they can have no other company than that of each other under the latter there may be room for some admixture of persons of repute under the former they are forced into the company of each other under the latter they may choose to be alone   relegation is apt to be rather serviceable than otherwise as in solitary imprisonment if the delinquent has formed any profligate connexions it separates him from them and does not like simple imprisonment lead him to form new ones of the same stamp turned adrift among strangers he cannot expect all at once to meet with a set of companions prepared to join with him in any scheme of wickedness should he make advances and be repulsed he exposes himself to their honest indignation perhaps to the censure of the law should the company he happens to fall in with be persons as profligate as himself it would be some time before he could establish himself sufficiently in their confidence if he continue to make war upon mankind it must be with his own single strength he may find it easier to betake himself to charity or to honest labour he is separated not only from the objects which used to supply him with the means to commit crimes but from those which used to furnish him with the motives the company he meets with in the new scene he enters upon will either be honest or at least for aught he can know to the contrary will for some time seem to be so in the meantime the disapprobation he may hear them express for habits resembling those which subjected him to the punishment he is undergoing may cooperate with that punishment and contribute to the exciting in him that salutary aversion to those habits which is styled repentance   in this respect banishment is apt to be rather more serviceable than relegation if the delinquent be still of that age at which new habits of life are easily acquired and is not insensible to the advantages of a good reputation his exile if the character in which he appears is not known will be the more likely to contribute to his reformation from his finding himself at a distance from those who were witnesses of his infamy and in a country in which his endeavours to obtain an honest livelihood will not be liable to be obstructed by finding himself an object of general suspicion but even though he were to carry with him to the place of his banishment his original vicious propensities he would not find the same facilities for giving effect to them especially if the language of the country were different from his own the laws also of the foreign country being new to him may on that account strike him with greater terror than the laws of his own country which he had perhaps been accustomed to evade and even in case of meeting with success in any scheme of plunder the want of established connexions for the disposing of it would render the benefit derivable from it extremely precarious the consideration of all these difficulties would tend to induce him to resort to honest labour as the only sure means of obtaining a livelihood but taking all the above sources of uncertainty into consideration it will be found that the cases are very few in which banishment can be resorted to as an eligible mode of punishment in what are called state offences it may occasionally be employed with advantage in order to separate the delinquent from his connexions and to remove him from the scene of his factious intrigues in this case however it would be well to leave him the hope of returning as a stimulus to good conduct during his banishment chapter ix of simply restrictive punishments having now considered the several punishments which restrain the faculty of locomotion we proceed to the consideration of those     which restrain the choice of occupations these may be called simply restrictive punishments and consist in a simple prohibition of performing certain acts upon this occasion we may recur to a distinction already explained which exists between restraint and punishment the civil code and police code are full of restraints which are not punishments certain individuals are prohibited from selling poison innkeepers are prohibited from keeping their houses open after a certain hour persons are prohibited from exercising the professions of medicine or of the law without having passed through certain examinations simply restrictive punishments consist in the preventing an individual from enjoying a common right or a right which he possessed before if the prohibition respect a lucrative occupation if for example an innkeeper or a hackneycoachman be deprived of his license the prohibition acts as a pecuniary punishment in its nature very inequable and unfrugal if a man be deprived of the means of earning his subsistence he must still be supported the punishment therefore falls not upon the individual alone but upon others whom it was not intended to affect employments which are not lucrative may be of an agreeable nature their variety is infinite but there is one point in which they all agree and which will render it unnecessary to submit them to a detailed discussion there are none of them or at least scarcely one which by its deprivation furnishes a sufficient portion of evil to enable us to rely upon its effect as respects pleasures the mind of man possesses a happy flexibility one source of amusement being cut off it endeavours to open up another and always succeeds a new habit is easily formed the taste adapts itself to new habits and suits itself to a great variety of situations this ductility of mind this aptitude to accommodate itself to circumstances as they change varies much in different individuals and it is impossible beforehand to judge or even to guess how long an old habit will retain its dominion so that its privation shall continue a real punishment this is not the only objection restrictive laws are very difficult of execution they always require a subsidiary punishment of which the effect is uncertain if you prohibit an individual from gaming drunkenness dancing and music it becomes necessary to appoint an inspector for all these things in all places to see that your prohibition is observed in a word punishments of this kind are subject to this dilemma either the attachment to the object prohibited is very weak or very strong if strong the prohibition will be eluded if weak the object desired will not be obtained in respect of exemplarity they are equally defective the privations they occasion are not of a nature to be generally known or if known to produce a strong effect upon the imagination the misery they produce rankles in the mind but is completely hidden from the public eye these are some of the circumstances which have reduced the employment of these punishments within so narrow a compass they are too uncertain in their effects and too easily eluded to allow of their use as the sanction to a general law it is true that if judges were acquainted with the characters and circumstances of individuals they might avail themselves of them with good effect but this knowledge can scarcely ever be expected this species of punishment is well suited to domestic government there is no pleasure which a parent or teacher cannot employ as a reward by permitting its enjoyment or convert into a source of punishment by restricting its use but though restraints of this nature that is to say prohibition of agreeable occupation do not alone form effective punishments there is one case in which they may be usefully employed in addition to some other punishment analogy recommends such employment of them has an offence been committed at some public exhibition it may be well to prohibit the delinquent from attending such public exhibitions for a time among simply restrictive punishments there is one of which a few examples are found and which has not received a name i have called it banishment from the presence it consists in an obligation imposed upon the offender immediately to leave the place in which he meets with the offended party the simple presence of the one is a signal for the departure of the other if silus the party injured enter a ball or concert room a public assembly or public walk titius is bound instantly to leave the same this punishment appears admirably well suited for cases of personal insult attacks upon honour and calumnies in a word for all crimes which render the presence of the offender particularly disagreeable and mortifying to the party offended in the employment of this punishment care must be taken that power be not given to the party injured to banish the offender from places in which he is carrying on his habitual operations or where his presence may be necessary for the discharge of any particular duty hence it will in many cases be found indispensable to make exceptions in respect of churches courts of justice markets and political assemblies instances in which this mode of punishment has been employed may be found in the decrees     of the french parliaments it will be sufficient to mention one instance a man of the name of aujay having insulted a lady of rank in the most gross manner among other punishments he was ordered under pain of corporal punishment to retire immediately from every place at which this lady might happen to be present in the intrigues of the cabinet may be seen the account of a quarrel between madame de montbazon and the princess de condé in the course of which the former was guilty of very gross insults towards the princess the queen anne of austria ordered that madame montbazon should retire from every place at which the princess was present† under the english law there are various instances in which though not under the name of punishment restrictions are imposed upon certain classes of persons catholics were formerly not allowed to exercise either the profession of the law or that of medicine persons refusing to take the sacrament according to the rites of the church of england were excluded from all public offices such was the law the practice was always otherwise in point of fact a very large proportion of offices civil and military were filled by persons who had never taken the oaths required but who were protected from the penalties to which they would otherwise have been subjected by an annual bill of indemnity in point of right the security thus afforded was a precarious one but the uninterrupted practice of nearly a century left little room for apprehension on the part of the persons interested the restrictions here in question were not designed to operate as punishments they were originally imposed with a view of avoiding the danger which it was apprehended might be incurred by vesting in the hands of persons of certain religious persuasions situations of public trust this at least was the avowed political reason the true cause of the exclusion was however religious animosity they were acts of antipathy but these were not the only motives selfinterest had its share in producing the exclusion exclude one set of persons and you confer a benefit on another set those to whom the right is reserved have to contend with a smaller number of competitors and their prospect of gain is increased these restrictive laws originating in religious hatred were afterwards maintained by injustice the persecution begun by misguided bigotry was persisted in long after the original inducement had been forgotten from the most sordid injustice this is the short history of the persecutions in ireland for the benefit of the protestants the restrictive laws against the catholics were kept in force out of eight millions of inhabitants a selection was made of one million on whom were conferred all offices of power or of profit in this state of things whilst privileges are by the continuance of the persecuting laws placed in the hands of the persecutors the procuring their abolition may be expected to be attended with no small difficulty the true motive—the sordid one—will long be concealed under the mask of religion though it may be said that these restrictions are not designed to operate as punishments and that in the making of this general law no particular individual was aimed at yet there results from it a distinction injurious to the particular class of persons affected by it—necessarily injurious since the continuance of the law can be justified only by supposing them to be dangerous and disloyal such laws form a nucleus around which public prejudice collects and the legislator by acquiescing in these transient jealousies strengthens them and renders them permanent they are the remnants of a disease which has been universal and which after its cure has left behind it deep and lasting scars chapter x of active or laborious punishment active punishment is that which is inflicted on a man by obliging or to use another word compelling him to act in this or that particular way to exert this or that particular species of action there are two kinds of means by which a man may be compelled to act—physical and moral the first applies itself to his body the other to his mind to his faculty of volition the actions which a man may be compelled to perform by physical means are so few and so unprofitable both to the patient and to others as not to be worth taking into the account when the instrument is of the moral kind it is by acting on the volition that it produces its effect the only instrument that is of a nature to act immediately upon the volition is an idea but not every idea—only an idea of pleasure or of pain as about to ensue from the performance or nonperformance of the act which is the object of the volition it cannot be an idea of pleasure which can so act upon the volition as to give birth to an act the performance of which shall be a punishment it must therefore be an idea of pain—of any pain no matter what so it be to appearance greater than the pleasure of abstaining from the performance of the penal act     it is manifest therefore that when a punishment of the laborious kind is appointed another punishment must necessarily be appointed along with it there are therefore in every such case two different punishments at least necessarily concerned one which is the only one directly and originally intended the laborious punishment itself which may be styled the principal or proper punishment the other in case of the former not being submitted to is called in to its assistance and may be styled the subsidiary punishment this subsidiary punishment may be of any kind that in point of quantity is great enough it ought not however to be likewise of the laborious kind since in that case as well as in the case of the principal punishment the will of the patient is necessary to constitute the punishment and to determine the will some incident is necessary that does not depend upon the will it will be necessary therefore to employ such punishments as are purely passive or those restrictive punishments in which the instrument is purely physical in regard to this class of punishments one thing is here to be noted with reference to the instrument in punishments of this kind there is a link or two interposed between the instrument and the pain produced by means of it the instrument first produces the volition that volition produces a correspondent external act and it is that act which is the immediate cause by which the pain here in question is produced this punishment then we see has this remarkable circumstance to distinguish it from other punishments it is produced immediately by the patients own act it is the patient who to avoid a greater punishment inflicts it on himself what then is the sort of act that is calculated to produce pain in the case of active punishment it admits not of any description more particular than this that it is any act whatever that a man has a mind not to do or in other words that on any account whatever is disagreeable to him an occupation is a series of acts of the same kind or tending to the same end an occupation may be disagreeable on a positive or a negative account as being productive in a manner more or less immediate of some positive pain or as debarring from the exercise of some more agreeable occupation considered in itself an occupation may be either painful pleasurable or indifferent but continued beyond a certain time and without interruption such is the constitution of mans nature every occupation whatsoever becomes disagreeable not only so but such as were in the beginning pleasurable become by their continuance more disagreeable than such as were originally indifferent to make the sum of his occupations pleasurable every man must therefore be at liberty to change from one to another according to his taste hence it is that any occupation which for a certain proportion of his time a man is compelled to exercise without the liberty of changing to another becomes disagreeable and in short becomes a punishment active punishments are as various as the occupations in which for the various purposes of life men can have occasion to be employed these being usually inflicted on all offenders indiscriminately have been such as all offenders indiscriminately have been physically qualified to undergo they have consisted commonly in various exertions of muscular force in which there has been little or no dexterity required in the manner of its application in general they have been such as to produce a profit—a collateral benefit in addition to that expected from the punishment as such among the modes of penal labour a very common one has been that of rowing this is an exercise performed chiefly by main strength with very little mixture of skill and that presently attained some vessels of a bulk large enough to bear any sea have been made so as to be put in motion in this manner even without the help of sails this occupation is more unpleasant in itself than that of an ordinary seaman as having less variety besides that the rowers are confined by chains such vessels are called gallies and the rowers galleyslaves this punishment though unknown in england is in use in most of the maritime states of europe and particularly in the mediterranean and adriatic seas in many countries malefactors have been employed in various public works as in the cleansing of harbours† and the streets of towns in making roads building and repairing fortifications and working in mines working in the mines is a punishment employed in russia and in hungary in hungary the mines are of quicksilver and the unwholesome effects of that metal upon a person who is exposed to the effluvia of it for a length of time may be one reason for     employing criminals in that work in preference to other persons beating hemp is the most common employment which delinquents are put to in our workhouses—persons of both sexes being subjected to it without distinction from the nature of the service active punishments may be distinguished into two sorts—specific and indiscriminate i call it specific when it consists in the being obliged to do such and such a particular kind or kinds of work indiscriminate when it consists in the being obliged to do not any kind of work in particular but every kind of work in general which it shall please such or such a person to prescribe if such person take all the profit of the work he is called a master if the profit is received by some other person he is called a keeper or overseer there are cases of a mixed nature in which in certain respects the servitude is indiscriminate as to other respects specific at warsaw before the partition of poland there was a public workhouse in which convicts were confined in ordinary to particular employments determined by the laws or custom of the place to this workhouse however any person who thought proper might apply and upon giving security for their forthcomingness and paying a certain stipulated price for their use a certain number of the convicts were allotted to him to be employed in any piece of work for a given time the services they were employed upon were generally of a rough kind such as digging a ditch or paving a court and a soldier or a party of soldiers according to the number of convicts thus employed was placed over them as a guard this custom was also in use in russia this distinction between specific and indiscriminate servitude may be illustrated by two examples derived from the english law the example of specific punishment is afforded by the statute which directs the employment of certain malefactors on board the hulks in improving the navigation of the thames the statute determines the kind of labour and the subsidiary punishments by which it is to be enforced indiscriminate servitude is part of the punishment inflicted by our laws under the name of transportation this servitude is sometimes limited as to its duration but is without limitation and without restriction in respect of the services which may be required all these kinds of labour whether indiscriminate or specific require as a necessary accompaniment that the individual should be upon that spot where the business is to be done some import imprisonment all of them import restraint upon occupations to wit upon all occupations incompatible with those in which they constrain a man to employ himself the degree of this restraint is in a manner indefinite to lay a man therefore under a particular constraint of any kind is for that time to lay him under an almost universal restraint the clear value then of the pleasure which a man loses by being compelled to any particular occupation is equal to that of the greatest of all the pleasures which had it not been for the compulsion he might have procured for himself upon examining laborious punishment we shall find it to possess the properties to be wished for in a mode of punishment in greater perfection upon the whole than any other single punishment   it is convertible to profit labour is in fact the very source of profit not that after all its power in this way is so extensive as that of pecuniary punishment for from the punishment of one man in this way all the profit that is to be reaped is that which is producible by the labour of one man—a limited and never very ample quantity on the other hand from the punishment of a man in the pecuniary way it may happen that a profit shall be reaped equal to the labour of many hundred men the difference however in favour of this punishment is that money is a casual fund labour one that cannot fail indeed upon the whole though pecuniary punishment be in particular instances capable of being more profitable yet considering how large a proportion of mankind especially of those most liable to commit the most frequent and troublesome kinds of crimes have no other possession worth estimating than their labour laborious punishment if managed as it might and ought to be may perhaps be deemed the most profitable upon the whole   in point of frugality to the state laborious punishment considered by itself is as little liable to objection as any other can be i say considered by itself for when coupled with imprisonment as it can hardly but be in the case of public servitude it is attended with those expenses to the public which have been noticed under the article of imprisonment these however are not to be charged to the account of the laborious part of the punishment so that the advantage which laborious punishment has on this score over simple imprisonment is quite a   0 clear one but the former of these two punishments though separable from the latter in idea is not separable in practice imprisonment may be made to subsist without labour but forced labour cannot be made to subsist without imprisonment the advantage then which servitude has in this respect when compared with imprisonment ceases when compared with any other mode of punishment however the profit gained by the one part is enough under good management to do more than balance the expense occasioned by the other so that upon the whole it has the advantage in point of economy over any other mode of punishment but pecuniary   it seems to stand equally clear of objection in point of equability as to the restraint it involves it accommodates itself of itself to each mans circumstances for with respect to each man it has the effect of restraining him from following those occupations whatever they may be which are to him most pleasurable the positive servitude itself will be apt to sit heavier on one man than another a man who has not been used to any kind of labour will suffer a good deal more for some time at least than one who has been used to labour though of a different kind or degree from that in question but this inconvenience may be pretty well obviated by a proper attention to the circumstances of individuals   in point of variability though it is not perfect throughout yet it is perfect as far as it goes in a very low degree it is not capable of subsisting on account of the infamy it involves at least in a country governed by european manners one of the most odious acts of the reign of the emperor joseph ii was the sentencing persons of high rank to labour in the public works the protestants of france considered the condemnation of their religious ministers to the galleys as a personal insult done to themselves in this respect then it falls short of pecuniary punishment after that exception it is capable of being varied to the utmost nicety being variable as well in respect of intensity as of duration   in point of exemplarity it has no peculiar advantage neither is it subject to any disadvantage symbols of suffering it has none belonging to itself for the circumstance which distinguishes penal servitude from voluntary labour is but an internal circumstance—the idea of compulsion operating on the patients mind the symbols however that belong necessarily to the punishment it is naturally combined with—i mean imprisonment—apply to it of course and the means of characterizing the condition of the patient by some peculiarity of dress are so obvious that these may be looked upon as symbols naturally connected with it   in point of subserviency to reformation it is superior to any other punishment except that mode of imprisonment which we have already insisted on as being peculiarly adapted to this purpose next to the keeping of malefactors asunder is the finding them employment while they are together the work they are engaged in confines their attention in some measure the business of the present moment is enough to occupy their thoughts they are not stimulated by the impulse of ennui to look out for those topics of discourse which tend in the manner that has been already explained to fructify the seeds of corruption in their minds they are not obliged in search of aliment for speculation to send back their memory into the field of past adventures or to set their invention in quest of future projects this kind of discipline does not indeed like the other pluck up corruption by the roots it tends however to check the growth of it and render the propensity to it less powerful another circumstance relative to the nature of this discipline contributes to check the progress of corruption to insure the performance of their tasks it is necessary that the workmen should be under the eye of overseers the presence of these will naturally be a check to them and restrain them from engaging in any criminal topics of discourse so much for the tendency which this punishment has to keep men from growing worse it has besides this a positive tendency to make them better and this tendency is more obvious and less liable to accident than the other there is a tendency as has been already observed in mans nature to reconcile and accommodate itself to every condition in which it happens to be placed such is the force of habit few occupations are so irksome that habit will not in time make them sit tolerably easy if labour then even though forced will in time lose much of its hardship how much easier will it become when the duration and the mode are in some measure regulated by the will of the labourer himself when the bitter ideas of infamy and compulsion are removed and the idea of gain is brought in to sweeten the employment in a word when the labourer is left to work at liberty and by choice   this mode of punishment is not altogether destitute of analogy at least of the verbal kind to that class of crimes which are the most frequent and for which an efficacious punishment is most wanted—crimes i mean that result from a principle of rapacity or of sloth the slothful man is constrained to work the vagabond is confined to a particular     spot the more opposite the restraint thus imposed is to the natural inclination of the patient the more effectually will he be deterred from indulging his vicious propensities by the prospect of the punishment that awaits him   with regard to the popularity of this species of punishment in this country the prejudices of the people are not quite so favourable to it as could be wished impatient spirits too easily kindled with the fire of independence have a word for it which presents an idea singularly obnoxious to a people who pride themselves so much upon their freedom this word is slavery slavery they say is a punishment too degrading for an englishman even in ruins this prejudice may be confuted by observing— st that public servitude is a different thing from slavery  dly that if it were not this would be no reason for dismissing this species of punishment without examination if then upon examination it is found not to be possessed in a requisite degree of the properties to be wished for in a mode of punishment that and not the name it happens to be called by is a reason for its rejection if it does possess them it is not any name that can be given to it that can change its nature but these observations have been more fully insisted on in the chapter on popularity having thus spoken of this species of punishment in general let us stop a moment to consider the different kinds of labour which ought to be preferred the principal distinction is that of public and private labour in public works the infamy of their publicity tends to render the individuals more depraved than the habit of working tends to reform them at berne there are two classes of forced labourers—the one employed in cleaning the streets and in other public works the others employed in the interior of the prison the latter when set at liberty rarely fall again into the hands of justice the former are no sooner set at liberty than they are guilty of new crimes this difference is accounted for at berne by the indifference to shame they contract in a service the infamy of which is renewed day by day it is probable that after the notoriety of this disgrace nobody in the country would like to hold communication with or to employ them the rough and painful kinds of labour which are ordinarily selected for this kind of punishment do not generally seem suitable it is difficult to measure the powers of individuals or to distinguish real from simulated weakness subsidiary punishments must be proportioned to the difficulty of the labour and to the indisposition to perform it the authority with which an inspector must be armed is liable to great abuses to rely upon his pity or even upon his justice in an employment which hardens the heart betrays an ignorance of human nature so soon as it becomes necessary to inflict corporal punishment the individual who is charged with its execution will become degraded in his own opinion and he will revenge himself by the abuse of his authority nam nil asperius humili qui surgit in altum labours which require great efforts ought to be performed by free labourers the labour obtained by the force of fear is never equal to that which is obtained by the hope of reward constrained labour is always inferior to voluntary labour not only because the slave is interested in concealing his powers but also because he wants that energy of soul upon which muscular strength so much depends it would be a curious calculation to estimate how much is lost from this cause in those states where the greater portion of labour is performed by slaves it would tend greatly to prove that their gradual emancipation would be a noble and beneficial measure labour in mines except in particular circumstances is little suitable for malefactors partly for the reason above given and partly from the danger of degrading this occupation the ideas of crime and shame will soon be associated with it miner and criminal would soon become synonymous this would not be productive of inconvenience if the number of malefactors were sufficient for working the mines but if the contrary is the case there might be a lack of workmen from the aversion inspired towards this kind of labour in those who used to exercise it voluntarily or who are at liberty to choose respecting it chapter xi capital punishment capital punishment may be distinguished into— st simple  d afflictive i call it simple when if any bodily pain be produced no greater degree of it is produced than what is necessary to produce death i call it afflictive when any degree of pain is produced more than what is necessary for that purpose it will not be necessary upon the present occasion to attempt to give an exhaustive view of all the possible modes by which death might be produced without occasioning any or the least possible quantity of collateral suffering the task would be almost an endless one and when accomplished the only use to which it could be applied would be that of affording an opportunity of selecting out of the catalogue the mode that seemed to     possess the desired property in the greatest perfection which may readily be done without any such process the mode in use in england is far from being the best that could be devised in strangulation by suspension the weight of the body alone is seldom sufficient to produce an immediate and entire obstruction of respiration the patient when left to himself struggles for some time hence it is not uncommon for the executioner in order to shorten his sufferings to add his own weight to that of the criminal strangling by the bowstring may to some perhaps appear a severer mode of execution partly from the prejudice against every usage of despotic governments partly by the greater activity exerted by the executioners in this case than in the other the fact however is that it is much less painful than the other for it is certainly much more expeditious by this means the force is applied directly in the direction which it must take to effect the obstruction required in the other case the force is applied only obliquely because the force of two men pulling in that manner is greater than the weight of one man it is not long however even in hanging before a stop is put to sense as is well enough known from the accounts of many persons who have survived the operation this probably is the case a good while before the convulsive strugglings are at an end so that in appearance the patient suffers more than he does in reality with respect to beheading there are reasons for supposing that the stop put to sensation is not immediate a portion of sensibility may still be kept up in the spinal marrow a considerable time after it is separated from the brain it is so at least according to all appearance for different lengths of time in different animals and insects which continue to move after their heads are separated from their bodies §   afflictive capital punishment to exhaust this part of the subject it would be necessary to make a catalogue of every various punishment of this description of which in practice there has been any example adding to them such others as the imagination could be made to supply but the ungrateful task performed of what use would it be we shall the more willingly refrain from any such labour as in the more modern european codes these punishments have been altogether discarded and in those in which they have not been formally abolished they have long fallen into desuetude let us rejoice in these improvements there are few opportunities in which the philosopher can offer to the governors of the world more just or more honourable congratulations the importance of the subject however will not admit of its being passed over in perfect silence the system of jurisprudence in question has been too long established it has had too many apologists and has had for its supporters too many great names to allow of its being altogether omitted in a work expressly treating on the subject of punishment it may besides be of use to show that reason concurs with humanity in the condemning punishments of this description not merely as being useless but as producing effects contrary to the intention of the legislator if the particular nature of the several species of punishments of this description be examined as well those that have for a long time past been abolished such as crucifixion and exposure to wild beasts as those that have been in use in various parts of modern europe such as burning empaling tearing to pieces and breaking on the wheel it will be found in all of them that the most afflictive part consists in their duration but this circumstance is not of a nature to produce the beneficial effect that may have been expected from it when any particular species of punishment is denounced that part of it which takes the strongest hold of the imagination is its intensity its duration makes a much more feeble impression a slight apparent addition of organical suffering made to the ordinary mode of inflicting the punishment of death produces a strong effect upon the mind the idea of the duration of its pains is almost wholly absorbed by the terrors of the principal part of the punishment in the legal description of a punishment its duration is seldom distinctly brought to view it is not mentioned because in itself it is naturally uncertain it depends partly upon the physical strength of the patient and partly upon various other accidental circumstances to this remarkable and important feature of this species of punishment there is no means by which the attention can be drawn and fixed upon it upon those who reflect it produces no impression upon those who do not reflect it is altogether lost it is true that the duration of any particular punishment might be fixed by law the number of hours or minutes might be determined which should be employed in performing the several prescribed manipulations this obviously would be a mode of fixing the attention upon this particular feature of the punishment but even this mode perfect as it may appear to be would be found very inadequate to produce the desired effect by the help of pictures the intensity of any particular species of punishment may be more or less faithfully represented but to represent its duration is impossible the flames     the rack and all the engines of torture together with the convulsive throes of the halfexpiring and wretched sufferer may be depicted but time cannot a punishment that is to be made to last for two hours will not appear different from a punishment that is to last only a quarter of an hour the deficiencies of art may to a certain degree be compensated for by the imagination but even then the reality will be left far behind it is true that upon bystanders the duration of the punishment is calculated to make a strong impression but even upon them after a certain time the prolongation loses its effect and gives place to a feeling directly opposite to that which it is desirable to produce—sentiments of pity and sympathy for the sufferer will succeed the heart of the spectator will revolt at the scene he witnesses and the cry of suffering humanity will be heard the physical suffering will not be confined to the offender the spectators will partake of it the most melancholy accidents swoonings and dangerous convulsions will be the accompaniments of these tragic exhibitions these sanguinary executions and the terrific accounts that are spread concerning them are the real causes of that deeprooted antipathy that is felt against the laws and those by whom they are administered—an antipathy which tends to multiply offences by favouring the impunity of the guilty the only reason that can be given by any government that persists in continuing to employ a mode of punishing so highly penal is that the habitual condition of the people is so wretched that they are incapable of being restrained by a more lenient kind of punishment will it be said that crimes are more frequent in countries in which punishments such as those in question are unknown the contrary is the fact it is under such laws that the most ferocious robbers are found and this is readily accounted for the fate with which they are threatened hardens them to the feelings of others as well as their own they are converted into the most bitter enemies and every barbarity they inflict is considered as a sort of reprisal upon this subject as upon so many others montaigne was far beyond the age in which he lived all beyond simple death he says appears to me to be cruelty the legislator ought not to expect that the offender that is not to be deterred by the apprehension of death and by being beheaded and hanged will be more effectually deterred by the dread of being exposed to a slow fire or the rack and i do not know indeed but that he may be rendered desperate by the french constituent assembly afflictive punishments were abolished in the code napoléon beheading is the mode prescribed for inflicting the punishment of death and it is only in the case of parricide and of attempts made upon the life of the sovereign that to the simple punishment of death the characteristic afflictive punishment of cutting off the hand of the offender is added in this country the only crime for which afflictive punishment is in use is that of high treason the judgment in high treason consists of seven different operations of the afflictive kind   dragging at a horses tail along the streets from the prison to the place of execution   hanging by the neck yet not so as entirely to destroy life   plucking out and burning of the entrails while the patient is yet alive   beheading   quartering   exposure of the head and quarters in such places as the king directs this mode of punishment is not now in use in favour of nobility the judgment has been usually changed into beheading in favour of the lower classes into hanging i wish that upon this part of our subject we could end here but unfortunately there remains to be mentioned an afflictive mode of punishment most excruciating and more hideous than any of which we have hitherto spoken and which is still in use it is not in europe that it is employed but in european colonies—in our own west india islands the delinquent is suspended from a post by means of a hook inserted under his shoulder or under his breast bone in this manner the sufferer is prevented from doing anything to assist himself and all persons are prohibited under severe penalties from relieving him he remains in this situation exposed to the scorching heat of the day where the sun is almost vertical and the atmosphere almost without a cloud and to the chilling dews of the night his lacerated flesh attracts a multitude of insects which increase his torments and under the fever produced by these complicated sufferings joined to hunger and thirst all raging in the most intense degree he gradually expires when we reflect on this complication of sufferings their intensity surpasses everything that the imagination can figure to itself and consider that their duration continues not merely for many hours but for many days it will be found to be by far the most severe punishment ever yet devised by the ingenuity of man the persons to whom this punishment has been hitherto appropriated are negro slaves and their crime what is termed rebellion because they are the weakest but which if     they were the strongest would be called an act of selfdefence the constitutions of these people are to their misfortune in certain respects so much harder than ours that many of them are said to have lingered ten or twelve days under these frightful torments it is said that this punishment is nothing more than is necessary for restraining that people and keeping them in their servile state for that the general tenor of their lives is such a scene of misery that simple death would be generally a relief and a death less excruciating would scarce operate as a restraint this may perhaps be true it is certain that a punishment to have any effect upon man must bear a certain ratio to the mean state of his way of living in respect of sufferings and enjoyments but one cannot well help observing where this leads the number of slaves in these colonies is to that of freemen as about six to one there may be about three hundred thousand blacks and fifty thousand whites here there are three hundred thousand persons kept in a way of life that upon the whole appears to them worse than death and this for the sake of keeping fifty thousand persons in a way of life not remarkably more happy than that which upon an average the same number of persons would be in where there was no slavery on the contrary it is found that men in general are fond when they have the opportunity of changing that scene for this on the other hand it is not to be disputed that sugar and coffee and other delicacies which are the growth of those islands add considerably to the enjoyments of the people here in europe but taking all these circumstances into consideration if they are only to be obtained by keeping three hundred thousand men in a state in which they cannot be kept but by the terror of such executions are there any considerations of luxury or enjoyment that can counterbalance such evils at the same time what admits of very little doubt is that the defenders of these punishments in order to justify them exaggerate the miseries of slavery and the little value set by the slaves upon life if they were really reduced to such a state of misery as to render necessary laws so atrocious even such laws would be insufficient for their restraint having nothing to lose they would be regardless of all consequences they would be engaged in perpetual insurrections and massacres the state of desperation to which they would be reduced would daily produce the most frightful disorders but if existence is not to them a matter of indifference the only pretence that there is in favour of these laws falls to the ground let the colonists reflect upon this if such a code be necessary the colonies are a disgrace and an outrage on humanity if not necessary these laws are a disgrace to the colonists themselves chapter xii capital punishment examined in making this examination the following plan will be pursued the advantageous properties of capital punishment will in the first place be considered we shall afterwards proceed to examine its disadvantageous properties we shall in the last place consider the collateral ill effects resulting from this mode of punishment effects more remote and less obvious but sometimes more important than those which are more immediate and striking the task thus undertaken would be an extremely ungrateful and barren one were it not that the course of the examination will lead us to make a comparison between this and other modes of punishment and thus to ascertain which is entitled to the preference on the subject of punishment the same rule ought in this respect to be observed as on the subject of taxes to complain of any particular tax as being an injudicious one is to sow the seeds of discontent and nothing more to be really useful this in itself mischievous discovery should be accompanied by the indication of another tax which will prove equally productive with less inconvenience §   advantageous properties of the punishment of death   the most remarkable feature in the punishment of death and that which it possesses in the greatest perfection is the taking from the offender the power of doing further injury whatever is apprehended either from the force or cunning of the criminal at once vanishes away society is in a prompt and complete manner delivered from all alarm   it is analogous to the offence in the case of murder but there its analogy terminates   it is popular in respect of that same crime and in that alone   it is exemplary in a higher degree perhaps than any other species of punishment and in countries in which it is sparingly employed an execution makes a deep and lasting impression it was the opinion of beccaria that the impression made by any particular punishment was in proportion to its duration and not to its intensity our sensibility he observes is more readily and permanently affected by slight but reiterated attacks than by a violent but transient affection for this     reason the putting an offender to death forms a less effectual check to the commission of crimes than the spectacle of a man kept in a state of confinement and employed in hard labour to make some reparation by his exertions for the injury he has inflicted on society notwithstanding such respectable authority i am apt to think the contrary is the case this opinion is founded principally on two observations   death in general is regarded by most men as the greatest of all evils and they are willing to submit to any other suffering whatever in order to avoid it   death considered as a punishment is almost universally reckoned too severe and men plead as a measure of mercy for the substitution of any other punishment in lieu of it in respect to duration the suffering is next to nothing it must therefore i think be some confused and exaggerated notion of the intensity of the pain of death especially of a violent death that renders the idea of it so formidable it is not without reason however that with respect to the higher class of offenders m beccaria considers a punishment of the laborious kind moderate we must suppose in its degree will make a stronger impression than the most excruciating kind of death that can be devised but for the generality of men among those who are attached to life by the ties of reputation affection enjoyment hope capital punishment appears to be more exemplary than any other   though the apparent suffering in the punishment of death is at the highest pitch the real suffering is perhaps less than in the larger portion of afflictive punishments in addition to their duration they leave after them a train of evils which injure the constitution of the patient and render the remainder of his life a complication of sufferings in the punishment of death the suffering is momentary it is a negation of all sensation when the last moment only is considered penal death is often more gentle than natural death and so far from being an evil presents a balance of good the suffering endured must be sought for in some anterior period the suffering consists in apprehension this apprehension commences from the moment the delinquent has committed the crime it is redoubled when he is apprehended it increases at every stage of the process which renders his condemnation more certain and is at its height in the interval between sentence and execution the more solid argument in favour of the punishment of death results from the combined force of the above considerations on the one hand it is to men in general of all punishment of the greatest apparent magnitude the most impressive and the most exemplary and on the other hand to the wretched class of beings that furnish the most atrocious criminals it is less rigorous than it appears to be it puts a speedy termination to an uneasy unhappy dishonoured existence stript of all true worth—heu heu quam male est extra legem viventibus† §   desirable penal qualities which are wanting in capital punishment   the punishment of death is not convertible to profit it cannot be applied to the purpose of compensation in so far as compensation might be derived from the labour of the delinquent the very source of the compensation is destroyed   in point of frugality it is preeminently defective so far from being convertible to profit to the community it produces a certain loss both in point of wealth and strength in point of wealth a man chosen at random is worth to the public that portion of the whole annual income of the state which results from its division by the number of persons of which it consists the same mode of calculation will determine the loss in respect of strength but the value of a man who has been proved guilty of some one or other of those crimes for which capital punishment is denounced is not equal to that of a man taken at random of those by whom a punishment of this sort is incurred nine out of ten have divested themselves of all habits of regular industry they are the drones of the hive and with respect to them death is therefore not an ineligible mode of punishment except in comparison with confinement and hard labour by which there is a chance of their being reformed and rendered of some use to society   equability is another point and that a most important one in which this punishment is eminently deficient to a person taken at random it is upon an average a very heavy punishment though still subject to considerable variation but to a person taken out of the class of firstrate delinquents it is liable to still greater variation to some it is as great as to a person taken at random but to many it is next to nothing death is the absence of all pleasures indeed but at the same time of all pains when a person feels himself under temptation to commit a crime punishable with death his determination to commit it or not to commit it is the result of the following calculation he ranges on one side the clear portion of happiness he thinks himself likely to enjoy in case of his abstaining on the other he places the clear happiness he thinks     himself likely to enjoy in case of his committing the crime taking into the account the chance there appears to him to be that the punishment threatened will abridge the duration of that happiness now then if in the former case there appear to be no clear happiness likely to accrue to him much more if there appear to be a clear portion of unhappiness in other words if the clear portion of happiness likely to befal him appear to be equal to 0 or much more if it appear to be negative the pleasure that constitutes the profit of the crime will act upon him with a force that has nothing to oppose it the probability of seeing it brought to an abrupt period by death will subtract more or less from the balance but at any rate there will be a balance now this is always the case with a multitude of malefactors rendered averse to labour by natural indolence or disuse or hurried away by the tide of some impetuous passion they do look upon the pleasures to be obtained by honest industry as not worth living for when put in competition with the pains or they look upon life as not worth keeping without some pleasure or pleasures which to persons in their situation are not attainable but by a crime i do not say that this calculation is made with all the formality with which i have represented it i do not say that in casting up the sum of pains on the one side and pleasures on the other exact care is always used to take every item into the account but however well or ill the calculation is made else a man could not act as he is supposed to do now then in all these cases which unhappily are but too frequent it is plain the punishment of death can be of no use it may be said no more would any other punishment for any other punishment to answer its purpose must have the effect of deterring or otherwise disabling the person in question from committing the like crimes in future if then he is thus deterred or disabled he is reduced to a situation in which by the supposition death was to him an event desirable upon the whole being then in his power he will produce it the conclusion however is not necessary there are several reasons why the same impulse which is strong enough to dispose a man to meet death at the hands of justice should not be strong enough to dispose him to bring on himself that event with his own hand in the first place the infliction of it as a punishment is an event by no means certain it is in itself uncertain and the passion he is supposed to be influenced by withdrawing his attention from the chances that are in favour of its happening makes it look still more uncertain in the next place although it were certain it is at any rate distant and the mortification he undergoes from the not possessing the object of his passion is present thirdly death is attended with much more pain when a man has to inflict it on himself with his own hand than when all he does is simply to put himself in a situation in which it will be inflicted on him by the hands of another or by the operation of some physical cause to put himself in such a situation requires but a single and sudden volition and perhaps but a single act in consequence during the performance of which he may keep his eyes shut as it were against the prospect of the pain to which he is about to subject himself the moment of its arrival is at an uncertain distance the reverse is the case where a man is to die by his own hand his resolution must be supported during the whole period of time that is necessary to bring about the event the manner is foreseen and the time immediate it may be necessary that even after a part of the pain has been incurred the resolution should go on and support itself while it prompts him to add further pain before the purpose is accomplished accordingly when people are resolved upon death it is common for them when they have an opportunity to choose to die rather by the hand of another than by their own thus saul chose to die by the hand of his armourbearer tiberius gracchus by that of his freeman so again the emperor nero by one of his minions fourthly when a man is prompted to seek relief in death it is not so much by the sudden vehemence of some tempestuous passion as by a close persuasion that the miseries of his life are likely to be greater than the enjoyments and in consequence when the resolution is once taken to rest satisfied without carrying it immediately into effect for there is not a more universal principle of human conduct than that which leads a man to satisfy himself for awhile with the power without proceeding immediately perhaps without proceeding ever to the act it is the same feeling which so often turns the voluptuous man to a miser now this is likely enough to be the condition of those who instead of death may have been sentenced to another punishment they defer the execution of their design from hour to hour—sometimes for want of means sometimes for want of inclination till at last some incident happens that puts in their heads a train of thought which in the end diverts them from their resolution in the mental as well as in the material part of the human frame there is happily a strong     disposition to accommodate itself by degrees to the pressure of forced and calamitous situations when a great artery is cut or otherwise disabled the circumjacent smaller ones will stretch and take upon themselves the whole duty of conveying to the part affected the necessary supplies loss of sight improves the faculty of feeling a left hand learns to perform the offices of the right or even the feet of both an inferior part of the alimentary canal has learned to perform the office and even to assume the texture of the stomach the mind is endowed with no less elasticity and docility in accommodating itself to situations which at first sight appeared intolerable in all sufferings there are occasional remissions which in virtue of the contrast are converted into pleasure how many instances are there of men who having suddenly fallen from the very pinnacle of grandeur into the gulphs of misery have when the old sources of enjoyment were irrecoverably dry gradually detached their minds from all recollections of their customary enjoyments and created for themselves fresh sources of happiness the comte de lauzuns spider the strawworks of the bicêtre the skilfully wrought pieces of carved work made by the french prisoners not to mention others are sufficient illustrations of this remark variability is a point of excellence in which the punishment of death is more deficient than in any other it subsists only in one degree the quantity of evil can neither be increased nor lessened it is peculiarly defective in the case of the greater part of the most malignant and formidable species of malefactors—that of professed robbers and highwaymen   the punishment of death† is not remissible other species of afflictive punishments it is true are exposed to the same objection but though irremissible they are not irreparable for death there is no remedy no man how little soever he may have attended to criminal procedure but must have been struck at the very slight circumstances upon which the life of a man may depend and who does not recollect instances in which a man has been indebted for his safety to the occurrence of some unlookedfor accident which has brought his innocence to light the risk incurred is doubtless greater under some systems of jurisprudence than under others those which allow the torture to supply the insufficiency of evidence derived from other sources those in which the proceedings are not public are if the expression may be used surrounded with precipices but it may be said is there or could there be devised any system of penal procedure which could insure the judge from being misled by false evidence or the fallibility of his own judgment no absolute security in this branch of science is a point which though it can never be attained may be much more nearly approached than it has hitherto been judges will continue fallible witnesses to depose falsehood or to be deceived whatever number may depose to the same fact the existence of that fact is not rendered certain as to circumstantial evidence that which is deemed incapable of explanation but by supposing the existence of the crime may be the effect of chance or of arrangements made with the view of producing deception the only sort of evidence that appears entitled to perfect conviction is the voluntary confession of the crime by the party accused but this is not frequently made and does not produce absolute certainty since     instances have not been wanting as in the case of witchcraft in which individuals have acknowledged themselves guilty when the pretended crime was impossible these are not purely imaginary apprehensions drawn from the region of possibility the criminal records of every country afford various instances of these melancholy errors and these instances which by the concurrence of a number of extraordinary events have attained notoriety cannot fail to excite a suspicion that though unknown many other innocent victims may have perished it must not be forgotten either that the cases in which the word evidence is most apt to be employed are not unfrequently those in which the testimony adduced is exposed to most suspicion when the pretended crime is among the number of those that produce antipathy towards the offender or which excite against him a party feeling the witnesses almost unconsciously act as accusers they are the echoes of the public clamour the fermentation goes on increasing and all doubt is laid aside it was a concurrence of such circumstances which seduced first the people and then the judges in the melancholy affair of calas these melancholy cases in which the most violent presumptions which fall little short of absolute certainty are accumulated against an individual whose innocence is afterwards recognised carry with them their own excuse they are the cruel effects of chance and do not altogether destroy public confidence to produce any such effect we must be able to detect in such erroneous decisions proofs of temerity ignorance and precipitation of an obstinate and blind adherence to vicious forms and of those determined prejudices which the very situation of judge is apt to generate a judge whose business it is to deal with human nature in its worst forms having daily before his eyes the false pretences and mendacity to which the guilty have recourse perpetually contriving expedients for unvailing imposture gradually ceases to believe in the innocence of those accused and by anticipation expects to find a criminal using all his arts to deceive him that it is the character of all judges to be actuated by these prejudices i am far from thinking but when the propriety of arming men with the power of indicting the punishment of death is the question under consideration it ought not to be forgotten before putting into their hands the fatal weapon that they are not exempted from the weaknesses of humanity that their wisdom is not increased neither are they rendered infallible by thus arming them the danger attending the use of capital punishment appears in a more striking point of view when we reflect on the use that may be made of it by men in power to gratify their passions by means of a judge easily intimidated or corrupted in such cases the iniquity covered with the robe of justice may escape if not all suspicion at least the possibility of proof capital punishment too affords to the prosecutor as well as to the judge an advantage that in all other modes is wanting—i mean greater security against detection—by stifling by death all danger of discovery arising from the delinquent at least while he lives to whatever state of misery he may be reduced the oppressed may meet with some fortunate event by which his innocence may be proved and he may become his own avenger a judicial assassination justified in the eyes of the public by a false accusation with almost complete certainty assures the triumph of those who have been guilty of it in a crime of an inferior degree they would have had everything to fear but the death of the victim seals their security if we reflect on those very unfrequent occurrences but which may at any time recur—those periods at which the government degenerates into anarchy and tyranny we shall find that the punishment of death established by law is a weapon ready prepared which is more susceptible of abuse than any other mode of punishment a tyrannical government it is true may always reestablish this mode of punishment after it has been abolished by the legislature but the introducing what would then become an innovation would not be unattended with difficulty the violence of which it was to be the precursor would be too much exposed the tocsin would be sounded tyranny is much more at its ease when exercised under the sanction of law when there is no appearance of any departure from the ordinary course of justice and when it finds the minds of people already reconciled and accustomed to this mode of punishment the duke of alba ferocious as he was would not have dared to sacrifice so many thousand victims in the low countries if it had not been a commonly received opinion that heresy was a crime which merited the punishment of death biren not less cruel than the duke of alba—biren who peopled the deserts of siberia with exiles caused them previously to be mutilated that being the most severe punishment that was in use in that country—he very rarely ventured to punish them capitally because capital punishment was not in use so little do even the most arbitrary despots dare to violate established customs hence we may draw a strong reason for seizing upon periods of tranquillity for destroying these dangerous instruments which though no longer dreaded when covered with rust are with such facility brought into use again when passion invites their employment     the objection arising from the irremissibility of the punishment of death applies to all cases and can be removed only by its complete abolition upon this occasion it is necessary to bear in mind that there are two branches of security for each of which it is necessary to make provision security against the errors and corruptions in judicial procedure and security against crimes if the latter were not to be attained but at the expense of the former there would be no room for hesitation with respect to crimes from whom is it that the terror is felt from every person that is capable of committing a crime that is to say from all men and at all times with respect to the errors and corruptions of justice these are the exceptions the accidental and rare occurrences this punishment is far from being popular and it becomes less and less so every day in proportion as mankind become more enlightened and their manners more softened the people flock in crowds to an execution but this eagerness which at first might appear so disgraceful to humanity does not proceed from the pleasure expected from the sight of men in the agonies of death it arises from the pleasure of having the passions strongly excited by a tragic scene there is however one case in which it does seem to be popular and that in a very high degree i mean the case of murder the attachment seems to be grounded partly on the fondness for analogy partly on the principle of vengeance and partly perhaps by the fear which the character of the criminal is apt to inspire blood it is said will have blood and the imagination is flattered with the notion of the similarity of the suffering produced by the punishment with that inflicted by the criminal in other cases the punishment of death is unpopular and this unpopularity produces different dispositions all equally contrary to the ends of justice a disposition on the part of the individuals injured not to prosecute the offenders for fear of bringing them to the scaffold a disposition on the part of the public to favour their escape a disposition on the part of the witnesses to withhold their testimony or to weaken its effect a disposition on the part of the judges to allow of a merciful prevarication in favour of the accused and all these antilegal dispositions render the execution of the laws uncertain without referring to that loss of respect which follows upon its being considered meritorious to prevent their execution §   recapitulation and comparison of the punishment of death with those punishments which may be substituted for it the punishment of death it has been observed possesses four desirable properties—   it is in one case analogous to the offence   in that same case it is popular   it is in the highest degree efficacious in preventing further mischief from the same source   it is exemplary producing a more lively impression than any other mode of punishment the two first of these properties exist in the case of capital punishment when applied to murder and with reference to that species of offence alone are they sufficient reasons for presevering in its use certainly not each of them separately considered is of very little importance analogy is a very good recommendation but not a good justification if in other respects any particular mode of punishment be eligible analogy is an additional advantage if in other respects it be ineligible analogy alone is not a sufficient recommendation the value of this property amounts to very little because even in the case of murder other punishments may be devised the analogy of which will be sufficiently striking in respect also of popularity the same observations apply to this mode of punishment every other mode of punishment that is seen to be equally or more efficacious will become equally or more popular the approbation of the multitude will naturally be in proportion to the efficacy of the punishment the third reason that it is efficacious in preventing further mischief from the same source is somewhat more specious but not better founded it has been asserted that in the crime of murder it is absolutely necessary that there is no other means of averting the danger threatened from that class of malefactors this assertion is however extremely exaggerated its groundlessness may be seen in the case of the most dangerous species of homicide—assassination for lucre a crime proceeding from a disposition which puts indiscriminately the life of every man into immediate jeopardy even these malefactors are not so dangerous nor so difficult to manage as madmen because the former will commit homicide only at the time that there is something to be gained by it and that it can be perpetrated with a probability of safety the mischief to be apprehended from madmen is not narrowed by either of these circumstances yet it is never thought necessary that madmen should be put to death they are not put to death they are only kept in confinement and that confinement is found effectually to answer the purpose in fine i can see but one case in which it can be necessary and that only occasionally in the case alleged for this purpose by m beccaria—the case of rebellion or other offence against government of a rebellious tendency   0 when by destroying the chief you may destroy the faction where discontent has spread itself widely through a community it may happen that imprisonment will not answer the purpose of safe custody the keepers may be won over to the insurgent party or if not won over they may be overpowered they may be won over by considerations of a conscientious nature which is a danger almost peculiar to this case or they may be won over by considerations of a lucrative nature which danger is greater in this case than in any other since party projects may be carried on by a common purse what however ought not to be lost sight of in the case of offences of a political nature is that if by the punishment of death one dangerous enemy is exterminated the consequence of it may be the making an opening for a more formidable successor look said the executioner to an aged irishman showing him the bleeding head of a man just executed for rebellion—look at the head of your son my son replied he has more than one head it would be well for the legislator before he appoints capital punishment even in this case to reflect on this instructive lesson the fourth reason is the strongest the punishment of death is exemplary preeminently exemplary no other punishment makes so strong an impression this assertion as has been already noticed is true with respect to the majority of mankind it is not true with respect to the greatest criminals it appears however to me that the contemplation of perpetual imprisonment accompanied with hard labour and occasional solitary confinement would produce a deeper impression on the minds of persons in whom it is more eminently desirable that that impression should be produced than even death itself we have already observed that to them life does not offer the same attractions as it does to persons of innocent and industrious habits their very profession leads them continually to put their existence in jeopardy and intemperance which is almost natural to them inflames their brutal and uncalculating courage all the circumstances that render death less formidable to them render laborious restraint proportionably more irksome the more their habitual state of existence is independent wandering and hostile to steady and laborious industry the more they will be terrified by a state of passive submission and of laborious confinement a mode of life in the highest degree repugnant to their natural inclinations giving to each of these circumstances its due weight the result appears to be that the prodigal use made by legislators of the punishment of death has been occasioned more by erroneous judgments arising from the situation in which they are placed with respect to the other classes of the community than from any blameable cause those who make laws belong to the highest classes of the community among whom death is considered as a great evil and an ignominious death as the greatest of evils let it be confined to that class if it were practicable the effect aimed at might be produced but it shows a total want of judgment and reflection to apply it to a degraded and wretched class of men who do not set the same value upon life to whom indigence and hard labour is more formidable than death and the habitual infamy of whose lives renders them insensible to the infamy of the punishment if in spite of these reasons which appear to be conclusive it be determined to preserve the punishment of death in consideration of the effects it produces in terrorum it ought to be confined to offences which in the highest degree shock the public feeling—for murders accompanied with circumstances of aggravation and particularly when their effect may be the destruction of numbers and in these cases expedients by which it may be made to assume the most tragic appearance may be safely resorted to in the greatest extent possible without having recourse to complicated torments §   collateral evil effects of the frequent use of the punishment of death the punishment of death when applied to the punishment of offences in opposition to public opinion far from preventing offences tends to increase them by the hope of impunity this proposition may appear paradoxical but the paradox vanishes when we consider the different effects produced by the unpopularity of the punishment of death in the first place it relaxes prosecution in criminal matters and in the next place foments three vicious principles—  it makes perjury appear meritorious by founding it on humanity   it produces contempt for the laws by rendering it notorious that they are not executed   it renders convictions arbitrary and pardons necessary the relaxation of criminal procedure results from a series of transgressions on the part of the different public functionaries whose concurrence is necessary to the execution of the laws each one alters the part allotted to him that he may weaken or break the legal chain by which he is bound and substitute his own will for that of the legislator but all these causes of uncertainty in criminal procedure are so many encouragements to malefactors     book iii of privative punishments or forfeitures chapter i punishment analyzed we now come to the last of the two grand divisions of punishments—privative punishments or forfeitures the word forfeiture is never used but with reference to some possession possessions are either substantial or ideal substantial when it is the object of a real entity as a house a field ideal when it is the object of a fictitious entity as an office a dignity a right the difficulty of dealing with cases of this description will immediately be seen real entities have all a common genus to wit substance fictitious entities have no such common genus and can only be brought into method in virtue of the relation they bear to real objects possessions of whatsoever nature they be whether real or fictitious are valuable and to forfeit them can never otherwise be a punishment than as far as they are instruments of pleasure or security by specifying then the sort of persons or things from which the benefit said to belong to a fictitious possession is actually derived all will be done that can be done towards giving a methodical view of those possessions and of the penal consequences of forfeiting them† to investigate therefore the several kinds of proper forfeitures it is necessary to investigate the several kinds of possessions on this subject however as it comes in only collaterally on the present occasion it will not be necessary to insist very minutely possessions are derived either from things only or from persons only or from both together those of the two first sorts may be styled simple possessions those of the other complex possessions derived from things may consist either—  in money these may be called pecuniary   in other objects at large the former may be styled pecuniary the latter quasipecuniary accordingly forfeiture of money may be styled pecuniary forfeiture forfeiture of any other possession derived from things quasipecuniary quasipecuniary forfeitures are capable of a variety of divisions and subdivisions but as these distinctions turn upon circumstances that make no difference in the mode of punishment it will not be necessary on the present occasion to enter into any such detail possessions derived from persons consist in the services rendered by those persons services may be distinguished into exigible and inexigible by exigible i mean such as a man may be punished to wit by the political sanction for not rendering by inexigible such as a man cannot be punished for not rendering or if at all not by any other sanction than either the moral or the religious‡ the faculty of procuring such as are exigible is commonly called power to wit power over persons the faculty or chance of procuring such as are inexigible depends in great measure upon reputation hence result     two farther kinds of forfeiture forfeiture of power and forfeiture of reputation reputation may be distinguished into natural and factitious by factitious i mean that which is conferred by rank or dignity credibility is a particular species of reputation—the reputation of veracity hence we have two further kinds of forfeiture both subordinate to that of reputation forfeiture of rank or dignity and forfeiture of credibility as to complex possessions and the forfeitures that relate to them these are too heterogeneous to be arranged in any systematic method all that can be done is to enumerate them thus much only may be said of them in general that the ingredients of each of them are derived from both the classes of objects which we have mentioned as being the sources from which the several kinds of simple forfeitures are derived it should seem however that they might all of them without any great violence be brought under the title of conditions conditions then may in the first place be distinguished into ordinary and peculiar ordinary conditions or modes of relationship may be distinguished into natural and acquired by natural conditions i mean those which necessarily belong to a man by birth to wit in virtue of either his own birth or that of some other person to whom he stands related such as that of son daughter father mother brother sister and so on through the several modes of relationship constituted by the several degrees of consanguinity to stand in any of these relations to such or such a person may be the source of various advantages these conditions it is plain cannot themselves be forfeited a man however may and in some instances has been said to have forfeited them and may actually be made to forfeit many of the advantages attending them acquired conditions may be distinguished in the first place into political and religious and political again into domestic and public domestic conditions may be distinguished into family conditions and professional family conditions are— st the matrimonial or that of being husband or wife to such a person  d and  th that of being guardian or ward  th and  th that of being master or servant to such a person by public political condition i mean that of belonging to any voluntary society of men instituted on any other than a religious account by religious condition i mean that of belonging to any society or sect instituted for the sake of joining in the performance of religious ceremonies of conditions that may be termed peculiar the several sorts may it should seem be all comprised under the head of conditions constituted either  st by offices or  dly by corporation privileges a right of exercising an office is an exclusive right to render certain services conditions constituted by offices may be ranked in the number of complex possessions inasmuch as they are apt to include the three simple possessions following to wit a certain share of power a certain rank and a certain salary or fees or other emoluments coming under the head of pecuniary or quasipecuniary possessions of offices there is an almost infinite variety of kinds and a still greater variety of names according to the almost infinite modifications of rank and power in different countries and under different governments this head is consequently susceptible of a great variety of divisions and subdivisions but these it will not be necessary on the present occasion to consider corporations may be distinguished into political and religious under the head of religious corporations may be included the various monastic orders established in countries professing the roman catholic religion as to political corporations the catalogue of the possessions that may be annexed to the condition of one who is a member of those bodies is so various that no other account need on the present occasion or indeed can be given of it than that there are scarce any of the simple possessions above enumerated but may be included in it† to the condition of one who is a member of a religious order or corporation may be annexed besides the above possessions others the value whereof consists in such or such a chance as they may appear to confer of enjoying the pleasures of a future life over and above such chance of enjoying the same pleasures as appears to be conferred by the condition or privilege of being an ordinary professor of the same religion as an appendix to the above list of possessions may be added two particular kinds of possessions constituted by the circumstance of contingency as applied in different ways to each one in that list these are the legal capacity of acquiring as applied to those articles respectively and the protection of the law whereby a man is secured against the     chance of losing them if acquired these abstract kinds of possessions form the subject of so many kinds of forfeiture forfeiture of legal capacity and forfeiture of the protection of the law forfeiture of legal capacity with respect to any possession taking away from a man whatever chance he might have of acquiring it forfeiture of protection subjecting him to a particular chance of losing it chapter ii of the punishments belonging to the moral sanction punishments of this class admit of no distinctions and this however paradoxical it may seem from no other reason than their extreme variety the way in which a man suffers who is punished by the moral sanction is by losing a part of that share which he would otherwise possess of the esteem or love of such members of the community as the several incidents of his life may lead him to have to do with now it is either from the esteem they entertain for him or the love they bear him or both that their goodwill towards him in a great measure depends moreover the way in which this goodwill displays itself is by disposing the person who entertains such affection to render good offices and to forbear doing ill offices or in other words to render inexigible services to the party towards whom it is entertained the way in which the opposite affection illwill displays itself is accordingly by disposing the former to forbear doing good offices and if it has risen to a certain degree by disposing him to render ill offices as far as may be consistent with his own safety to the latter now then from the good offices of one man to another may all sorts of possessions and through them or even more immediately all sorts of pleasures be derived on the other hand from the withholding of the good offices one man might have expected from another may all sorts of pains and death itself be also derived much more may they from positive ill offices added to those other negative ones and what are the good offices which you may be disposed to withhold from me or the ill offices you may be disposed to do me from my having become the object of your illwill it is plain not one or other particular species of good or ill office but any species whatever just as occasion serves that shall be proportionate to the strength of your illwill and consistent with your own safety this consideration will make our work short under the head which respects the several modes or species of punishment subordinate to the mode in question the same consideration will make it equally short under the second head relative to the evils producible by the mode or modes of punishment in question these it must have been already seen may be all sorts of evils all the different sorts of evils which are producible by any of the punishments belonging to the political sanction by any punishments properly so called in a word all the different sorts of evils to which human nature is liable but though the punishments belonging to the moral sanction admit not of any varieties that are separable from one another there are two distinct parcels as it were into which the evils produced by any lot of punishment issuing from this source on the occasion of any offence may be divided one which as being the basis of the other may be mentioned first though the last in point of time consists of the several contingent evils that may happen to the offender in consequence of the illwill he has incurred the other consists of the immediate pain or anxiety the painful sense of shame which is grounded on the confused apprehension of the unliquidated assemblage of evils above mentioned it is this last which is referable in a peculiar manner to the moral sanction and which cannot be produced by the political any otherwise than as far as those who have the management of that sanction can gain an influence over the moral it may therefore for distinction sake be styled the characteristic evil of the moral sanction this must obtain in a greater or less degree upon every instance of detected delinquency unless in those callous and brutish natures if any such there be in whom all sense of disgrace and all foresight of the consequences is utterly extinguished the others above spoken of may be styled the casual evils these casual evils as we have already intimated owing to their extreme uncertainty admit not of any determinate variations in point of quality in point of quantity however they do admit of some distinctions resulting from— st their intensity  dly their extent this distinction ought not to be overlooked since we shall have occasion to make frequent application of it to practice these two lots of evils howsoever distinguishable intermix with and aggravate one another i have done an immoral act i am discovered i perceive as much now then before i happen to have occasion to avail myself of the good offices of such of my acquaintance as come to know of it—before i happen to be in a way to suffer from the denial of those good offices—in a word     before i have experienced any of the casual evils annexed by the moral sanction to my delinquency i already foresee more or less clearly and apprehend more or less strongly the loss of those good offices and of that goodwill i feel the painful sense of shame the pain of ignominy i experience in a word the characteristic evil of the moral sanction as the punishment of my misbehaviour this sense of shame stamps the marks of guilt upon my deportment this being the case either out of despair i avoid my acquaintance or else i put myself in their way if i avoid them i by that means already deprive myself of their good offices if i put myself in their way the guilt which is legible in my countenance advertises and increases their aversion they either give an express denial to my request or what is more common anticipate it by the coldness of their behaviour this reception gives fresh keenness to the sting of shame or in the systematical language i have ventured to make use of the experiment i have made of the casual evils adds force to the characteristic evils of this sanction we have already intimated the distinction between positive and negative ill offices to the former and even in a few instances to the latter it is the duty and a great part of the business of the political magistrate to set limits these limits however may come accidentally to be transgressed as there are scarce any laws that can be made but what may come accidentally to be disobeyed on this account the evils that may result from this source remain still indeterminate and unlimited but were the laws that might be made in this behalf ever so certain in their operation those evils would still remain indeterminate and unlimited notwithstanding for so uncertain and unforeseeable may be the connexion between the refusal of a good office and the miseries which in particular circumstances may be the consequences of such a refusal that no law could make a secure provision against those miseries in every case without such a subversion of all liberty and all property as would produce much greater miseries your giving me a shilling to buy me food or taking me twenty miles to a physician may on a critical occasion save me from an excruciating disease but no law without leaving it to the determination of the person in want can with sufficient certainty describe such occasions nor can any law without depriving you of all liberty and all property oblige you to give money to or take a journey for every man who shall determine himself to be in want of such assistance howosever this be with regard to negative ill offices positive ill offices not only may be limited but in most cases may be and commonly are forbidden in no settled state of government is private displeasure permitted to rise so high as to vent itself indiscriminately in any of those direct ways of inflicting pain which the political magistrate himself may have thought it expedient to recur to however flagrantly immoral may have been the conduct of a delinquent persons at large are never permitted of their own authority to punish him by beating or maiming or putting him to death positive ill offices may be divided into such as display themselves in actions at large and such as display themselves in discourse now it is to speech that the latitude which is still left to the right of rendering positive ill offices in a direct way is principally confined and even this right is commonly subject to a number of limitations but ill offices which are confined to speech are not if they stop there productive of any evil when they are it is ultimately by disposing other persons to entertain a displeasure against the same person and manifest it by actions of another kind if then such positive ill offices as display themselves in actions at large be excluded all that remains is resolvable ultimately into negative ill offices and of these those which a delinquent has in ordinary cases to apprehend amount only to such as are not illegal nor is even this a contemptible and inconsiderable source of suffering dependent as men in a state of society are upon one another the punishment derived from the source in question even when narrowed by all these restrictions may and indeed frequently does rise to a tremendous height it admits of no evasion it comes upon a man from all quarters he can see no end to its duration nor limit to its effects it is not unusual for it to bereave him of the chief pleasures and sources of profit he has set his heart upon it may deprive him of all those profits and enjoyments he had been accustomed to expect at the hands of his friend or his patron by setting his common acquaintance at a distance from him it may fill the detail of his life with a perpetual train of disappointments and rebuffs it leaves him joyless and forlorn and by drying up the source of every felicity it embitters the whole current of his life were we indeed to inquire minutely into the distinction between the nature of the political and moral sanctions it would come out that of the evils which when considered as issuing from the moral sanction i have styled casual evils some are even more likely     to be brought upon a man by the action of one of these sanctions and some others by that of the other but as to the species of evil this is all the distinction we shall be able to make out for there is not any evil which the exertion of one of these forces may bring upon a man but which may also be brought upon him by the action of the other the most studied and artificial torments for instance that can be invented by a political magistrate and the most unlikely for a man to be exposed to suffer by the unassisted powers of nature or even from the unauthorized resentment of an individual are what he may by accident be exposed to from the latter source it may be for want of some evidence that an individual might furnish and from illwill forbears to furnish that i may have been doomed to these torments by a judge or if the like torments be supposed to be inflicted by the unauthorized violence of an enemy they may be attributed in the first place indeed to the vengeance of that enemy but in the second place to the disesteem and illwill borne me by some stranger who having it in his power to rescue me yet exasperated against me on account of some real or supposed instance of immorality in my behaviour chose rather to see me suffer than to be at the pains of affording me his assistance on the other hand the whole sum of the evils depending upon the moral sanction to wit not only the casual evils but the sense of infamy which constitutes the characteristic evil is liable in many instances to be brought upon a man by the doom of the political magistrate this is what we have found it unavoidably necessary on various occasions to give intimation of and what we shall have need more particularly to enlarge upon hereafter it is in the manner then in which the evils that come alike under the department of each of the two sanctions come to be inflicted that the only characteristic difference discernible between these two sanctions is to be seen with regard to punishment issuing from the political sanction the species the degree the time the place the person who is to apply it are all assignable with regard to that which may issue from the moral sanction none of these particulars are assignable when i say assignable i must be understood to speak with reference to some particular time coincident with or subsequent to that of the commission of the offence at that very time then with respect to political punishment that is with respect to personal punishments and forfeitures many of those particulars and sometimes all of them are assignable and may be foreseen at the time the offence theft suppose is committing it may be foreseen that a number of stripes given with such an instrument not more than so many nor fewer than so many will be inflicted in case of detection so many days or weeks hence at such a place and by the hands of such an executioner and vice versâ when they come to be inflicted the punishment will be seen to be the consequence of such an offence now when the organical pain produced by the punishment thus inflicted is over all the punishment for that offence as far as depends upon the political sanction is commonly over and at an end but as to the ill offices as well negative as positive which constitute the substance and groundwork of the moral sanction no man can tell what they will be—what particular evils they will subject a man to—when they will commence or when they will end—where they will display themselves nor who will render them nor vice versâ when they have actually been rendered when such or such a neighbour has shut his door against me and i am pining with hunger or shivering with cold can i always know for certain that the immorality i was guilty of at such or such a time was the occasion of his unkindness in a word determinateness is the perfection of the punishments belonging to the political sanction indeterminateness is the very essence of those issuing from the moral a word or two may be of use in this place with respect to the nomenclature employed in speaking of the punishments belonging to this sanction the expressions made use of on this occasion are singularly various a whole legion of fictitious entities are created for the purpose of representing the one fundamental idea in question under the different aspects of which it is susceptible the names of these fictitious entities are many of them disparate they require different sets of words to enable them to make a meaning and the coincidence lies not between the import of these names when separately taken but between certain sentences or propositions in which they may respectively be made to bear a part among these words may be reckoned reputation honour character good name dishonour shame infamy ignominy disgrace aversion and contempt in speaking then of a man as suffering under a punishment of the moral sanction it may be more or less convenient according to the occasion to use amongst others any of the following expressions we may say that he has forfeited his reputation his honour his character his good name that his fame has been tarnished that his honour his character or his reputation has received a stain that he stands disgraced that he has become infamous that he has sunk under a load of     infamy ignominy or disgrace that he has fallen into disgrace into disesteem into disrepute that he has incurred the illwill the aversion the contempt of the neighbourhood of the public that he is become an object of aversion or contempt it were the task rather of the lexicographer than the jurist to exhaust the catalogue of these expressions those which have been already exhibited may be sufficient to advertise the reader of the similarity there may be in point of sense between a variety of other expressions of like import however dissimilar they may be in sound hitherto we have considered the punishment belonging to the moral sanction in no other point of view than that in which it appears when standing singly uncombined with and uninfluenced by the political in this state the direction given to it and the force with which it acts are determined altogether by the persons to whom it belongs ultimately to dispense it unassisted and uncontrouled by the political magistrate in this state it acted before the formation of political society before the creation of that artificial body of which the political magistrate is the head in this state by its connexion with the various modes of conduct which it happened to be employed to prohibit or to recommend it gave birth to that fictitious set of rules which are what some moralists have sometimes at least in view when they speak of the law of nature in this state it was an engine to the power of which the political magistrate was a witness before the construction of that which is of his own immediate workmanship it then was it still is and it ever must be an engine of great power in whatever direction it be applied whether it be applied to counteract or to promote his measures no wonder then he should have sought by various contrivances to press it into his service when thus fitted up and set to work by the political magistrate it becomes a part of the vast system of machinery to which we have given the name of the political sanction and now then we are in a condition to discuss the nature of that genus of political punishment which in systems of jurisprudence is commonly spoken of under the name of infamy or forfeiture of reputation §   advantages and disadvantages of the punishments belonging to the moral sanction we will now proceed to examine the punishments belonging to the moral sanction itself independently of any employment of it by the magistrate to aggravate or guide the effect of his designs punishments of this class as has been already said admit of no distinctions they comprise all sorts of evils the illwill produced manifests itself in a variety of modes that can neither be calculated nor foreseen they admit then of no precise description for it is only when the effects are determinate that a punishment admits of a description will they be analogous to the offence or unfrugal or excessive upon these points nothing can be said our observations will be comprised under three heads—their divisibility equability and exemplarity   these punishments admit of minute division they have all the degrees possible from mere blame to infamy from a temporary suspension of goodwill to active and permanent illwill but these several degrees depend altogether upon accidental circumstances and are incapable of being estimated by anticipation punishments of the pecuniary or chronical class as for example imprisonment are susceptible of being exactly measured punishments that depend on the moral sanction not before they are experienced the value put upon them is necessarily extremely inaccurate in respect of intensity they are liable to be inferior to the greater part of those belonging to the political sanction they consist more in privations of pleasure than in positive evils this it is that constitutes their principal imperfection and it is solely for supplying this imperfection that penal laws were established one of the circumstances by which their effect is weakened is the locality of their operation do you find yourself exposed to the contempt of the people with whom you are in the habit of associating to exempt yourself from it all that you have to do is to change your abode the punishment is reduced to the giving a man the option to remain exposed to the inconveniences resulting from this contempt or to inflict on himself the punishment of banishment which may not be perpetual he does not abandon the hope of returning when by lapse of time the memory of his transgressions shall be effaced and the public resentment appeased   in respect of equability these punishments are really more defective than at first sight they might appear in every condition in life each man has his own circle of friends and acquaintance to become an object of contempt or aversion to this society is a misfortune as great to one man as to another this is the result that may at first view present itself to the mind and which to a certain extent is really correct it will however upon a more narrow scrutiny of the matter be found that in point of intensity this class of punishment is subject to extreme variation depending as it does upon the condition in life wealth education age sex and other circumstances the casual evils resulting from     the punishments belonging to this sanction are infinitely variable shame depends upon sensibility women especially among civilized nations are more alive to and susceptible of the impression of shame than men from their earliest infancy and even before they are capable of understanding the object of it one of the most important branches of their education is to instil into them principles of modesty and reserve and they are not long in discovering that this guardian of their virtue is at the same time the source of their power they are moreover physically weaker and more dependent than men and stand more in need of protection it is more difficult for them to change their society and to remove from the place of their abode at a very early age generally speaking sensibility to the moral sanction is not remarkably acute in old age it becomes still more obtuse avarice the only passion that is fortified by age subdues all sense of shame a weak state of health morbid irritability any bodily defect any natural or accidental infirmity are circumstances that aggravate the suffering from shame as from every other calamity wealth considered of itself independently of rank and education has a tendency to blunt the force of these impressions a rich man has it in his power to change his residence to procure fresh connexions and acquaintance and by the help of money to purchase pleasures for which other people are dependent upon goodwill there exists a disposition to respect opulence on its own account to bestow on the possessor of it gratuitous services and above all external professions of politeness and respect rank is a circumstance that augments the sensibility to all impressions that affect the honour but the rules of honour and morality are not always calculated upon the same scale the higher ranks are however in general more alive to the influence of opinion than the inferior classes profession and habitual occupation materially affect the punishments proceeding from this source in some classes of society the point of honour is at the very highest pitch and any circumstance by which it is affected produces a more acute impression than any other species of shame courage among military men is an indispensable qualification the slightest suspicion of cowardice exposes them to perpetual insults thence upon this point that delicacy of feeling among men who upon other points are in a remarkable degree regardless of the influence of the moral sanction the middle ranks of society are the most virtuous it is among them that in the greatest number of points the principles of honour coincide with the principles of utility it is in this class also that the inconveniences arising from the forfeiture of esteem are most sensibly felt and that the evil consequences arising from the loss of reputation produce the most serious ill consequences among the poorer classes among men who live by their daily labour sensibility to honour is in general less acute a day labourer if he be industrious though his character be not unspotted will be at no loss for work his companions are companions of labour not of pleasure from their gratuitous services he has little to expect and as little to ask his wants are confined to the mere necessaries of life his wife and his children owe him obedience and dare not withhold it the pleasures which arise from the exercise of domestic authority fill up the short intervals of labour   the greatest imperfection attending punishments arising from the moral sanction is their want of exemplarity their effect in this respect is less than that of any of the punishments of the political sanction when a man is exposed to suffering from loss of reputation it may be unknown to all the world or at least the knowledge may be confined to those who are the instruments of his punishment and to the immediate circle of his friends and acquaintance but these are witnesses only of a small part of his sufferings they perceive that he is treated with indifference or disdain they observe that he does not find protection or confidence but all these observations are transitory the individual wounded by these signs of coldness or aversion shuns the company of the authors or the witnesses of his shame he retires to solitude where he suffers in secret and the more unhappy he is the smaller is the number of the spectators of his punishment punishments connected with the moral sanction are advantageous with reference to reformation when a man suffers in consequence of a violation of the established rules of morality he can only refer the evil he experiences to its true cause the more sensible he is to shame the more he will fear to increase it he will become either more prudent that he may avoid detection or more careful to save appearances or he will in future submit to those laws which he has been unable to break without suffering public opinion with the exception of a few cases is not implacable there is among men a reciprocal need of indulgence and a levity and ease in forgetting instead of forgiving faults when the remembrance of them is not renewed by fresh failures on the other hand with respect to dishonourable actions for which there is neither appeal or pardon the punishment of infamy acts as a discouragement and not as a motive     to reformation nemo dignitate perditæ parcit these disadvantages are in a measure compensated and this sanction receives a degree of force which is often wanting in the political sanction from the certainty of its action there is no offending against it with impunity an offence against one of the laws of honour arouses all its guardians the political tribunals are subjected to a regular process they cannot pronounce a decision without proof and proofs are often defective the tribunal of public opinion possesses more liberty and more power it is liable to be unjust in its decisions but they are never delayed on that account they can be reversed at pleasure trial and execution proceed with equal steps without delay or necessity for pursuit there are everywhere persons ready to judge and to execute the judgment this tribunal always inclines to the side of severity its judges are interested by their vanity and their love of display in making its decisions severe the more severe they appear the more they flatter themselves with the possession of the good esteem of others they seem to think that the spoliation of one character forms the riches of another thus although the punishments of the moral sanction are indeterminate and for the most part when estimated separately of little weight yet by the certainty of their operation their frequent recurrence and their accumulation from the number of those who have authority to inflict them they possess a degree of force which cannot be despised by any individual whatever may be his character his condition or his power the power exercised by the moral sanction varies according to the degree of civilization in civilized society there are many sources of enjoyment and consequently many wants which can be supplied only from considerations of reciprocal esteem he who loses his reputation is consequently exposed to extended suffering in all these points the exercise of this sanction is also favoured or restrained by different circumstances under a popular government it is carried to the highest degree under a despotic government it is reduced almost to nothing easy communications and the ready circulation of intelligence by means of newspapers augments the extent of this tribunal and increases the submission of individuals to the empire of opinion the more unanimous the decisions of the moral sanction the greater their force are its decisions different among a great number of different sects or parties whether religious or political they will contradict each other virtue and vice will not use the same common measure places of refuge will be found for those who have disgraced themselves and the deserter from one sect or party will be enrolled in another chapter iii forfeiture of reputation we now come to consider the punishment of infamy or forfeiture of reputation the nature of this punishment we have already had occasion to discuss in treating of the moral sanction from which it derives its origin all that remains for us to do in this place is to state the various contrivances by which the political magistrate has gone about to modify its direction and to augment its force in point of direction the way in which he influences the action of this punishment is     very simple it is this by annexing it to the commission of any act which by prohibiting he has constituted an offence in point of force he may influence it by various means the methods by which this may be done may be divided in the first place into legislative or executive  st it may be done by methods simply legislative without any of that interference which in the case of ordinary punishments is necessary of the executive power the law in this case commits to each individual in as far as he himself is concerned the office of judge and executioner  d but in this case as in any other the law may carry itself into execution in the ordinary methods of procedure authorizing the judge either in imitation of his predecessors or in conformity to the letter of positive law to direct and animate the resentment of the community at large by the simple exercise of the legislative office the law may annex to any mode of conduct a certain quantity of disrepute in the following ways—   by simply prohibiting any mode of conduct although no political penalty be also employed to enforce the prohibition this is the lowest degree in which the political magistrate can be instrumental in applying the force of the several sanctions this slightest exertion of the force of the moral sanction is inseparable we see from an exertion of that of the political a few words may be of use on this occasion to show to what causes it is owing that a certain share of the former of these forces is become as it were appurtenant to the other   if no political penalty is denounced the community find in this circumstance a stronger or additional reason for annexing their disesteem to the breach of it for since it must be evident to the legislator as it is to every man that no rule can have any effect without a motive to prompt a man to observe it his omitting to annex any other penalty is naturally understood to be a kind of tacit warning to the community at large to take the execution of the law into their own hands all he does in such case is to give direction to the moral sanction trusting to its native force for the execution of his law   if the ordinance be accompanied by an express exhortation to obey it or what comes to much the same thing if the terms in which it is delivered savour of exhortation this is another and more express declaration of his persuasion of the utility of the ordinance he promulgates and the more anxious be is that it should meet with obedience the more pernicious it shows he appears to deem the conduct of any one who disobeys it or at least the more convinced he shows himself to be that to a certain degree at least the nonobservance of it would be pernicious to the community   a fifth expedient by which the moral sanction is called upon in a manner still more express to enforce a political ordinance is by censure directly levelled at him whosoever he shall prove to be that shall infringe it this censure may be levelled at the offender either immediately or else mediately by being immediately pointed at the offence†   a sixth expedient is by transferring or at least endeavouring to transfer upon one offence the measure of disrepute that naturally attends upon another the way in which this is done is by affecting to regard the obnoxious practice in question as an evidence of another practice on which men are already in the habit of bestowing a superior degree of disrepute‡ it is plain that the cases in which this can be attempted with any prospect of success must necessarily be limited to warrant the inference some appearance in connexion however superficial there must be between the two offences but any little connexion however slight is ordinarily sufficient in such a case men in general are not apt to be very difficult with regard to the evidence the vanity of being thought sagacious the pride of sitting in judgment and condemning the hope of earning a certain measure of reputation on the score of virtue at an easy rate the love of novelty and paradox and the propensity   0 to exaggeration especially on the unfavourable side second the aim of the legislator so much for the ways in which the political magistrate may exert an influence over the moral sanction by the bare exercise of his legislative powers we now come to the instances in which he requires the assistance of the executive of all the expedients that may be classed under this head the least severe is that of publication—the making public the fact of the offence accompanied with a designation of the offender it is principally in point of extent that a measure of this sort tends to add to the natural quantum of disrepute though something likewise may be supposed to be contributed by it in point of intensity on account of the certainty which it gives to mens opinions of the delinquency of the offender even this mode of proceeding mild as it may appear is capable of various degrees of severity according to the various degrees of publicity that may be given to the fact it may be registered in a written instrument to which few people have access it may be registered in a written instrument to which any person may have access it may be notified by proclamation by sound of trumpet by beat of drum since the invention of printing it may be recorded in indelible characters and circulated through the whole state it is obvious that the discredit reflected by this expedient must be greater or less in point of intensity as the offence is esteemed more or less disreputable the censure which in the law is pronounced in general terms upon such uncertain persons as may chance to become offenders may upon conviction by the assistance of the executive power be brought home to and personally levelled at any individual offender and this may be done in a manner more or less public and either in a settled form of words or with more latitude in a speech ad libitum to be delivered by the judge† but the severest expedient for inflicting infamy is that which consists in the applying of some political punishment which by its influence on the imaginations of mankind is in possession of the power of producing this effect this leads us to inquire into the different measures of infamy that stand naturally annexed to the several modes of punishment and in the course of this inquiry we shall find reason to distinguish certain punishments from the rest by the special epithet of infamous a certain degree of infamy or disrepute we have already remarked is what necessarily attends on every kind of political punishment but there are some that reflect a much larger portion of infamy than others‡ these therefore it is plain are the only ones which can be stated properly by that name upon looking over the list of punishments we shall find that it is to those which come under the name of corporal punishments that this property of reflecting an extraordinary degree of infamy is almost exclusively confined pecuniary punishments which are the most common are attended with a less degree of infamy than any other unless it be quasipecuniary punishments which in this respect as in most others are pretty much upon a par with pecuniary next to these come the several modes of confinement among which if there be any difference quasi imprisonment and local interdiction seem the mildest in this respect next to them banishment and imprisonment the severest of specific restraints and active punishments at large they are so various that it is not easy to give an account in general they seem to be on a footing with those punishments that are mildest in this respect unless where by means of analogy they are so contrived as to reflect and aggravate in a peculiar manner the infamy of the offence∥ the same account may be given of all the other kinds of forfeiture with regard to corporal punishments short of death there is no punishment of this class but is understood to carry with it a very high degree of infamy the degree of it however is not by any means in proportion to the organical pain or inconveniences that are respectively attendant upon those punishments on the contrary if there be any difference it seems as if the less the quantity is which a punishment imparts of those or any other kind of inconveniences the greater is the quantity which it imports of     infamy the reason may be that since it is manifest the punishment must have been designed to produce suffering in some way or other the less it seems calculated to produce in any other way the more manifest it is that it was for this purpose it was made choice of accordingly in regard to punishments to which the highest degrees of infamy are understood to be annexed one can scarcely find any other suffering which they produce this is the case with several species of transient disablement such as the punishments of the stocks the pillory and the carcan and with several species of transient as well as of perpetual disfigurement such as ignominious dresses and stigmatization accordingly these modes of punishment are all of them regarded as neither more nor less than so many ways of inflicting infamy infamy thus produced by corporal punishments may be styled corporal ignominy or infamy according as the corporal punishment that is made choice of for the sake of producing the infamy is temporary or perpetual the infamy itself may be distinguished into temporary and indelible thus the infamy produced by the stocks the pillory and the carcan is but temporary that which is produced by an indelible stigma is perpetual not but that any kind of infamy howsoever inflicted or contracted may chance to prove perpetual since the idea of the offence or what comes to the same thing of the punishment may very well chance to remain more or less fresh in mens minds to the end of the delinquents life but when it is produced by an indelible stigma it cannot do otherwise than continue so long as the mark remains whatsoever happens to him wheresoever he goes and how long soever he lives he bears about him the evidence of his guilt mutilation and the severer kinds of simple afflictive punishments discolourment disfigurement and disablement are all attended likewise with a very intense degree of infamy that is in as far as the effects produced by them are known to be produced on purpose in the way of punishment but with regard to many of the sorts of punishment that come under the three latter heads as the effects of them are upon the face of them no other than might have been produced by accident they are therefore the less certain of producing the effect of infamy the infamy produced by these punishments is in point of duration of a mixed nature as it were between temporary and perpetual at the time of the execution it stands upon a par in this respect with the pillory or the stocks with whipping or any other kind of simple afflictive punishments after that time it is greater than what is produced by any of these punishments because the visible consequences still continue it is not however so great as what is produced by stigmatization because it does not of itself like that galling punishment make known the guilt of the delinquent to strangers at the first glance nearly allied to corporal infamy are two other species of infamy which as they derive their influence altogether from that which is possessed by corporal infamy may be styled quasicorporal the one is inflicted by an application made instead of to a mans body to some object the idea of which by the principle of association has the effect of suggesting to the imagination the idea of a punishment applied actually to the body itself this inasmuch as it operates by the force of symbols or emblems may be styled symbolical or emblematical corporal infamy the other is inflicted by a punishment applied indeed to the body but not till after it has ceased to be susceptible of punishment—i mean not till after death this may be styled posthumous or postobitory corporal infamy† to the head of forfeiture of reputation must be referred a forfeiture of a very particular kind—forfeiture of credibility that is in effect forfeiture of so much of a mans reputation as depends upon the opinion of his veracity the effect of this punishment as far as it can be carried into effect is to cause people to bestow on the delinquent that share of illwill which they are naturally disposed to bear to a man whose word they look upon as not being to be depended upon for true this punishment is a remarkable instance of the empire attempted and not unsuccessfully to be exercised by the political magistrate over the moral sanction application is made     to the executors of that sanction that is the public at large to bestow on the delinquent not so much of their disesteem in general nor yet so much of their disesteem as they are disposed to annex to some particular offence of which he has been found guilty but such a share as they are disposed to annex to another offence of which he has not been proved guilty and which unless by accident has no connexion with that of which he has actually been proved guilty the method too which is taken to inflict this punishment is equally remarkable it is inflicted not by any restraint or other punishment applied to the delinquent but by a restraint laid upon another person—a judge or by an inconvenience which may be of any kind whatsoever thrown as the case may require upon any person whatsoever the judge is forbidden to interrogate him or to permit him to be interrogated as a witness in any cause as also to pay any regard on any such occasion to any instrument purporting to contain his written attestation the party who may have stood in need of his evidence for the preservation of his life liberty or fortune or the public who may have stood in need of it to warrant the punishment and guard itself against the enterprises of another perhaps more atrocious criminal are precluded from that benefit i know not of any instance in which it is absolutely clear that a man has been made to incur this singular kind of forfeiture in the express view of punishment in all the cases in which it has been adopted it is not impossible but that the restraint which it imports may have been imposed in no other view than that of improving the rules of evidence and guiding the judge against error in his decision upon the questions of fact brought before him be this as it may it is certain that in the english law it stands annexed in many instances to offences which have not the remotest connexion with the veracity or mendacity of the offender to this head also must be referred the punishment of forfeiture of rank otherwise entitled degradation for the purpose of understanding this modification of ignominious punishment reputation must be distinguished into natural or ordinary and factitious or extraordinary by natural share of reputation and goodwill i mean that which each man possesses in virtue of his own personal conduct and behaviour by factitious i mean that extraordinary share of these possessions which independently of a mans personal conduct is bestowed on him by the institution and contrivance of the political magistrate this kind of factitious reputation is commonly annexed to office or employment but it sometimes exists by itself this is the case for instance in england with the ranks of gentlemen esquire knight and baronet and the ranks derived from academical degrees rank may be conferred either by custom or by authority when derived from custom it is annexed either to family or to occupation when derived from authority it is annexed to the person but whether it were conferred by authority or no it is in the power of authority to diminish the reputation belonging to it if not wholly to take it away a sentence of a judge degrading a man from the rank of gentleman cannot cause a man not to have been born of a father that was a gentleman but it may divest him of a greater or less share of that respect which men were disposed before to pay him on that account as to the mode of inflicting degradation it may be inflicted by any process that serves to express the will of the magistrate that the delinquent be no longer considered as possessing the rank in question with or without corporal ignominy degradation did it answer precisely to the definition given of it when it is styled forfeiture of rank should take away from a man that precise quantity of reputation and consequently of good offices and consequently of happiness for which he stands indebted to his rank but as these quantities are incapable of being measured or even estimated with any tolerable degree of exactness the punishment of degradation can never with any certainty be made to answer precisely to such definition it seems probable that a man who has once been possessed of a certain rank can never be totally deprived of all the reputation respect and good offices that are commonly rendered to that rank the imaginations of mankind are too stubborn to yield instant and perfect obedience to the nod of power it seems probable notwithstanding that the condition of a man who has undergone a degradation of rank is thereby commonly rendered worse upon the whole than if he had never been possessed of it because in general simply not to possess is not so bad as having possessed to lose to speak with more precision it should seem that the characteristic pain of the moral sanction produced by such a punishment is in     general more than equivalent to the sum of such of the casual benefits of that sanction as the punishment fails to take away it is common enough to speak of a total loss of reputation and some jurists speak of such a loss as if it could easily be and were frequently incurred but such a notion is not compatible with any precise idea of the import of that term to understand this it will be necessary to conceive in idea a certain average or mean quantity of reputation equal to zero from whence degrees of good reputation may be reckoned on one side and of bad reputation on the other this mean quantity of reputation or goodwill call that which any given member of the community may be deemed to possess who has no rank and who either has neither merits nor demerits if such a human being be conceivable or rather whose merits stand exactly upon a level with his demerits all above this average quantity may be styled good reputation all below it bad reputation in one sense then a total forfeiture of reputation should consist of nothing more than a total forfeiture of good reputation as thus defined now then according to this account of the matter a total forfeiture of reputation would be nothing more than what is very possible and indeed must be very frequent but it is plain that this is not what the jurists nor indeed what persons in general in speaking of a total forfeiture of reputation have in view for all that this would amount to would be the reducing the delinquent to a level with a man of ordinary merit and condition it would not put his reputation upon so low a footing as that to which a man of ordinary merit and reputation would be reduced by the slightest instance of moral or political delinquency what they have in view is the acquisition if one may so term it of a certain share of ill reputation the quantity of which they view in a confused manner as if it were determinate and consisted of all the ill reputation a man could possibly acquire but this it is plain it never can do at least in the cases to which they apply it for they speak of such an event as if it could be and commonly were the effect of a single instance of delinquency for instance a robbery or ordinary murder this it is plain it can never be unless it should be maintained that an act of parricide for example would not make a man worse looked upon than he was before after having committed only a robbery or ordinary murder it is plain that the maximum of bad as well as that of good reputation is an infinite quantity and that in this sense there is no such thing within the sphere of real life as a total forfeiture of reputation §   simple ignominious punishments examined the infliction of ignominious punishment is an appeal to the tribunal of the public—an invitation to the people to treat the offender with contempt to withdraw from him their esteem it is to speak in figurative language a bill drawn upon the people for so much of their illwill as they shall think proper to bestow if they look upon him in a less favourable light than they would otherwise the draft is honoured if they do not it is protested and the charge is very apt to fall upon the drawer ignominious punishments are like those engines which are apt to recoil and often wound the hand that unadroitly uses them but if skilfully managed what important services may they not be made to render the legislator by calling in to his aid and trusting to the moral sanction increases its power and the extent of its influence and when he declares that the loss of honour is to be considered as a severe punishment he gives to it in the eyes of every man an additional value   this species of punishment so far as it goes is not without some commodious properties it is variable in quantity from the paternal admonition of the judge to a high degree of infamy accompanied with more or less publicity with various circumstances of disgrace and humiliation the legislator may proportion the punishment to the malignity of the offence and adapt it to the various circumstances of age rank sex and profession every station in life will for this purpose afford facilities that are peculiar to it and in particular the military in point of variability punishments of this kind have an advantage over every other mode of punishment this quality is desirable in a mode of punishment that it may be capable of being made to bear a due proportion to every offence to which it is annexed with regard to all other kinds of punishments that are constituted solely by the law the proportion must be settled by the law whereas this mode has a tendency to fall into that proportion of itself the magistrate pronounces—the people execute the people that is as many of the people as think proper they execute it that is in whatever proportion they think proper the malignity towards the delinquent is in general proportionate to the malignancy of his offence it is not however like corporat punishment capable of being universally applied to all offences in many cases an offence may be productive of real mischief but a mischief which the people the executioners     of this mode of punishment are not qualified to perceive on this part of the subject we shall have occasion to speak further presently   in point of exemplarity this mode of punishment cannot be excelled whatever it is that a man suffers by the publication of his offence whether by degradation or by being subject to ignominious exposure it is evident that he suffers it from the infamy attached to his character under the sanction of the legislator   in point of frugality it is advantageous enough the mischief apprehended from the illwill annexed to a disreputable act bears i suppose at least as high a ratio to the eventual mischief as the mischief apprehended from any other mode of punishment does to the eventual   in point of popularity it cannot be excelled for what objection can the people have to a mans being punished in this manner when all that is done to him is the giving them notice that within the bounds which the law allows they themselves may punish him as they please—when they themselves are both judges and executioners   they are remissible an erroneous sentence may be annulled a greater degree of notoriety may be given to the justification than accompanied the condemnation the stain that had been thus affixed on his character will not only be completely effaced but the supposed offender from the unjust persecution that he will have undergone will become a general object of sympathy and especially to those who have been instrumental in inflicting the punishment what is more even though justly inflicted the patient by the stimulus he will have received may be excited to exertions to recover the esteem he has lost and to earn fresh honours to hide his disgrace in the army it has happened that whole bodies of troops after having been stigmatized by their officers have atoned for their offence by distinguished acts of valour and have received the highest marks of honour this advantage is not possessed by ignominious corporal punishments the stain that they leave is indelible and unless the patient expatriates himself his lost reputation is irrecoverable having thus stated the properties that belong to punishments of this kind we proceed to notice a difficulty which arises in their application and which is peculiar to them the legislator cannot at pleasure attach to any given species of offence the degree of infamy that he may be desirous of affixing to it there are some classes of offences really detrimental to the country such for example as election bribery and smuggling for the punishing of which the legislator has no means of pressing the great bulk of the people into the service upon other points the popular sentiments are in direct opposition to those of the legislature there are others on which they are wavering neutral or too feeble to serve his purpose the case of duelling may serve as an example so far says rousseau is the censorial tribunal from leading the public opinion it follows it and when it departs from it its decisions are vain and nugatory be it so but what follows from this is it that the legislator is to be the slave of the most mischievous and erroneous popular notions no this would be to quit the helm while the vessel was surrounded with rocks his greatest difficulty will consist in conciliating the public opinion in correcting it when erroneous and in giving it that bent which shall be most favourable to produce obedience to his mandates the legislator is in an eminent degree possessed of the means of guiding public opinion the power with which he is invested gives to his instructions whenever he may bestow them far greater weight than would be attributed to them if falling from a private individual the public generally speaking presumes that the government has at its command more completely than any private man the requisite sources of information it is presumed also that in the great majority of cases its interest is the same with that of the people and that it is unbiassed by personal interest which is so apt to misguide the opinion of individuals if things go on unprosperously the responsible agents become subject to the animadversion of the public if prosperously they have the credit and the advantage of this people in general have a confused notion and it is the ground of their confidence in extirpating prejudices that appear to him to be mischievous the legislator has the means of laying the axe to the root of the evil he may form institutions which without inculcating doctrines in direct repugnance to received opinions may indirectly attack them instead of planting against them a battery he may sink a mine beneath them the effect of which will be infallible the legislator is clothed not only with political but with moral power it is what is commonly expressed by the words consideration respect confidence there are not wanting instances in which by means of such instruments the most important effects have been produced a certain degree of infamy it is obvious must naturally result upon a conviction for any offence which the community are accustomed to mark with their displeasure thus much results from the bare conviction indeed     from the bare detection without any express designation of the magistrate the only way therefore in which the magistrate can produce any additional degree of infamy—i mean all along pure and simple infamy—is by taking extraordinary measures to make public the fact of the offence in this way it is only in point of extent that the magistrate adds to the actual portion of infamy that flows from the offence in point of intensity there is but one way in which the law can contribute anything to the infliction of simple infamy this is by bestowing on the act in question some opprobrious appellation—some epithet calculated to express illwill or contempt on the part of him who uses it thus a legislator of ancient rome in a passage of livy quoted by the author of principles of penal law after describing a particular mode of offence is said to have done nothing more towards punishing it than by subjoining these words improbè factum here the legislator begins the song of obloquy expecting that the people will follow in chorus the delinquent is to be pelted with invectives and the legislator begins and casts the first stone but when the object of the legislator is to conciliate the public opinion and especially when that opinion is opposite to the one he would establish he must address himself to their reason i hope it will not be supposed that under the name of reasons i have here in view those effusions of legislative babbling—those oldwomanish aphorisms mocking the discernment of the people degrading the dignity of the legislature which stuff up and disgrace the preambles of our statutebooks whereas it has been found inconvenient—whereas great mischiefs have arisen—as if it were endurable that a legislator should prohibit a practice which he did not think inconvenient which he did not think mischievous and as if without his saying as much the people would not give him credit for wishing that it might be believed he thought it of what sort then should the reasons be which the legislator ought to employ to back and justify an epithet of reproach they should be such as may serve to indicate the particular way in which the practice in question is thought liable to do mischief and by that means point out the analogy there is between that practice and those other practices more obviously but perhaps not more intensely mischievous to which the people are already disposed to annex their disapprobation such reasons if reasons are to be given should be simple and significant that they may instruct—energetic that they may strike—short that they may be remembered take the following as an example in the case of smuggling—whosoever deals with smugglers let him be infamous he who buys uncustomed goods defrauds the public of the value of the duty by him the public purse suffers as much as if he had stolen the same sum out of the public treasury he who defrauds the public purse defrauds every member of the community† as the legislator may lay the hand of reproach upon him who counteracts the purposes of the law so may he take it off from him who forwards them such is the informer—a sort of man on whose name the shortsightedness and prejudice of the people inflamed by the laws themselves have most undeservedly cast an odium the informers law might be prefaced in the following manner it is the artifice of bad men to seek to draw contempt upon them who by executing the laws would be a check upon their misdeeds if the law is just as it ought to be the informer is the enemy of no man but in proportion as that man is an enemy to the rest in proportion as a man loves his country he will be active in bringing to justice all those who by the breach of the laws entrench on its prosperity it will be remarked that in this new part of the law—in this struggle to be made against the errors of the moral sanction—there is work for the dramatist as well as the legislator or else that the politician should add somewhat of the spirit of the dramatist to all the information of the lawyer thus wrote the legislators of ancient days—men who spoke the significant and enchanting language of ancient greece poetry was invited to the aid of law no man had ever yet thought of addressing the people in the barbarous language that disgraces our statutebook where the will of the legislator is drowned in a sea of words habited in a gothic accoutrement of antiquated phrases useless repetitions incomplete specifications entangled and neverending sentences he may merely from incomprehensibility inspire     terror but cannot command respect it may be matter of astonishment why the arbiters of our life and of our property instead of disporting themselves in this grotesque and abject garb cannot express themselves with clearness with dignity and with precision the best laws would be disfigured if clothed in such language in a moderate and virtuous government says an elegant and admired writer the idea of shame will follow the finger of law yes so as his finger be not so employed as to counteract and irritate the determined affections of the people he goes on and says whatever species of punishment is pointed out as infamous will have the effect of infamy true whatever is appointed by the legislator as a mark to signify his having annexed his disapprobation to any particular mode of conduct will have this effect it will make the people sensible that he wishes to be thought to disapprove of that mode of conduct in most cases that he does really disapprove of it but to say that whatever the legislature professes to disapprove of the people will disapprove of too is i doubt going a degree too far we may direct his attention to an instance of an offence which under as moderate and virtuous a government i dare believe all prejudices apart as ever yet existed laws have rendered penal magistrates have endeavoured to render infamous by a punishment which in general marks the patient with infamy but which no laws no magistrates no punishments will in this country ever render infamous i mean statelibelling the offence of libelling as marked out by the law as it stands at present is this it is the publishing respecting any man anything that he does not like this being the offence of libelling in general the offence of statelibelling is the publishing respecting a man in power anything which he does not like a libel is either criminative or vituperative by criminative i mean such an one as charges a man with having done a specific act determinable by time and place of the number of those that are made punishable by law by vituperative simply vituperative i mean such an one as without charging a man with any specific fact does no more than intimate in terms more or less forcible the disapprobation in which the libeller holds the general conduct or character of the party libelled such are all those epithets of vague reproach—liar fool knave wicked profligate abandoned man and so forth together with all those compositions which in the compass of a line or of a volume intimate the same thing a criminative libel therefore is one thing a vituperative is another the law knows not of these terms but it acknowledges the distinction they are here intended to express of these two a libel of the criminative kind admits we may observe of another much more confined and determinate definition a vituperative libel will admit of no other than that which is given above now then so it is that for a libel simply vituperative against a private person the law will not let a man be punished by what is called an action to the profit of the party unless it be under particular circumstances which it is not here the place to dwell upon but by imprisonment or to the profit of the crown by what is called an indictment or more especially what is called an information it will let him be punished at the caprice for no rules are or can be laid down to guide discretion—at the caprice i say and fancy of the judges for a libel of the criminative kind against a private person the law will not let a man be punished if the libeller can prove his charge to be a true one but for a libel against a man in power criminative or vituperative true or false moderate or immoderate it makes a man punishable at all events without distinction if it be true it is so much the worse judges thinking to confound reasoning by paradox have not scrupled to hazard this atrocious absurdity the judges of antiquity broached it long ago succeeding judges have adhered to it present judges whose discernment cannot but have detected it—present judges as if borne down by the irresistible weight of authorities recognise it and it triumphs to this hour this being the case he who blames the proceedings of a man in power justly or unjustly is a libeller the more justly the worse libeller but for blaming the proceedings of men in power and as they think justly never will the people of this country look upon a man as infamous lawyers may harangue juries may convict but neither those juries nor even those lawyers will in their hearts look upon him as infamous the practical conclusion resulting from this is that the legislator ought never directly to oppose the public opinion by his measures by endeavouring to fix a stain of ignominy upon an act of the description of those in question which are equally liable to originate     in the most virtuous as in the most vicious motives and which consequently escape general reprobation but it is not less true that in a very extensive class of cases an argument addressed to the understandings and sentiments of the people would if properly applied have some considerable effect as well as an argument addressed to their fears if he thought the experiment worth trying the legislator might do something by the opinion of his probity and his wisdom and not be forced to do everything by the terror of his power as he creates the political sanction so he might lead the moral the people even in this country are by no means illdisposed to imagine great knowledge where they behold great power a few kind words such as the heart of a good legislator will furnish without effort will if the substance of the law be not at variance with them be enough to dispose the people to be not uncharitable in their opinion of his benevolence not that the legislator in our days and in those countries which on the subject of government one has principally in view ought to expect to possess altogether the same influence over the moral sanction as was exercised by the legislators of such small states as those of greece and italy in the first dawnings of society the most prominent reason of this difference is that in monarchical governments it is birth and not any personal qualifications that fix a man in this office it is rare that the person in whose name laws are issued is the person who is believed to make them it is one thing to make laws and another to touch them with a sceptre the catherines and gustavuses govern and are seen to do so other princes are either openly governed or locking up their bosoms from the people reign as it were by stealth in a mixed government like ours where the sovereign is a body he has no personal character he shows himself to the people only in his compositions which are all that is known of him by those writings he may doubtless give some idea of his character but as his person is in a manner fictitious and invisible it is not to be expected that the idea of his character should make so strong an impression upon the imagination of the people as if they had the idea of this or that person to connect it with in the small states of greece the business of legislation stood upon a very different footing the zalencuses the solons the lycurguses were the most popular men in their respective states it was from their popularity and nothing else that they derived their title they were philosophers and moralists as well as legislators their laws had as much of instruction in them as of coercion as much of lectures as of commands the respect of the people had already placed the power of the moral sanction in their hands before they were invested with the means of giving direction to the political members of a small state the people of which lived as if they were but one family they were better known to the whole people for whom they made laws than with us a member ordinarily is by the people of the county he is chosen for in those days men seem to have been more under the government of opinion than at present the word of this or that man whom they knew and reverenced would go further with them than at present not that their passions as it should seem were more obsequious to reason but their reason was more obsequious to the reason of a single man a little learning or the appearance of it gleaned from foreign nations gave a man an advantage over the rest which no possible superiority of learning could give a man at present ipse dixit is an expression that took its rise from the blind obsequiousness of the disciples of pythagoras and not uncharacteristic of the manner of thinking of those who pretended to make any use of their thinking faculty throughout ancient greece chapter iv of pecuniary forfeitures we now come to consider the several kinds of forfeitures and first the sorts of forfeiture     that bear the name of pecuniary and quasipecuniary forfeiture of money and what is exchangeable for money a pecuniary forfeiture is incurred when a man is by a judicial sentence compelled to pay a sum of money to another or as it is in some cases called a fine as to the methods which may be taken by the law to inflict a punishment of this sort they are as follows—   the simplest course is to take a sum of money to the amount in question out of the physical possession of the delinquent and transfer it into the physical possession of the person who is to receive it after which were he to meddle again with the money so taken he would be punished just as if he had meddled with any other parcel of money that never was in his possession this course can only be taken when it happens to be known that the delinquent has such a sum in his possession and where it lies but this is seldom the case   the next and more common expedient is to take such and such a quantity of what other corporal effects he may have in his physical possession as if sold will produce the sum in question and to make sale of them accordingly and bestow the produce as before   another expedient is to make use of compulsive means to oblige him to produce the sum himself these means will be either  st the subjecting him to a present punishment to be taken off as soon as he has done the thing required or  d the threatening him with some future punishment to be applied at such or such a time in case of his not having done by that time the thing required   a fourth expedient is to take such property of his whether in money or other effects or whereof though the legal right to them or in a certain sense the legal possession of them is in him the physical possession is in other people as the existence of such legal right and the place where the effects in question are deposited are circumstances that can seldom be known but by his means this makes it necessary to apply compulsion to him to oblige him to give the requisite information of these four expedients the first and second commonly go together and are put in practice indiscriminately at one and the same operation the officer to whom the business is entrusted if he finds money enough takes money if not he takes other effects to make up the deficiency the first then may in future be considered as included under the second in england the second and the third have both of them been in practice from time immemorial not indiscriminately however but according to the name that has been given to the punishment by which the money has been exacted when this punishment has been called a fine the third method has been exclusively employed when it has been called damages the second and third have been employed together—not indeed in their full force but under certain restrictions too particular to be here insisted on the fourth is comparatively of late invention it was first applied to traders by one one of the bankrupt laws and has since been extended by the insolvent acts to persons at large where the obligation they are under to pay money bears the name of debt such is the case in many instances where that obligation is imposed with a view to punishment §   pecuniary forfeitures examined   as to the evils produced by a punishment of this kind they are all reducible to the pain of privation occasioned by the loss of so much money   pecuniary forfeiture shares with penal servitude in the striking advantage of being convertible to profit the quantity of profit is not limited in this case as in that this is its peculiar excellence and this it is that adapts it particularly to the purpose of compensation   in respect of equality it is not less advantageous no punishment can be made to sit more equally than this can be made to sit on different individuals so as the quantum of it be proportioned to the means which the delinquent has of bearing it for money that is the ratio of a given sum of money to the total sum of a mans capital we have already shown to be the most accurate measure of the quantity of pain or pleasure a man can be made to receive the pleasures which two men will be deprived of by being made to lose each a given part suppose a tenth of their respective fortunes will in specie perhaps be very different but this does not hinder but that on taking into the account quantity on the one hand and actual expectations and probable burthens on the other they may be the same they will be the same as nearly as any two quantities can be made to be so by any rule of measuring it is from his money that a man derives the main part of his pleasures the only part that lies open to estimation the supposition we are forced to follow is that the quantities of pleasure men are capable of purchasing with their respective capitals are respectively equal this supposition is it must be supposed very loose indeed and inaccurate because the quantity of a mans capital is subject to infinite fluctuations and because there is great reason to suppose that a richer man is apt to be happier upon an average than a poorer     man it is however after all nearer to the truth than any other general suppositions that for the purpose in question can be made   in point of variability it is evident nothing can excel this mode of punishment as far as it extends it commences at the very bottom of the scale in this respect it has greatly the advantage over corporal punishments which are always complicated with a certain degree of infamy while in the instance of pecuniary punishments no other infamy is produced than what is necessarily attached to the offence   in respect of frugality pecuniary punishment especially when the relative quantum of it is great is liable to a disadvantage which balances in some degree against the advantage which it has of being convertible to profit along with the delinquent other parties who are innocent are exposed to suffer to wit whatever persons were comprised within the circle of his dependents this suffering is not the mere pain of sympathy grounded on the observation of his suffering if it were there would be no reason for making mention of it as belonging in a more especial manner to the present mode of punishment it is an original pain produced by a consciousness of the loss which they themselves are likely to incur by the impoverishment of their principal this evil again is not a mere negative evil the evil which consists in the not being to have the comforts which had it not been for his impoverishment they would have had if it were there could be no more reason for taking it into the account on this occasion than the pain of sympathy for whatever it be it is balanced and that exactly by the pleasure that goes to those persons whosoever they be to whose profit the money is applied the pleasure resulting from the use of that money is neither diminished nor increased by the operation it only changes hands the pain then that is peculiar to this species of punishment is neither more nor less than the pain of disappointment produced by the destruction of those expectations which the parties in question had been accustomed to entertain of continuing to participate in the fortune of their principal in a measure proportioned to that in which they had been accustomed to participate in it   in point of exemplarity it has nothing in particular to boast of at the execution of it no spectacle is exhibited the transfer of a sum of money on this account has nothing to distinguish it from the case of an ordinary payment it is not furnished with any of those symbolical helps to exemplarity which belong to most punishments of the corporal kind upon the face of the description the exemplarity it possesses is in proportion to the quantum of it that is in the ratio of the quantum of the forfeiture to the capital of him whom it is to affect there is one case however in which it is particularly deficient in this article this is when it is laid on under the shape of costs upon the face of the law nothing occurs from whence any adequate idea can be drawn of what eventually turns out to be the quantum of the punishment   in point of remissibility it is in an eminent degree advantageous under no other mode of punishment can reparation be made for an unjust sentence with equal facility   in point of popularity this punishment exceeds every other it is the only one of any consequence against which some objection or other of the popular cast has not been made   in point of quantity pecuniary forfeitures are susceptible of varieties which may have considerable influence on their effects the quantum of such a forfeiture as inflicted by statute or common law may be either discretionary or indeterminate or if determinate it may be either limited or fixed and in either case it may be determined either absolutely or by reference in the latter case with regard to the standards by which it is determined it would manifestly be in vain to attempt to set any bounds to their variety the circumstances most commonly made choice of for this purpose are—  the profit of the offence   the value of the thing which is the subjectmatter of the offence   the amount of the injury   the fortune of the offender in england a punishment of this kind is known in different cases by different names which have nothing to do with the nature of the punishment that is of the suffering itself nor essentially with the manner in which it is inflicted they are taken only from the accidental circumstance of the manner in which the produce of the punishment is disposed of when this produce is given to the king or his grantee the punishment being left unlimited by the legislature after the quantum of it has been settled by a judge it is called fine when after being limited by the legislature it has been settled by the judge the name employed to denote it by howsoever applied has commonly been the general term of forfeiture when the quantum of it has been left unlimited by the legislature and the produce of it given to a party injured by the offence the punishment is called damages in this case the settling of the quantum has generally been committed to a jury §   of quasipecuniary forfeitures by quasipecuniary forfeitures i mean the   0 forfeitures of any kind of property that is not money but is of such a nature as admits of its being exchanged for money the enumeration of the different species of property belongs more to a treatise upon civil law than to a work upon punishments as many species of property so many species of forfeiture the observations we have made upon pecuniary punishments may in general be applied to quasipecuniary punishments the evil produced by their infliction may be estimated according to the pecuniary value lost but there is one exception to be made with respect to objects possessing a value in affection an equivalent in money will not represent any of the pleasures attached to these objects the loss of patrimonial lands of the house which has passed from father to son in the same family ought not to be estimated at the price for which those lands or that house would sell punishments of this kind are in general more exemplary than pecuniary punishments the confiscation of lands of a manor for instance more visibly bears the marks of a punishment attracts the attention of a greater number of persons than a fine of the same or of a greater value the fact of the possession is a fact known through all the district—a fact of which the recollection must be recalled by a thousand circumstances and perpetuated from generation to generation these considerations open a vast field for reflection upon the use of confiscations of territorial property especially in the case of those equivocal crimes called rebellions or civil wars they perpetuate recollections which ought to be effaced we shall recur to this subject when we speak of punishments misplaced—book iv chapter v forfeiture of condition when the property under consideration consists of a real tangible entity as a house or lands it presents itself under its most simple and intelligible shape but when it is of an incorporeal nature it can only be designated by abstract terms and to explain those terms it is necessary to have recourse to those real entities from which those fictitious entities derive their name and their signification in order to explain the nature of any particular condition in life for example that of husband it is necessary to state the right conferred upon him by the law over the person the property and the services of an existent being—the woman to whom he is married to explain the nature of rank it is necessary to explain the rights that it confers—the exclusive privilege of using a certain title of being habited in a particular manner of being entitled to priority upon certain occasions in short to enjoy such honours as are attached to the particular rank in question so far the effect produced is produced by the operation of the law as to the honour itself which is the source of their value it depends upon the moral sanction it is however a species of property a man invested with a certain rank is entitled to receive from persons at large unexigible services services of respect and which will be generally rendered to him in consideration of his rank in respect of offices—public offices—we may point out the power possessed by the person holding them over his subordinates the emoluments that are attached to them and the unexigible services that may result from the possession of them that is to say benefits resulting from the disposition that may be supposed to be felt by persons at large to render services to a man placed in an official station by the same process we may explain the nature of all rights for example the right of voting in a parliamentary election every person in possession of this right has the privilege of giving a vote by which he influences the choice of the person to be vested with a particular species of power the value of this interest under the present state of things consists principally in giving the elector a certain power over the candidate and his friends an honest and independent exercise of this right is a means of acquiring reputation to generous and benevolent minds there also accrues from it a pleasure of sympathy founded on the prospect of public happiness that is to say upon the influence that the choice of a virtuous and enlightened candidate may have upon the public welfare the value of a condition in life of a right of a privilege being explained to consist in power profit and reputation that is to say the pleasures resulting from the possession of it we are in possession of all the necessary elements for estimating the evil accruing from their loss or in other words the magnitude of the punishment occasioned by their forfeiture to give an analytical view of all the modifications of which property is susceptible and every species of forfeiture to which it may be exposed would be a work of almost endless labour we shall content ourselves here with giving a few examples beginning with §   the matrimonial condition the evils liable to be experienced by the husband from the forfeiture of this condition consist in the loss of the pleasures belonging to it       the pleasures which are the principal objects in the institution of marriage may be divided into— st pleasures of sense and  d pleasures proceeding from the perception of an agreeable object which depends partly on the senses and partly on the imagination   the innumerable minor pleasures of all kinds resulting from those inexigible services which belong to a husbands authority notwithstanding their variety they may be all of them comprised under the head of pleasures of possession   the pleasures resulting from the use of the property derived from the wife these belong to the same head as the preceding   where the wife has separate property over which a power of disposal is reserved to her pleasure resulting from the hope of becoming possessed of this part of her property pleasure of expectation founded on the pleasures derivable from the possession of wealth   the pleasure resulting from the persuasion of being beloved—this affection producing a variety of uncompellable services which have all the charms of appearing to be as spontaneous as those that are the result of friendship these pleasures may be referred to the pleasures of the moral sanction   the pleasure resulting from the good repute of the wife which is reflected upon the husband and which has a natural tendency as honour derived from any other source to conciliate to him the esteem and goodwill of persons in general this may also be referred to the pleasures arising from the moral sanction   the pleasure of witnessing her happiness and especially that part of it which he is most instrumental in producing this is the pleasure of benevolence or goodwill   the pleasure resulting from the several uncompellable services received at the hands of the family of which he has become a member this may be referred to the pleasures of the moral sanction   the pleasure of power considered generally independently of any particular use that may be made of it with which he is invested in virtue of the exclusive controul he possesses over the fund for reward and punishment this may be referred to the pleasures of the imagination  0 the pleasure resulting from the condition of father this we shall have occasion to notice in considering the evils resulting from the forfeiture of the condition of father this same catalogue with such slight variations as the reader will find no difficulty in making is applicable to the condition of wife the task of coolly analyzing and classifying feelings of this nature may appear tedious but it is not the less necessary if we would estimate the amount of evil resulting from the loss of this condition §   the paternal condition the evils resulting from the forfeiture of the condition of father may be referred most of them to the loss of the following pleasures—   the pleasures derived from the imagining his own existence perpetuated in that of his child this is a pleasure of the imagination   the pleasure of having at his command during the childs minority the services that he may be in a condition to render this is a pleasure of power   the pleasure of employing in so far as it can be done without diminution the separate property of this child this is a pleasure referable to two sources—that of father and of guardian of which presently   the pleasure of filial affection—a pleasure of the moral sanction   the pleasure reflected upon him by the good repute of his child this also is a pleasure of the moral sanction   the pleasure of advancing the happiness of his child—pleasure of benevolence or goodwill   the pleasure derived from the several inexigible services that he may hope to receive from the connexions that his son as he grows up may form in the world—pleasure of the moral sanction   the pleasure resulting from the sentiment of paternal power this is a pleasure of the imagination   in some cases the pleasure derived from the expectation of becoming possessed of the whole or a part of the property the child may have acquired or in case of his death the actual possession of such property pleasure in the one case of expectation founded on the pleasures derivable from the possession of wealth in the other case from the actual possession of wealth §   condition of child pleasures belonging to the condition of child—   the pleasure derived from the use of the exigible services of the parent   the pleasure resulting from the power of using certain parts of the property belonging to the father   the pleasure resulting from the persuasion of being beloved by him   the pleasure derived from the good repute of the father which is reflected upon the child   the pleasure of witnessing the fathers happiness and of contributing to promote it a pleasure rendered more vivid by being accompanied with sentiments of gratitude       the pleasure resulting from the connexions of the father and the right he may have to certain services at their hands   the pleasure derived from the hope of inheriting the whole or a part of his fathers property or if he be dead from the possession of the property §   pleasures derived from the condition of trustee the pleasures resulting from standing in the condition of trustee are the following—   the pleasure resulting from the hope of contributing to the happiness of the individual whose interest is in question this is a pleasure of benevolence or goodwill   the pleasure derived from the hope of the inexigible services to be expected from the gratitude of the individual in question pleasure of the moral sanction   pleasure founded on the hope of receiving inexigible services at the hands of persons benefited by the being entrusted with the use of the trustproperty this also is a pleasure of the moral sanction   pleasure founded on the hope of sharing in the esteem the goodwill and the inexigible services of the different persons to whom his capacity and probity in the management of the trust property may have become known this is also a pleasure of the moral sanction   when a salary is annexed to the duty pleasure of pecuniary profit it is but too well known that the pleasures respectively belonging to these conditions are liable to vanish and at any rate to be alloyed by a corresponding set of pains these pains are too obvious to need insisting on the value of any such condition may therefore be either positive or negative in plain terms a man may either be the better for it or the worse where the value of it is positive it will consist of the sum of the values of the several pleasures after that of the several pains had been deducted when negative as the sum of the value of the pains after that of the pleasure has been deducted when therefore the value of any such condition happens to be negative a sentence taking a man out of it must needs operate not as a punishment but as a reward with regard to those pleasures or benefits which are common to several of the above conditions it is manifest that though the pleasure is in each of these several cases nominally the same they are liable to be very different in point of value thus the pleasure of contributing to the happiness of the person who forms the other term in the relation is incident to the condition of parent and also to that of a guardian but it is more certain and more vivid in the case of the father than in that of the guardian to engage however further in such details besides their being so obvious would lead us from the subject of politics to that of morals let us now proceed to consider the manner in which the several forfeitures may be produced or as the case be any part of them may be employed as an instrument of punishment the advantages of the conjugal condition may be subtracted as a punishment by a judicial sentence declaring that the offender is not or shall not be any longer considered as the husband or wife of the person in question the consequence of such sentence would be not completely to destroy the advantages of that condition but to render them precarious if after this sentence has been pronounced they cohabit or are suspected of cohabiting together the woman is considered as a concubine when this sort of connexion is known to subsist it is in some countries punished by the moral sanction in others both by the moral and political by legal divorce a man is also deprived in the whole or in part of the inexigible services derived from the right he has over the property of his wife and especially of those services derived from cohabitation it would make him dependent upon her with respect to the testamentary disposition over such part of her property of which she might have an absolute power of disposal with respect to the pleasures derivable from the relation of father the law it is true cannot deprive a man altogether of the pleasures connected with this condition but it may be greatly embittered as for example by a retrospective sentence declaring his children to be illegitimate upon those who might be born subsequent to the sentence of divorce the punishment would fall with much greater certainty for the public opinion which would not be forward in supporting the degradation of children born under the faith of lawful wedlock would not exercise the same indulgence towards those who were born after a divorce the paternal and filial condition may in so far as the nature of the case admits of it be in the same manner subtracted by a judicial sentence declaring that the offender is     not or shall no longer be considered as the father or the son of the person in question the certain effects of a sentence of the kind in question in respect of the father would be to deprive him of all legal power over the person of his child in respect of the child to deprive him of taking by inheritance or representation the property of his father as to the other advantages derivable from these relations the sentence may or may not have any effect according to the feelings of the parties interested its operation will depend upon the father and the son—upon their more immediate connexions and upon the public in general as to the office of guardian and other offices of a fiduciary nature the sentence will operate to the whole extent of those offices a legal interdiction of all the acts annuls all the advantages issuing from them it may at first sight appear extraordinary that a power should be attributed to the magistrate of destroying relations founded in nature it is it may be observed an event—an event that has already happened and how can it be in the power of any human tribunal to cause that which has taken place not to have taken place this cannot be accomplished but the magistrate may have power to persuade people to believe that an event has happened in a manner different from what it actually did happen it is true that upon the parties themselves and upon the persons who have a direct knowledge of the fact the power of the magistrate as to this purpose is altogether nugatory but with the public at large an assertion so sanctioned would have the greatest weight the principal obstacle to the exercise of any such power however is that a declaration to this effect as a penal instrument would upon the face of it bear marks of its own falsehood this is a dilemma from which there is no escaping if the offender is not the father of the person in question to declare that he is not is not an act of punishment if he is his father the declaration is false the idea of employing as a mode of punishment the subtraction of any of the rights attached to the several conditions as above is not however so extravagant as at first might be imagined if not the same thing what approaches very near to it is already in use this object may be effected in two modes one the endeavouring to cause it to be believed that the offender does not stand in the relation of father or of son as the case may be to the person regarded as such the other is in endeavouring to cause it to be believed that from the nonobservance of some legal form the progeny is illegitimate a case somewhat analogous to this is that famous one upon which so many volumes have been written—corruption of blood or in other words the perfection of inheritable blood the plain object stripped of all disguise is to prevent a man from inheriting as he would have done if this punishment had not been pronounced but what is endeavoured to be done by the help of this expression is to cause it to be believed that the blood of the person in question undergoes some real alteration which is a part of the punishment another example in which at least in words a controul is assumed over events of the description of those in question is by that barbarous maxim that a bastard is the son of no one—a maxim which has a tendency as much as it is in the power of words to give it to deprive a man of all parental connexions it is not however ever employed as a punishment another example opposite to the preceding one is that other legal maxim pater est quem nuptiæ demonstrant—a maxim by which sanction is frequently given to a palpable falsehood by recent decisions the severity of this rule has however been relaxed it being now settled that though marriage is to be considered as presumptive proof of filiation it may be rebutted by evidence of the impossibility of any connexion having taken place in france a mode of punishment has been employed which it is true without any such pretence as that of destroying the fact of parentage endeavoured as far as might be to abolish all trace of it by imposing on the person in question the obligation of changing his name the same punishment has been employed in portugal† the punishment consisting in the forfeiture of credibility is another example no less remarkable of an attempt to exercise a despotic controul over the opinions of men as part of the punishment for many sorts of offences which do not import any want of veracity the offender is declared to have lost all title to credence the visible sign of this punishment is the not being permitted to depose in a court of justice the forfeiture of the conjugal condition at least to a certain extent is frequently among the consequences of imprisonment especially when with imprisonment is combined penal labour this part of the punishment is not formally denounced but it is not the less real it is not ever in express terms declared     that a man is divested of this condition but he is in fact precluded from the principal enjoyments of it and the condition separate from the pleasures that belong to it is evidently nothing more than a mere name the forfeiture is temporary or perpetual according as the imprisonment is either one or the other §   condition of liberty liberty being a negative idea—exemption from obligation—it follows that the loss of liberty is a positive idea to lose the condition of a freeman is to become a slave but the word slave or state of slavery has not any very definite meaning which serves to designate that condition as existing in different countries there are some countries in which slavery is unknown in countries in which slavery is in use it exists under different forms and in different degrees the pain of servitude would be different according to the class to which the offender might be aggregated slaves are of two classes they may belong to the government or to individuals the condition of public slaves determined by regulation fixing the nature and amount of the work and the coercive punishments by which the performance of it may be compelled is not distinguishable from the condition of persons condemned for life to penal labour if there exist no such regulations it varies little from private slavery a public slave unprotected by any such regulations is placed under the despotic controul of an overseer who is bound to employ him for the benefit of the public in a certain sort of occupation this power arbitrary as it is does not extend to life and death this condition varies very little from that of private slavery a negro for example employed upon a plantation belonging to the crown is not from this circumstance in a condition greatly superior to what he would be in if standing in the same relation to a private individual who instead of being his own overseer employed an agent for that purpose the most ready means of forming a correct conception of the condition of slavery is by considering it in the first instance as absolute and unlimited in this situation the slave is exposed to every possible species of evil the punishment designated then by the expression forfeiture of liberty is no other than the being exposed to a greater or less chance according to the character of the master of suffering all sorts of evils that is to say of all evils resulting from the different modes in which punishment may be inflicted to form an accurate notion of this situation all that is required is to glance the eye over all the possible varieties of punishment the slave with respect to the individual standing in the condition of master is absolutely deprived of all legal protection such is the nature of slavery under its most simple form such is the nature of the total deprivation of liberty the different restrictions that may be imposed on the exercise of this power renders the state of servitude more or less mild there are then two heads to which the evils resulting from this condition may be referred—   the risk on the part of the slave of being subject to every possible evil with the exception of such only as the master is expressly prohibited from inflicting   the continuity of the pain founded on the apprehension of these sufferings §   condition of political liberty i shall say but one word upon a subject that would require a volume the loss of political liberty is produced by a change in the condition not merely of any particular individual but of the whole community the loss of liberty is the result of a fresh distribution of the power of the governing body—a distribution which renders the choice of the persons or their measures less dependent upon the will of the persons governed a fresh distribution of power depends absolutely upon a corresponding disposition to pay obedience to that fresh distribution when superior physical force is in the possession of those from whom obedience is demanded it is evident that the power of commanding can be exercised only in so far as that obedience is rendered as this disposition to pay obedience may be produced by the conduct of a single individual of the governing class it may be and has frequently been said that a single man has destroyed the constitutional liberty of a whole nation but if the analysis of such events be followed out it will be found that this liberty can be destroyed only by the people themselves chapter vi forfeiture of the protection of the law a class of forfeitures as miscellaneous and extensive as any and the last that we shall now take notice of is that of the protection whatever it be which the law affords a man for the enjoyment of the objects of possession this is not altogether the same thing with a forfeiture of the possessions themselves in the instance of some of them the law by taking from him the possessions themselves     excludes him by sure and physical means from the enjoyment of them in the instance of others the law without taking away from him altogether the physical capacity of enjoying them punishes him in the case of his attempting to enjoy them in the remaining cases the law uses not either of those compulsive methods it however does an act by which the parties on whose choice the enjoyment of the object in question depends are disposed on preestablished principles to put an end to it it therefore in this case likewise becomes still the author of the punishment this is the case with the forfeitures in which the political sanction produces its effect not by its own immediate energy but by the motion it gives if one may so say to the moral and religious sanctions in the case of forfeiture of protection the law takes no such active part all it does is this it simply withdraws in part or altogether that punishment by means of which it protects a possessor in the enjoyment of those several possessions if then every man refrain from disturbing him in the enjoyment of any such possession it is well the law does nothing of itself to prompt them to it but if any persons of their own motion choose to disturb him it is also well the law does nothing of itself to hinder them forfeiture of protection is in short neither more nor less than the forfeiture of the use of the ministers of justice that is of such persons whose business it is to protect the several members of the community in the enjoyment of their respective rights between forfeiture of protection and forfeiture of capacity the difference is that by the latter the law does what is necessary to prevent a mans acquiring a possession in the former it forbears to do anything to prevent his losing it when considered with reference to the individual who has forfeited the protection of the law this species of punishment may be called forensic disability it forms part of the artificially complex punishment of outlawry the consideration of which will be subsequently resumed book iv of the proper seat of punishment or say of misseated punishment what is here meant by misseated punishment is not that which in another place was meant by groundless punishment the case in which the epithet groundless was applied to the subject punishment is that in which by the supposition there was no offence in the case—no act to which by the annexation of eventual punishment any such character as that of an offence ought by the legislature to have been superinduced the case in which the epithet misseated is applied to the same subject—the case which on the present occasion is in view—is that in which there exists an offence that is an act fit to be as above converted into an offence—an act to which it is fit that punishment be accordingly attached and in which case punishment is attached accordingly thus far all is right but what there is wrong in the case consists in this that punishment is to be found which in consideration of the same offence has been attached to a wrong person that some persons one or many are to be found on whom in respect of that same offence no punishment from which they could have been saved ought to have been attached but on whom punishment of some sort or other from which they might have been saved does notwithstanding stand attached when in so far as by appointment of the legislature or of the judge acting as in all cases of unwritten or judgemade law in the place of the legislator punishment is inflicted on any person by whom no part has been borne in the offence it may be said to be misseated—seated in a place which is not its proper place in this case if along with the nonoffender no offender suffers the misseated punishment may be as in practice it has been termed vicarious if in the contrary case extravasated punishment that is flowing in a wrong channel punishment ought naturally to be the work of reflection but whether it be vicarious or extravasated should there be found an instance in which the infliction of it appears to have been the result not so much of reflection and thought as of want of thought—and the mass of such instances will be found but too extensive—in such case it may be termed random punishment punishment which is misseated and in particular that which is in an extravasated state may be so unavoidably or avoidably first as to the case in which the extravasation is unavoidable on another occasion in another work and for another purpose this case has already been brought to view viz under the head of circumstances influencing sensibility† whether in the way and for the purpose of punishment or in any other way and for any other purpose a man cannot be made to suffer but his connexions if he have any—always his connexions in the way of sympathy     frequently his connexions in the way of interest understand selfregarding interest are made to suffer along with him and forasmuch as it can only be by some rare accident that a man can be found who has not in either of those ways any connexions thence it follows that if where it is unavoidable the certainty or probability of its extravasation were regarded as a sufficient cause for forbearing to inflict punishment it would only be by a correspondently rare accident that any thing could be done for the prevention of offences of any sort the consequence of which would be general impunity to crimes and other offences of all sorts and with it the destruction of society itself in so far as it is misseated and is not unavoidably so punishment it is almost needless to observe is with reference to the person on whom it is thrown groundless as such it is thrown away it is so much evil expended in waste—reformation determent disablement—it contributes not anything to any one of the proper ends of punishment—not so much as to vindictive satisfaction for injury at least to any mind that is not more or less deranged it is repugnant to utility inconsistent with humanity inconsistent with justice to all these it is repugnant but what it is not repugnant to is english law written as well as unwritten for under both these dispensations instances of it are to be found—instances altogether deplorable in extent as well as abundance when the epithet unavoidable is on this occasion employed some such limitative clause as is expressed by the words without preponderant inconvenience must be understood for in point of possibility punishment i e the infliction of suffering on that score being on the part of the legislator and the judge an act of the will to avoid inflicting it will on this as on every other occasion be respectively in their power at all times not only on this but on every occasion on so simple a condition as that of seeing government and with it society itself perish you may avoid inflicting punishment altogether bearing continually in mind this necessary and not unobvious limitation in answer to the question what in regard to misseated punishment ought to be the conduct of the legislator two simple propositions may be laid down without difficulty—   one is—where it is unavoidable misseated punishment may be employed   where it is avoidable misseated punishment ought in no case to be employed unhappily there exists not a system of established law which does not exhibit instances in which misseated punishment is thus wrongfully employed first as to the case when the application thus made of the matter of punishment is unavoidable—not to be avoided without letting in in some other shape evil in such a quantity as after deduction made of the evil saved on the score of punishment shall leave a nett balance on the side of evil upon the whole now taking the matter on the footing of the principles of utility—punishment however misseated not only may be but ought to be introduced and on the part of him by whom that principle is embraced and taken for his constant guide to say that of punishment so circumstanced that it ought not to be introduced would be equivalent to a contradiction in terms but says an objector punishment in so far as it is inflicted falls upon the guiltless and to inflict punishment on the guiltless is to violate one of the most important and fundamental and universally recognised principles of justice the answer is this being one of those principles which in substance are continually alluded to but which in truth are not any where to be found cannot with propriety be employed in the character of an objection to any rule which standing expressed in a determinate form of words is seen to be unexceptionable to inflict punishment when without introducing preponderant inconvenience the infliction of such punishment is avoidable is in the case of the innocent contrary to the principle of utility admitted—and so is it in the case of the guilty likewise to punish where without introducing preponderant inconvenience such punishment is unavoidable is not in either case contrary to the principle of utility—not in the case of the guilty no nor yet in the case of the innocent what then are the cases in which the application of punishment to the innocent is avoidable what the cases in which it is unavoidable answer wheresoever punishment not being in the case in question in itself undue it is in your power to apply to the guilty punishment in as great a quantity as supposing it actually administered is commensurate to the end of punishment—namely without having recourse to the innocent there the evil whatsoever it be that would be produced by the infliction of punishment on the innocent is avoidable now the fact is and so it will be found that with the exception of such suffering as extravasates and overflows upon the innocent in consequence of their connexion in the way of sympathy or particular and casual interest wheresoever the nature of the case admits of the distinguishing who is innocent from who is guilty the infliction of suffering on the innocent is avoidable define punishment in a certain way and     even the above limitation need not be made say that to give it the character of punishment it is necessary that the suffering that is inflicted should the whole of it be directly intentional—that is either mediately or ultimately intentional and in that case such part of the suffering as in virtue of their connexion with the guilty person falls unavoidably upon third persons a wife or husband children relations dependants friends or creditors and so forth is not punishment—does not come under the denomination of punishment this however is but a question of words take any lot of evil you will such as it is it is whatsoever be its name say that it is punishment the reason for avoiding to produce it if unavoidable will not be the stronger say that is not punishment the reason for avoiding to produce it if avoidable will not be the weaker §   naturally extravasating punishment—rules concerning it in regard to such punishment as comes under the denomination of derivative or naturally extravasating punishment the following seem to be the rules that may be laid down—   the consideration that the lot of punishment in question comes under the denomination of derivative or extravasating punishment—punishment overflowing upon the guiltless from the guilty—can never of itself constitute a sufficient reason for forbearing to inflict such punishment for were that a sufficient reason punishment could not in the way of legislation be appointed in any case   in so far as punishment not coming under this denomination is capable of being inflicted to a sufficient amount without the addition of any punishment which comes under this denomination in other words in as far as properly seated punishment to a sufficient amount is capable of being inflicted without the addition of derivative or extravasating punishment no such addition ought by the legislator to be appointed viz either prescribed or authorised   for so far as without prejudice to the sufficiency of the remainder the lot of punishment actually to be inflicted is capable of being cleared of derivative or extravasated punishment punishment or suffering borne by those who have had no share either in the commission of the offence or in the benefit of the offence—such clearance ought always to be made   in the account taken of the suffering for the purpose of any punishment which is about to be inflicted by the judge such derivative suffering ought always be comprised comprised in the first place in respect of what it is in itself and of itself in the next place in respect of the pain which if inflicted on the innocent connexions of the guilty person it may be expected to produce viz in the shape of a pain of sympathy in the bosom of the guilty person himself   accordingly in the case of a delinquent having such connexions to the end that the real quantity of punishment may not be greater than in the case of a delinquent in the same degree of delinquency having no such connexions the nominal may be—and so far as the deduction is capable of being made with sufficient precision ought to be—made by so much the less   for the purpose of making any such allowance as may be requisite on this score proceed thus in the first place settle with yourself what would be a sufficient punishment on the supposition that the delinquent had no connexions then inquiring into such connexions if any as he has proceed to make such abatement if any as may be requisite on this score   for any such purpose the view of the judge must not absolutely confine itself to the connexion itself the outward and visible sign and presumptive evidence of the internal and invisible sympathy viz the fact that the delinquent has a wife has children has other persons in his dependence of the existence of the degree of sympathy naturally and usually attached to the species of relationship in question the existence of the relationship itself may it is true be received in the character of primâ facie or presumptive evidence such evidence as in default of evidence to the contrary may be taken for conclusive but supposing any such contrary evidence to be offered or to be capable of being without preponderant inconvenience collected such presumptive evidence as above mentioned ought not to be taken and acted upon as if conclusive if for example it appear that in consequence of ill usage inflicted by him his wife has been separated from him it is not right that on that account he should be let off with a less punishment merely because he has a wife if it appear that in consequence of ill usage or desertion or neglect on his part children of his have been taken in hand and provided for by some relation or private friend or some public institution it is not right that merely because he has children he should be let off with a less punishment as above   in so far as it is in the nature of the punishment to extract and provide any quantity of matter applicable to the purpose of compensation the legislator and the judge respectively acting within their respective spheres ought not in the care taken by them to avoid the production of unnecessary     misseated punishment to confine themselves to negative measures if for example either by the general nature of the appointed punishment—imprisonment for example or banishment or death—a separation be made or to the purpose in question by special appointment can be made between the lot of the delinquent and the lot of his guiltless connexions it may be right out of and to the extent of the pecuniary means of the delinquent to make a provision for his guiltless connexions   in other words so far as can be done without reducing to too low a pitch the suffering inflicted on the delinquent the claims of any guiltless connexion of his to be saved harmless from such misseated punishment as would otherwise be made to overflow upon them from the punishment inflicted upon him should have the preference over the interest of the public purse this rule may without reserve or difficulty be in its full extent applied to ordinary creditors to persons whose connexion with the delinquent is accordingly a connexion purely in the way of interest unaccompanied with any such connexion as in the case of wife and children or other near relatives has place in the way of sympathy for example to speak particularly and precisely on the score and for the purpose of punishment money extracted from the pocket of a delinquent ought not to be poured into the public purse such sum excepted as if any remains to be disposed of after satisfaction of all just and bonâ fide demands made or capable of being made by creditors §   punishment apparently but not really misseated—civil responsibility one class of cases may be marked out in which a punishment to which it may happen in appearance to be misseated is not misseated in reality the offence is committed by a who is a person under power the punishment is inflicted on b in whom the power resides in other words the superordinate is made responsible for the subordinate to this class of cases may be aggregated the following— responsibility of the husband for the wife responsibility of the father for the children responsibility of the guardian for his ward responsibility of the madmans keeper for the madman responsibility of the gaoler for his prisoners responsibility of the sheriff for the gaoler responsibility of the military commander for his subordinates responsibility of the master for his servants in all these cases though to appearance the punishment may be misseated yet in point of fact the punishment is inflicted on the person having the power not under the notion of innocence on his part but in contemplation of delinquency on the score of negligence for an ill choice of or want of attention to his subordinates it is on his part a transgression of the negative cast consisting in the omitting to take proper precautions for the prevention of the positive offence committed by his subordinates under our law the sheriff is punished if any of the prisoners under the gaolers custody escape the sheriff has not the immediate custody of the prisoners his other duties are incompatible with that from this circumstance alone then there is no reason for supposing any complicity on his part but the gaoler is appointed by him and the object of the law is to render him circumspect in his choice the gaoler himself is the person immediately responsible but as the safe custody of prisoners is a matter of the highest importance the punishment levelled at the sheriff is in the highest degree expedient and the more so as the amount of it is in certain cases left to the discretion of the judge the responsibility thus imposed on superiors for the acts of their subordinates is founded not only on the reasons above mentioned but on others equally substantial which have been more particularly developed before §   misseated punishment varieties of punishment is misseated in either of two cases—  where the delinquent himself is not made to suffer at all but some other is in his stead   when the delinquent himself is punished and some other guiltless person with him in virtue of an express provision of the law if the delinquent himself be not punished but some other person be in his stead the punishment may be called vicarious punishment it is thus that in the case of a suicide who is of course removed beyond the reach of human punishment suffering is inflicted on his wife his children or his dependants when in virtue of a social connexion between the delinquent and some other person it passes from the delinquent upon that other it may be styled transitive punishment it is thus that in our law the children and other descendants in many cases are punished with their parents for the delinquencies of their parents and other ancestors where a large body of persons are punished at once upon a presumption that the delinquent or delinquents are to be met with in that body it may be styled collective punishment thus it is in our law corporations are in several cases punishable for the delinquencies of the cocorporators     lastly where along with the delinquent a person is punished who is a total stranger to him the punishment in this case may as far as the stranger is concerned be styled random punishment thus it is that by our law a person who after certain acts of delinquency secretly committed has bought land of the delinquent loses his money and the land punishment by lot as is sometimes practised where the delinquents are numerous as in large bodies of soldiery comes not within this case the persons who are made to cast lots are all supposed to be delinquents there is therefore no punishment but what is in propriam personam in this case it is not random punishment but random pardon in vicarious punishment we see it is a third person as the phrase is that is punished alone in transitive punishment a third person with the delinquent in virtue of his connexion with him in collective punishment a large body of third persons uncertain and indeterminate because probably the delinquent is of the number in random punishment a single third person who for certain is not the delinquent and with whom the delinquent has nothing to do §   vicarious punishment the case in which punishment is in the most palpable degree misseated is that in which it has received the name of vicarious upon the person who has had any share in the offence no punishment is inflicted yet upon the same occasion punishment is inflicted upon this and that person who has not had any share in the offence in the reign of james i there lived a sir kenelm digby who besides being a person of quality was an adept in the science of medicine dressing of wounds is among the number of those operations that are attended with pain and trouble by means of a powder of sir kenelms invention this inconvenience was saved in addition to this powder all that he required for the cure of the most desperate wound was a little of the blood that had been made to flow from it to this blood a competent dose of the powder being applied the wound closed and the cure was radical the presence of the patient was no more necessary than to our present quack doctors while the compound of powder and blood was lying upon sir kenelms shelves the patient might be at the antipodes exactly of a piece with the therapeutics that invented this sympathetic powder for such was the name which by the author was applied to it are the politics that gave birth to vicarious punishment i was about to exhibit the absurdity and mischief of this mode of punishment but what end would it answer a simple statement that one man is punished for the offence of another is calculated to produce a stronger impression on the mind than could be produced by the aid of logic and rhetoric an error so extravagant could never have been acted on but from confusion of ideas or upon suppositions the improbability of which was altogether lost sight of in the english law the only instance which is to be seen of a case of misseated punishment which is clearly and palpably vicarious is that of the punishment attached to suicide it may perhaps be said that the man himself is punished as much as the case will admit of that his body used to be pierced with a stake that he is still buried with ignominy and that with respect to him every thing that could be done is done that this is not found sufficient and that as an additional check to the commission of this offence it is necessary to call in aid the contemplation of the sufferings that his wife and children may endure by his death but the effect of this contrivance is obviously very trifling the prospect of the pain he shall suffer by continuing to live affects him more than that of the pain it seems to him they will suffer upon his putting himself to death he is more affected then with his own happiness than with theirs the selfish predominate in his mind over the social affections but the punishment of forfeiture that is the punishment of those relations and friends can have the effect of preventing his design upon no other supposition than that the social affections are predominant in him over the selfish that he is more touched by their suffering than by his own but this is shown by his conduct not to be the case nor is this all it is not only nugatory as to its declared purpose but in the highest degree cruel when a family has thus been deprived of its head the law at that moment steps in to deprive them of their means of subsistence the answer to this may be that there is some species of property which upon this occasion is not forfeited that the law is not executed that the jury elude it by finding the suicide to be insane and that moreover the king has the power of remitting the forfeiture and of leaving to the widow and orphans the paternal property that such is the disposition of juries and of the sovereign is undeniable but is that a reason for preserving in the penal code a law that it is considered a duty invariably to elude and by what means is it eluded by perjury by a declaration made by twelve men upon oath that the suicide was deranged in his mind even in cases in which all the circumstances connected with the case exhibit marks of a deliberate and steady determination the consequence is that every suicide who dies   0 worth any property is declared to be non compos it is only the poorest of the poor who after making the same calculation that was made by cato and finding the balance on the same side act accordingly that are ever found to be in their senses and their wives and children to be proper victims for the rigour of the law the cure for these atrocious absurdities is perjury perjury is the penance that at the expense of religion prevents an outrage on humanity in speaking of vicarious punishment in order to avoid the confusion that might be produced by its liability to be ranked under this head it may be necessary to mention a case belonging to the subject of international law—the case of reprisals in war by a foreign nation innocent persons are subjected to the most rigorous punishment—to confinement and even to death the real author of the offence not being in the jurisdiction of the foreign state the exercise of this power is justified by necessity as a means of preventing the infliction of injuries not warranted by the rules of war this is not strictly speaking vicarious punishment the reprisals inflicted on his subjects operate upon the sovereign himself either by the compassion felt for their suffering or by the fear if patiently submitted to of alienating the affections of his people it is more particularly useful between contending armies honour is the principal sanction of the laws of war but the power of making reprisals is a very necessary coadjutor in these cases what humanity dictates is that the sufferings inflicted on the innocent should be the least possible consistent with the production of the desired effect that they should be remissible and that the utmost degree of publicity should be given to them either by public declarations or in any other more effectual manner one word more and i have done instances have not been wanting in history when an innocent person has offered to satiate the resentment of the person injured and his selfdevotion has been received in expiation what satisfaction did the offended person reap from this sacrifice—the degradation and shame belonging to it the glory of the sufferer was the disgrace of the judge it may be asked is it possible to find any case in which one person may with propriety be allowed spontaneously to subject himself to the punishment designed for another—a son for his father—a husband for his wife—a friend for his friend such cases might perhaps be imagined but it is useless to enter upon the consideration of such deviations from the ordinary course of things §   transitive punishment it has already been observed that it is the nature of all punishments to affect not only those that are the immediate objects of them but also those that are connected with the offender in the way of sympathy and their participation in his suffering is unavoidable with these we have nothing to do what we have to do with are those that the legislator by an express provision of the law inflicts upon persons connected with the delinquent—punishments the existence of which depends entirely upon the legislator and which as he has created he can abrogate them thus under the english law with respect to property of a particular description the innocent grandson by the delinquency of his father is made to lose the chance he had of succeeding to his grandfather because no title can be deduced through the corrupt blood of the father this is what by english lawyers is called corruption of blood     the strength of the argument lies in the metaphor this cabalistic expression serves as an answer to all objections the justice of the metaphor turns upon two suppositions— the one is that where a man has committed a felony stolen a horse for instance his blood immediately undergoes a fermentation and according to the system of physiology in use upon this occasion becomes really corrupt the other is that when a mans blood is in this state of putrescency it becomes just and necessary to deprive his children not only of all real property of which he was in the enjoyment but of what might thereafter be derived through him the end of punishment is to restrain a man from delinquency the question is whether it be an advantageous way of endeavouring at this to punish in any and what cases in any and what mode to any and what degree his wife his children or other descendants that is with a direct intention to make them sufferers if a man can be prevented from running into delinquency by means of punishment hung over the heads of persons thus connected with him it is not as in the cases above mentioned because it is expected that they should have it in their power to restrain him by any coercion physical or mental of their imposing it is not that they are likely to have it in their power by anything they can do in the case of the wife it is not very likely in the case of children already born it is still less likely in the case of children not yet born it is impossible what is expected to work upon him is the image of what they may be made to suffer the punishment then upon them may be and it is expected will be without any act of theirs a punishment upon him it will produce in him a pain of sympathy first we will consider the case of the wife where the punishment consists in being made to lose what is already in specific prospect viz the immoveable property in which she had her dower it has been doubted whether it were possible for a man to love another better than himself that is to be affected not merely momentarily but for a length of time together more by the pains and pleasures of another than by his own some have denied the possibility all will admit that it is extremely rare suppose it then to happen in one case out of five hundred and to do all possible honour to the marriage state let us suppose that this person whom a man loves better than he does himself is never any other than his wife but it is not so many as half the number of men of an age to commit crimes that have wives nor is there above one in a hundred who has lands of which a wife is endowed upon this calculation there is not above one man in  0000 of those that are liable to this mode of punishment on whom it would operate in as great a degree as if laid on himself in the remaining       instances in order to produce the same effect more punishment must be laid upon the innocent wife than would need to be laid upon the offending husband let us suppose for the purpose of the argument that every man loves his wife half as much as he does himself on this supposition ten degrees or grains or by what other name soever it shall be thought proper to call so many aliquot parts of punishment must be laid upon the wife in order to produce the effect of five grains laid directly upon the husband on this supposition then in       cases out of  0000 half the punishment that is laid on in this way is laid on in waste   what has been said with regard to the wife may without any very considerable variation be applied to the children in this latter case however generally speaking the affection is likely to be more uniform and certain and consequently the contemplation of the suffering they may be exposed to more certainly efficacious in restraining the commission of the act intended to be guarded against the same method making due allowance on this score will therefore apply to this as to the preceding case what follows from this therefore is that till the whole stock of direct punishment be exhausted upon the offender himself none ought in this way to be attempted to be applied through the medium of the innocent if there be any case in which forfeiture can be employed with advantage it would be that of rebellion—rebellion not treason for treason is a name applied to a variety of offences that have nothing in common but their name and if it were employed against the descendants of a rebel it should not be in the way of transitive punishment nor in the way of punishment at all but as a measure of selfdefence—of selfdefence against the mischief that might be expected not from the criminal who is no more but from his dependants when the husband is engaged in rebellion it is probable that the     affections of his wife are enlisted on the same side is it certain by no means but however it is probable is it probable that so also are his children is it certain by no means all rebellions and particularly the last scotch rebellion afford instances to the contrary but however it is probable what then should be done presume guilt and make it require an effort to exempt the party from the consequences no but presume innocence and make it require an effort on the part of the crown to afflict him let the crown be empowered immediately upon the attainder of a rebel to seize into its hands the possessions real as well as personal of his wife his children and his other descendants too with a power to continue the seizure from year to year upon special mention of each person in so many proclamations to be issued for that purpose and this too under whatever title such property may be held without suffering the law as it is now to be turned into a dead letter by expedients for giving to property such modifications as render it unforfeitable this would be a remedy exactly analogous to the suspension of the habeas corpus act putting the near kindred of a convicted rebel upon the same footing with respect to their fortunes which by that act all men without distinction are put upon with respect to their liberties this would be a certain not a casual safeguard giving strength to the government without bringing guiltless oppression upon the people state crimes with treason at the head of them may issue from various sources from indigence from resentment from ambition but in many instances they are crimes of conscience by lawyers in this country it is spoken of as one of those almost incredible abominations at which nature shudders like murder not to be committed by any man but one who has sold himself to the devil they see not or would not seem to see that the character of rebel or of loyalist turns upon the accidents of war that men may differ with the most perfect integrity and with the purest intentions about the title to the crown or to such a branch of public power as well as about a town or a piece of land and that it is only party prejudice that makes rebellion and wickedness synonymous but in those difficult and distracted times when right and duty are liable to be confounded the hydes the falklands the seldens and the hampdens divide themselves who can read the recesses of their hearts men enlist from pure motives in the worse and from sordid in the better cause now when conscience is the motive it is always probable that the same conscience which governs the principal may govern the dependants or in other words the same that governs the husband and the father may govern the wife whom he cherishes and the children whom he educates rebellion then is a family offence that treason however which consists in secretly conspiring in a united nation with a foreign enemy stands upon a very different footing this is always among offencea against conscience it can scarcely arise even from personal resentment it arises from the most sordid of all sources—lucre every one acknowledges the baseness of such a crime and a man could scarcely be more detested by the public at large than he would be if discovered by his own family this is no more a family offence than robbery or murder are family offences in this kind of offence therefore there is not the same reason for casting the family upon the mercy of the crown whatever the family suffers is endured without reason and in waste §   disadvantages of this mode of punishment   from what has been said except in the above case of rebellion it will be pretty apparent that in point of certainty this mode of punishment is eminently deficient in by far the greater number of cases in which the offence has been committed this punishment cannot take place for want of a subject on which to operate a man who has no wife or children cannot be punished in the persons of his wife and children couple this circumstance with the cases in which the offender will have nothing to forfeit and it will be found that the punishment will be inoperative in nine hundred and ninetynine cases out of a thousand now a punishment that is good in one case only out of a thousand is good for nothing some other punishment then must be adopted in its room this punishment must be as much as is enough in those cases otherwise there had as good be none now then as that punishment serves in all other cases why may it not in this one if it be enough in those cases it is when added to the particular punishment in question more than enough in this one now then if it be more than enough it is misery in waste it is therefore for the most part useless and whenever it is not useless it is mischievous   after this it is saying little to observe that in respect of equability it is not less defective because to a man who has no thought about his wife or children or has taken a dislike to them it is at least matter of indifference to him whatever may befall     them in this case therefore the punishment of them is so much clear waste   in respect of frugality it is in a very remarkable degree defective the quantity of evil that it is susceptible of producing is altogether boundless consider the chain of domestic connexion and calculate the number of descendants that a man may have the suffering communicates from one to another and destroys the peace of the most extensive families to produce a direct punishment which may be estimated as unity indirect and misseated punishment must be created equal to ten twenty thirty a hundred or perhaps a thousand c   it is no less deficient in point of exemplarity what the delinquent himself suffers is known always by the sentence it is in many cases visible in the execution the woman or the child who is made to suffer for his crime languishes in secret and unavailing misery   the punishment thus withdrawn from its natural course possesses not so much as the advantage of popularity it is directly adverse to the general sentiments of sympathy and antipathy when the delinquent himself is punished the public vengeance is satiated and receives no satisfaction from any ulterior punishment if he be pursued beyond the tomb and his innocent family be offered up as victims feelings of pity are excited an indistinct feeling accuses the laws of injustice humanity declares itself against them and on all sides the respect for the laws is weakened §   collective punishments i now come to another case of which examples are to be met with in the penal dispensations of most countries—that of collective punishment or the punishment of large bodies of men for the delinquencies of a part of them under the english law one instance is the punishment inflicted on a whole corporation for the delinquency of some of its members when this mode of punishment is justifiable it is only on the score of necessity now to prove this necessity two matters of fact must be made to appear one is that the guilty could not be punished without the innocent the other is that the suffering of the innocent when added to that of the guilty will not in the whole compose a mass of evil more than equivalent to the benefit of the punishment of these two matters of fact the first is easy enough to be judged of the latter must be left to vague conjecture of the administering this mode of punishment there are some remarkable instances both by common law and by statute the above principles will enable us to form a judgment of the propriety of those several proceedings by the common law it is settled that the privileges of a municipal corporation may be forfeited for the misconduct of the corporators those privileges which are indiscriminately beneficial to all the persons who are free of the corporation for the delinquency of the majority of any general assembly of those who form the governing part of it the power however of adjudging such a forfeiture has been very rarely exercised and the insidious and unconstitutional use that was attempted to be made of it in the reign of charles ii has cast a stigma on the general doctrine so that it is not likely to be ever again carried into practice such a mode of punishment is plainly unnecessary and inexpedient the particular delinquents in this way may always be ascertained and that much more easily and infallibly than in the case of ordinary offences their acts being in the very essence of them public and notorious our own times have exhibited several instances in which punishment either in reality or to appearance has been inflicted on a body of men for the misbehaviour of a part of it i will mention them in their order the first i shall mention is the case of the city of edinburgh which happened in      a very numerous mob rose up in arms seized the city guard possessed themselves of the city gates and in defiance of the public authorities put to death a captain porteous who lay under sentence of death but had been reprieved this outrage occasioned an act of parliament to be made by this act a particular punishment is inflicted upon the lord provost of the town for the particular neglect he is there charged with but besides this a fine is laid on the corporation of these punishments that on the provost we may observe was in proporiam personam the fine on the corporation was a collective punishment falling on as many persons as might find themselves in any shape prejudiced by such fine now the ground of applying this latter punishment was not the absolute impracticability of applying any punishment of the proper kind at all the provost as we see was punished for the negative offence of his neglect and it appears from another act which immediately follows that in question that a number of persons were actually fugitives for the principal offence by the second act these fugitives in case of their not surrendering within such a time were to suffer death as were also those who should conceal them if then they never surrendered they remained fugitives and were punished by banishment if they surrendered the presumption was that     they would be punished with the ordinary punishment for the offence of which they were guilty this punishment however was not thought sufficient for so enormous and dangerous an outrage as a supplement operating in the way of ex posto facto law this fine upon the corporation was thought of now from such a punishment considered in itself it is not probable that any great effects could have been expected it served however to point the moral sanction against the offence and to help to express as in the words of the act the highest detestation and abhorrence of the criminal transaction in this case as in that of rebellion what may be presumed even though the fact be not capable of being established by evidence is that there was a complicity of affection in virtue of which all the inhabitants joined in endeavouring to protect the offenders from the visitation of the law the next statute i shall take notice of in this view is that for punishment of the corruption that prevailed in the borough of new shoreham a society calling itself the christian society consisting of a large majority of the electors had formed itself and subsisted for several years for the purpose of selling the seats in parliament for that borough on this account all who were members of that society were by name with great propriety laid under a perpetual incapacitation so much considered as a punishment was a punishment in proprias personas but the proper light in which this measure ought to be considered seems not to have been that of a punishment for in this light it seems hardly to be justified if it were a punishment it was an ex post facto punishment which was the less necessary as there was already a punishment of the same kind provided by the law to wit incapacitation though it be but temporary but in truth by much the greatest part of the efficacy which it was expected to have was built on another ground on it as a measure of anticipation calculated to prevent an evil which but for such remedy it was visibly in the power and as visibly in the intention of the parties thus disabled to introduce viz a succession of representatives brought in in this corrupt and unconstitutional way it was therefore not punishment for an evil past and gone but selfdefence against an evil still impending now the expense at which this benefit was purchased for the community could not well be less in any instance than in this the franchise of electorship like any other branch of public power is not an usufructuary possession but a trust an article of property which a man holds not for his own benefit alone but for that of the whole community of which he is himself but one those who are in possession of it find means it is true of deriving from it a personal benefit to themselves but this is in direct repugnance to the interest of the community and the end of the institution so that with reference to the particular interest of the possessor it may be truly said it is of the less value to him the more conscientiously he discharges it in truth i see not why with respect to the possessor himself it ought to be looked upon as anything but the legislature went farther besides incapacitating the electors there named who were a majority but not the whole it went on and communicated the right of election to all the fortyshilling freeholders within a large district of which the borough in question was but a part in doing this they lessened the right of the innocent burghers who remained† and as to such part of it the measure if it be to be considered as a measure of punishment must be allowed to have been a punishment in alienas personas considered in this light it was not expedient since it was not necessary for the innocent not only could be but actually were distinguished from the guilty but in whatever light it may appear considered with reference to the particular persons subjected to that trifling disadvantage as a measure of reformation it cannot be too highly praised it stands as the pattern and groundwork of a great plan of constitutional improvement‡     §   random punishment random punishment is the epithet that may be applied to misseated punishment in those cases in which without previous design it has fallen upon the innocent by some caprice of the imagination taken up at the moment when the occasion and the pretence has come for the infliction of it—not so much as even the wretched sort of pretence which had place in the case of extravasated punishment having place in the present case for the illustration of this modification of misseated punishment we may again refer to the law of forfeiture to that of deodands and that of the exclusion put upon testimony when for the punishment of an inconjecturable number of innocent persons through the sides of one delinquent and by wounds of every imaginable breadth and depth and nature the fact of his delinquency forms the pretence when a man who has a freehold interest in any lands commits an offence part of the punishment for which is the forfeiture of such interest and then sells or mortgages or in any other manner disposes of that interest and is afterwards attainted for the offence the law takes it back from those in whose favour it was disposed of without deigning to inquire whether they knew anything of his having committed it an individual commits a secret murder and sells you an estate twenty years after he is discovered prosecuted attainted the king that is somebody who assumes his name seizes the estate if you have devised it charged it sold it—if besides yours it has passed through fifty other hands it makes no difference if it was your wife who had been murdered it would make no difference you would lose your wife by the crime and your fortune by the punishment it might be supposed that the law looked upon itself as driven to this expedient by the apprehension of fraudulent conveyances but this is not the case in the case of moveable and other personal property it recognises the practicability of distinguishing fraudulent conveyances from fair it establishes the latter it vacates only the former yet it is obvious that immoveable property is much less obnoxious to such a fraud than moveable with all this the author of the commentaries is perfectly well satisfied this may be hard he says upon such as have unwarily engaged with the offender but what of that the cruelty and reproach continues he must lie on the part not of the law but of the criminal who has thus knowingly and dishonestly involved others in his own calamities to one who can reason in this manner nothing that is established can come amiss so long as there is the least particle of guilt not only in him who is punished but in any one else no law by which punishment is inflicted can be cruel no law deserving of reproach another instance of random punishment is that of deodands you are a farmer you employ a waggon you send your son to drive it he slips down is run over and killed the king or somebody in his name is to have your waggon this is the consolation which the law of england gives you for your loss this idea might be improved upon let it be a law that when a man happens to break his neck the people of his parish shall draw lots who shall be hanged to keep him company the punishment would be greater but the reason for punishment would be the same if instead of a waggon it had been a ship that was moving to your sons death it would make no difference though the ship were laden with the treasure of the indies it would make no difference the ship and its lading would be the kings the source from whence this institution flowed is pretty generally known but it is not perhaps so generally observed that the institution is not a just consequence even from the ideas then received it was established it is not easy to say how early but however in the days of catholicism in those days as soon as a mans soul had left its body it used to go to a place called purgatory there to be broiled for  0000 years now in this life some souls love music others not but in that post life which was then to come all souls were fond of it alike luther himself who ought to know is positive of it not that all music was to their taste it was only a particular kind of music such as only priests know how to sing but it was not reasonable that priests should sing unless they were paid for it for the labourer is worthy of his hire now when a man died thus suddenly it was not probable that he should have made any provision by     his will for paying them therefore it was necessary that somebody else should pay them so far was in order but why resort to any other fund than the mans own property was he the poorer for having died a violent death than if he had died a natural one or for dying by the effect of a thing in motion than if he had died by a fall from a thing at rest and if after all he had nothing to pay for himself could not the parish or the hundred or the next abbey have paid for him i would not swear but the sages who invented this notable institution might think to do a spite to the thing the waggon the ship or whatever it was by making it forfeited as the athenians exterminated a stone that struck a man and killed him that is carried it out of their country and threw it into another many a public institution which the lawyer admires with humble deference has had no better ground the next instance of random punishment which i would give consists in the exclusion put upon testimony i could wish to give the reader a precise list of the offences to which this punishment is annexed but this i find to be impossible every principle delivered on this subject teems with contradiction the enumeration which is sometimes made includes nearly every principal crime comprehending treason perjury forgery and such like crimes theft all crimes considered infamous and felony as to felony this is spoken of as if it were a particular species of crime the case is that felony is a collection of crimes as heterogeneous as can be conceived and which have nothing in common between them but the accidental circumstance of being punished with the same punishment crimes of mere resentment or malicious mischief are by scores of statutes made felonies homicide intentional in the heat of passion or unintentional by an unlucky blow is felony rape is felony crimes of lewdness are felonies what is not felony the evidence of persons excommunicated is not received the reason annexed by some has been that these individuals not being under the influence of religion cannot be believed on their oath by others it has been generally said that those who converse with excommunicated persons are excommunicated with them and consequently they cannot be admitted to receive any questions from a court of justice of this nature are the reasons frequently given for existing laws in the books of english jurisprudence without longer stopping therefore to ascertain in what cases testimony is refused let us proceed to examine if this be a proper punishment that is to say if there be any case in which because a man has committed a crime his testimony ought to be rejected the only reason there can be for rejecting a witness is this that it appears more probable that after every expedient that can be put in practice to get the truth of him the account he gives of the matter would rather mislead those who are to judge than set them right i say mislead the judges i do not say be a false one for whether it be true or not is what to the purposes of justice is a matter of indifference the point is for them to be enabled to form such a notion of the fact in dispute as shall prove a true one by what means they come at it is no matter he would commit perjury indeed but that is quite another evil and an evil for which there is another and more proper remedy than that of prematurely repelling his evidence this want of veracity therefore is no objection to him unless he has the faculty of maintaining to the last such a degree of consistency and plausibility as shall enable him to conceal it as to want of veracity it should be considered that the greatest liar in the universe rarely swerves from truth i mean what to him seems truth in one instance out a hundred the natural bent of all mankind is to speak truth it requires the force of some particular interest real or imaginary to overbalance that propensity some men it is true are made to deviate from it by very slender motives but nobody tells a lie absolutely without a motive now then do but suppose him absolutely without any interest to give a false account and the most abandoned criminal that ever was upon the earth might be trusted to as safely as the man of the most consummate virtue where then lies the difference in this that the profligate man may easily be made to fancy he has such an interest in telling falsehood as shall preponderate over the interest he fancies he has in speaking truth the easier the more profligate he is the man of virtue not without difficulty the more difficulty the more he is confirmed in virtue now a motive to speak truth in cases where he is called upon by law to give his testimony is what every man has and unless he be insane must conceive himself to have he has it from the political sanction in the penalties which the law denounces against falsehood in such cases he has it from the moral sanction in the infamy annexed by men in general to such a conduct he has it from the religious sanction unless he be an atheist and except in as far as dispensations or absolutions may intervene to take it off the interest which a man may have on the other hand to speak falsehood in such a case may be distinguished into a natural interest and an artificial one what i mean by a natural interest need not be explained i call     that an artificial interest which he may derive in the way of reward by the express act of him who has some natural interest if you are at law for an estate you have a natural interest in my telling any story true or false that may serve to establish your title if you give me a reward for telling such a story i have an artificial one which is raised up in me by you now whether a man have a natural interest or no in the fate of a contest is in general pretty easy to be known it is a question of itself and if determined in the affirmative the tendency of the law is to reject a man as a witness upon that distinct ground and without regard to his probity or improbity the question is here concerning an artificial interest the existence or nonexistence of which does not so readily lie within proof but the lights that are to be had are to be drawn from such circumstances as may appear to affect the description of a mans general character thus much only is certain that in proportion as a man is more or less confirmed in virtue the less or the more likely is any artificial motive which may be presented to him to preponderate over the motives he has to speak truth and be effective so as to determine him to speak falsehood it is here proper to be upon our guard against a vulgar error men of narrow experience of hasty judgment and of small reflection—in a word the bulk of mankind have in a manner but two classes in which to stow a man in respect of merit they know but of two characters the good man and the bad man if then they happen to view a mans conduct in any instance in a favourable light up he goes among the good men if in an unfavourable down he goes among the bad men and they fix a great gulph between the two if their opinion with respect to either come to change as they have no intermediate stages he is removed from his station with the same violence as he was at first placed in it but men of observation and cool reflection who have had patience and sagacity to make a narrow search into human nature learn to correct the errors of this indolent and hasty system they know that in the scale of merit mens characters rise one above the other by infinite and imperceptible degrees and at the same time that the highest is distant from the lowest by a much less space than is commonly imagined those who admit the truth of these observations will see how precarious and illcontrived a means the law takes to come at truth by giving into the error above noticed by making one class of men which it will hear and another of men whom it will not suffer to be heard in any case or on any account in a word for this is the sum of the argument they will see that while the law enjoins the exclusion of any class of persons at all events in order to avoid a small degree of possible inconvenience it embraces a great degree of certain inconvenience it is manifest that the smaller the number of persons is whom it guards against in proportion to those from whom it remains still exposed to danger the less is the advantage gained by it whom then does it guard against a few hundreds perhaps in a nation and from whom does it remain exposed to danger the rest of the nation for who is it from whom it does not stand exposed in any case to a danger of this kind i declare is more than i can imagine if there be any man now living that can lay his hand upon his heart and solemnly declare that in no instance trivial or important has he ever departed from the rigid line of truth upon the prospect of advantage he has either more hypocrisy than i would wish to impute to any man or more virtue than i can persuade myself to exist in any man the only person about whom i can be sure and who yet would not willingly yield the palm of integrity to any one that lives nor barter any atom of it for any other honour the world has to bestow is far i know from the thoughts of making any such pretensions there are cases in which the best man alive could scarcely be credited without danger there are cases in abundance in which the worst man alive might be believed with safety such are all those where the circumstances of the case afford the witness no natural motive to speak falsely and the circumstances of the parties are such as can afford him no artificial one i am for instance as bad a man as for the suppositions sake you would choose to have me i happen to see one man beating another who afterwards seeks his remedy at law against the oppressor and calls me as a witness and the only witness now it has happened that i have been convicted of perjury over and over again as many times as you please i would swear my fathers life away for a penny but the parties are both of them miserably poor they neither of them have a penny to tempt me with what then is there to induce me to give a false account of the matter nothing what then is the danger of admitting me none at all what the consequence of rejecting me the triumph of oppression now in a case like this there is nothing singular nor improbable a thousand such might a man figure to himself with ease having proceeded thus far i will venture to advance this position that a mans testimony ought not to be rejected at all events even for the crime of perjury if not for perjury it will follow à fortiori not for any     other crime i will just offer a farther consideration or two in support of this opinion i will then give a short sketch of the evil consequences that result from such an absolute rejection i will thirdly offer an expedient which i think would answer every good purpose of it and lastly i will state the different degrees of reason there may be for extending the incapacity to the different crimes that may be proposed now then let the crime of which the witness has been convicted be that of perjury he has however no natural interest to speak false if he have that forms another ground of disability which is not here in question if then he have an artificial interest it is the party that must give it him but in this case the party must be a suborner unless then he stand already convicted of subornation on a former occasion there can be no ground for repelling the perjured witness without peremptorily attributing to another man whose character stands unimpeached a crime of a similar complexion—a supposition which no rule either of law or reason seems to warrant i cannot help thinking that these rules of peremptory incompetency would never have been laid down had those who first started them gone deliberately and circumspectly to work and carefully examined the consequences on both sides of the question the evil consequences of the rule they seemed scarcely to have cast their eyes on they seem to have gone to work as if they had witnesses enough in every case to pick and choose out of on which supposition certainly they would do well to discard the worst to pick out and retain none but the best and such as should be proof against all exception all this was mighty well provided there was no danger on the other side but the danger on the other side is terrible it is a truth however which i can scarce help looking upon as very obvious and certainly it is an important one that to mark any man out as disabled from witnessing at all events is to grant all men a license to do to him and before him all manner of mischief whatsoever now as to what may be done to him that indeed may be taken as so much punishment of the proper kind though it would be a strange loose and inconsiderate method of laying a man under proscription but as to mischief that may be done to others in his presence or which in any other way others may suffer for want of his evidence—the case of pendoch and mackendar† may serve as an example by the statute which is called the statute of frauds and perjuries three witnesses are necessary to a will of land in this case the will had three witnesses as it ought to have two stood unimpeached but it was found out that the other once upon a time had been convicted of petty larceny and been whipt this was before the attestation—how long it does not appear the suit was commenced five years afterwards this man being deemed a bad witness and as such not to be heard there wanted the requisite number and the man in whose favour the will had been made lost the estate one may imagine the shock to a person who thought he had all the security for his estate which the law could give him one may imagine the surprise and indignation the testator were he to arise out of his grave must feel at seeing his disposition vacated by an incident which common prudence could never have prompted him to guard against unless by looking in a mans face he could have told that once in his life he had been guilty of a trifling breach of honesty and been whipt for it the limits of this design will not permit me to expatiate upon this subject any further by suggesting cases of like mischief that are liable to happen or collecting such as are known actually to have happened this general sketch of them being given the intelligent reader will readily excuse me from entering into the detail because a woman has been guilty of perjury or any other offence which has rendered her testimony inadmissible it is just that she should be punished but is it just is it proper that she should be delivered over to the lust of every man to whom her beauty may become an object of desire if the law were known to be in this respect as it is said to be the nation would become a scene of lust cruelty and rapine but it happens here as it will sometimes happen in other instances one mischief operates as a palliative to another the extreme absurdity of the law is veiled by mens utter ignorance of its contents let us turn back and look on the other side what then would be the mischief of admitting the testimony of a man thus stigmatized i see none none at least that can for a moment stand in competition with the mischief on the other side but the person so stigmatized does not deserve to be believed does he not why am i to think so because you say so no but because men in general will say so too and will they then yes surely will they i do believe it and therefore it is i say there is no danger let him be known for what he is and a jury will be under the strongest bias not to believe him their prejudice will bear strong against him nor will any thing less than the strongest degree of probability and the most perfect consistency in the whole     narration be sufficient to induce them to believe it i see not what it is that should justify the extreme distrust which judges have shown of juries in establishing this rule especially as in case of a conviction of an innocent person which is the greatest danger the case is open to it is so entirely in the power of the judge to save the convict the general prejudice of mankind as we have before observed leads them to exaggeration in the judgment they pronounce of the general tenor of a mans character from a single action in particular to spread the stain that a single act of delinquency brings upon a mans character farther than according to reason it ought to go it is from having been the dupes as i take it of this prejudice that even judges—the ancient judges who first laid down the law upon this point first broached this rule it may always be expected to work at least as strongly as it ought to work upon juries taken from the body of the people were it then abolished the conduct of juries then you think would nearly be the same as if it subsisted i think it probable what advantage then would you gain by the abolition this great one the chance that a delinquent might have of impunity in such a case would no longer be visible upon paper he would no longer see a formal licence given him by the letter of the law to commit all manner of wickedness in presence of an object circumstanced like the party in question if a guilty person were acquitted upon that ground it would appear as if upon the whole the story was not credible and that in fact no such crime was committed as was charged not that having been committed it was suffered to go unpunished this then is the advantage and i think a more conclusive one cannot well be required to justify any institution all that prudence requires in such a case is that the character of the witness that is to say the offence of which he was formerly guilty should be known that those who are called upon to weigh his testimony may be able to judge how far he is to be believed suppose the party has been guilty of perjury this crime most particularly affects his credibility there is a great difference to be observed in the quality of the crime when committed in selfdefence in ones own cause and when committed on the subornation of a stranger and in an attack upon the life of an innocent person such distinctions are most important and readily offer themselves to those who consult the dictates of common sense and do not suffer their eyes to be blinded by the mist of technical jargon the time which has elapsed since the offence was committed is a consideration of importance a man in his youth at fourteen or fifteen years of age was led to take a false oath and was convicted he becomes reformed during thirty or forty years he maintains an unimpeachable character his reformation is of no consequence the record of his forgotten crime is dragged from the dust with which it had been covered in accordance with this rule his testimony must be rejected upon every principle of common sense and of utility it would have been equally admissible with any other in the prosecution of criminals the testimony of those who have a manifest interest in their condemnation is not refused whether that interest be pecuniary or arising from a desire of vengeance such testimony is however received with distrust and caution this is well—be equally distrustful of a witness whose previous conduct has rendered him suspected but hear him and examine whether the circumstances of his crime are of a nature to affect his credibility on each particular occasion §   cause of the frequency of misseated punishment as to the cause of the abuse thus made of punishment it lies not very deep below the surface it lies partly in the strength of the selfregarding and dissocial passions partly in the weakness of the intellectual faculties on the part of legislators and of judges acting in the place of legislators it lies more particularly in the strength of the dissocial passions and in that one of the false principles rivals to the principle of utility viz in the principle of sympathy and antipathy in the production of which the dissocial affections influenced and swollen to that pitch in which they assume the name of passion have so large a share urged on by the dissocial passion of antipathy misguided by the principle of sympathy and antipathy men in power have punished because they hated taking as a sufficient warrant for the infliction of the sufferings which they proposed to themselves to inflict the existence of that hatred of which as towards the person in question in consideration of the act in question the existence was demonstrated to them by their own feelings that which was the cause became naturally the measure of what was done punishing because of his hate it was to the man with the strong hand matter of course to punish in proportion to his hate a lot of punishment in which so much suffering and no more would fall upon the innocent as consistently with the application of punishment to the guilty was unavoidable sufficed not for the gratification of his hate of that satisfaction which consists in his contemplation of anothers suffering he would have as much more as was to be had and   0 frequently there was scarce a price so as it was at the expense of others only that that price was made up and not any part at his expense—there was scarce a price at which he was not content to purchase it book v of complex punishments chapter i inconveniences of complex punishments we have before observed that a penal act is not simple in its effects does not produce one single evil that it produces many masses of evil at once a punishment considered as an act may be simple—considered in its effects complex a man is imprisoned here is a simple punishment as respects the act on the part of the judge but as respects the individual the evils resulting from it may be very various affecting in different ways his fortune his person his reputation and his condition in life a simple punishment is that which is produced by a single act of punishment a compound punishment is that which requires more than one operation the punishment for an offence may include imprisonment a fine a mark of infamy c if all these are announced by the law—if each of these punishments is expressed by a clear and familiar term the punishment though compound or complex may be a good one improper complex punishments are those of which the integral parts are not known those which include evils that the law does not announce which are only expressed by obscure and enigmatical names which do not exhibit their penal nature in clear characters and which are only understood by lawyers of this kind are transportation felony with and without benefit of clergy præmunire outlawry excommunication incompetency as a witness and many others everything which is uncertain everything which is obscure offends against the first condition in framing a good law the inconveniences attached to complex punishments when thus defined are very great but they may be explained in a few words the legislator knows not what he does the subject knows not what is meant by the punishment threatened it becomes impossible for the legislator to do what is proper in each case he therefore does either too much or too little every obscure expression veils from his eyes the nature of the punishment or punishments he employs he strikes blindfolded and scatters suffering at hazard the jury and the judges who witness the inconveniences of the law in each particular case allow themselves to employ all possible means to avoid them they usurp the authority of the legislator and perjury becomes the habitual palliative of his injustice or improvidence if the law is executed what happens—the judge in inflicting one useful punishment is obliged to inflict a multitude of useless punishments—punishments of which the offenders had only an imperfect idea which produce mischief in pure waste oftentimes the mischief spreads over persons who are entire strangers to the offence and the consequences are such that the legislator would have trembled had he foreseen them we have already spoken of incompetency as a witness we shall now direct our attention to the other punishments above named chapter ii of transportation among the advantages which the north americans have derived from their independence there is one which cannot fail to strike every man who has any feeling of national pride it has saved them from the humiliating obligation of receiving every year an importation of the refuse of the british population of serving as an outlet for the prisons of the mother country whereby the morals of their rising people were exposed to injury by a mixture with all possible kinds of depravity north america after having been exposed to this scourge for upwards of a century no longer serves as a receptacle for these living nuisances but can any limits be assigned to the moral effects that may have been produced by this early inoculation of vice i shall have occasion again to recur to this important topic when in speaking of the colony at new south wales and of the population now forming there i shall point out the inconveniences which result from sending thither these periodical harvests of malefactors the present object is to show that the system of transportation as now managed is essentially different from what it was under the old system and that with the change of scene the punishment itself has in many respects been materially altered in some respects for the better in many others for the worse under the old system of transportation to america power being given for that purpose by parliament the convicts destined for transportation were made over by the government to a contractor who for the profit to be made by selling their services for the penal     term to a master in america engaged to convey them to the scene of banishment to banishment—the banishment prescribed by law—was thus added in all cases in which the individuals were not able to purchase their liberty the ulterior and perfectly distinct punishment of bondage but wherever it happened that through the medium of a friend or otherwise the convict could bid more for himself than would be given for his services by a stranger he was set at liberty in the first port at which he arrived the punishment was limited as respected him to simple banishment the individual was therefore punished with bondage rather for his poverty than for the crime he had committed thus the most culpable—those who had committed great crimes and who had contrived to secure the profits of their crimes were least punished the minor thieves novices and inexperienced malefactors who had not secured their plunder bore the double chain of banishment and slavery under the system of transportation to botany bay the whole expense is borne by the government the governor of the colony always retains an authority over the convicts and acts as their goaler he provides them with habitations employment and food they are placed under his sole controul he may employ them either in public or private works hard labour with some few exceptions is the lot of all exemption from it cannot be purchased by money in this respect the inequality above spoken of has been greatly corrected and the punishment having been rendered more certain is consequently more efficacious transportation to america was attended with another inconvenience that country presented too many facilities for the return of the convicts a great number of them availed themselves of these opportunities and returned to the mother country to exercise their fatal talents with superior skill—some when their terms of banishment had expired many before that period had arrived as to the latter the facility of return was one among the disadvantages attending transportation to america as to the others in the eyes at least of those who conceive that the commission of one offence ought not to operate as a forfeiture of all title to justice this facility of return could not fail to appear as an advantage on the other hand the distance of botany bay afforded a better security against illegal returns being situated at the antipodes of britain with scarcely any existing commerce when first selected the return of any of the convict population was an event hardly to be looked for whilst however a security thus effectual was provided against the return of convicts whose terms had not expired an equally effectual barrier was raised against the return of those whose terms had expired and thus at one stroke all inferior degrees of this punishment were in nearly all cases indiscriminately converted into the highest whether such an effect was intended or not is is needless to inquire but that such was the effect is indisputable transportation under the present system is a complex punishment composed first of banishment and second of hard labour—banishment a punishment eminently defective particularly in respect of its inequality hard labour a punishment in itself eminently salutary but when connected with banishment and as in this case carried on under every possible disadvantage failing altogether to produce any beneficial effects in order to show how completely adverse the system of transportation to new south wales is to the attainment of the several objects or ends of penal justice it will be necessary shortly to recapitulate what those ends or objects are and then to show from the accounts which have been furnished respecting the state of the convict population of that colony in what degree these ends or objects have been respectively fulfilled   the main object or end of penal justice is example—prevention of similar offences on the part of individuals at large by the influence exerted by the punishment on the minds of bystanders from the apprehension of similar suffering in case of similar delinquency of this property transportation is almost destitute this is its radical and incurable defect the punishment is not seen by—it is hidden abstracted from the eyes of those upon whom it is desirable it should operate in the way of example punishments which are inflicted at the antipodes—in a country of which so little is known and with which communication was so rare could make only a transient impression upon the minds of people in this country the people says an author who had deeply considered the effects of imagination the mass of the people make no distinction between an interval of a thousand years and of a thousand miles it has been already said but cannot be too often repeated and enforced that the utility and effect of example is not determined by the amount of suffering the delinquent is made to endure but by the amount of apparent suffering he undergoes it is that part of his suffering which strikes the eyes of beholders and which fastens on their imagination which leaves an impression strong enough to counteract the temptation to offend however deficient they may be in respect of exemplarity the sufferings inflicted on persons condemned to this mode of punishment are not the less substantial and severe confinement for an unlimited time in prisons or     in the bulks—a voyage of from six to eight months itself a state of constant sufferance from the crowded state of the ships and the necessary restraint to which convicts are subjected—the dangers of the sea—exposure to contagious diseases which are often attended with the most fatal consequences such are some of the concomitants of the system of punishment in question which serves as the introduction to a state of banishment and bondage in a distant region in which the means of subsistence have been extremely precarious and where by delay in the arrival of a vessel the whole colony has been repeatedly exposed to all the horrors of famine it is scarcely possible to conceive a situation more deplorable than that to which the convicts thus transported have been exposed constant hard labour and exposure to depredation if they have anything of which they can be plundered and occasional starvation without the means of mending their condition while they remain there without the hope of ever leaving it such has been the condition to which persons banished to this colony for periods that in pretence were limited have found themselves exposed here then is punishment partly intentional partly accidental dealt out with the most lavish profuseness but compared with its effects in the way of example it may be considered as so much gratuitous suffering inflicted without end or object a sea of oblivion flows between that country and this it is not the hundredth nor even the thousandth part of this mass of punishment that makes any impression on the people of the mother country—upon that class of people who are most likely to commit offences who neither read nor reflect and whose feelings are capable of being excited not by the description but by the exhibition of sufferings the system of transportation has moreover this additional disadvantage which not merely neutralizes its effects in the discouragement of offences but renders it in many cases an instrument of positive encouragement to the commission of offences a variety of pleasing illusions will in the minds of many persons be connected with the idea of transportation which will not merely supplant all painful reflections but will be replaced by the most agreeable anticipations it requires but a very superficial knowledge of mankind in general and more especially of the youth of this country not to perceive that a distant voyage a new country numerous associates hope of future independence and agreeable adventures will be sufficiently captivating to withdraw the mind from the contemplation of the painful part of the picture and to give uncontrouled sway to ideas of licentious fascinating enjoyment ii the second end or object of punishment is reformation—prevention of similar offences on the part of the particular individual punished in each instance by taking from him the will to commit the like in future under this head what has been done in the colony of new south wales by referring to facts we shall find not only that in this respect it has been hitherto radically defective but that from the nature of things it ever must remain so connected with the system of transportation to the american colonies there were two circumstances highly conducive to the reformation of the convicts transported their admission upon landing in the country into families composed of men of thrift and probity their separation from each other when a master in america had engaged a convict in his service all the members of the family became interested in watching his behaviour working under the eye of his master he had neither the inducements nor the means of giving loose to his vicious propensities the state of dependence in which he was placed gave him an obvious interest in cultivating the goodwill of those under whose authority he found himself placed and if he still retained any principle of honesty it could scarcely fail to be invigorated and developed under the encouragement that it would find in the society with which he was surrounded thus it was in america how is it in new south wales to receive the convicts upon their landing a set of brutes in human shape a species of society beyond comparison less favourable to colonization than utter solitude—few other inhabitants but the very profligates themselves who are sent by thousands from british goals to be turned loose to mix with one another in this desert—together with the few taskmasters who superintend their work in the open wilderness and the military men who are sent out with them in large but still unequal numbers to help to keep within bounds the mischief they would otherwise be sure to occupy themselves with when thus let loose here then there were not as in america any families to receive the convicts any means of constantly separating them from each other no constant and steady inspection fieldhusbandry is under this system the principal employment hence general dispersion—fieldhusbandry carried on by individuals or heads of families each occupying a distinct dwelling the interior of which is altogether     out of the habitual reach of every inspecting eye it is true that the police officers occasionally go their rounds to maintain order and keep the convicts to their work but what is to be expected from a system of inspection at long intervals and which is as disgusting to the inspectors as to the inspected can this be regarded as a sufficient check against sloth gaming drunkenness incontinence profaneness quarrelling improvidence and the absence of all honourable feeling immediately the back of the inspector is turned all the disorder which his actual presence had suspended is renewed it may easily be imagined how completely all controul may be set at defiance by a set of men who have regularly organized among themselves a system of complicity and who make it a matter of triumph and agreeable pastime to assist each other in escaping from inspection on this subject the public have long been in the possession of a very valuable document it is a complete history of the first sixteen years since the establishment of this colony which in respect of fidelity possesses every title to confidence and which states the events as they happened in the form of a journal accompanied with the necessary details what gives the work the highest claim to confidence is that the historiographer is also the panegyrist the professed panegyrist of the establishment—a character which when accompanied as in this instance with that candour and those internal marks of veracity with which it is so rare for it to be accompanied renders the testimony in this point of view more than doubly valuable the general impression left by a perusal of this work is one of sadness and disgust it is a history of human nature in its most degraded and depraved state—an unmixed detail of crimes and punishments—the men constantly engaged in conspiracies against the government always forming plans for deceiving and disobeying their taskmasters forming among themselves a society of refractory and wily profligates—a society of wolves and foxes—the women everywhere else the best part of humanity prove in new south wales a remarkable exception to this general rule the late chief magistrate says the women are worse than the men and are generally found at the bottom of every infamous transaction that is committed in the colony his work abounds with passages to the same effect of such materials is it that the foundation of the colony is formed from such a stock and under such auspices is it that the rising generation is to be produced the historian has not confined himself to vague imputations of general immorality and profligacy but has particularized the acts of delinquency on which those imputations rest the crimes that are committed at new south wales in spite of the alertness of the government and the summary administration of justice surpass in the skill and cunning with which they are managed every thing that has been ever witnessed in this country almost every page of his work contains the description of offences against persons or against property either of individuals or of the public gaming and drunkenness produce perpetual quarrels which usually end in murder the crime of incendiarism is there practised to an extent altogether unexampled in any other country churches prisons public and private property are all alike subjected to the devouring element without any regard to the extent of the loss that may be occasioned or the number of lives that may be sacrificed when the public gaol was set on fire says the historian it will be read with horror that at the time there were confined within the walls twenty prisoners most of whom were loaded with irons and who with difficulty were snatched from the flames feeling for each other was never imputed to these miscreants and yet if several were engaged in the commission of a crime they have seldom been known to betray their companions in iniquity† the bond of connexion is not sympathy for each other but antipathy to the government the common enemy for the natives they manifest as little feeling as towards each other spite of the rigour of the law these european savages are guilty of the most wanton acts of barbarity towards the natives of the country instead of cultivating a good understanding with them which might have been attended with many advantages they have converted them into the most determined enemies so far from exhibiting any symptoms of reformation the longer they are subjected to the discipline of the colony the worse they become whatever may be the degree of viciousness ascribed by the historian to the convicts during the continuance of their term they appear in his history to be in a certain degree honest sober and orderly in comparison with those whose term is expired and who afterwards become settlers they then become the prime instigators of all the crimes committed in the colony and constitute the principal source of the embarrassment to which the government is subjected in proof of this assertion the historian furnishes a most satisfactory piece of evidence during the first five years subsequent to the establishment of the colony and when there were no convicts whose terms had expired the conduct of the convicts was in general orderly and such as to give hopes of a disposition to reformation but in proportion as by the expiration of their respective terms     the number of the emancipated colonists increased the most ungovernable licentiousness was introduced not only those that were thus recently emancipated as if to make up for the time they had lost abandoned themselves to every species of excess but they encouraged the natural viciousness of those who still remained in a state of bondage—the convicts finding among these independent settlers who were their old companions and associates receivers of stolen property and protectors from the punishments denounced by the law always ready to receive them in their retreat from justice and to conceal them from detection became more insolent and refractory anxiously waiting for the time when they also would be entitled to assume this stage of savage independence what possible means can be devised to neutralize this perpetually increasing influx of vice all the expedients that have hitherto been employed have proved completely fruitless and there would be no difficulty in showing that so they must ever be instruction moral and religious seems almost altogether vain the very nature of the population bids defiance to the establishment of an effectual system of police or to an uniform administration of the laws rewards were found as inefficient as goodwill in procuring evidence the enormous consumption of spirituous liquors the principal cause of all the disorders in the colony has from local circumstances hitherto been found altogether irrepressible under each of these heads a few remarks may suffice with respect to religious instruction little could be expected from two or three chaplains for a colony divided into eight or ten stations each to appearance at too great a distance from the rest to send auditors to any other to minds so disposed as those of the convicts of what advantage was the attendance on divine service for one or two hours on one day in the week and with what profit could religious instruction be expected to be received by men who were made as the historian expresses it to attend divine service to rid themselves of the occasional listlessness they were thus made to endure the church was got rid of by an incendiary plot to punish them if by accident another building fit for the purpose had not been already in existence they were to have been employed on the sunday in the erecting another building for the purpose† to work on sunday they might be made but will they ever be made to lend an attentive ear and a docile heart to authorative instruction even the women says the historian were extremely remiss in their attendance on divine service and were never at a loss for mendacious pretences for excusing themselves in short instead of being observed as a day dedicated to religious duties sunday appears in that colony to have been distinguished only by the riot and debauchery with which it was marked—those who did not attend divine service taking advantage of the absence of those who did to plunder their dwellings and destroy their crops it has just been seen with how very sparing a hand religious instruction for the protestant part of the establishment was supplied for the spiritual instruction of the catholic part of the colony which from the large importations made from ireland must now have become very numerous it does not appear that any provision whatever was made it is true that in one of the importations of convicts from ireland a priest of the catholic persuasion whose offence was sedition was comprised‡ if instead of a seditious clergyman would not the expense have been well bestowed in sending out a loyalist clergyman of the same religious persuasion∥ as to the police it is necessarily in an extreme degree debilitated by the corrupt state of the subordinate class of public functionaries in a population that warranted the utmost distrust on the part of the government it was found necessary to restrain the free intercourse between the several parts of the colony all persons officers excepted were forbidden to travel from one district of the settlement to another without passports these regulations proved however altogether nugatory the constables whose duty it was to inspect these passports§ either from fear or corruption neglected to do their duty whilst as has been already mentioned a most effectual bar to the preservation of any wellregulated system of police was found in those convicts whose terms had expired and who were ever ready to give protection and assistance to the criminal and turbulent with regard to all classes of offences committed in this colony justice was paralyzed by a principle which ensured impunity and which it seems impossible to eradicate with the historian who was also judge advocate it is a matter of perpetual complaint that it     was scarcely possible to convict an offender who was not taken in the very act of committing an offence evidence was on almost all occasions altogether as inaccessible as if there had been a combination and tacit agreement among the majority of the inhabitants of the colony to paralyze the arm of justice by a refusal to bear testimony he speaks of five murders in one year      which were left unpunished notwithstanding the strong presumptions which indicated the guilty parties because the necessary witnesses would not come forward even though extraordinary rewards were offered one such fact is sufficient it is superfluous to cite others of the same nature the most prominent cause of this state of abandoned profligacy is the universal and immoderate passion for spirituous liquors it is the exciting cause which leads to every species of vice—gaming dissoluteness depredation and murder servants soldiers labourers women the youth of both sexes prisoners and their gaolers are all alike corrupted by it it was carried to such a pitch that numbers of the settlers were in the practice of selling the whole of their crops as soon as they were gathered in order to purchase their favourite liquor the attempts made from time to time by the government to check this practice have proved altogether unavailing the policy of the government upon this point appears not to have been quite steady sometimes it has allowed the trade in spirituous liquors at other times it has been forbidden but whatever may be the policy of the government experience shows that from the diffusiveness of the population as well as from other causes no precautions within its power will ever diminish the quantity of this liquid poison consumed in any part of the colony the greater the population and the more distant the stations from the seat of government the more easy will it be to carry on private distilleries and to prevent them from being detected and even if the supply thus produced were unequal to the demand it would be impossible to prevent smuggling on an extent of coast which the whole navy of england would be unequal to guard if it were found impossible to restrain this evil when the colony was confined to a single station and a single harbour can any better success be looked for now that the settlements are spread wide over the face of the country when there are numerous settlers constantly employed in the manufacture of this article and every ship that arrives is provided with an abundant supply the sale of it being more certain and more profitable than that of any other commodity such has been the state of the convict population of this colony—past reformation none—future reformation still more hopeless we have perhaps dwelt too long upon this part of the subject fortunately the topics which remain may be compressed into a narrower compass iii the third object or end of punishment is incapacitation—taking from the delinquent the power of committing the same crimes transportation accomplishes this object with relation to a certain place the convict whilst in new south wales cannot commit crimes in england the distance between the two places in a considerable degree precludes his illegal return and this is the sum of the advantage whilst the convict is at botany bay he need not be dreaded in england but his character remains the same and the crimes which are mischievous in the mother country are mischievous in the colony we ought not therefore to attribute to this punishment an advantage which it does not possess that an inhabitant of london should rejoice in the removal to a distance of a dangerous character is easily comprehended his particular interest is touched but a punishment ought not to meet the approbation of a legislature which without diminishing the number of crimes committed only changes the place of their commission the security great as it may appear to be against returns both legal and illegal has not been so effectual as might have been expected the number of convicts who left the colony between the years    0 and      the accounts of which are scattered over the whole of collins work amount in the whole to     of which    consisted of those whose terms had expired and    of those whose terms had not expired this is however very far from being the total amount of either description of those that had quitted the colony with or without permission escapes are in various parts of the work mentioned as being made in clusters and the numbers composing each cluster not being stated could not be carried to the above account the number of escapes will most probably increase as commerce extends and as the convicts become more numerous and consequently possess greater facilities for escaping iv the fourth end or object of punishment is the making compensation or satisfaction to the party injured on this head there is but one word to be said—the system of transportation is altogether destitute of this quality it is true that this objection has no weight except in comparison with a system of punishment in which provision is made out of the labour of     the offender for compensation to the party injured v the fifth end or object proper to be kept in view in a system of penal legislation is the collateral object of economy if it could be said of the system in question that it possessed all the several qualities desirable in a plan of penal legislation its being attended with a certain greater degree of expense would not afford a very serious objection to it but in this case this system the most defective in itself is at the same time carried on at a most enormous expense upon this subject the   th report of the committee of finance contains the most accurate and minute information from that report it appears that the total expense incurred during the ten or eleven first years of the establishment ending in the year      amounted to £ 0  000 which sum being divided by the number of convicts will be found to amount to about £   ahead a possible reduction is in that report contemplated which might in time cut down the expense to about £   per head to this expense however must be added the value of each mans labour since if not considered as thrown away the value ought to be added to the account of expense consider new south wales as a large manufacturing establishment the master manufacturer on balancing his accounts would find himself minus £   for every workman that he employed what enhances the expense of this manufacturing establishment beyond what it would be in the mother country are—  the expense incurred in conveying the workmen to a distance of between two and three thousand leagues   the maintenance of the civil establishment consisting of governors judges inspectors police officers c   the maintenance of a military establishment the sole object of which is to preserve subordination and peace in the colony   the wide separation of the workmen their untrustworthiness their profligacy favoured by the local circumstances of the colony and the trifling value of the labour that can be extracted by compulsion from men who have no interest in the produce of their labour   the high price of all the tools and raw materials employed in carrying on the manufactory which are brought from europe at the risk and expense of a long voyage if it be impossible to find a single clerk in manchester or liverpool who would not have taken all these circumstances into his consideration in making such a calculation as that in question and if after or without having made it there is not one man of common sense who would have undertaken such a scheme a necessary conclusion is that the arithmetic of those who risk their own property is very different from that of those who speculate at the expense of the public in addition to the evils above enumerated as attending the system of transportation to new south wales the punishment thus inflicted is liable to be attended with various species of aggravation making so much clear addition to the punishment pronounced by the legislator when a punishment is denounced by the legislature it ought to be selected as the one best adapted to the nature of the offence his will ought to be that the punishment inflicted should be such as he has directed he regards it as sufficient his will is that it should not be made either more lenient or more severe he reckons that a certain punishment when inflicted produces a given effect but that another punishment if by accident coupled with the principal one whether from negligence or interest on the part of subordinates exceeding the intention of the law is so much injustice and being nugatory in the way of example produces so much uncompensated evil the punishment of transportation which according to the intention of the legislator is designed as a comparatively lenient punishment and is rarely directed to exceed a term of from seven to fourteen years under the system in question is in point of fact frequently converted into capital punishment what is the more to be lamented is that this monstrous aggravation will in general be found to fall almost exclusively upon the least robust and least noxious class of offenders—those who by their sensibility former habits of life sex and age are least able to contend against the terrible visitation to which they are exposed during the course of a long and perilous voyage upon this subject the facts are as authentic as they are lamentable in a period of above eight years and a half viz from the  th of may      to the   st december      of five thousand one hundred and ninetysix embarked five hundred and twentytwo perished in the course of the voyage nor is this all the accounts being incomplete out of twentyeight vessels in twentythree of which the mortality just spoken of is stated to have taken place there are five in respect of which the number of deaths is not mentioned a voyage however long it may be does not necessarily shorten human existence captain cook went round the world and returned without the loss of a single man it necessarily follows therefore that a voyage which     decimates those that are sent upon it must be attended with some very peculiar circumstances in the present case it is very clear that the mortality that thus prevailed arose partly from the state of the convicts partly from the discipline to which they were subjected allow them to come on deck everything is to be apprehended from their turbulent dispositions confine them in the hold and they contract the most dangerous diseases if the merchant who contracts for their transportation or the captain of the ship that is employed by him happen to be unfeeling and rapacious the provisions are scanty and of a bad quality if a single prisoner happen to bring with him the seeds of an infectious disorder the contagion spreads over the whole ship a ship the hillsborough which in the year      was employed in the conveyance of convicts out of a population of  00 lost  0  it was not says colonel collins a neglect of any of the requisite precautions but the gaol fever which had been introduced by one of the prisoners that caused this dreadful ravage whatever may be the precautions employed by any single accident or act of negligence death under its most terrific forms is at all times liable to be introduced into these floating prisons which have to traverse half the surface of the globe with daily accumulating causes of destruction within them before the diseased and dying can be separated from those who having escaped infection will have to drag out a debilitated existence in a state of bondage and exile can the intention of the legislator be recognised in these accumulated aggravations to the punishment denounced can he be said to be aware of what he is doing when he denounces a punishment the infliction of which is withdrawn altogether from his controul—which is subjected to a multiplicity of accidents—the nature of which is different from what it is pronounced to be—and in its execution bears scarce any resemblance to what he had the intention of inflicting justice of which the most sacred attributes are certainty and precision—which ought to weigh with the most scrupulous nicety the evils which it distributes—becomes under the system in question a sort of lottery the pains of which fall into the hands of those that are least deserving of them translate this complication of chances and see what the result will be i sentence you says the judge but to what i know not—perhaps to storm and shipwreck—perhaps to infectious disorders—perhaps to famine—perhaps to be massacred by savages—perhaps to be devoured by wild beasts away—take your chance—perish or prosper—suffer or enjoy i rid myself of the sight of you the ship that bears you away saves me from witnessing your sufferings—i shall give myself no more trouble about you but it may perhaps be said that however deficient in a penal view new south wales possesses great political advantages it is an infant colony the population will by degrees increase the successively rising generations will become more enlightened and more moral and after the lapse of a certain number of centuries it will become a dependent settlement of the highest political importance the first answer to this is if it be thought to require any that of all the expedients that could have been devised for founding a new colony in this or in any other place the most expensive and the most hopeless was the sending out as the embryo stock a set of men of stigmatized character and dissolute habits of life if there be any one situation more than another that requires patience sobriety industry fortitude intelligence it is that of a set of colonists transported to a distance from their native country constantly exposed to all sorts of privations who have everything to create and who in a newlyformed establishment have to conciliate a set of savage and ferocious barbarians justly dreading an invasion on their lives and property even an oldestablished and wellorganized community would be exposed to destruction from an infusion of vicious and profligate malefactors if effectual remedies were not employed to repress them such characters are destitute of all qualities both moral and physical that are essential in the establishing a colony or that would enable them to subdue the obstacles opposed by nature in its rude and uncultivated state where colonization has succeeded the character of the infant population has been far different the founders of the most successful colonies have consisted of a set of benevolent and pacific quakers—of men of religious scruples who have transported themselves to another hemisphere in order that they might enjoy undisturbed liberty of conscience—of poor and honest labourers accustomed to frugal and industrious habits†     chapter iii panopticon penitentiary the plans of mr bentham upon this subject are already before the public for the purpose of the present work it will be only necessarily shortly to explain the three fundamental ideas which he lays down— i a circular or polygonal building with cells on each story in the circumference in the centre a lodge for the inspector from which he may see all the prisoners without being himself seen and from whence he may issue all his directions without being obliged to quit his post ii management by contract—the contractor undertaking the whole concern at a certain price for each prisoner reserving to himself the disposal of all the profit which may arise from their labours the species of which is left to his choice under this system the interest of the governor is as far as possible identified with his duty the more orderly and industrious the prisoners the greater the amount of his profits he will therefore teach them the most profitable trades and give them such portion of the profits as shall excite them to labour he unites in himself the characters of magistrate inspector head of a manufactory and of a family and is urged on by the strongest motives faithfully to discharge all these duties iii responsibility of the manager—he is bound to assure the lives of his prisoners a calculation is made of the average number of deaths in the year among the mixed multitude committed to his care and a certain sum is allowed to him for each but at the end of the year he is required to pay a similar sum for every one lost by death or escape he is therefore constituted the assurer of the lives and safe custody of his prisoners but to assure their lives is at the same time to secure the multitude of cares and attentions on which their health and wellbeing depend publicity is the effectual preservative against abuses under the present system prisons are covered with an impenetrable veil the panopticon on the contrary would be so to speak transparent—accessible at all hours to properly authorized magistrates—accessible to everybody at properly regulated hours or days the spectator introduced into the central lodge would behold the whole of the interior and would be a witness to the detention of the prisoners and a judge of their condition some individuals pretending to a high degree of sensibility have considered this continual inspection which constitutes the peculiar merit of mr benthams plan as objectionable it has appeared to them as a restraint more terrible than any other tyranny they have depicted an establishment of this kind as a place of torment in so doing these men of sensibility have forgotten the state of most other prisons in which the prisoners heaped together can enjoy tranquillity neither day nor night they forget that under this system of continual inspection a greater degree of liberty and ease can be allowed—that chains and shackles may be suppressed—that the prisoners may be allowed to associate in small companies—that all quarrels tumults and noise bitter sources of vexation will be prevented—that the prisoners will be protected against the caprices of their gaolers and the brutality of their companions whilst those frequent and cruel instances of neglect which have occurred will be prevented by the facility of appeal which will be afforded to the principal authority these real advantages are overlooked by a fantastic sensibility which never reasons let us suppose a prison established upon this plan and then observe in what manner it contributes to the several ends of punishment— first end— example it would be placed in the neighbourhood of the metropolis where the greatest number of persons are collected together and especially of those who require to be reminded by penal exhibitions of the consequences of crime the appearance of the building the singularity of its shape the walls and ditches by which it would be surrounded the guards stationed at its gates would all excite ideas of restraint and punishment whilst the facility     which would be given to admission would scarcely fail to attract a multitude of visitors and what would they see—a set of persons deprived of liberty which they have misused—compelled to engage in labour which was formerly their aversion—and restrained from riot and intemperance in which they formerly delighted the whole of them clothed in a particular dress indicating the infamy of their crimes what scene could be more instructive to the great proportion of the spectators what a source of conversation of allusion of domestic instruction how naturally would the aspect of this prison lead to a comparison between the labour of the free man and the prisoner—between the enjoyments of the innocent and the privations of the criminal and at the same time the real punishment would be less than the apparent—the spectators who would have only a momentary view of this doleful spectacle would not perceive all the circumstances which would effectively soften the rigours of this prison the punishment would be visible and the imagination would exaggerate its amount its relaxations would be out of sight no portion of the suffering inflicted would be lost the greater number even of the prisoners being taken from the class of unfortunate and suffering individuals would be in a state of comfort whilst ennui the scourge of ordinary prisons would be banished second object— reformation idleness intemperance and vicious connexions are the three principal causes of corruption among the poor when habits of this nature have become to such a degree inveterate as to surmount the tutelary motives and to lead to the commission of crimes no hope of reformation can be entertained but by a new course of education—an education that shall place the patient in a situation in which he will find it impossible to gratify his vicious propensities and where every surrounding object will tend to give birth to habits and inclinations of a nature altogether opposite the principal instrument which can be employed on this occasion is perpetual superintendence delinquents are a peculiar race of beings who require unremitted inspection their weakness consists in yielding to the seductions of the passing moment their minds are weak and disordered and though their disease is neither so clearly marked nor so incurable as that of idiots and lunatics like these they require to be kept under restraints and they cannot without danger be left to themselves under the safeguard of this continual inspection without which success is not to be expected the penitentiary house described includes all the causes which are calculated to destroy the seeds of vice and to rear those of virtue   labour—it is admitted that constraint instead of inspiring a taste for labour is calculated to augment the aversion to it it must however be recollected that in this case labour is the only resource against ennui—that being imposed upon all it will be encouraged by example and rendered more agreeable by being carried on in the company of others it will be followed by immediate reward and the individual being allowed a share in the profits it will lose the character of servitude by his being rendered in some measure a partner in the concern those who formerly understood no lucrative business will in this new course of education obtain new faculties and new enjoyments and when they shall be set free will have learned a trade the profits of which are greater than those of fraud and rapine   temperance—we have already had occasion to show that nearly all the crimes committed at botany bay either originate or are increased by the use of spirituous liquors and that it is impossible to prevent their use here the evil is arrested in its source it will not be possible to smuggle in a drop of this poison transgressions will therefore be impossible man yields to necessity difficulties may stimulate his desires but an absolute impossibility of satisfying them destroys them when they are not supported by long established habits there is much humanity in a strict rule which prevents not only faults and chastisements but temptations also   separation into classes—the panopticon is the only practicable plan which admits of the prisoners being divided into little societies in such manner as to separate those whose vicious propensities are most contagious these associations can hardly fail to afford opportunities for the performance of reciprocal services for the exercise of the affections and the formation of habits favourable to reformation the relation of master and scholar will gradually be formed among them opportunities will thus be given for bestowing rewards for instruction—for exciting emulation in learning and the creation of a sentiment of honour and selfesteem which will be among the first fruits of application ideas of improvement and lawful gains will by degrees supplant those of licentiousness and fraudulent acquisition all these advantages arise out of the very nature of the establishment why should not unmarried prisoners be allowed to intermarry it would operate as a powerful spur to those who aimed at attaining this reward which should only be bestowed on account of orderly conduct and industry these little societies present an additional  00 security arising from their mutual responsibility it is both just and natural to say to them you live together you act together you were able to have prevented this crime and if you have not so done you are accomplices in it thus the prisoners would be converted into guardians and inspectors of each other each cell would be interested in the good conduct of every one of its members if any one of them should be distinguished for its good order some distinction might be bestowed upon it which should be visible to all by such means a feeling of honour might be excited even in the abode of ignominy   instruction—indigence and ignorance are the parents of crime the instruction of those prisoners who are not too old to learn confers upon them many benefits at once it affords great assistance in changing the habits of the mind and elevating them in their own estimation from the class of beings who are degraded on account of the inferiority of their education different studies may usefully fill up the intervals of time when mechanical operations are suspended—both prudence and humanity dictating the occupation of those intervals instead of abandoning to themselves minds to whom idleness is a burthen difficult to bear but the object is much more important especially with regard to young offenders who form the largest proportion of the whole the prison should be their school in which they should learn those habits which should prevent their ever entering it again the services of religion ought to be rendered attractive in order that they may be efficacious they may be performed in the centre of the building without the prisoners quitting their cells the central lodge may be opened for the admission of the public the worship adapted to the nature of the establishment may be accompanied with solemn music to add to its solemnity the chaplain engaged in its performance would not be a stranger to the prisoners his instructions should be adapted to the wants of those to whom they are addressed he would be known to them as their daily benefactor who watches over the progress of their amendment who is the interpreter of their wishes and their witness before their superiors as their protector and instructor as a friend who consoles and who enlightens them he would unite all the titles which can render him an object of respect and affection how many sensible and virtuous men would seek a situation which presents to a religious mind opportunities for conquests more interesting than the savage regions of africa and canada there is at all times great reason for distrusting the reformation of criminals experience too often justifies the maxim of the poet   lhonneur est comme une ile escarpée et sans bords   on ny peut plus rentrer dès quon en est dehors but those who are most distrustful and incredulous of good must acknowledge at least that there is a great difference to be made in this respect on account of the age of the delinquents and the nature of their offences youth may be moulded like soft wax whilst advanced age will not yield to new impressions many crimes are not deeply rooted in the heart but spring up there from seduction example and above all indigence and hunger some are sudden acts of vengeance which do not imply habitual perversity these distinctions are just and not controverted it must also be admitted that the plan we have described presents the most efficacious means for the amendment of those who have preserved some remains of honest principle third object— suppression of power to injure whatever may be its effects in producing internal reformation and correcting the will the panopticon unites all the conditions requisite for the prevention of the commission of new offences under this head the prisoners may be considered at two periods—the period of their imprisonment the period posterior to their liberation during the first suppose them as wicked as you will what crimes can they commit whilst under uninterrupted inspection—divided by cells at all times sufficiently strong to resist a revolt—unable to unite or to conspire without being seen—responsible the one for the other—deprived of all communication with the exterior—deprived of all intoxicating liquors those stimulants to dangerous enterprises—and in the hand of a governor who could immediately isolate the dangerous individual the simple enumeration of these circumstances inspires a feeling of perfect security when we recall the picture of botany bay the contrast becomes as striking as it can be rendered the prevention of crimes on the part of delinquent prisoners is also in proportion to the difficulty of their escape and what system affords in this respect a security comparable to that of the panopticon with respect to discharged prisoners the only absolute guarantee is in their reformation independently of this happy effect which may be expected in this plan more than upon any other the liberated prisoners would for the most part have acquired by the savings made for them out of their part of the profit of their labour a stock which will secure them from the immediate temptations of want and give them time to avail themselves  0  of those resources of industry which they have acquired during their captivity but this is not all i have reserved for this chapter the mention of an ingenious plan which the author of the panopticon has proposed as a supplement to this scheme of punishment he has paid particular attention to the dangerous and critical situation of discharged prisoners when reentering the world after a detention perhaps for many years they have no friends to receive them—without reputation to recommend them—with characters open to suspicion and many times perhaps in the first transports of joy for recovered liberty as little qualified to use it with discretion as the slaves who have broken their fetters by these considerations the author was led to the idea of an auxiliary establishment into which the discharged prisoners might be admitted when they left the panopticon and be allowed to continue for a longer or shorter period according to the nature of their crimes and their previous conduct the details of the plan would be foreign to the present subject it must suffice to say that in this privileged asylum they would have different degrees of liberty the choice of their occupations the entire profit of their labour with fixed and moderate charges for their board and lodging and the right of going and returning on leaving a certain sum as a security they would wear no prisoners uniform no humiliating badge the greater number in the first moment of their embarrassment whilst they have no certain object in view would themselves choose a retreat so suitable to their situation this transient sojourn this noviciate would serve to conduct them by degrees to their entire liberty it would be an intermediate state between captivity and independence and afford a proof of the sincerity of their amendment it would afford a just precaution against individuals in whom an immediate and absolute confidence could not be reposed without danger fourth object— compensation to the party injured in most systems of jurisprudence when a delinquent has been corporally punished justice is thought to have been satisfied it is not in general required that he should make compensation to the party injured it is true that in the greater number of cases compensation could not be exacted of him delinquents are commonly of the poorer class—ex nihilo nihil fit if they are idle during their imprisonment far from being able to render satisfaction they constitute a charge upon society if they are condemned to public works these works rarely sufficiently lucrative to cover the expense of undertaking them cannot furnish any surplus it is only in a plan like the panopticon in which by the combination of labour and economy in the administration it is possible to obtain a profit sufficiently great to offer at least some portion of indemnity to the parties injured mr bentham had made engagements upon this head in his contract with the ministers in the prisons of philadelpnia they levy upon the portion of profit allowed to the prisoner the expenses of his detection and prosecution one step more and they will grant indemnity to the parties injured fifth object— economy to say that of two plans of equal merit the most economical ought to be preferred is to advance a proposition which must appear trivial to all those who do not know that the expense of an enterprise is often its secret recommendation and that economy is a virtue against which there exists a general conspiracy in the conract for the panopticon one thousand convicts were to have cost the state £   per head without including the expense of constructing the prison which was estimated at £  000 and the ground at £ 0000 upon which reckoning interest at £  per cent £    0s ought to be added for the annual expense of each making the total expense of each individual £     0s per annum it should be recollected that at this time the average expense of each convict in new holland was £   per annum nearly three times as much besides the author of the panopticon assured—   an indemnity to the parties injured   he allowed a fourth part of the profits of their labour to the prisoners   he was to make a future reduction in the expense to government a new undertaking like that of the panopticon intended to embrace many branches of industry would not yield its greatest profits at first it would be expensive at first and only become profitable by degrees time would be required for establishing its manufactories and for the cultivation of the grounds applicable to the support of the establishment for forming its pupils and regulating their habits in a word bringing to perfection the whole economy of its system mr bentham had expressly stipulated for the publicity of his accounts and if the advantages as was expected had become considerable the government would have been enabled to take advantage of them in obtaining more favourable terms in its subsequent contracts mr bentham reckoned from the calculations he had made and respecting which he had consulted experienced persons that after a short time the convicts would cost the government nothing  0  laying aside everything hypothetical it is clear that a penitentiary at home ought to be less expensive than a colonial establishment the reasons for this opinion have been given when speaking of transportation to botany bay i have shown the excellence of this plan with reference to all the ends of punishment it remains to be observed that it attains its object without producing any of those collateral inconveniences which abound in colonial transportation there is no prolonged sojourn in the hulks—none of the dangers of a long sea voyage—no promiscuous intercourse of prisoners—no contagious sickness—no danger of famine—no warfare with the savage natives—no rebellions—no abuse of power by the persons in authority—in short an entire absence of the accidental and accessory evils of which every page of the history of the penal colony affords an example what an immense economy in the employment of punishment it will no longer be dissipated and lost upon barren rocks and amid far distant deserts it will always preserve the nature of legal punishment—of just and merited suffering without being converted into evils of every description which excite only pity the whole of it will be seen it will all be useful it will not depend upon chance its execution will not be abandoned to subordinate and mercenary hands the legislator who appoints it may incessantly watch over its administration the success which may be obtained from a wellregulated penitentiary is no longer a simple probability founded upon reasoning the trial has been made it has succeeded even beyond what has been hoped the quakers of pensylvania have the honour of making the attempt it is one of the most beauteous ornaments of the crown of humanity which distinguishes them among all other societies of christians they had for a long time to struggle with the ordinary obstacles of prejudice and indifference on the part of the public—the routine of the tribunals and the repulsive incredulity of frigid reasoners the penitentiary house at philadelphia is described not only in the official reports of its governor but also in the accounts of two disinterested observers whose agreement is the more striking as they brought to its examination neither the same prejudices nor views the one was a frenchman the duke de liancourt well acquainted with the arrangements of hospitals and prisons—the other an englishman captain turnbull more occupied with maritime affairs than politics or jurisprudence both of them represent the interior of this prison as a scene of peaceful and regular activity hauteur and rigour are not displayed on the part of the gaolers nor insolence nor baseness on the part of the prisoners their language is gentle a harsh expression is not permitted if any fault is committed the punishment is solitary confinement and the registration of the fault in a book in which every one has an account opened as well for good as for evil health decency and propriety reign throughout there is nothing to offend the most delicate of the senses no noise no boisterous songs nor tumultuous conversation every one engaged with his own work fears to interrupt the labours of others this external peace is maintained as favourable to reflection and labour and well calculated to prevent that state of irritation so common elsewhere among prisoners and their keepers i was surprised said captain turnbull at finding a woman exercising the functions of gaoler this circumstance having excited my curiosity i was informed that the husband having filled the same situation before her amidst the attentions he was paying to his daughter he was seized with the yellow fever and died leaving the prisoners to regret that they had lost a friend and protector in consideration of his services his widow was chosen to succeed him she has discharged all the duties with equal attention and humanity where shall we find similar traits in the registers of a prison they call up the pictures of a future golden age depicted by the prophet when the wolf shall lie down with the lamb and a little child shall lead them i cannot refuse to transcribe two other facts which do not stand in need of any commentary—during the yellow fever in      there was much difficulty in obtaining nurses for the sick in the hospitals at bush hill recourse was had to the prison the question was asked the danger of the service was explained to the convicts as many offered themselves as were wanted they discharged their duties faithfully till the conclusion of that tragic scene and none of them demanded any wages till the period of their discharge the females gave another proof of good conduct during the course of the contagion they were requested to give up their bedsteads for the use of the hospital they willingly offered their beds also oh virtue where wilt thou hide thyself exclaimed the philosopher upon witnessing an act of probity on the part of a beggar would he have been less surprised at this act of heroic benevolence in a criminal prison had this good conduct of the prisoners been only a simple suspension of their vices and crimes it would have been a great point gained but it extended much further— of all the criminals who have been found  0  guilty says turnbull there has not been five in each hundred who have been in the prison before at new york although the result has not been so favourable it exhibits the good effects of the system—during the five years ending in   0  says mr eddy the principal governor of the penitentiary in the account rendered to his fellowcitizens of three hundred and fortynine prisoners who have been set at liberty at the expiration of their sentences or by pardons twentynine only have been convicted of new offences and of this twentynine sixteen were foreigners of eightysix pardoned eight have been apprehended for new offences and of this eight five were foreigners it must however be remembered that we may guard against exaggeration that of these liberated prisoners many may have expatriated themselves and committed crimes in the neighbouring states being unwilling to expose themselves to the austere imprisonment of new york or philadelphia for it is a fact that the risk of death is less frightful to men of this temper than laborious captivity the success of these establishments is without doubt owing in great measure to the enlightened zeal of their founders and inspectors but it has permanent causes in the sobriety and industry established and the rewards bestowed for good conduct the rule which has ensured sobriety has been the entire exclusion of strong liquors no fermented liquor is allowed not even small beer it has been found more easy to insure abstinence than moderation experience has proved that the stimulus of strong liquors has only a transitory effect and that an abundant and simple nourishment with water for the only drink fits men for the performance of continued labours many of those who entered the prison of new york with constitutions enfeebled by intemperance and debauchery have regained in a short time under this regime their health and vigour the duke de liancourt and captain turnbull have entered into more precise details we learn from them that since the adoption of this system the charge for medicines which amounted annually to more than twelve hundred dollars has been reduced to one hundred and sixty this fact affords a still stronger proof of the salubrity of this prison this exposition in which i have omitted many favourable circumstances without suppressing anything of a contrary nature is sufficient to show the superiority of penitentiaries over the system of transportation if the results have been so advantageous in america why should they be less so in england the nature of man is uniform criminals are not more obstinate in the one place than the other the motives which may be employed are equally powerful the new plan proposed by the author of the panopticon presents a sensible improvement upon the american methods—the inspection is more complete—the instruction more extended—escape more difficult publicity is increased in every respect the distribution of the prisoners by means of cells and classes obviates the inconvenient association which subsists in the penitentiary at philadelphia but what is worth more than all the rest is that the responsibility of the governor in the panopticon system is connected with his personal interest in such manner that he cannot neglect one of his duties without being the first to suffer whilst all the good he does to his prisoners redounds to his own advantage religion and humanity animated the founders of the american penitentiaries will these generous principles be less powerful when united with the interests of reputation and fortune the two grand securities of every public establishment—the only ones upon which a politician can constantly rely—the only ones whose operation is not subject to relaxation—the only ones which always being in accordance with virtue may perform its part and even replace it when it is wanting chapter iv felony felony is a word of which the signification seems to have undergone various revolutions it seems at first to have been vaguely applied to a very extensive mode of delinquency or rather for delinquency in general at a time when the laws scarce knew of any other species of delinquency cognizable by fixed rules than the breach of a political engagement and when all political engagements were comprised in one that of feudal obligation upon feudal principles everything that was possessed by a subject and was considered as a permanent source of property and power was considered as a gift by the acceptance of which the acquirer contracted a loose and indefinite kind of engagement the nature of which was never accurately explained but was understood to be to this effect that the acceptor should render certain stipulated services to the donor and should in general refrain from everything that was prejudicial to his interests it was this principle of subjection in its nature rather moral than political which at the first partition of conquered countries bound the different ranks of men by whatever names distinguished to each other—as the barons to the prince the knights to the barons and the peasants to the knights if then the acceptor failed in any of these points—if in any one of his steps he fell from the line which  0  had been traced for him and which at that time was the only line of duty he was not such a man as his benefactor took him for the motive for the benefaction ceased he lost his fief the only source of his political importance and with it all that was worth living for he was thrust down among the ignoble and defenceless crowd of needy retainers whose persons and precarious properties were subject to the arbitrary disposal of the hand that fed them so striking and impressive a figure did such a catastrophe make in the imaginations of men that the punishment of death when in course of time it came in various instances to be superadded to the other showed itself only in the light of an appendage it came in by custom rather than by any regular and positive institution it seemed to follow rather as a natural effect of the impotence to which the inferior was reduced than in consequence of any regular exertion of the public will of the community this seems to have been the aspect of the times at the first dawnings of the feudal polity but it was impossible things should long remain in so unsettled a state it is in such times however that we are to look for the origin of a word which sometimes as the name of a crime sometimes as a punishment is to be met with in the earliest memorials that are extant of the feudal law some etymologists to show they understood greek have derived it from the greek if they had happened to have understood arabic they would have derived it from the arabic sir edward coke knowing nothing of greek but having a little stock of latin learning which he loses no opportunity of displaying derives it from fel gall spelman who has the good sense to perceive that the origin of an old northern word is to be looked for in an old northern language rejecting the greek and saying nothing of the latin proposes various etymologies according to one of them it is derived from two words—fee which in ancient anglosaxon had and in modern english has a meaning which approaches to that of property or money and lon which in modern german he says means price fee lon is therefore pretium feudi this etymology the author of the commentaries adopts and justifies by observing that it is a common phrase to say such an act is as much as your life or estate is worth but felony in mixed latin felonia is a word that imports action i should therefore rather be inclined to derive it from some verb than from two substantives which when put together and declined in the most convenient manner import not any such meaning the verb to fall as well as to fail which probably was in its origin the same as the other by an obvious enough metaphysical extension is well known to have acquired the signification of to offend the same figure is adopted in the french and probably in every other language† in anglosaxon there is such a word as fellan‡ the evident root of the english word now in use in german there is such a word as faellen which has the same signification this derivation therefore which is one of spelmans is what seems to be the most natural so much for the origin of the word not that it is of any consequence whence it came so it were but gone as the rigours of the feudal polity were relaxed and fiefs became permanent and descendible the resumption of the fief upon every instance of trivial delinquency became less and less of course a feudatory might commit an offence that was not a felony on the other hand it was found too that for many offences the mere resumption of the feud was not by any means a sufficient punishment for a man might hold different feuds of as many different persons the sovereign too interposed his claim on behalf of himself and the whole community and exacted punishments for offences which to the immediate lord of the feudatory might happen not to be obnoxious in this way for various offences pecuniary and corporal punishments in various degree and even death itself came in some instances to be substituted—in others to be superadded by positive laws to that original indiscriminating punishment which used at first to follow from almost every offence that punishment remained still inseparably annexed to all those offences which were marked by the highest degree of corporal punishment the punishment of death partly with a view of giving the lord an opportunity of ridding himself of a race of vassals tainted by an hereditary stain partly in order to complete the destruction of the delinquents political as well as natural existence the punishment of forfeiture being the original punishment still continued to give denomination to the complex mass of punishment of which it now constituted but a part the word felony now came to signify a punishment viz the complex mode of punishment of which  0  that simple mode of punishment which anciently stood annexed to every delinquency a feudatory could incur was a main ingredient at this period of its history when the above was its signification the word felony was as a part of the norman jurisprudence imported into this country by the norman conquerors for among the saxons there are no traces of its having been in use at this period it stood annexed only to a few crimes of the grossest nature—of a nature the fittest to strike the imagination of rude and unreflecting minds and these not very heterogeneous theft robbery devastation when committed by the ruinous instrument of fire or upon the whole face of a country with an armed force these and homicide the natural consequences of such enterprises or of the spirit of hostility which dictated them were included by it at this time the import of the word felony was not either as the name of a punishment or as the name of an offence as yet immeasurably extensive but lawyers by various subtleties went on adding to the mass of punishment still keeping to the same name at the same time legislators compelled by various exigencies went on adding to the list of offences punishable by the punishment of that name till at length it became the name not of one but of an incomprehensible heap of punishments nor of one offence only but of as many sorts of offences almost as can be conceived tell me now that a man has committed a felony i am not a whit the nearer knowing what is his offence all i can possibly learn from it is what he is to suffer he may have committed an offence against individuals against a neighbourhood or against the state under any natural principle of arrangement upon any other than that which is governed by the mere accidental and mutable circumstance of punishment it may be an offence of any class and almost of every order of each class the delinquents are all huddled together under one name and pelted with an indiscriminating volley of incongruous and many of them unavailing punishments felony considered as a complex mode of punishment stands at present divided into two kinds the one styled felony without benefit of clergy or in a shorter way felony without clergy or as capital punishment is one ingredient in it capital felony the other felony within benefit of clergy felony within clergy or clergyable felony the first may be styled the greater—the latter the lesser felony there are other punishments to which these are more analogous in quality as well as in magnitude than the one of them is to the other such is the confusion introduced by a blind practice and as the consequence of that practice an inapposite and illdigested nomenclature how punishments so widely different came to be characterized in the first place by the same generic name and thence by specific names thus uncouth and inexpressive shall be explained by and by after we have analyzed and laid open the contents of the greater felony of which the other is but an offset detached from the main root history of the benefit of clergy the christian religion ere yet it had gained any settled footing in the state had given birth to an order of men who laid claim to a large and indefinite share in the disposal of that remote but boundless mass of pains and pleasures which it was one main business of that religion to announce this claim in proportion as it was acquiesced in gave them power for what is power over men but the faculty of contributing in some way or other to their happiness or misery this power in proportion as they obtained it it became their endeavour to convert as it is in the nature of man to endeavour to convert all power into a means of advancing their own private interest—first the interest of their own order which was a private interest as opposed to the more public one of the community at large and then of the individuals of that order in this system of usurpation a few perhaps had their eyes open but many more probably acted under the sincere persuasion that the advancement of their order above that of others was beneficial to the community at large this power in its progress to those ends would naturally seek the depression and by degrees the overthrow of the political power of any other that opposed it these operations carried on by an indefinite multitude of persons but all tending to the same end wore the appearance of being carried on in concert as if a formal plan had been proposed and unanimously embraced by the whole clergy to subdue the whole body of the laity whereas in fact no such plan was ever universally concerted and avowed as in truth there needed none the means were obvious—the end was one and the same there was no fear of clashing each succeeding operator took up the work where his predecessor had left off and carried it on just so far as interest prompted and opportunity allowed in pursuance of this universal plan not concerted but surer than if it had been the result of concert were those exemptions laid claim to which by a long and whimsical concatenation of causes and effects were the means of breaking down the punishment of felony into the two species of it that now subsist the persons of these favoured mortals honoured as they pretended they were by a more immediate intercourse with the divinity  0  and employed as they were incessantly in managing the most important and indeed only important concerns of mankind were of course to be accounted sacred—a word of loose and therefore the more convenient signification importing at bottom nothing more than that the subject to which it was attributed was or was not to be accounted an object of distant awe and terror they were therefore not to be judged by profane judgments sentenced by profane mouths or touched in any manner that was unpleasant to them by profane hands the places wherein that mysterious intercourse was carried on imbibed the essence of this mysterious quality stones when put together in a certain form became sacred too earth within a certain distance round about those stones became sacred too hence the privilege of sanctuary in short the whole of the material as well as intellectual globe became divided into sacred and profane of which so much as was sacred was either composed of themselves or become subjected to their power the rest of it lay destitute of these invaluable privileges and as the name imports tainted with a note of infamy i pass rapidly over the progress of their claim of exemption from profane judicature the reader will find it ably and elegantly delineated in sir w blackstones commentaries as to the causes those which come under the denomination of felonies are the only ones with which at present we have to do contining our consideration therefore to these causes as to persons it was first claimed one may suppose for those of their own order—by degrees for as many as they should think fit for that particular purpose to recognise as belonging to that order by degrees the patience of profane judges was put to such a stretch that it could hold no longer and they seem to have been provoked to a general disallowance of those exceptions which had swelled till they had swallowed up in a manner the whole rule this sudden and violent reformation wearing the appearance of an abuse the clergy had influence enough in the legislature to procure an act to put a stop to it by this act it was provided that all manner of clerks as well secular as religious which shall be from henceforth convict before the secular justices for any treasons or felonies touching other persons than the king himself or his royal majesty shall from henceforth freely have and enjoy the privilege of holy church and shall be without any impeachment† or delay delivered to the ordinaries‡ demanding them this statute one should have thought would have been sufficiently explicit on the one hand to secure the exemption to all persons in clerical orders so on the other hand to exclude all persons not possessed of that qualification to prove a person entitled to the exemption the obvious and only conclusive evidence was the instrument of ordination but the different ranks of persons who were all comprised under the common name of clerks and as such partook more or less of the sacred character were numerous and some of these seem to have been admitted to their offices without any written instrument of ordination whether this omission was continued on purpose to let in a looser method of evidence or whether it was accidental so it is that the clergy had the address to get the production of that written evidence dispensed with in the room of it they had the address to prevail on the courts to admit of another criterion which ridiculous as it may seem at this time of day was not then altogether so incompetent orders they said or might have said may be forged or may be fabricated for the purpose but as a proof that the man really is of our sacred order you shall have a proof that can neither be forged nor fabricated he shall read as we do the book was probably at first a latin book—the bible or some other book made use of in church service at that time few who were not clergymen could read at all and still fewer could read latin and the judges if they happened to see through the cheat might in some instances perhaps not be sorry to connive at it in favour of a man possessed of so rare and valuable a qualification but one book was easily substituted for another a man might easily be tutored so as to get by rote a small part of a particular book and as society advanced to maturity learning became more and more diffused we need not wonder therefore if by the time of henry viith it was found that as many laymen as divines were admitted to the ecclesiastical privilege—i should suppose a great many more for there is something in the ecclesiastical function that in the worst of times will render them less liable than others of the same rank and fortune to fall into open and palpable enormities a statute∥ therefore was made to apply a remedy to this abuse and what would one imagine was that remedy to oblige persons claiming the benefit of clergy to produce their orders no but to provide that persons claiming it and not being in orders should not be allowed it more than once and that all persons who had once been allowed it should have a mark set upon them whereby they might be known real clergymen—clergymen  0  who had orders to produce were by an express provision of the statute entitled to claim it toties quoties as often as they should have need which privilege they have still when a felon was admitted to his clergy he was not absolutely set free but delivered to the ordinary the great point then was if we may believe lay judges who it is to be confessed are not altogether disinterested witnesses to prove him innocent for this tended to discredit the profane tribunal this business of proving him innocent was called his purgation if this were impracticable he was put to penance that is subjected to such corporal punishment as the ordinary thought proper to inflict upon him which we may imagine was not very severe thus it was that the clergy contrived to bind even the most stubborn spirits under the yoke of their dominion the honest and credulous by their fears the profligate though incredulous by their hopes circumstances however are not wanting which tend pretty strongly to make it probable that when once a man got into the hands of the clergy he almost always stood the purging and proved innocent and it is what the lay judges seem to have taken for granted would be the case of course when therefore they made a point of making the offender suffer the train of punishments that stood annexed to acknowledged guilt death excepted which was too much for them to attempt they knew no other way of compassing it than by insisting on his not being admitted to make purgation these punishments the imprisonment excepted consisted altogether of forfeitures and civil disabilities penalties with which the ecclesiastical superior had nothing to do and which it lay altogether within the province of the temporal judge to enforce one should have thought then it would have been a much less apparent stretch of authority in the latter to give effect to the proceedings of his own judicature than to lay a restraint on the ecclesiastical judge in the exercise of what was acknowledged to be his but it were too much to expect anything like consistency in the proceedings of those rude ages the whole contest between the temporal judge and the spiritual was an irregular scramble the result of which was perpetually varying according to the temper of individuals and the circumstances of the time by the time of queen elizabeth it came to be generally understood that purgation which originally meant trial was synonymous to acquittal this is so true that when by a statute of that reign purgation came to be abolished† the legislature instead of appointing a trial appointed punishment persons claiming the benefit of clergy instead of being delivered to the ordinary to make purgation were now after being burnt in the hand to be forthwith delivered out of prison unless the temporal judge should think proper to sentence them to imprisonment which he was now for the first time empowered to do for any time not exceeding a year it will here be asked what was done with the pecuniary punishments the forfeitures the corruption of blood and the disabilities the answer is nothing at all—they were never thought of however by one means or other there is now an end of them the legislator neither then nor since has ever opened his mouth upon the subject but the judge drawing an argument from that silence has opened his and construed them away this bold interpretation is a farther proof how entirely the ideas of purgation had become identified with that of acquittal when a man was admitted to make purgation he was acquitted by that means he was discharged from these pecuniary penalties now then that the legislature has appointed that in the room of going free the delinquent may now be punished by a slight punishment and that not of course but only in case the judges should think fit to order it of their own accord we cannot said the judges suppose that it meant to subject him to a set of punishments so much severer than those it has named therefore as to all but these coming in place of an acquittal we must look upon it as a pardon having by this chain of reasoning got hold of the word pardon they went on applying it to other purposes in a very absurd manner but as we have already had occasion to observe with a beneficial effect one would imagine that being to suffer  0  nothing what has been mentioned only excepted first because he was acquitted next because he was pardoned there was an end of all pecuniary penalties of the one species of forfeiture as well as the other this however neither was nor is the case a man did then and does still continue subject to the forfeiture of his personal estate the reason of this is of true legal texture and altogether characteristic of ancient jurisprudence forfeiture of real estate is not to take place till after judgment forfeiture of personal estate without the least shadow of a reason for the difference is to take place before judgment to wit upon conviction now ever since the days of henry vi it has not been the way to admit a man to plead his clergy till after conviction now then if a man comes and pleads his clergy whatever goods he had the king has got them this being the case having had your clergy you are innocent or what comes to the same thing you are forgiven all this is very true but as to your money the king you hear has got it and when the king has got hold of a mans money with title or without title such is his royal nature he cannot bear to part with it for the king can do no man wrong and the law is the quintessence of reason to make all this clear let it be observed there is a kind of electrical virtue in royal fingers which attracts to it light substances such as the moveables and reputed moveables of other men there is moreover a certain glutinous or viscous quality which detains them when they have got there such are the grounds upon which the forfeiture of personal estate in cases of clergyable felony still continues to subsist this act gave the finishing stroke to the abusive jurisdiction of the clergy the still more abusive exemption remained still but so changed and depreciated by a lavish participation of it with the laity that its pristine dignity and value was almost entirely obliterated by the turn they had given to it it was originally an instrument of unlimited dominion over others it was now sunk into a bare protection and that no longer an exclusive one for themselves at last came the statute of queen anne which gives the benefit of clergy to all men whatsoever whether they can read or cannot this together with a statute of the preceding reign† which had already given the same benefit to all women gave quite a new import to the phrase in words it confirmed and extended the abusive privilege in reality it abolished it it put the illiterate altogether upon a footing with the literate providing at the same time that in the case of the offences to which it extended both classes alike should suffer not the punishment which the unprivileged but that which the privileged had been used to suffer before since then to allow the benefit of clergy to any offence is to punish all persons who shall have committed that offence in the same manner as lettered persons were punished before it is to punish in a certain manner all persons for that offence to take away this benefit is to punish in a certain other manner much more severe all persons for that offence the difference between the having it and the taking it away is now the difference between a greater and a lesser degree of punishment the difference formerly was the allowing or not allowing an oppressive and irrational exemption but these entangled and crooked operations have been attended with a variety of mischiefs which are not by any means cured as yet and of which scarce anything less than a total revision of the criminal law can work a total cure such a veil of darkness such a cobweb work of sophistry has been thrown over the face of penal jurisprudence that its lineaments can scarcely be laid open to public view but with great difficulty and with perpetual danger of mischief of the mischief and confusion that has thus been produced i will mention one instance which will probably be thought enough in a statute of henry viii‡ by a strange caprice of the legislature the benefit of clergy was taken away in the lump from all offences whatever which should happen to be committed on the high seas he might as well have said or in such a county or by men whose hair should be of such a colour in point of expediency of a provision like this one knows not what to make considered with reference to other parts of the legal system it is reasonable as doing something towards abolishing an unreasonable distinction considered in the same point of view it is unreasonable as making that abolition no more than a partial one and grounding it as far as it went on a circumstance totally unconnected with the mischievousness of the offence considered by itself it is again unreasonable as tending to subject to the punishment of death for a great many offences a great many persons for whom a less punishment might suffice in point of fact however what the legislature meant by it is clear enough it meant that all men without exception privileged persons as well as others should suffer death and so forth who should be guilty of any kind of felonies upon the high seas instead of their being made some of them to suffer death others a punishment beyond comparison less severe would any one imagine what  0  has been the effect of this provision the effect of it has been that these privileged persons instead of suffering death have suffered no punishment at all yes absolutely no punishment—not even that slight degree of punishment to which they before were subject now the case is that at present if one may be indulged in a solecism established by the legislature all persons are privileged so that now all persons who may think proper to commit clergyable felonies on the high seas are absolutely dispunishable this situation of things in itself is not altogether as it ought to be but the means whereby it has been brought about are still worse when a man is indicted of a clergyable offence within that jurisdiction let his guilt be ever so plainly proved the constant course is for the judge to direct the jury to acquit him the man is proved to be guilty in such a manner that no one can make a doubt about it no matter the judges direct the jury to say upon their oaths that he is not guilty in the ecclesiastical tribunal we have above been speaking of things were so ordered that according to the author of the commentaries felonious clerks were not constantly but almost constantly acquitted i do beseech the reader to turn to that book and observe in what energetic terms partly his own partly adopting what had been said on the same subject by judge hobart the learned author has chosen to speak of this unjustifiable practice†—vast complication of perjury and subornation of perjury—solemn farce—mock trial—good bishop—scene of wickedness—scandalous prostitution of oaths and forms of justice—vain and impious ceremony—most abandoned perjury such are the terms he uses—to the reader it is left to make an application of them felony without benefit of clergy as to felony without benefit of clergy i will in the first place state the ingredients of which this mode of punishment is compounded of punishments included under the title of felony without benefit of clergy we must distinguish in the first place such as are made to bear upon the proper object—punishments in personam propriam and in the second place such as are thrown upon the innocent—punishments in personam alienam of punishments in personam propriam it includes the following—   a total forfeiture of goods and chattels whether in possession or in action at the time of the forfeiture taking place it is a sweeping punishment of the pecuniary kind it takes place immediately upon conviction that is upon a mans being found guilty—and does not wait for judgment that is for sentence being pronounced upon him   forfeiture of lands and tenements this also is a sweeping punishment of the pecuniary kind it does not take place till after judgment this and the other forfeiture between them include the whole of a mans property whether in possession or in action at the time of the forfeiture taking place if he does not lose it by the one he loses it by the other   the corporal punishment of imprisonment till such time as the conclusive punishment is executed upon him the length of it depends partly on the judge partly on the king   the disability to bring any kind of suit this operates as a punishment in such cases only in which a long interval as sometimes happens intervenes between the sentence and the actual infliction of the ultimate punishment   the corporal punishment of death viz simple death by hanging as this punishment in general puts a speedy period to all the rest the dwelling upon the effect of any other is what may at first sight appear useless but this is not absolutely the case for the execution of this punishment may at the pleasure of the king be suspended for any length of time and in some instances has actually been suspended for many years‡ thus much for punishment in propriam personam punishments in alienam personam included under it are the following some of them are instances of transitive others of merely random punishment— his heirsgeneral that is that person or persons of his kindred who stand next to him and so to one another in the order of succession to real property unentailed forfeit all property of that denomination which he had enjoyed and which without an express appointment of his to the contrary they would have been entitled to from him this results as a consequence of the doctrine of corruption of blood this is an instant forfeiture it is a sweeping punishment of the pecuniary kind upon the heir it may amount to a forfeiture total or partial of all the immoveable property the heir would be worth or to no forfeiture at all if previously to the commission of the offence the offender had settled upon his heirapparent the whole or any part of what property he had of the kind in question this the heir will not be deprived of   0   his heir as before forfeits his hope of succession to all such real property as he must make title to through the delinquent as standing before him in the order of consanguinity to the person last seized this is a remote contingent forfeiture—another pecuniary punishment of the sweeping kind in this the uncertainty is still greater than in the former case   any creditors of his who have had real security for their debts forfeit such security in case of its having been granted to them subsequently to the time of the offence committed this where it takes place is a fixed punishment of the pecuniary kind it is uncertain as to the person but if there be a person on whom it falls it is certain as to the event   any persons who may have purchased any part of his real property forfeit such property in case of this purchase having been made by them subsequently to the time of the offence this again is a fixed punishment of the pecuniary kind it is uncertain whether it shall fall upon any person because it is uncertain whether there be a person so circumstanced but if there be it is certain as to the event of its falling   any persons who hold lands or tenements of him under a rent are obliged to pay over again to the person on whom the forfeiture devolves whatever they may have paid to the delinquent subsequently to the time of the offence these four last denominations of persons are made to suffer in virtue of the doctrine of backrelation according to legal notions it is the delinquent that suffers by the forfeiture being made to relate back to the time of the offence as if it were a new suffering to a man to be made to have parted with what he had already parted with of his own accord in plain english it is the people themselves—the tenants purchasers and creditors that suffer it is they who forfeit and not he again by virtue of the forfeiture of what is called his personal property the following denominations of persons are made to suffer—   his wife by being deprived of whatever she would have been entitled to under his will or under the law of distributions   his children or others next of kin by losing what they might in the same manner have become entitled to   his creditors by losing all claim upon his personal estate by this forfeiture added to what takes place in the case of real estate all his creditors whatever are defrauded such only excepted as may have been fortunate enough to have obtained a real security previous to the commission of the offence we now come to felony within clergy the mass of punishments included within this title are much less various as well as less severe of punishments in propriam personam it includes only the first and third of those which are included under the other species of felony in the room of the fifth and last punishment the punishment of death there is one that takes place or rather is said to take place of course i mean marking in the hand others there are which besides the former take place optionally at the discretion of the judge conjunctively with respect to the three former—disjunctively with respect to one another this punishment of marking is now become a farce it is supposed to be inflicted in open court immediately after the convict in order to exempt himself from the punishment of the other felony has been made—if a woman to plead the statute—if a man to tell the solemn lie that he is a clerk the mark to be inflicted is according to the statute to be the letter t unless the offence be murder in which case it is to be an m murder at that time not as yet having been taken out of the benefit of clergy as it has however since the mark ought now to be that of a t in all cases the part to be marked is the brawn of the left thumb so that if a man happens to have lost his left thumb he cannot be marked at all or if afterwards he chooses to cut it off he may prevent its answering the purpose it was meant to answer that of distinguishing him from other men the instrument originally employed was a heated iron with a stamp upon it of the shape of the letter to be marked to the judges of that time this was the only expedient that occurred for marking upon the human skin such a mark as should be indelible at present the practice is to apply the iron but it is always cold this is what is called burning with a cold iron that is burning with an iron that does not burn in consequence no mark at all is made the judge presides at this solemn farce by no one is it complained of by many it is approved it is mildness humanity it is true that the law is eluded and turned into ridicule but the judge spares himself the pain of hearing the cries of a man to whose flesh a redhot iron is applied it may be asked why do not the judges propose that the law should be made conformable to the practice i cannot tell the judge that first disregarded the statute was guilty of the assumption of illegal power he who should now have the courage to obey it might now affix the prescribed mark without putting the delinquent to any considerable pain†     the other punishment which in all cases of felony within clergy may at the discretion of the judge be superadded or not to those which we have seen are those of imprisonment and transportation for the second offence of a clergyable felony capital felony is the punishment clerks in orders are alone exempted† peers are not women are expressly subjected to it it is certainly a distinction highly honourable to the clergy that they may go on pilfering while other people are hanged for it why a man having been punished for one act of delinquency should be punished more than ordinarily for a second act of the same species of delinquency or even for any other offence of the same species of delinquency there is at least an obvious if not a conclusive reason but why when a man has been punished by a certain mode of punishment and then commits an offence as different as any offence can be from the former the punishment for this second offence is because it happens to be the same with that for the first to be changed into a punishment altogether different and beyond comparison more penal is what it will not i believe be easy to say is it because the first mode of punishment having been tried upon a man the next above it in point of severity is that of capital felony that is not the case for præmunire is greatly more penal than clergyable felony i mention this as being impossible to justify not as being difficult to account for since nothing better could consistently be expected from the discernment of those early times there is one thing which a clergyable felon does not forfeit and which every other delinquent would forfeit for the most venial peccadillo and that is reputation i mean that special share of negative reputation which consists in a mans not being looked upon as having been guilty of such an offence this share of reputation the law in the single instance of clergyable felony protects a delinquent in so far forth as it is in the power of law by brute violence to counteract the force of the most rational and salutary propensities if a man has stolen twelvepence and been convicted of it call him a thief and welcome but if he had stolen but elevenpence halfpenny and been convicted of it and punished as a felon call him a thief and the law will punish you this has been solemnly adjudged i say convicted and punished as a felon for if he has not been convicted of it in virtue of the general rule in case of verbal defamation you may call him so if you can prove it but when the law by a solemn and exemplary act has put the matter out of doubt then you must not mention it would any one suspect the reason it is because the statute which allows the benefit of clergy operates as a pardon it has the virtue to make that not to have been done which has been done and it was accordingly observed that a man could no more call another thief who had been punished for it in this way thief say they in the present time than say he hath a shameful disease when he had had it and has been cured of it‡ it is there also said with somewhat more colour of reason though in despite of the lastmentioned rule that there is no necessity or use of slanderous words to be allowed to ignorants and that though the arresting of a pardoned felon by one who knows not of the pardon may be justifiable because this is in advancement of justice yet so it is not to call him thief because that is neither necessary nor advanceth nor tends to justice he who said this knew not or did not choose to know how mighty is the force and how salutary the influence of the moral sanction how much it contributes to support and in what a number of important instances it serves to controul the caprices and supply the defects of the political it was perhaps sir edward coke—a man who from principle was a determined enemy though from ill humour upon occasion an inconsistent and unsteady friend to political liberty—who in his favourite case de libellis famosis has destroyed as far as was in his power to destroy the safeguard of all other liberties that of the press—proscribing all criticism of public acts silencing all history and vying in the extent of his anathemas with the extravagance of the most jealous of the roman emperors chapter v of præmunire the punishment of præmunire∥ consists in the being put out of the kings protection and in the forfeiture of lands and tenements goods and chattels but such is the     uncertainty of english law that some add to the above imprisonment during the kings pleasure and others say for life sir edward coke is for adding loss of credibility he might as well have added loss of ears but i do not find that this conceit has been taken up by anybody else the offences to which this punishment has been applied are as heterogenous as any that can be imagined the offence to which it was first applied was an offence against government since that besides a multitude of other offences against government it has been applied to various offences against the property against the personal liberty of individuals and against trade what it is that in such a variety of laws should have tempted the legislature instead of the known and ordinary names of punishment to devise a new and unexpressive name to which no meaning whatever could be annexed without rummaging over a confused parcel of old french statutes is not easy to assign there is nothing gained by it in any way not in point of brevity for in one of the statutes in which it is described with the most conciseness i find more words are taken up by this uncouth description than would be by the plain one there is nothing gained by it in point of precision for the word has no signification whatever but by reference to the words of the old statute and consequently cannot be more precise than they are the only recommendation i can find for it is that it is a latin word added to the notion perhaps that as being less intelligible than most other names of punishments it might be more tremendous if this has been the design it has been in some measure answered terrible indeed is the name of præmunire it is become a kind of bugbear in which shape it has descended even among the lowest mob it is used as synonymous with a scrape not that the sort of persons last mentioned have any much clearer idea of the particular sort of scrape than those have who bring others into it by solemn acts of legislation chapter vi outlawry the punishment known in practice by the name of outlawry consists of the following ingredients—   forensic disability which may be called simple outlawry   forfeiture of personal estate   forfeiture of the growing profits of the real estate   imprisonment c this is the punishment inflicted for the offence of absconding from justice in all cases except where the punishment for the principal offence amounts to felony in this case a man against whom a sentence of outlawry is pronounced is punished as if he had been convicted of the principal offence as the offence of absconding is a chronical offence the punishment applied to it should be a chronical punishment such an one as being made to cease upon the cessation of the offence may operate only as an instrument of compulsion all these punishments are capable of being made so but none are so upon the face of them none were so originally they are by this time however rendered so in great measure by modern practice which has corrected the inordinate severity of the original institution this punishment applies in most cases but not in all cases in all cases where the prosecution for the original offence was in the criminal form that is in other words in all criminal suits it applies in most but not in all civil suits in the same civil suit it applies or does not apply according as the suit happens to be commenced before one court or another in the same suit and that carried on in the same court it does or does not apply according as the suit happens to have been commenced by one kind of jargon or another all this without the least relation to the merits the punishment of forensic disabilities is applied to a multitude of offences namely to all those which are punished either by capital felony or præmunire or excommunication in felony it is useless because the effect of it is merged in the punishment of death in præmunire it is justifiable in as far as the punishment of total and perpetual impoverishment is an eligible mode of punishment for of this it makes a necessary part in excommunication it is ineligible on account of its inequality to make it answer in an equable manner the purpose of impoverishment is impracticable for want of the punishment of forfeiture of which it can come in only as an appendage taking it by itself and laying aside what is necessary to make it answer the purpose of impoverishment it is superfluous when added to the punishment of imprisonment whatever may be the offences cognizable in the ecclesiastical court either corporal punishment is enough for them without pecuniary or it is not if it be enough simple outlawry in addition to it is too much if not     it is too little all this is upon the supposition that the delinquent is forthcoming for the purpose of undergoing imprisonment when a man absconds and has no property in possession or none that is sufficient to answer the demand upon him in this case and in this only the punishment of simple outlawry is expedient why not because it is eligible in itself but because it is the only one the case admits of when a man has no visible property in his own country and has made his escape into another generally speaking his own country has no hold of him this may happen suppose in nine instances out of ten but in the tenth it may happen that he may have a debt due to him which he may want the assistance of the laws of his own country to recover if this debt be more in value to him than what is equivalent to the punishment he would be likely to suffer for the original offence which made him fly he will return and submit to justice the punishment of simple outlawry in this case will answer its purpose it is eligible therefore in this case because it has some chance of compassing its end and no other punishment has any advantages and disadvantages of forfeiture of protection to this mode of punishment the objection of inequality applies with peculiar force the fund out of which a man who has a fund of his own subsists is either his labour or his property if he has property it consists either in immoveables or in moveables if in immoveables it is either in his own hands or in those of other persons if in moveables it is either in public hands or in private if in private either in his own hands or in those of other persons a man who subsists by his labour is in general scarcely at all affected by this punishment he receives his pay if not before he does his work at least as soon as a small quantity of it is done a man whose fund of subsistence consists in immoveable property is very little affected by this punishment if that property is in his own hands the utmost inconvenience it can subject him to is the obliging him to deal for ready money if his property is in the funds he is not at all affected there seems no reason to suppose that those who have the management of those funds would refuse a man his dividend on the ground of any such disability they would have no interest in such a refusal and the importance of keeping up public credit would probably be a sufficient motive to keep them in this instance from departing from the general engagement if a mans property consists in moveable property which is in his own hands—for instance stock in trade it affects him indeed but not very deeply the utmost it can do is to oblige him to deal for ready money to preclude him from selling upon credit it does not preclude him from buying upon credit since though others are not amenable to him he is to others it is only where a mans property consists in credits—for example in immoveables in the hands of a tenant in a sum due for goods sold on credit or in money out upon security that it can affect him very deeply of such a man it may be the utter ruin in this case whether a man suffer to the extreme amount or whether he suffer at all depends upon what upon the moral honesty of those he happens to have to do with there are two circumstances therefore on which the quantum of this mode of punishment depends  st the nature of the fund from whence he draws his subsistence  d the moral honesty of the people he happens to have to do with but neither of these circumstances is any ways connected with the degree of criminality of any offence for which a man can be thus punished of two men both guilty and that in the same degree one may be ruined the other not all affected the greater punishment is as likely to fall upon the lesser offender as upon the greater the lesser upon the greater offender as upon the lesser     another objection applies to this mode of punishment on the score of immorality the punishment being of a pecuniary nature there is a profit arising out of it which accordingly is to be disposed of in favour of somebody and in whose favour is it disposed of in favour of any one who having contracted an engagement with the delinquent can for the sake of lucre be brought to break it it may be said that the engagement being by the supposition rendered void there is no harm in its being broken true it is void as far as concerns the political sanction but it is not void by the moral all that the law does is not to compel him to perform it but the interests of society require and accordingly so does the moral sanction require that a man should be ready to perform his engagement although the law should not compel him if a man can be brought in this way to break his engagement it is a sign that the power of money over him is greater than that of the moral sanction he is therefore what is properly termed an immoral man and it is the law that either has begotten in him that evil quality or at least has fostered it the dispensations therefore of the political sanction are in this case set at variance with those which are and ought to be those of the moral sanction it invites men to pursue a mode of conduct which the moral sanction in conformity to the dictates of utility forbids chapter vii excommunication various and manifold are the evils which the punishment of excommunication inflicts or proposes to inflict various are the sources from whence they flow it does not confine itself to the political sanction it calls in or makes as if it would call in the two others to its assistance of excommunication there are two species or degrees—the greater and the lesser the greater contains all that the lesser does and something more i will first then give an account of those that are contained in the lesser and then take notice of those that are peculiar to the other those contained in the lesser are as follows—   imprisonment—the time unlimited depending on the good pleasure of the judge the severity of it is determined by the circumstance of its being in the common jail   penance as a condition to the termination of the other punishment by penance is meant a corporal punishment of the ignominious kind the particular manner of inflicting it shall be considered hereafter   in lieu of the penance commutation money the quantum of it is not limited in a direct manner but is in an indirect manner it cannot be more than a man chooses to give in order to avoid the corporal penance these two last are accidental ingredients in this complex mass of punishment their infliction or omission depends in some measure upon the will of the prosecutor those which follow are inseparable   disability to sue either in a court of law or equity this is a punishment of a pecuniary nature contingent in its nature and uncertain as to time   disability of acting as an advocate or as an attorney or procurator for another† that is i suppose in the ecclesiastical courts and not in any other this is a punishment of the class of those that affect a mans condition in the present instance it affects a man chiefly on a pecuniary account   disability of acting as a juryman‡   disability of being presented to an ecclesiastical benefice∥ of this the same account may be given as of the last disability but one   disability of bringing a suit or action as an executor§ this is a punishment in alienam personam affecting those who have a beneficial interest under the will   incapacity of being constituted or continued an administrator or at least danger of being subjected to that disability  0 disability of being a witness this likewise is another punishment in alienam personam affecting those persons to whom this evidence if given would be beneficial in respect of their lives fortunes liberties and every other possession that is in the protection of the law    the being looked upon as a heathen and a publican this i suppose is meant as a sort of infamy¶    exclusion from all churches this is a species of personal restraint that involves in it consequences that belong to the religious sanction    exclusion from the benefit of the burial service i do not know under what class to rank this punishment i do not very precisely know what benefit it is to a man after he is dead to have the service read over his body if it be anything it belongs to the religious sanction    exclusion from the benefit of the sacraments of baptism and the lords supper this belongs altogether to the religious sanction so much for the lesser excommunication the greater adds two other circumstances to the catalogue       exclusion from the commerce and communion of the faithful   disability of making a will† this is a punishment that affects the power of the party viz in the present case the investitive power performable in a particular manner with respect to the ownership of such property as he shall die entitled to in as far as the power of making a will includes that of appointing a guardian to a child as also that of an executor to manage the property of a person of whom the party in question was executor it is a punishment in alienam personam the child may suffer for want of a proper guardian the persons interested in the effects of the first testator may suffer for want of a proper person to manage those effects this is the mode and the only mode of punishment inflicted by those courts that go by the name of ecclesiastical or spiritual courts this they are forced to make serve for all occasions they have neither less nor greater it is the only punishment they have when this punishment is pronounced they have exhausted their whole penal code if its brevity be its recommendation it must be confessed that it has no other let us consider a little more particularly the punishments of which it is composed of imprisonment nothing in particular need be said at present the punishment of penance demands more attention it consists in the penitent being exposed bareheaded and barelegged with a white sheet wrapped round the body either in the parish church or in the cathedral or in the public market‡ there to pronounce a certain form of words containing the confession of his crime this as has been already observed is a corporal punishment of the ignominious kind and might if defined with precision be employed with the same advantage as are other punishments of that description the time at which it should take place and the duration of the penance ought to be determined but there is nothing fixed with regard to them so that it may continue for several hours or only for an instant it may take place before a crowd of spectators or in the most absolute solitude besides this there is a vast difference between the parish church of a village and the cathedral of a great city or the public market of a district the larger or smaller concourse of spectators will render the punishment more or less severe the penitent ought to pronounce a formula containing an acknowledgment of his crime a different formula ought therefore to be provided for every crime by law this formula may be pronounced either distinctly or indistinctly a man can hardly be expected willingly to proclaim his own shame it would therefore be proper that he should only be required to repeat the words which should be clearly and distinctly pronounced by an officer of justice as is practised with respect to the administration of oaths certain persons also should be nominated to preside over the ceremony and ascertain that everything is done according to law till these points are regulated this mode of punishment though good in itself will always be subject as it is at present to the greatest abuses it will be executed with inequality and capriciously according to the condition of the individuals rather than according to their crimes and according as the character of the judge is more or less severe penance is the punishment usually imposed says dr burn in the case of incest or incontinency these two offences are classed together by the ecclesiastical compiler and opposed to what he calls smaller offences and scandals when we consider how far these two first offences are removed from one another one is astonished to see them classed together and visited with the same punishment far be it from me to treat lightly the exposure of innocence to infamy the disturbance of domestic felicity or to degrade the chaste raptures of the marriage bed to a level with the bought smiles of harlots but there are degrees in guilt which i see not why it should be meritorious to confound it is not often that we hear of this punishment being put in practice examples of it were more frequent in former times but now it is most commonly commuted for by the payment of a sum of money   as to the different legal incapacities which form part of this punishment the objections to which they are liable have been pointed out elsewhere see book iv misplaced punishments   part of the punishment consists in the delinquents being looked upon if men think fit to look upon him in that light as a beathen and a publican to try the effect of generals the only way is to apply them to particulars a is not willing or not able to pay his proctors or another mans proctors fees he is in consequence excommunicated amongst his other punishments he is to be looked upon as a heathen or a publican that is as being such a sort of man as socrates cato titus marcus antoninus a collector of taxes or a lord of the treasury the heaping of hard names upon a man might at one time have been deemed a punishment but such legal trifling nowadays serves only to render the laws ridiculous   exclusion from the churches in our     days an exclusion of this sort shows rather oddly under the guise of punishment the great difficulty is now not to keep people out of the churches but to get them in the punishment however was not illdesigned if it were intended to increase the desire of attending there by forbidding it—the general effect of every prohibition being to give birth to a desire to infringe it it affords a presumption that what is prohibited is in itself desirable or at least desirable in the opinion of the legislator or he would not have prohibited it such is the natural supposition when the interdiction relates to an unknown object but even when it relates to an object which has been tried and neglected from distaste the prohibition gives to it another aspect the attention is directed to the possible advantages of the act having begun to think of them the individual fancies he perceives them and goes on to exaggerate their value on comparing his situation with that of those who enjoy this liberty he experiences a feeling of inferiority and by degrees a most intense desire often succeeds to the greatest indifference those who are forward to refer the propensity to transgress a prohibition of any kind to an unaccountable perversity and unnatural corruption in human nature as if it were not reconcileable to the known dominion of the ideas of pain and pleasure over the human mind do an injustice to mans nature in favour of their own indolence man according to these superficial moralists is a compound of inconsistencies everything in him is an object of wonder everything happens contrary to what they would expect strangers to the few simple principles which govern human nature the account they give of everything is that it is unaccountable with respect to those parts of the punishment of excommunication which belong to the religious sanction such as exclusion from the sacraments their most striking imperfection is their extreme inequality their penal effect depends on the belief and sensibility of the individuals the blow which would produce torments of agony in one person will only cause the skin of another to tingle there is no proportion in these punishments and nothing exemplary those who suffer languish in secrecy and silence those who do not suffer make a jest and a laughingstock of the law in public they are punishments which are thrown at hazard among a crowd of offenders without care whether they produce any effect or none i speak of these punishments with reference only to the present life for who is there that supposes that a sentence of excommunication can carry with it any penal consequences in a future state for what man reasoning without prejudice can believe that god hath committed so terrible a power to beings so feeble and so imperfect or that the divine justice could bind itself to execute the decrees of blind humanity—that it could allow itself to be commanded to punish otherwise than it would have punished of itself a truth so evident could only have been lost sight of by an abasement which could only have been prepared by ages of ignorance book vi miscellaneous topics chapter i choice of punishments—latitude to be allowed to the judges the legislator ought as much as possible to determine everything relating to punishments for two reasons that they may be certain and impartial   the more completely the scale of punishments is rendered certain the more completely all the members of the community are enabled to know what to expect it is the fear of punishment in so far as it is known which prevents the commission of crime an uncertain punishment will therefore be uncertain in its effects since where there is a possibility to escape escape will be hoped for   the legislator is necessarily unacquainted with the individuals who will undergo the punishment he appoints he cannot therefore be governed by feelings of personal antipathy or regard he is impartial or at least appears to be so a judge on the contrary only pronouncing upon a particular case is exposed to favourable or unfavourable prejudices or at least to the suspicion of such which almost equally shakes the public confidence if an unlimited latitude be allowed to judges in apportioning punishments their functions will be rendered too arduous they will always be afraid either of being too indulgent or too severe it may also happen that being able to diminish the punishment at discretion they may become less exact in requiring proof than if they had to pronounce a fixed punishment a slight probability may appear sufficient     to justify a punishment which they may lessen at pleasure there may however often arise either with regard to the offences themselves or the person of the delinquent unforeseen and particular circumstances which would be productive of great inconveniences if the laws were altogether inflexible it is therefore proper to allow a certain latitude to the judge not of increasing but of diminishing a punishment in those cases in which it may be fairly presumed that one individual is less dangerous or more responsible than another since as has been before observed the same nominal punishment is not always the same real punishment—some individuals by reason of their education family connexions and condition in the world presenting if we may so speak a greater surface for punishment to act upon other circumstances may render it expedient to change the kind of punishment that which has been directed by the law may be incapable of application or it may be less suitable in other respects but whenever this discretionary power is exercised by a judge he ought to declare the reasons which have determined him such are the principles the details of this subject belong to the penal code and to the legislative instructions to the tribunals chapter ii of subsidiary punishments of all the punishments which can be appointed by the law there is none but what from one accident or other is liable to fail it is obvious that against such an event it becomes the law in every case to make provision such a failure may arise from either of two causes unwillingness that is want of will to bear the punishment or inability that is want of power the first cause if no steps were taken to controul it would naturally occasion the failure of all punishments the execution of which is dependent upon the will of the party to be punished this among corporal punishments is the case with all such as are either active or restrictive one case of restrictive punishment excepted that to wit in which the restraint is produced by physical means to give efficacy therefore to the mandate of which any of these punishments is intended as the sanction it is absolutely necessary that some further punishment should be appointed to back it through the whole of its continuance in the first instance this backing or subsidiary punishment as it may be called may be taken from those two classes as well as from the other and so through any number of instances one behind another a punishment of the active kind for instance might be backed by quasiimprisonment that again by banishment or any one of those punishments for a certain term by the same or another kind of punishment for a further term ultimately however every such series must be terminated by some punishment that may be inflicted without the concurrence of the partys will that is by some punishment of the passive kind or if of the restrictive kind by such restraint as is compassed by physical means even such punishments to the execution of which so the party be forthcoming the concurrence of the party is not essentially necessary may fail from his want of power or in other words from his inability to sustain them this is the case with all corporal punishments not capital that affect any parts of the body that are not essential to life it is the case therefore with simply afflictive punishments and with discolourment disfigurement disablement and mutilation in as far as they affect any of the parts just spoken of it is also the case with forfeitures of all kinds the only punishments therefore that are sure and require no others to be subjoined to them are the abovementioned corporal punishments in the cases where the parts they affect are such as are essential to life imprisonment and such punishments by which life itself is taken away even these like any others may come to fail by the want of will in the party to sustain them to wit by his not choosing to be forthcoming which is a cause of failure common to all punishments but then this cause does not necessarily produce its effect it does not render the punishment of the man necessarily dependent upon his will for he may be taken and punished in spite of his wishes and endeavours to prevent it which when a man does suffer any of these punishments especially death and those other acute and heavy punishments is generally the case in this case the only resource is in forfeitures upon the contingency of a mans having anything to forfeit that is within the reach of justice or in the punishment of those whose feelings are connected with his own by sympathy as in punishments in alienam personam from the differences above remarked respecting the cause of failure in the punishment first designed results a difference in what ought to be the quantity of the subsidiary punishment concerning which we may lay down the following rules— rule i where inability is manifestly the only cause of failure the subsidiary punishment should be neither greater nor less than that which was first designed for no reason can be given why it should be either less or greater rule ii where want of will is manifestly     the only cause of failure the subsidiary punishment ought to be greater than that which was first designed for the punishment first designed is that which by the supposition is thought the best to determine the delinquent then to submit to this in preference to the other there is but one way which is to make that other punishment the greater rule iii when the cause of failure may be want of power or want of will as it may happen and it cannot be known which the subsidiary punishment ought to be greater than the punishment first designed but not so much greater as in the case last mentioned this is apt to be the case with pecuniary forfeitures if however it can be ascertained which of these is the cause it ought always to be done otherwise on the one hand he who fails from mere inability will be punished more than there is occasion and he who fails wilfully not enough when a man fails wilfully to submit to the punishment first designed for him such a failure may be considered in the light of an offence viewing it in this light we shall immediately see the propriety of the following rule— rule iv the subsidiary punishment ought to be made the greater the easier it is for the delinquent to avoid the punishment first designed without being detected and made amenable for the punishment to be efficacious must always be greater than the temptation to the offence and the temptation to the offence is the greater the greater is the uncertainty of that punishment which is the motive that weighs against the profit of the offence imprisonment is the most convenient and natural kind of subsidiary punishment in cases where the offender cannot or will not submit to a pecuniary punishment a circumstance that renders these two modes of punishment particularly apt for being substituted to each other is their divisibility they admit of every degree that can be desired simple afflictive punishments on account of the infamy they involve cannot in general be eligibly employed as substitutes for pecuniary punishments in case of violation of boundaries of local confinement the most eligible substitute is imprisonment a single act of transgression may be taken as a sufficient warning that the penal mandate is not meant to be regarded laborious punishments require an uninterrupted train of attention in order to compel the delinquent to submit to them a constant supply of fresh motives is required to produce the desired effect it is necessary therefore that these motives should be drawn from a stock of punishment that is susceptible of minute division and capable of being applied at the moment it is wanted thus whenever an inspector is appointed in a house of correction in which the individuals confined are employed in hard labour power is tacitly given to him to inflict personal correction the infamy by which it is accompanied is not an objection because by the principal punishment—the penal labour—an equal degree of infamy is produced we have already observed that to pecuniary punishment in case of inability on the part of the patient ought to be substituted imprisonment but by what standard are we to estimate a sum of money by a sum of imprisonment for what debt or part of a debt is each days imprisonment to be reckoned as an equivalent let us say that the amount of the debt struck off by each days imprisonment shall be equal to what each day the patient might have earned had he remained in a state of liberty the daily income of a mechanic sailor soldier artist labourer servant may be calculated according to the wages of persons employed in the same profession the daily income of a farmer may be estimated according to the    th part of the rent of his farm if besides his farm he is engaged in any other line of business the daily benefit arising from that business must be added to the income arising from his farm the revenue of a man who is not engaged in any business or is not a manufacturer may be calculated as being eight times the rent of his house if he is a manufacturer at four times the rent of his house if he is engaged in trade at six times that rent the revenue of a man that boards and lodges in the house of another may be estimated at double the sum that he so pays if he lodges only at four times that sum if he is supported gratuitously in the house of a relation as equal to the value of his board and lodging the points that then require to be determined are the three following—   the income being given what portion of the debt shall be considered as being abolished by imprisonment of a certain duration   from what period anterior to the contracting of the debt ought the value of the income to be estimated       what proofs ought to be required by which to fix the amount of the income in question it would be the interest of the debtor to make it appear as great as possible during the examination the creditor ought to be present and to be at liberty either by himself or his counsel to examine the defaulter the more exalted a mans rank the greater in general are his annual outgoings the greater consequently ought to be the debt abolished by a given period of imprisonment i confine myself then to the laying down the principles upon which the calculation may be made the details of their application belong more properly to the penal code than to a work on punishment chapter iii of surety for good conduct the obligation of finding sureties for good conduct is an expedient the utility of which appears more problematical in proportion as it is examined more nearly a condition which is essential to it is that there be an ulterior punishment destined to replace this obligation in case its fulfilment is found impossible this subsidiary punishment is ordinarily imprisonment this imprisonment is ordinarily indefinite as to its duration it may be perpetual and it is natural that it should be so does the accused find himself without friends ready to risk their security upon his good conduct imprisonment and the ignominy that accompanies it are means little proper for enabling him to find friends so devoted suppose that he finds them what happens then to a properly seated punishment a vicarious punishment is added—a punishment to be borne by the innocent for the guilty in the nature of things any punishment might be equally well employed for this purpose by custom pecuniary punishment only is employed in the first instance which however changes into imprisonment in case of insolvability according to a general rule it is not however natural that a man especially a man who by the supposition has given proofs of misconduct should find friends who will expose themselves to be punished for actions over which they have no power unless he have wherewith to indemnify them for bearing this pecuniary punishment does he find them in this case then this expedient is useless it would have been quite as well to have fixed the amount upon him directly in order that this expedient may have an efficacy of its own it will be necessary to limit its use to the case in which the incapacity of the accused to furnish this indemnity is known does he after this find any persons sufficiently generous thus to expose themselves for him it is without doubt something gained in point of security but it is a security very dearly bought in all other cases this expedient resolves itself into a question of account the support which the law receives from this expedient springs from two sources it operates as an additional punishment whereby the will of the accused is influenced—this punishment consisting in the remorse which a generous mind would feel in seeing friends who had devoted themselves for him plunged into misfortune by his ingratitude it is also an expedient whereby he is attacked upon the side of power his sureties become guards whom the danger to which they are exposed induces to watch over his conduct but will he whom the fear of punishment to be inflicted upon himself has been found insufficient to restrain be restrained by the fear of a less punishment to be inflicted upon another those passions which have stifled the voice of prudence will they obey those of generosity and gratitude they may obey it but that they will not obey it is i think most natural but if this is so it is a very costly expedient in the majority of cases instead of ensuring the good of prevention it will produce the evil of punishment—of punishment borne by the innocent whilst as to this guard it is a security much more verbal than real—it would be a very weak security even if the individuals were his companions and lived under the same roof with him at all times but it is not among such as these that sureties are selected they are under the english law required to be householders having separate establishments is it then possible that the passion which by the supposition had broken through the united restraints of prudence gratitude and honour should be restrained by so loose a band besides this is it natural that the extremes of confidence and mistrust should be united in the same person the bitterness of this punishment to which the innocent are made to expose themselves is not taken away by calling the exposure voluntary this willingness is owing only to the constraint which the consideration of his friend being sent or about to be sent to prison for life brings with it it is a willingness produced by torture in conclusion suretyship is a resource which ought not to be resorted to without very evident necessity if it were unattended with any other inconvenience than this of exposing the virtue of individuals to these combats which in a moment of weakness may give birth to a remorse which shall end only with life this expedient is much employed under the english law but custom has caused it   0 to exist only in connexion with judicial commination a certain fine is determined on the accused is made to say i consent to the payment of this fine if i commit a certain offence one or more sureties are made each to say i consent on the same condition to owe the same or a part of the same sum in this manner as if an inevitable punishment required an extorted consent to its infliction the accused himself is made to contract an engagement which if it is not always ridiculous it is that it is sometimes unjust implying a claim upon his property it serves to rob his creditors of their just rights to payment of debts contracted between the period of the engagement and the contracting of the debt of this illcontrived compound mischief what are the effects in practice very commonly none this formality is complied with as so many others are complied with without thinking of what it means partly from duty and partly from habit sometimes it may be useful because it always includes admonition and sometimes threatening according to the proportion between the fine threatened and the punishment which would have had place without it sometimes for want of sureties it may be believed that the accused himself may go to prison sometimes after having found them it may equally be believed that they may incur the fine and that they pay it or go to prison with or without him do these misfortunes frequently happen i know not how can i know this is one of those thousand things on which everybody ought to be instructed and of which no one can find an opportunity of learning the truth chapter iv defeazance of punishment §  — of pardon it is necessary to increase the magnitude of a punishment in proportion as it is wanting in certainty the less certain your punishments are the more severe they must be the more certain your punishments are the more you may reduce their severity what shall we then say of a power expressly established for rendering them uncertain i mean the power of pardoning it has cruelty for its cause it has cruelty for its effect among nations as among individuals the government of the passions precedes that of reason the object of primitive punishments was to assuage the rage of their authors of this there are two proofs the first is drawn from the multitude of cases in which the most severe punishments have been lavished upon actions which have but a slightly hurtful influence upon the happiness of individuals or society and with respect to which such evil influence was not sought to be established till long after these punishments were appointed of this kind are the punishments directed against heresy the second is drawn from the praises lavished upon clemency for whilst the effect of an offence is only to enrage the sovereign there is merit in his abstaining from punishing it there is utility in his so doing for by a privation which is borne by him alone he spares the infliction of terrible evils upon a multitude of persons in this consists the difficulty for it is difficult for a man accustomed to follow the bent of his inclinations to restrain them suppose the effect of a crime is to interrupt his ease and the effect of the punishment is to repress this crime to abstain from the application of this punishment is a treason of which the most pardonable sources are feebleness or folly to praise the elemency of the sovereign upon this supposition is to praise the surgeon who allows his patient to perish by not cutting off a gangrened finger among sovereigns therefore without cruelty the use of unmerited pardons could not take place the reason is an enlightened love of the public welfare does not engage him in undoing with one hand what he had done with the other if the punishments have not had for the cause of their establishment cruelty towards individuals it is cruelty towards the public to render them useless—to violate his promise the engagement which he has made to the laws to put them in execution i speak here of gratuitous pardons such as all pardons have hitherto been there are cases in which the power of pardoning is not only useful but necessary in all these cases if the punishment were inflicted the evil produced would exceed the good and in some cases almost infinitely if the legislator could have known that certain individual cases would or would not be included in the general case in which he would have wished that the punishment should cease he would act unwisely were he to rely upon any other person for its cessation for why should he give to another a power to frustrate his designs but he does not possess this knowledge unless in quality of legislator he acts also in that of a prophet it follows therefore that he must rely upon some other in english law one method by which the law gives to a party injured or rather to every prosecutor a partial power of pardon consists in giving him the choice of the kind of action which he will commence on this or on the difference between the actions depends a difference between the punishments so far as the happening of this difference is     concerned the lot of the offender depends not on the gravity of his offence but on some other foreign circumstances such as the degree of the illwill of the party injured or other prosecutor or of the knowledge of his legal advisers the judge is a puppet in the hands of any prosecutor which he can cause to move at his pleasure and caprice there are many persons as we have seen who exercise the power of pardoning there are many others who possess it who are not observed among the latter class may be placed those who have the power of placing nullities in the course of procedure in england an attorney or his clerk any copying clerk at eighteenpence or two shillings per day may grant or sell impunity to whomsoever it seems them good if the individual injured can directly or indirectly put an end to a criminal process otherwise than by the punishment before the judgment has been pronounced and in case of conviction executed he enjoys in effect this right of pardoning the right of remission is then one branch of the power of pardoning when the interest of the public requires that the punishment should take place the individual injured ought not to enjoy this right when this interest does not require it he may enjoy it this power may be allowed in all cases when the offence on which it operates being founded only in a private quarrel does not spread any alarm through society or at least does not spread any alarm which the conduct of the parties does not destroy but in the case of corporal injuries how trifling soever and especially in the case of injuries accompanied with insult this remission ought not to be allowed without the knowledge of the judge otherwise the weakness and goodnature of some minds would serve to draw down upon them vexation from hardened oppressors homicide is a case in which the power of remission ought not to be allowed to any one in particular it would in effect be to grant to him an arbitrary power over the life of those whose death he might thus pardon he might boldly employ any assassin by exercising in favour of that assassin his power of pardoning if to grant to any one whatsoever the power of taking away a reward offered by the legislator would be regarded as an absurdity to grant the power of taking away a punishment in the opposite case with the reserve of specific exceptions would be a more terrible absurdity this absurdity is not found in the system of rewards no person proposes to take away a reward after the legislator has offered it the nullitics however allowed in prosecutions when he has appointed a reward for offenders operates to this effect in the case of punishment the frequency of capital punishment is one of the most probable causes of the popularity of pardons in england it may therefore admit of debate whether the legislature has done most evil by appointing so many capital punishments or the sovereign by exercising his power of remitting them the essence of this power is to act by caprice the king as it is falsely said—the deputy of the king as it ought to have been said—does not act judicially he does not act from a knowledge of the matter he has not the power of doing so he has not even the power of compelling the attendance of witnesses is a lie told before this powerless despot it is an unpunishable lie the power of pardoning is often said to be one of the brightest jewels in the royal crown it is burdensome as it is bright not only to those who submit to the crown but still more so to him also who wears it many cases have occurred in england in which the counsellors of the crown have from more or less praiseworthy motives made use of this lawful despotism of the king to soften the tyranny of the laws never was power so undoubtedly legal though undue employed for a mere legitimate purpose—the result however has been not that the minister has been applauded as he deserved but that he has become the object of clamour libels and threats the most correct and legitimate exercise of the powers impolitically attached to his character has only served to draw down upon the king that treatment which a tyrant would have merited how much discontent and fear would have been spared if a right legally abusive had given place to an enlightened and wellordered law §   by length of time ought punishment in any cases and in what to be defeasible by length of time—by the time i mean that has elapsed since the commission of the offence at first view the answer seems to be clearly in the negative for what it may be said has the circumstance of the length of time to do with the demand there is for punishment upon a nearer view however it will be found that the utility of prescription in certain cases is maintainable by specious at least if not conclusive arguments as a foundation for these arguments it must be admitted that if in any case the suffering of the delinquent is not necessary for the attainment of the ends of punishment the punishment ought not to be inflicted this being premised it should seem that     in a view to one of the ends of punishment to wit reformation the execution of it after a certain length of time is not necessary a certain number of years suppose ten has elapsed since he committed the offence now then in all this time either he has committed similar offences or he has not if he has not he has reformed himself and the purpose of the law has been answered without punishment if he has he has been punished for subsequent offences and the discipline he stood in need of has been already administered to him at a time when he stood more in need of it than he can be supposed to stand at present thus stands the argument upon the ground of reformation but of the facts alleged one it must be confessed is rather problematical if a man commit an offence and is forthcoming ten years afterwards it is by no means clear from his not having been punished for any similar offences that he has not committed any in the same manner that he escaped detection or prosecution for the first he may have escaped detection or prosecution for any number of other similar offences the difficulty of detection the death of witnesses the subtleties of procedure are circumstances that afford ample grounds for disputing the force of the inference from his not having incurred punishment to his not having deserved it upon the ground of example there is still less to be said in favour of prescription if the prescription is not to take place till at the end of a long period as ten years the number above taken for an example it will not contribute in any assignable degree to lessen the apparent value of the punishment when a man meditates a crime his great fear is the being detected and apprehended immediately almost upon the commission of it the taking away the danger that would await him at the end of ten years will add very little to his security† when a crime has been committed either the person only who committed it may remain unknown or the fact‡ itself as well as the person if either be unknown it is plain no prosecution can have been set on foot if both be known then either a prosecution may have been set on foot or not it is only in case of there being no prosecution that prescription has ever been allowed the rule is that a man shall not be prosecuted after that interval has elapsed—not that if he has been prosecuted and convicted he shall not suffer the apprehension of danger commences at the time of the discovery persons who are about the criminal now understand that they have among them a thief a robber or a murderer this cannot but give them some alarm if no punishment at all is to be inflicted on him if he is suffered to go on and live where he did before how is this alarm to be quieted in crimes the object of which is a pecuniary profit prescription ought not in any case to operate so as to protect the delinquent in the enjoyment of his illgotten acquisition neither ought it to operate in such manner as to leave innocent persons exposed to suffer from their terror or abhorrence of the criminal there are also certain crimes in respect of which prescription ought not to be adopted in any case such are three species of homicide viz homicide for lucre through wantonness or from premeditated resentment incendiarism and the offence of sinking a vessel manned or of laying a country under water the mischief of crimes of these kinds is so great that it seems paying too great a regard to the interests of the criminal to adopt a rule that may contribute though in ever so small a degree to lessen the apparent certainty of the punishment and the horror or terror a fact of any of those kinds inspires when discovered is so great that that circumstance alone seems enough to overweigh any good that could be gained by it what is the good in view in prescription it is the interest of one single person that is in question—the delinquent the sparing of that single person from a suffering which it is supposed it may in the case in which it is proposed the prescription should take place not be necessary at least not so necessary as formerly to the purposes of punishment to inflict now when it is a crime by which men are exposed to suffer in their individual capacities it can scarcely be detected but a multitude of persons must begin to suffer to wit by the apprehension of his committing other such crimes in future of which they may chance to be the objects and this suffering of theirs will continue till he be manifestly disabled to hurt them the least penal method of doing which is to send him out of the way upon this slight examination we perceive that the utility of prescription will vary greatly in respect of different offences to discuss this topic completely it would be necessary therefore to consider it with a     view to the several sorts of offences to do this fully belongs not to our present subject all we can do in this place is to offer a few general hints just to put us in the way and to serve as a clew to indicate the principal points upon which the inquiry ought to turn whether a given person detected after such a length of time of a crime of the sort in question is or is not an object of terror to those around him is a question that can be answered only by a particular inquiry it is a matter therefore that ought rather to be committed to the magistrate who has the power of pardoning than to be provided for by a general law §   by death of parties in pursuit of the means of making compensation the business of punishment is apt to be overlooked when one man the party injured is presented with what another man the injurer is made to pay men are apt to take it for granted and at first asking would be apt to answer that there is no punishment in the case they imagine but hastily and erroneously that the only person who has suffered by the offence is that party who is the immediate object of the injury if then that person by an operation of law be made to enjoy as much as by the offence he had been made to suffer they conclude and justly enough were the foundation true that everything is set to rights and that the law has nothing more to do the pain which the offender is made to suffer by being made to give up what the party injured is made to enjoy they do not look upon in the light of punishment they look upon it as a circumstance resulting accidentally and unintentionally out of the operation by which an indemnification is produced to the injured party so that it would be but so much the better if that pain could be altogether spared and it is for want of being able to save it that it is suffered to exist in short so entirely is the idea of punishment lost in that of compensation that a law which appoints the latter is not understood to appoint the former is not looked upon as a penal law punish however it must a penal law in one sense of the word it must be if it is to have any effect at all in preventing the practice which is productive of the mischief it means to cure and it is by punishing that it does more good than by indemnifying for of the two ends prevention and compensation the former as has been proved is by much the most important this neglect however of the principal end of laws made in restraint of private injuries has not been attended with all the ill consequences that might at first sight be imagined the indemnification being made to come out of the pocket of the aggressor has produced the punishment of course now under the laws of most nations in most instances of acknowledged injuries indemnification has been exacted and by that means in most cases it has happened that punishment has been applied yet not in all because compensation has been made defeasible by contingencies i say in most but it has not in all for there are two events by which in all these cases indemnification is rendered not necessary in so great a degree as it was before and as it may appear upon a superficial glance not necessary at all in effect upon the happening of either of these two events under most laws and particularly under our own the obligation of making compensation has been cancelled at the same time compensation being the only object in view this being taken away punishment has of course dropped along with it but in these cases as i hope soon to make appear howsoever it may stand with compensation the demand for punishment has not been lessened by either of the events in question these are— st the death of the injurer  dly the death of the party injured   the death of the injurer has been deemed to take away the occasion for indemnification the reason that occurs is that there is nobody to give it had he continued alive he ought to have given it doubtless but as he is gone who ought then why one person rather than another to answer these questions at large we must make a distinction according to the nature of the offence the offence is either attended with a transferable profit a fruit transmissible to the representatives of the offender or not in the first case the obligation of making compensation ought clearly to devolve on the representative on the score of punishment if on no other in the latter case there would still be one use in its being made to devolve on the representative as far as the possessions he inherits from the party deceased extend though not so great a use as in the former case where the profit of a transgression is transmissible to a representative the obligation of restoring the amount of it ought likewise to devolve on him if not the punishment would not in the case in question be equal to the profit in fact there would be no punishment at all no motive for the party under temptation to abstain from it it may occur for the first moment but it will soon appear to be otherwise that neither will there in contemplation of this case be any temptation for if the injurer thinks himself about to die there will be an end of the profit of the injury but this is not the case should he be made to lose it ever so soon himself he may transmit it to those who are dear to him so that the pleasure of sympathy grounded     on the contemplation of their enjoyment is a clear force that acts without controul and impels him to transgression besides this the delays and uncertainty of justice add still to the force of the temptation if he can contrive to spin out the suit so long as he lives the whole business from beginning to end is clear gain to him   even though the profit of a transgression be not of such a nature as to be transmissible to a representative there seems still to be a reason why the obligation of making amends ought to devolve on the representatives as far as they have assets such an arrangement would be eligible as well on account of punishment as of compensation on account of compensation for the following reasons the mischief of the transgression is a burthen that must be borne by somebody the representative and the party injured are equally innocent in this respect—they stand upon a par but the representative would suffer less under the same burthen than the party injured as we shall presently perceive from the moment when the injury was conceived the party injured in virtue of the known disposition of the law in his favour entertained expectations of receiving amends if these expectations are disappointed by a sudden and unforeseen event like that of the delinquents death a shock is felt by the party injured such as he would feel at the sudden loss of anything of which he was in possession the eventual representative entertained no such determinate expectations what expectation he could entertain in the lifetime of his predecessor respected only the clear surplus of his fortune—what should remain of it after the deduction of all charges that might be brought upon it by his misfortunes his follies or his crimes on account of punishment for the following reason the punishment of the delinquent in his own person is a punishment which fails upon his death the burthen thrown upon those who are dear to him extends his punishment as it were beyond the grave their suffering it is true will for the reasons above given not be very considerable but this is what the bulk of mankind are not apt to consider it will be apt therefore in general to appear to him in the light of punishment and will contribute to impose a restraint on him in a case in which otherwise there would be none nor will this advantage in point of punishment be charged with that expense which renders punishments in alienam personam generally ineligible for when the burthen is made to rest on the representative who has assets there is less suffering as we have shown upon the whole than if it were to rest upon any other person the law of england on this head is full of absurdity and caprice the following are the instances in which the heir is permitted to enrich himself by the wrongdoing of his ancestor a man is permitted to enrich his heir with the profit of his crimes† by the wrongful taking and withholding of any kind of moveables while if it had been by only withholding money due the heir must have refunded—by the waste committed on immoveables in which he has only a temporary interest‡—by selling to a prisoner for debt his liberty—by embezzling property entrusted to him by will though if he had not broken any such confidence but had intruded himself into the management of the dead mans property without warrant the heir must have refunded—in short by any kind of injurious proceeding where the compensation instead of being left to the discretion of a jury is thought fit to be increased and liquidated by a positive regulation the death of the party injured is another event upon which the obligation of making amends is very commonly made to cease but with full as little reason it should seem as in the former case the death of the party in question is a contingency which does not at all lessen the demand there is for punishment for compensation indeed the demand is not altogether so strong in this case as in the former the person who was the immediate object of the injury entertained a prospect of reaping in present the whole profit of a compensation he expected to be adjudged to him his representative did not during the lifetime of the principal entertain so fixed a prospect he however entertained a full prospect of some compensation to be made to his principal and he entertained a prospect of a part at least of that compensation devolving upon himself subject to the contingencies to which his general expectations from the principal were exposed this expectation is more than any one else was in a situation to entertain so that there is a better reason why he should reap the profit of the punishment than why any one else should the law of england has been more liberal     in the remedies it has given to the heir of the party injured than in those which it has given against the heir of a wrongdoer it gives it to the heir in all cases as it should seem of injuries done to the property of the ancestor it denies it however in the case of injuries to the person be they ever so atrocious and probably in the case of injuries to the reputation this omission leaves an open door to the most crying evils age and infirmity which ought if any difference be made to receive a more signal protection from the law than the opposite conditions of life are exposed more particularly to oppression the nearer a man is to his grave the greater is the probability that he may be injured with impunity since if the prosecution can be staved off during his life the remedy is gone† the remedy by a criminal prosecution is but an inadequate succedaneum it extends not to injuries done to the person through negligence nor to all injuries to the reputation it is defeasible by the arbitrary pleasure and irresponsible act of a servant of the crown it operates only in the way of punishment affording no compensation to the heir after so many instances where no satisfaction is exigible from the heir for transgressions by which he profits no one will wonder to find him standing exempt from that obligation in the case of such injuries as being inflicted commonly not from rapacious but merely vindictive motives are not commonly attended with any pecuniary profit such are those done to the person or to the reputation or in the way of mere destruction to the property so accordingly stands the law‡ though there are none of them by which the injurer may not in a multitude of cases draw indirectly a pecuniary profit for instance in the case of a rivalry in manufactures where one man destroys the manufactory of his more successful rival appendix— on deathpunishment∥ jeremy bentham to his fellowcitizens of france § i introduction fellowcitizens—hear me speak a second time   among the topics of the day§ i behold the punishment of death shall it be abolished   this question is of the number of those which for threescore years or thereabouts have been familiar to me for these eightandtwenty years my thoughts on subjects of this nature have had the honour and good fortune of being viewed among you with eyes not altogether unfavourable of these thoughts some there are which if capable of being of use at any time present a better chance of being so at the present than at any other and moreover as not being very likely to make their appearance from any other quarter put together these reasons will i flatter myself be regarded as affording a tolerably sufficient warrant for this address¶   now then as to this same question the punishment of death—shall it be abolished i answer—yes shall there be any exception to this rule i answer so far as     regards subsequential offences no meaning by subsequential an offence committed on any day subsequent to that which stands appointed by the law as that after which no such act of punishment shall be performed   meantime on the part of rulers general custom—general at least not to say universal—delivers its testimony in favour of this punishment this considered a consequence is—that to justify the abolition of it determinate reasons are requisite this i cannot but acknowledge   well then various features of inaptitude—features peculiar to itself—features such as when taken together will be seen to be absolutely conclusive—i have to charge it with inaptitude is a term of reference—subjectmatter of reference the end in view end in view on the present occasion prevention of the like acts of maleficence in future this is at any rate the main end any others of which mention may come to be made will be seen to be of no other than subordinate importance   features of inaptitude or say in other words bad properties here they follow— i bad property the first—inefficiency—comparative inefficiency—inefficiency in comparison with other modes of punishment ii bad property the second—irremissibility—incapacity of being remitted as to the remainder after a part has been undergone iii bad property the third—positive maleficence—tendency to produce crimes iv bad property the fourth—enhancing the evils produced by illapplied pardon—under these several heads explanations will follow   in favour of this punishment—in support of it against the argument afforded by the proof of all these its bad properties—the only argument adducible will be found to be—that presumption of its aptitude which is afforded by the extensiveness as above of the acceptance given to it this presumption will be seen repelled by indication made of the sources of the attachment to it thus manifested by rulers—sources among which will not be found any experience of its comparative conduciveness to the only proper ends to which it is or can be directed   to the proof of the bad properties thus charged upon it you will see added the proof afforded of its needlessness afforded—by experiments actually made and the experience thereby obtained should all these truths be rendered manifest and incontestable can any further reason or argument in support of the proposed abolition of it be desired   but in and for the cases in which at present application is made of it a succedaneum to it will be necessary a succedaneum preferable to it in every imaginable particular will accordingly be indicated and proposed for your consideration § ii—i bad property the first—inefficiency i—  now then for bad property the first—inefficiency that is to say with reference to that same end in view namely prevention of acts similar to that in consideration of which application is made of it i mean acts on the part of individuals other than the one to whom on the individual occasion in question it is applied for as to that one the efficiency of it in this respect cannot it must be confessed be disputed   causes of this inefficiency these— i cause the first on the part of the several descriptions of persons whose cooperation is necessary to the conviction of the criminal reluctance as to the performance of their respective parts in the melancholy drama these persons are—   i the informer or informers   ii prosecutor or prosecutors   iii witnesses   iv judges   v where jurytrial is in use jurymen in any one of these several situations let but the necessary service be withheld the denunciation made of this punishment fails of being productive of the preventive effect looked for and endeavoured to be produced   ii cause the second on the part of the delinquent himself—that is to say on the part of persons at large considered as standing exposed to the temptation of becoming delinquents in this shape—comparative insensibility to the danger of punishment in this shape—as to this matter presently   look first at cause the first prodigious is the counteracting force with which you will see this same reluctance tending to destroy the efficiency of this mode of punishment—prodigious in comparison of that with which it acts in relation to any other mode   and as the dissocial affections decrease in strength and the social increase—in a word as civilization advances—the reluctance to contribute to the infliction of this punishment will increase so therefore in the eyes of the individual in question the apparent improbability of its infliction and thence in his instance the probability of its being without effect   now for a measure of the degree of this same reluctance would you have an instructive one take for the subjectmatter of observation a place in which sympathy for sufferings ordained by law may be stated as being at its minimum—the heart of an english judge   case prosecution for theft subjectmatter nine and thirty pieces of gold value nine and thirty pounds sterling judges charge—gentlemen of the jury find the     value nine and thirty shillings note that in england—the verdicts of jurymen are given on their oaths and that the breach of an oath is termed perjury and to induce a man to commit perjury is termed subornation of perjury   for what purpose then this subornation for the purpose of preventing the execution of the law—that law which he too is sworn to execute why thus seek to prevent the execution of the law because by the law in question where the value of the subjectmatter of a theft was as high as forty shillings no less punishment was allowed to be inflicted than a sort of olla podrida called felony of the ingredients of which death was one and at the expense of this compound of perjury and subornation of perjury and not otherwise the substitution of a different punishment to deathpunishment on these terms and no others was effectible recommendation given to a jury—to this effect and with this effect—has long been a common practice   when such is the reluctance in a heart of such hardness as that of an english judge steeled against all generous affections by sinister interest with the accompanying prejudices think what it must be in a heart of average consistence in the several other situations above mentioned  0 fellowcitizens who can now doubt but that of the reluctance thus produced impunity in vast abundance must have been the effect and of the impunity increase in the multitude of the several crimes effect actually produced the reverse of the effect intended and supposed to be produced    is there any other punishment in regard to which any such reluctance can be seen to have place no not one    think of the multitudes of men of so many different classes whose breasts one inclination or other employs itself in hardening against impressions from the fear of sufferance in this shape i military men against death by warfare ii men of education against death by duelling in this case the fact of the insensibility is out of dispute its propriety is a consideration that belongs not to the present purpose iii seafaring men of the nonmilitary as well as the military class iv men engaged for subsistence in various occupations in greater or less degree unhealthy but—why all this rambling this resort to other countries the question is a local one insensibility—to what to the fear of death in what place in the hearts of frenchmen wanted for the occasion a measure for the force of this quality fellowcitizens would you have a correct one look at home look at the work of the three days § iii—ii bad property the second—irremissibility   for this purpose punishments may be distinguished into continuous and instantaneous continuous those which being in their nature capable of continuing to be inflicted and suffered for and during a length of time more or less considerable may after having been suffered for and during a part of that same time be made to cease as to what remains of them instaneous such of which if any part is suffered so is every other part of the instantaneous and in this sense of the irremissible sort is as every one sees death punishment   by remission understand—not prevention of the whole but after a part has been already undergone prevention of the remainder   whatsoever on the occasion in question may be the demand for the remission of the punishment—deathpunishment being thus instantaneous is not capable of being remitted consequently in every case in which justice requires such remission it is productive of injustice   of occasions on which it may be manifestly desirable that the punishment which a man has been sentenced to suffer should thus be remitted—examples you will see are these— i discovery of the innocence of the supposed criminal ii special service in some determinate shape capable of being rendered—by the criminal in question and not by any other person iii indication for example of evidence probative of delinquency in any shape on the part of some other person iv or of innocence on the part of some other person who otherwise would have been convicted of delinquency no matter in what shape v special service in any other shape whatsoever in which service can be rendered to mankind   deathpunishment is thus rendered unapt—in comparison not only of all continuous but of other instantaneous punishments for in the case of every such punishment—mulct pillory whipping for example—after the punishment has been undergone there the man is in a capacity of receiving satisfaction in the shape of compensation and whatever other shapes may be indicated—by the nature of the supposed offence committed the punishment undergone and the circumstances of the individual sufferer in such sort that suffering and satisfaction taken together he may be—not a sufferer but rather a gainer upon the balance of the account   and note—that at the charge of some fund or other satisfaction in the pecuniary shape say in one word compensation the     man should be made to receive in every case that is to say at the charge of individual witnesses and prosecutors one or both wherever the falsehood by which the conviction was produced had evil consciousness or temerity for its accompaniment on their part failing that private fund—then at the charge of the public fund   and thus it is—that not only is deathpunishment a punishment of the infliction of which irreparable wrong may be the consequence but it is the only mode of punishment of which so deplorable a result is a necessary consequence   the comparative inefficiency of this punishment in consequence of mens reluctance to contribute to the infliction of it has just been brought to view to that same inefficiency this same irremissibility cannot but be in a greater or less degree contributory by the thought—that should the suffering which his testimony if given will be productive of turn out to be wrongful the wrong will be irreparable—can it be but that a man will be restrained from delivering such testimony on many an occasion on which he would have delivered it had the punishment been of no other sort than one of which if eventually found undue the remainder might be remitted—and for the part already undergone reparation made reader whoever you are put this question to yourself and make answer to it § iv—iii bad property the third—tendency to produce crimes   now comes bad property the third—tendency of this punishment to produce crime paradoxical as it may seem—the proposition by which this property is attributed to this same punishment is not the less true for this so extraordinary a property it is indebted to its capacity of being applied to the extinction of evidence for you will see immediately whatsoever evil is producible by false evidence that same evil is producible by extinction of true evidence   by false evidence a man may be invested with a right that does not belong to him he may be divested of a right that does belong to him so therefore may he by extinction of true evidence   by false evidence a guiltless man may be made to suffer punishment whether in the shape of deathpunishment or any other a guilty man may be acquittal be exempted from all punishment—and unreclaimed let loose upon society to add to the number of his crimes so likewise may evil in these shapes be produced by extinction of true evidence   but if any sort of crime there be to which deathpunishment is attached—then so it is—that by prosecution as for a crime of that sort with false evidence for the support of it and conviction thereupon pronounced may a man be put out of the way—and the evidence which he would have delivered on the occasion of such other suit extinguished   in this case here is a man who has been seduced and converted into a murderer seduced and by whom even by the law herself who has thus put arms into his hands having prepared the judge and his subordinates to serve him in the character of instruments and accomplices and thus it is—that by means of deathpunishment may be produced—wrongs and crimes to any amount which would not otherwise have had place   in a word deathpunishment puts it in the power of any illdisposed person by extinction put upon true evidence to produce any evil producible by him by means of false evidence by no other mode of punishment can evil in this shape be produced § v—iv bad property the fourth—enhancing the evil effects of undue pardon   throughout the civilized world pardon is as yet upon an unapt footing and of this inaptitude deathpunishment is the main cause fellowcitizens you look for explanation here it follows   punishment is everywhere an evil but everywhere a necessary one punishment that is to say suffering applied purposely by public functionaries no punishment no government no government no political society   punishment is everywhere necessary the application of it is everywhere a necessary part of judicial procedure but of that same procedure power of pardon is moreover a requisite part power of pardon that is to say as above power of arresting the hands of the judge and preventing him from applying punishment notwithstanding that demand for it which the conviction of the accused has proved to have place requisite i say—not necessary for without the existence of any such power government might be anywhere carried on but in this case evils of no small magnitude would unavoidably have place—evils which by apt application of pardonpower may be excluded and by such application as is actually made of them—are in a degree more or less considerable everywhere excluded   on the other hand—evils there are which are liable to be produced by pardonpower where unaptly applied and unaptly applied it is—when applied otherwise than under certain restrictions of which presently not inconsiderable will these same evils be seen to be and in deathpunishment you will see a main cause of them   in what way you ask i answer—in this way whenever monarchy has place—a public functionary there is in whose hands pardonpower has place and the monarch is that functionary how the case stands in     this respect under a pure aristocracy as in switzerland—how in a representative democracy as in the angloamerican united states—i stay not to inquire to the present purpose any such inquiry would be irrelevant only that you may see they are not overlooked is this brief mention made of those cases   you—so long as you have a king—you will have a functionary in whose hands this same pardonpower will remain lodged but having in hand this power he will have in hand an instrument with which if death has place in the list of punishments it depends upon him unless restrained by conditions which will presently be brought to view—yes upon him it does depend for the gratification of whatever may at any time be his desires to produce evil without stint take for example murder applying to murder this same power—it depends upon him—to murder any man—and as many men as at any time or times it pleases him so to deal with to apply to that purpose—not his own hands only but any hand or hands which by remuneration he can engage to lend themselves to this service in a word in this same power he possesses an instrument which always supposing death to have place on the list of punishments is in the very nature of it a perennial source of delusion corruption and misrule in every imaginable shape   how so you ask i answer thus wherever with a title such as that of king a monarch has place—so it is that under the influence of fear and hope imagination has exalted him into a being of a superior order—a sort of god in this god upon earth the people behold the god of their idolatry—image deputy and representative of the god which is in heaven as such they worship him they bow down to him they kneel to him they pray to him whatsoever it is that he bids them do that of course they feel disposed to do repelling as undutiful the consideration of what may be the consequences to this maleficent exaltation deathpunishment is in a prodigious degree contributory in the hands of the god of heaven is the power of life and death so accordingly is it in the hands of this god upon earth in his hands and no others the god which is in heaven has his attributes some of them belong to him in severalty others he holds in jointtenancy having for partner this his likeness—the god upon earth in the import of the word mercy is included the supposition of the existence of a power of producing pain and pleasure—of producing it in cases in which the production of it is not required by justice or on any other score by the greatesthappiness principle mercy is of the number of the attributes of the god of heaven it is of the number of those in which by law he has for partner this his deputy—the god upon earth   thus mischievous is this same word mercy in a penal code having for its first principle the greatesthappiness principle—no such word would have place   power on the one part is created by obedience on the other part correspondent with perfect exactness is this same power with this same obedience correspondent and proportionate neither greater nor less by whatever hand political power in any shape is holden a perpetual operation of it is—the pushing the power onwards in every direction in which the man finds obedience yielding to it and in every such hand the abuse of this same power except in so far as kept down by appropriate checks—rises in proportion to the quantity of it  0 fellowcitizens certain restrictions i have said there are without which by this same power evils cannot fail to be produced the restrictions i had thus in view are these which follow—    i restriction the first—no pardon granted but on condition—that to the fact of its being granted and the grounds on which it is grounded the same publicity be given as to the fact and ground of the conviction    proper grounds for pardon these— i multitude of the delinquents this applies of course not to any one separately considered but to a part of the number—a part greater or less according to the circumstances of the individual case ii since the conviction discovery made of the convicts nonguiltiness iii on condition of receipt of the pardon and not otherwise special service in any shape rendered or on adequate grounds expected to be rendered by the convict such service not being otherwise obtainable on such good terms iv special service in the particular shape of indication made—of not less maleficent delinquency on the same occasion or on any other occasion on the part of some other individual or needful evidence afforded such as is not extractible from the delinquent himself v in case of infliction apprehension of displeasure at the hands of the people vi in case of infliction apprehension of displeasure at the hands of this or that foreign power    what says somebody—if the remission has for its ground—apprehension of displeasure at the hands of the people or at the hand of a foreign power would any such allegation be compatible with the dignity of the government would it not be a confession of weakness i answer—against this evil such as it is the door might be shut without difficulty whether it has place or no depends on the   0 complexion given to the discourse which on this occasion is employed in the case where the people were in question a tone of sympathy or say of paternal condescension would be the tone proper to be assumed in the case where a foreign power was in question a tone of civility and general desire of amity    as to the time of the publicity both that and the time of the pardon might and should be left to be appointed by the powerholder in question and left to be determined by circumstances in many if not in most cases of special service what might happen is that by the publicity the service expected would be prevented from being received    ii restriction the second—as to the relative time of the grant of the pardon on the ground of special service—the grant should not be made unless and until the service had been performed in other words it should be made conditional and the condition should be—actual receipt of the expected service or at any rate performance of so much as depended upon the individual in question towards the receipt of it reason—but for this condition the ground in question might where it had no existence no such service being so much as expected be successfully employed as a pretence for pardon in cases in which pardon was unmeet    iii restriction the third—in the mean time instead of definitive the remission might be temporary or say—in the word commonly employed—a respite    iv restriction the fourth—where to the particular ground of the pardon—namely the particular service thus performed—publicity is not given at the time of the publicity given to the pardon itself—still to the general ground—special service expected the publicity might be given and on the same occasion an engagement entered into—to give publicity to the particulars of the service so soon as that could be done without detriment to the public interest    v restriction the fifth—lest this engagement should be a pretence—a list should be kept of all these cases of publicity delayed and at the recurrence of some certain period—twelve months for example—publicity should be given to a list of those several engagements the notice requisite for explanations and justification being in the instance of each delinquent inserted under appropriate heads    from pardonpower unrestricted comes impunity to delinquency in all shapes from impunity to delinquency in all shapes impunity to maleficence in all shapes from impunity to maleficence in all shapes dissolution of government from dissolution of government dissolution of political society  0 all this while no such sweeping results have place whence happens this only from the influence of two causes—  one is—on the part of those on whose hands the power of pardon is lodged nonexistence of sinister interest adequate to the production of such result on the contrary existence of an interest adequate to the prevention of it   the other is—the preventive tutelary power of public opinion    still only in part is it—that by their united power these two causes have the effect of warding off this calamitous state of things as to the first—to no inconsiderable degree as you will see the functionaries in whose hands the power of pardoning is lodged have an interest and that an adequate and but too effective interest in the production of the evils in question as to the second—namely public opinion—you will see it is itself influenced and determined by those same men who are thus under the dominion of that same sinister interest and that to such a degree that they are actually and purposely instrumental in giving birth to these same evils    then as to death that being the case you will see how it is—that in the place which death has in the list of punishments originates so large a portion of that same sinister interest and at the same time of the power of giving effect to it this is what you will see immediately when the cause of the attachment of rulers in general to this mode of punishment comes to be brought to view from all which you will see—how important it is that those same restrictive applications should accordingly be made § vi causes of the general approval of it   but says somebody—the application so universally made of it—is not this a strong presumptive proof of the need there is of it is it not everywhere in use in use under every form of government what is more—is it not generally is it not almost universally approved by some a more by others a less extended application of it by almost everybody to some cases approved or at any rate to one case—the case of murder—the application of it here then is not public opinion thus decidedly and to this degree in favour of it exists there then in the whole business of government a practice in favour of which a more strongly presumptive proof has place than that which is seen to plead in favour of this of the application made of it in practice the cause you say may be seen in the interest of kings—that sinister interest which you have been holding up to view—but—public opinion—does not public opinion likewise thus declare in favour of it and in the maintenance of this or any other practice in use on the part of kings or any other rulers can public opinion have any such or any other sinister interest i answer—the case is—that in regard to this practice public opinion has a sinister interest public opinion is—in every country     where civilization and aristocracy have place—the child and disciple of aristocracy and in the sinister interest by which monarchy is wedded to this practice aristocracy has no small share   moreover not only in one shape is sinister interest created as above by power but in another shape also it is created by pride and in this case too aristocracy has its full share look now if this be not the case whatsoever presents itself as constituting the distinction between the higher and lower orders the higher orders take a pleasure in the possession of deathpunishment presents itself to them as contributing to this distinction for wherever death has place the lower are sure to stand more exposed to it than the higher orders   take for instance depredation in some cases deathpunishment has commonly been applied to this maleficent practice what are those cases those in which it is more particularly the practice of the lower orders for instance highway robbery house robbery and pocketpicking in the literal sense of the word they having in indigence an excitement which does not so strongly apply to the higher orders   in other cases instead of deathpunishment the punishment applied to it is one which susceptible as it is of variation upon a scale of indefinite length—such as pecuniary punishments and imprisonment—may be at pleasure reduced to next to nothing what are these cases they are those in which the maleficent forbidden practice is more particularly the practice of the higher orders for instance extortion in which case it may be styled the crime of office—official situations being those by which are afforded the means necessary to the commission of it   in other cases again—instead of being punished it is licensed and established by law what are these cases they are those in which the maleficent practice is exclusively the practice of the higher orders for instance where sinecurism pay of useless or needless offices or overpay of useful and needful offices is the shape in which it veils itself sinecurism—a mode of obtaining money on false pretences   so much for sinister interest but in support of deathpunishment acts moreover the neverfailing offspring and accompaniment of sinister interest interestbegotten prejudice   again—those who believe in the christian religion believe also in the jewish religion and under the jewish religion abundant was the application made of deathpunishment and thus may be seen authoritybegotten prejudice operating in support of it   lastly under all governments from and ever since the earliest times deathpunishment has been in customary use and thus may be seen primæval prejudice and custombegotten prejudice testifying in favour of it and operating in support of it several causes concurred in bringing it into and have concurred in keeping it in use—  the strength of the antipathy excited by the acts to which it was applied   the influence which groundless antipathy had in the choice made of punishments in those rude ages on which the light of the greatesthappiness principle had not yet dawned   personal interest and aptitude for the purpose of vengeance in the breasts of rulers   the nonexistence as yet of its present succedaneum—prison discipline   the deficiency of prisonroom for want of the quantity of capital necessary to the establishment of it without need of recurring to its supposed efficiency sufficient surely to account for the universality of deathpunishment is the sum of all these causes § vii its inefficiency and needlessness proved by experience   closed on this subject you have been seeing the eyes of rulers and by what causes against reason—closed behold them now against experience   on this subject the following is the information for which i find the question indebted to our fellowcitizen—m lucas—in tuscany in the whole interval between the abolition of deathpunishment in that grand duchy by the emperor leopold while grand duke—and the reestablishment of it—the average number of crimes was considerably less than those after that same reestablishment length of the interval many years and in that same interval assassinations no more than six while in the roman states not much larger than tuscany the number in a quarter of a year was no less than sixty   for the first of these so highly instructive and interesting articles of information we were already indebted to my friend—the illustrious howard familiarly known by the name of prison howard for the other i know not that we are indebted to anybody but m lucas   that by all this put together the ruling few should in many places be engaged to abstain willingly from thus dealing with the subject many is little to be hoped for but that the subject many although the ruling few are not tired of thus dealing with them—should sooner or later be tired of being thus dealt with—and that to such a degree as to do what depends upon them towards engaging the ruling few to cease thus dealing with them seems not too much to hope for if so who can refuse to say—the sooner the oppressed bestir themselves and the more they bestir themselves the better     whatever may have been the case antecedently to this experience—subsequently to the demonstration thus afforded of the needlessness and uselessness of this so highly objectionable mode of punishment the leaving it unabolished was everywhere without excuse nor could the practice have anywhere remained unabolished but for the original influence of the abovementioned causes of error and in particular sinister interest the progenitor of all the others and therefore it is—that to account for mens thus shutting their eyes against the light—the force by which they appear to have been closed has thus been presented to your view asterisks while these pages are under revision comes in the london newspaper the spectator a masterly article on this subject presenting itself as operating powerfully in support of the policy here recommended—it is here subjoined the no is     for the week ending saturday may         capital punishments two men were hanged on wednesday one for sheepstealing the other for stealing in a dwellinghouse it was alleged in aggravation of the crime of the former that his character was bad—he was what the french call a mauvais sujet it does not appear that he had ever been tried before the thefts of the latter had been numerous and extensive the execution of these men for crimes unaccompanied by the slightest violence has very naturally attracted the notice of a large and respectable class of the community to whom the sanguinary character of our code has long been a subject of regret it indeed appears singular on a first view of the subject that in free england as it is usually called the number of crimes punishable with death should be greater than in any other european state—that we who boast so highly of our civilization should display in our practice greater barbarism than the least enlightened of our neighbours on a closer inspection of the case however the wonder will vanish our race of real freedom is only beginning hitherto there has been freedom for a party—licence for a faction but the great mass of the people have been in bondage in purely despotic countries the king can afford to be just joseph the second abolished the punishment of death throughout his dominions even now it is inflicted there only for murder and treason the emperor has his lichtensteins and his esterhazys as we have our northumberlands and our newcastles but austria has no sarums nor gattons—the curse of the rotten boroughs has not visited her in states again where freedom is a living substance as well as a form the government can show mercy america has almost no capital punishments america has neither boroughs nor boroughmongers in england law grinds the poor and why the remainder of the line supplies the ready answer—rich men make the law here is the secret of our bloody code—of the perverse ingenuity by which its abominations have so long been defended—of the dogged obstinacy with which all attempts to wash them away has been withstood whoso stealeth a sheep let him die the death says the statute could so monstrous a law have been enacted had our legislators been chosen by the people of england but our lawmakers hitherto have been our landlords by the sale of his sheep the farmer pays his rent by the rent of the farmer the luxury of the member is upheld touch one link touch all the price of blood some six hundred years ago was equal to forty pounds of our degenerate coin in process of time silver fell in the market and with it the life of an englishman twentyfold sir robert peel moderate in all things raised the sum from £  to £  why not to £ 00—why not to £ 000 in point of moral guilt is not he who filches a shilling as criminal as he that filches a million if we hang for example the lesser crime is of necessity the more frequent and most calls for repression besides it is the poor—they who most require protective laws that are the sufferers by petty plunder theres the rub rich men make the law rich men alone suffer by the abstraction of large sums—hence the bloody penalty but the remedy is nigh at hand—it is even now come the bill which gives us good legislators insures for us good laws men impartially chosen will judge impartially we shall no more have one rule for the rich and another for the poor nor shall we any longer have the pain of listening to the defence in the high court of parliament of absurdities which have long been condemned by sensible men in every other place in the empire reform will satisfy the yearnings of humanity as amply as the hopes of patriotism     part iii of indirect means of preventing crimes introduction in all sciences there are some branches which have been cultivated more slowly than others because they have required a longer train of observations and more profound reflection thus in mathematics one part is called transcendental or sublime because so to speak it is a new science beyond the ordinary science the same distinction might at a certain point be applied to legislation some actions are hurtful what ought to be done to prevent them the first reply which presents itself to all the world is—prohibit such actions punish them this method of combating offences is the most simple and the first adopted and every other method of attaining the same end is a refinement in art and so to speak its transcendental part this part consists in providing a train of legislative proceedings for the prevention of offences by acting principally upon the inclinations of individuals for the purpose of diverting them from evil and impressing on them the direction most useful to themselves and others the first method of combating offences by punishments constitutes direct legislation the second method of combating them by means which prevent them constitutes what may be called the indirect branch of legislation thus the sovereign acts directly against offences when he prohibits each one separately under pain of special punishment he acts indirectly when he takes precautions to prevent them in direct legislation the evil is attacked in front in indirect legislation it is attacked by oblique methods in the first case the legislator declares open war with the enemy he hoists his signals he pursues he fights hand to hand with him and mounts his batteries in his presence in open day in the second case he does not announce his designs he opens his mines he consults his spies he seeks to prevent hostile designs and to keep in alliance with himself those who might have secret intentions hostile to him political speculators have perceived all this but in speaking of this second branch of legislation they have not clearly expressed their ideas the former has long since been reduced to system the second has never been analyzed no one has thought of treating it methodically of classifying it—in a word of considering it as a whole it is still a new subject writers who have formed political romances tolerate direct legislation it is the last resource to which they apply and of which they never speak with a very lively interest on the contrary when they speak of the means of preventing offences—of rendering men better—of improving their manners—their imagination kindles their hopes brighten they believe that they are about to effect a great work and that the condition of the human race is about to receive a new form this arises from the habit of thinking every thing magnificent in proportion as it is unknown and because upon such vague subjects the imagination has greater scope than upon those which have long been submitted to the yoke of analysis major e longinquo reverentiâ this saying is equally applicable to thoughts and persons a detailed examination will reduce all these undefined hopes to their just dimensions of what is possible but if we lose some fictitious treasures we shall be well indemnified by ascertaining the real extent of our resources in order clearly to ascertain what belongs to these two branches it is necessary to begin by forming a just idea of direct legislation we should proceed in the following manner—   to determine what acts ought to be considered as crimes   to describe each crime as murder theft peculation c   to exhibit the reasons for attributing to these acts the quality of crimes—reasons which ought to be deduced from a single principle and consequently which should agree among themselves   to set apart a sufficient punishment for each crime   to exhibit the reasons which serve to justify this punishment this penal system if it were the best possible would be defective in many respects   it would require that the evil had existed before the remedy could be applied the remedy consists in the application of punishment and punishment can only be inflicted after the crime is committed each fresh instance of the infliction of punishment is another proof of its inefficiency and allows a certain degree of danger and alarm to subsist   the punishment itself is an evil although     necessary for the prevention of a greater evil penal justice throughout the whole course of its operation can only be a train of evils—evils in the threats and constraint of the law—evils in the pursuit of the accused before the innocent can be distinguished from the guilty—evils in the infliction of judicial sentences—evils in the inevitable consequences which reverberate upon the innocent   in short the penal system has not sufficient hold upon many mischievous acts which escape from justice—sometimes from their frequency sometimes from the facility with which they are concealed—sometimes from the difficulty of defining them—sometimes from a wrong direction in public opinion which screens them penal law can only act within certain limits and its power only extends to palpable acts susceptible of manifest proofs this imperfection of the penal system has induced a search after new expedients for supplying what is wanting these expedients have for their object the prevention of crimes—sometimes by taking away even the knowledge of evil—sometimes by taking away the power or the will to do evil the most numerous class of these means is connected with the art of directing the inclinations by weakening the seductive motives which excite to evil and by fortifying the tutelary motives which excite to good indirect methods then are those which without having the characters of punishment act either physically or morally upon the man in order to dispose him to obey the laws—to remove from him temptations to crimes and govern him by his inclinations and his knowledge these indirect methods have not only great advantage in point of gentleness they also often succeed when direct methods fail all modern historians have remarked how much the abuses of the roman catholic church have been diminished since the establishment of protestantism what popes and councils could not effect by their decrees a happy rivalry has effected without trouble they have feared to give occasion of scandal which should become a subject for triumph to their enemies hence this indirect method the free competition of religions has had greater force in restraining and reforming them than all their positive laws we may take another example from political economy it has been considered desirable that the prices of merchandise and especially that the interest of money should be low high prices it is true are only an evil by comparison with the good of which they hinder the enjoyment but such as it is there has been a reason for seeking to diminish them in what manner has it been attempted a multitude of regulations have been established—a fixed rate—a legal interest and what has happened the regulations have been eluded—punishments have been increased—and the evil instead of being diminished has increased also there is no efficacy but in an indirect method of which few governments have had the wisdom to make use to leave a free course for the competition of all merchants of all capitalists—to trust instead of making war upon them—to allow them to supplant each other—to invite the buyers to themselves by the most advantageous offers—such is the method free competition is equivalent to a reward granted to those who furnish the best goods at the lowest price it offers an immediate and natural reward which a crowd of rivals flatter themselves that they shall obtain and acts with greater efficacy than a distant punishment from which each one may hope to escape before entering upon an exhibition of these indirect methods i ought to acknowledge that the manner of their classification is a little arbitrary so that several might be ranged under different heads in order invariably to distinguish them from each other an exceedingly subtle and fatiguing metaphysical analysis would be required it is sufficient for the object in view if all the indirect methods may be placed under one or other of these heads and if the attention of the legislator be awakened to the principal sources from which they may be drawn i only add one preliminary remark but it is an essential one in the variety of measures about to be exhibited there is not one that can be recommended as suitable to each government in particular and still less to all in general the special advantage of each measure considered by itself will be indicated under its title but each may have relative inconveniences which it is impossible to determine without a knowledge of particular circumstances it ought therefore to be well understood that the object in view is not to propose the adoption of any given measure but solely to exhibit it to the view and recommend it to the attention of those who may be able to judge of its fitness chapter i methods of taking away the physical power of injuring when the will the knowledge and the power necessary for an act concur this act is necessarily produced inclination knowledge power these then are the three points to which the influence of the laws may be applied in order to determine the conduct of individuals these three words contain in abstract the sum and the substance of every     thing which can be done by direct or indirect legislation i begin with power because the means of influence in this respect are more limited and more simple and because in those cases in which the power to injure is taken away every thing is done—success is secure power may be distinguished into two kinds   internal power which depends upon the intrinsic faculties of the individual   external power which depends upon the persons and things which are without him and without which he cannot act as to internal power which depends upon the faculties of the individual it is scarcely possible to deprive a man of this advantage the power of doing evil is inseparable from the power of doing good when the hands are cut off a man can hardly steal but also he can hardly work besides these privative means are so severe that they can only be employed with regard to criminals already convicted imprisonment is the only one which can be justified in certain cases in order to prevent an apprehended offence† there are some cases in which the power of injuring may be taken away by excluding what tacitus calls irritamenta malorum—the subjects the instruments of the offence here the policy of the legislator may be compared to that of a governess the bars of iron for the windows the guards around the fire care in removing all sharp and dangerous instruments out of the reach of the children are steps of the same kind with the prohibition of the sale and fabrication of dies for coining of poisonous drugs of concealed arms of dice and other instruments of prohibited games the prohibition of making and having snares or other means of catching game mahomet not trusting to reason has sought to put it out of the power of men to misuse strong liquors if we regard the climate of hot countries in which wine produces fury rather than stupidity it will perhaps be found that its total prohibition is more gentle than its permitted use which would have produced numerous offences and consequently numerous punishments taxes upon spirituous liquors in part accomplish the same end in proportion as the price is raised above the reach of the most numerous class the means of yielding to intemperance are taken from them sumptuary laws so far as they prohibit the introduction of certain articles which are the objects of the legislators jealousy may be referred to this head it is this which has rendered the legislation of sparta so famous the precious metals were banished strangers were excluded voyages were not permitted at geneva the wearing of diamonds was prohibited and the number of horses was limited‡ under this head may be mentioned many english statutes relative to the sale of spirituous liquors their open exposure to sale is prohibited it is necessary to obtain a licence which costs much c the prohibition to open certain places of amusement on the sunday belongs to this head to the same head must be referred measures for the destruction of libels seditious writings and obscene figures exhibited in the streets and for preventing their printing and publication the old police of paris prohibited servants from carrying not only swords but also canes and sticks this might have been a simple distinction of rank—it might have been as a means of security when one class of the people is oppressed by the sovereign prudence would direct that they should be forbidden to bear arms the greater injury becomes a justifying reason for the commission of the lesser the philistines obliged the jews to resort to them whenever they wanted to sharpen their hatchets and saws in china the manufacture and sale of arms is confined to the chinese tartars by a statute of george the third any individual is forbidden to have more than fifty pounds weight of gunpowder in his house and the dealers in gunpowder are forbidden to have more than two hundred pounds weight at one time the reason assigned is the danger of explosions in the statutes relating to the public roads and turnpikes the number of horses to be used in a carriage is limited to eight except in case of the removal of certain articles and in what relates to the public service connected with the artillery and ammunition     the reason assigned is the preservation of the roads if these measures and others like them have besides a political object it is what i do not pretend to say but it is certain that such expedients may be employed for taking away the means of revolt or diminishing the facilities for smuggling among the expedients which may be derived from this source i know of none more happy nor more simple than that which is employed in england for rendering the stealing of banknotes difficult when it is intended to send them by the post they may be cut into two parts and each part sent separately the stealing of one half of the note would be useless and the difficulty of stealing both parts the one after the other is so great that the offence is almost impossible for the exercise of some professions proofs of capacity are required there are others which the laws render incompatible with each other in england many offices of justice are incompatible with the condition of an attorney it is feared lest the right hand should secretly work for the benefit of the left contractors for the supply of provisions c for the navy are not allowed to sit in parliament the contractors may become delinquents and subject to the judgment of the parliament it would not be proper that they should be members of it but there are stronger reasons for this exclusion to be drawn from the danger of increasing ministerial influence chapter ii another indirect method—hinder the acquisition of knowledge which may be rendered injurious† i only mention this policy to proscribe it it has produced the censorship of books it has produecd the inquisition it would produce the eternal degradation of the human race i intend to show— st that the diffusion of knowledge is not hurtful upon the whole crimes of refinement being less hurtful than those of ignorance  d that the most advantageous method of combating the evil which may result from a certain degree of knowledge is to increase its quantity i say at once that the diffusion of knowledge is not hurtful upon the whole some writers have thought or appeared to think that the less men knew the better they would be that the less they knew the fewer objects would they be acquainted with as motives to or instruments for doing evil that fanatics have held this opinion would not be surprising seeing there is a natural and constant rivalry between the knowledge of useful and intelligible things and the knowledge of things imaginary useless and unintelligible but this style of thinking with respect to the danger of knowledge is sufficiently common among the mass of mankind they speak with regret of the golden age—of the age when nothing was known in order to exhibit the mistake upon which this manner of thinking is founded a more precise method of estimating the evil of an offence than has hitherto been employed is required that the crimes of refinement have been considered more hateful than the crimes of ignorance is not surprising in judging of the grandeur of offences the principle of antipathy has been more followed than the principle of utility antipathy looks more at the apparent degradation of character indicated by the offence than at any other circumstance this in the eyes of passion is the salient point in every action in comparison with which the strict examination required by the principle of utility will always appear cold now the greater the knowledge and refinement indicated by a crime the greater the reflection exhibited on the part of its author the greater the depravation of moral dispositions indicated also but the evil of a crime the only object according to the principle of utility is not solely determined by the depravity of character exhibited—it depends immediately upon the sufferings of the persons who are affected by the crime and the alarm which results from it to society in general and into this sum of evil the depravity which the criminal has manifested enters as an aggravation but not as an essential circumstance the greatest crimes are those for which the slightest degree of knowledge is sufficient the most ignorant individual always knows how to commit them inundation is a greater crime than incendiarism incendiarism greater than murder murder than robbery robbery than cheating this might be demonstrated by an arithmetical process by an inventory of the items of evil on both sides by a comparison of the extent of evil done to each person injured and by the number of persons who would be     enveloped in such evil but how much knowledge must be possessed that an individual may be qualified to commit such acts the most atrocious of all only requires a degree of information which is found among the most barbarous and savage of men rape is worse than seduction or adultery but rape is more frequent in times of ignorance seduction and adultery in times of civilization the dissemination of knowledge has not augmented the number of crimes nor even the facility of committing them it has only diversified the means of their accomplishment and how has it diversified them by gradually substituting those which are less hurtful is a new method of cheating invented the inventor profits for a time by his discovery but soon his secret is discovered and we are upon our guard he must then have recourse to a new method which like the first will last only for a time and pass away all this time it is only cheating which is less mischievous than theft which itself is a less evil than highway robbery for what reason the confidence of every one in his own prudence in his own sagacity hinders him from being alarmed so much by a case of cheating as by a robbery let us however acknowledge that the wicked abuse every thing—that the more they know the greater will be their means of doing evil what follows if the good and the wicked compose two distinct races as those of the blacks and the whites the one might be enlightened whilst the other was held in ignorance but since it is impossible to distinguish them and since good and evil are so frequently mingled in the same individuals one law must be established for all general illumination or general blindness there is no medium the remedy springs out of the evil itself knowledge confers no advantage upon the wicked except they exclusively possess it a snare when recognised is no longer a snare the most ignorant nations have known how to poison the points of their arrows but it is only those nations which are far advanced in civilization which are acquainted with all poisons and can oppose antidotes to each all men are qualified to commit crimes it is only the enlightened who are qualified to frame laws for their prevention the less instructed a man is the more is he led to separate his interests from those of his fellows the more enlightened he is the more distinctly will he perceive the union of his personal with the general interest examine the history of past times the most barbarous ages will present an assemblage of all crimes and even crimes of cheating as well as those of violence the grossness given to some vices does not exclude a single one at what period were false titles and false dotations most multiplied when the clergy alone knew how to read—when from the superiority of their knowledge they regarded other men nearly as we regard horses which we could no longer render submissive to the bit and the bridle if their intellectual faculties were augmented why at the same time had they recourse to judicial duels to proofs by fire and water to all those species of trials which they called judgments of god it was because in the infancy of reason they had no principles upon which to discern between true and false testimony compare the effects produced under those governments which have restrained the publication of thought and those which have allowed it a free course you have on the one side spain portugal italy you have on the other side england holland and northern america where are the most civilized manners and the greatest happiness where are the most crimes committed where is society most gentle and most secure those institutions have been too much celebrated in which their heads have monopolized all knowledge of this kind was the priesthood of ancient egypt the caste of the bramins in indostan the societies of the jesuits in paraguay upon these institutions it is proper to make two observations the first that if their conduct have merited eulogium it is with respect to the interest of those who have invented these forms of government not with respect to the interest of those who have been subject to them it may be admitted that the people have been tranquil and docile under these theocracies have they been happy this cannot be believed if it be admitted that abject servitude vain terrors useless obligations and mortifications painful privations and gloomy opinions are obstacles to happiness the second observation is that they have less completely obtained their design in maintaining natural ignorance than in spreading prejudices and propagating errors the chiefs themselves have always finished by becoming the victims of this narrow and pusillanimous policy nations which have been retained in a state of constant inferiority by institutions     which were opposed to all kinds of progress have at length become the prey of other nations who have obtained a comparative superiority these nations become old in their infancy under tutors who prolonged their imbecility in order more easily to govern them have always offered an easy conquest and once subjugated have known no change but in the colour of their chains but it may be said there is no question among us of leading men back to ignorance all governments feel the necessity of illumination what excites their fears is the liberty of the press they are not opposed to the publication of books of science but have they not reason to oppose the publication of immoral and seditious writings with regard to which there is no longer any opportunity of preventing their mischief when once they are issued to punish a guilty author may perhaps prevent the guilt of those who may be tempted to imitate him but to prevent by the institution of a censorship the publication of evil books is to stop the poison at its source the liberty of the press has its inconveniences but the evil which may result from it is not to be compared with the evil of the censorship where shall that rare genius that superior intelligence that mortal accessible to all truth and inaccessible to all passions be found to whom to confide this right of supreme dictation over all the productions of the human mind would a locke or a leibnitz or a newton have had the presumption to undertake it and what is this power that you are obliged to confide to ordinary men it is a power which by a singular necessity collects together in its exercise all the causes of prevarication and all the characters of iniquity who is the censor he is an interested judge—a sole an arbitrary judge who carries on a clandestine process condemns without hearing and decides without appeal secresy the greatest of all its abuses is essential to a censorship publicly to plead the cause of any book would be to publish it in order to determine whether it were fit for publication whilst as to the evil which may result from it it is impossible to estimate it since it is impossible to say what it arrests it is nothing less than the danger of arresting the progress of the human mind in every career every interesting and new truth must have many enemies because it is interesting and new is it to be presumed that the censor will belong to that infinitely small number who rise above established prejudices were he to possess this elevation of mind would be possess boldness sufficient to compromise himself by discoveries of which he would not possess the glory there is only one course of safety for him it is to proscribe all but ordinary ideas—to pass his blasting scythe over every thing which rises above the ordinary level he risks nothing by prohibition he risks every thing by permission by doubt he does not suffer it is truth which is stifled if it had depended upon men invested with authority to regulate the progress of the human mind where should we now have been religion legislation natural philosophy morals would still be all in darkness the proof of these wellknown facts need not here be repeated the true censorship is that of an enlightened public which will brand dangerous and false opinions and will encourage useful discoveries the boldness of a libel in a free country will not save it from general contempt but by a contradiction easily to be explained the indulgence of the public in this respect is proportioned always to the rigour of the government chapter iii of indirect means of preventing the will to commit offences we have seen that legislation can only operate by influencing the power the knowledge the will we have spoken of the indirect means of taking away the power of injury we have seen that the policy which would prevent men from acquiring information would be more hurtful than advantageous all other indirect means which can be employed must therefore have reference to the direction of their inclinations to the putting in practice the rules of a logic too little understood at present—the logic of the will—a logic which often appears in opposition to the logic of understanding as it has been well expressed by the poet—   video meliora   proboque et deteriora sequor the methods we are about to present are of a nature to make this internal discord in many cases to cease to diminish this contrariety among motives which often exists only from the unskilfulness of the legislator—from an opposition which he has himself created between the natural and political sanctions—between the moral and religious sanctions if he could make all these powers concur towards the same end all the faculties of the man would be in harmony and the inclination to injure would no longer exist in those cases in which this object cannot be attained it is proper that the power of the tutelary motives should be made to exceed that of the seductive motives i shall propose the indirect methods by which the will may be influenced in the form     of political or moral problems and i shall show their solution by different examples— problem  st to divert the course of dangerous desires and direct the inclination towards those amusements which are most conformed to the public interest  d to make such arrangements that a given desire may be satisfied without prejudice or with the least possible prejudice  d to avoid furnishing encouragements to crimes  th to augment the responsibility of individuals in proportion as they are more exposed to temptation  th to diminish their sensibility with regard to temptation  th to strengthen the impression of punishments upon the imagination  th to facilitate the knowledge of the commission of crimes  th to prevent crimes by giving to many persons an immediate interest in preventing them  th to facilitate the means of recognising and finding individuals  0th to increase the difficulty of escape to delinquents   th to diminish the uncertainty of procedure and punishments   th to prohibit accessory offences in order to prevent their principals after these means whose object is special we shall point out others of a more general nature such as the cultivation of benevolence and honour the employment of the motive of religion and the use which may be made of the power of instruction and education chapter iv problem i to divert the course of dangerous desires and direct the inclination towards those amusements which are most conformed to the public interest the object of direct legislation is to combat pernicious desires by prohibitions and punishments directed against the hurtful acts to which those desires may give birth the object of indirect legislation is to countermine their influence by augmenting the force of the less dangerous desires which may enter into competition with them there are two objects to be considered—what are the desires which it would be desirable to weaken by what means may we attain this end pernicious desires may arise from three sources— st the malevolent passions  d the fondness for inebriating liquors  d the love of idleness the methods of diminishing them may be reduced to three heads—  the encouraging kindly feelings   the favouring the consumption of noninebriating liquors in preference to those which intoxicate   the avoidance of forcing men into a state of idleness some persons may be astonished that the catalogue of the sources of vicious inclinations is so limited but they must be made to observe that in the human heart there is no passion absolutely bad there is no one which does not need direction—there is no one which ought to be destroyed it is said that when the angel gabriel prepared the prophet mahomet for his mission he took out of his heart a black spot which contained the seed of evil unhappily this operation is not practicable in the hearts of ordinary men the seeds of good and evil are inseparately mixed inclinations are governed by motives but motives are constituted by pains and pleasures by all pains to be avoided by all pleasures to be pursued hence all these motives may produce all sorts of effects from the best to the worst they are trees which bear excellent fruits or poisons according to the aspect in which they are found according to the culture of the gardener and even according to the wind which prevails and the temperature of the day the most pure benevolence too confined in its object or mistaking its means will be productive of crimes selfish affections though they may occasionally become hurtful are constantly most necessary and notwithstanding their deformity the malevolent passions are always at least useful—as means of defence as securities against the invasions of personal interest no one affection of the human heart ought therefore to be eradicated since there is not one which does not act its part in the system of utility all that is required is to work upon these inclinations according to the direction which they take and the effects which can be foreseen it may be possible also to establish a useful balance among them by fortifying those which are usually weak and weakening those which are too strong it is thus that a farmer directs the course of the waters that he may not impoverish his meadows and prevents their inundation by dykes the art of constructing dykes consists in not directly opposing the violence of the current which would carry away every obstacle placed directly in its front the desire for intoxicating liquors is properly speaking the only one which can be extirpated without producing any evil since the irascible passions as i have said are a necessary stimulant in the cases in which individuals have to protect themselves from injuries and to repel the attacks of their enemies the love of repose is not hurtful in itself indolence is however an evil inasmuch as it   0 favours the ascendancy of evil passions at all times these three desires may be considered as requiring to be equally resisted it need scarcely be dreaded lest we should be too successful in overcoming the inclination to idleness or that it will be possible to reduce the vindictive passions below the point of their utility the first expedient i have said consists in encouraging innocent amusements this is one branch of the very complicated but undefined science which consists in advancing civilization the state of barbarism differs from that of civilization by two characteristics—  by the force of the irascible appetites   by the small number of objects of enjoyment which offer themselves to the concupiscible appetites the occupations of a savage when he has procured the necessaries for his physical wants—the only wants he knows—are soon described the pursuit of vengeance—the pleasures of intoxication if he possess the means—sleep or the most complete indolence these are all his resources each of his inclinations is favourable to the developement and action of every other resentment finds easy access to an empty mind idleness is the door of drunkenness and drunkenness produces quarrels which nourish and multiply quarrels the pleasures of love not being complicated by the sentimental refinements which embellish and strengthen them do not occupy a conspicuous part in the life of the savage and do not go far in filling up the intervals of his labours under a regular government the necessity of revenge is suppressed by legal protection and the pleasure of giving way to it is repressed by fear of punishment the power of indolence is weakened but the love of intoxicating liquors is not diminished a nation of savages and a nation of hunters are convertible terms the life of a hunter offers long intervals of leisure as well as that of a fisherman provided they understand the means of preserving the species of food which they obtain but in a civilized state the mass of the community is composed of labourers and artisans who have no more leisure than is required for relaxation and sleep the misfortune is that the passion for strong drinks may be gratified in the midst of a life of labour and they may be taken during the hours set apart for repose poverty restrains it among the inferior classes but artisans whose labour is better paid for may make great sacrifices to this fatal desire and the richer classes may devote to it all their time hence we see that in the rude ages the superior classes have divided their life between war—the chase which is the image of war—the animal functions and long repasts of which drunkenness was the chief attraction the detail of such scenes formed the whole history of a great proprietor of a grand feudal baron in the gothic ages the privilege of this noble warrior of this noble hunter seems to have been to prolong in a more civilized society the occupations and the character of the savage this being the case every innocent amusement that the human heart can invent is useful under a double point of view— st for the pleasure itself which results from it  d from its tendency to weaken the dangerous inclinations which man derives from his nature and when i speak of innocent amusements i mean all those which cannot be shown to be hurtful their introduction being favourable to the happiness of society it is the duty of the legislator to encourage them or at least not to oppose any obstacle to them i shall mention the sources of some commencing with those which are regarded as most gross and proceeding to those which are considered as more refined—   the introduction of a variety of aliments and the improvement of horticulture applied to the production of nutritive vegetables   the introduction of nonintoxicating liquors of which coffee and tea are the principal these two articles which some superficial minds would be surprised to find occupying a place in a catalogue of moral objects are so much the more useful since they come in direct competition with intoxicating liquors†   the improvement of every thing which constitutes elegance whether of dress or furniture the embellishment of gardens c   the invention of games for passing the time whether athletic or sedentary among which the game of chess holds a distinguished rank i exclude only games of chance these tranquil games have brought the sexes more nearly upon an equality and have diminished ennui the peculiar malady of the human race and especially of the opulent and the aged   the cultivation of music   theatres assemblies and public amusements‡       the cultivation of the arts sciences and literature when we consider these different sources of enjoyment as opposed to the necessary means of providing subsistence they are called objects of luxury if their tendency be such as has been suggested how singular soever it may appear luxury is rather a source of virtue than of vice this branch of policy has not been entirely neglected but it has been cultivated in a political rather than in a moral view the object has rather been to render the people tranquil and submissive to government than to render the citizens more united among themselves more happy more industrious more honest the games of the circus were one of the principal objects of attention among the romans it was not merely a method of conciliating the affections of the people but also of diverting their attention from public affairs the saying of pylades to augustus is well known cromwell whose ascetic principles did not allow him to use this resource had no other means of occupying the minds of his countrymen than engaging the nation in foreign wars at venice a government jealous to excess of its authority showed the greatest indulgence to pleasures the processions and other religious festivals of catholic countries partly accomplished the same object as the games of the circus all these institutions have been considered by political writers as so many means of softening the yoke of power—of turning the minds of men towards agreeable objects and preventing them from occupying themselves with the affairs of government this effect without having been the object of their establishment has caused them to obtain more favour when they have been established peter i had recourse to a greater and more generous policy the manners of the russians with the exception of sobriety were more asiatic than european peter i desirous of moderating their grossness and softening the ferocity of their manners employed some expedients which were perhaps a little too direct he employed every possible encouragement and went so far as to use violence in order to introduce the european dress the amusements the assemblies the arts of europeans to lead his subjects to the imitation of the other nations of europe was in other terms to civilize them but he found the greatest resistance to all these innovations envy jealousy contempt and a multitude of antisocial passions rendered them disinclined to an assimilation to these rival strangers these passions no longer recognised their object when the visible marks of distinction were effaced by taking away that exterior which distinguished them he took away from them so to speak the pretext and aliment of these hateful rivalries he associated them with the great republic of europe and he gained every thing for them by this association the rigid compulsory observance of the sabbath as in scotland in some parts of germany and in england is a violation of this policy which has no foundation in the gospels and is even contrary to many texts and positive examples happy the people who rising above brutal and gross vices study elegance of manners the pleasures of society the embellishments of their places of resort the fine arts the sciences public amusements and exercises of mind the religions which inspire sadness—the governments which render men mistrustful and separate them one from another contain the germs of the greatest vices and of the most hurtful passions chapter v problem ii to make such arrangements that a given desire may be satisfied without prejudice or with the least possible prejudice the desires of which we are about to speak as well as others which we have not mentioned may be satisfied in different manners and on different conditions through all the degrees of the scale of morality from innocence to the highest crime that these desires may be satisfied without prejudice—such is the first object to be accomplished but if they cannot be regulated to this point that their satisfaction may not produce so great an injury to the community as that which results from a violated law—such is the second object if even this cannot be attained to arrange every thing in such manner that the individual placed by his desires between two offences may be led to choose the least hurtful—such is the third object this last object appears humble enough it is a species of composition with vice a bargain is made with it so to speak and it is sought that the individual may be satisfied at the least possible expense let us examine how it is possible to deal upon all these points with three classes of imperious desires—  revenge   poverty   love section i for the satisfaction of vindictive desires without prejudice there are two means—  to provide a legal redress for every species of injury   to provide a competent     redress for all injuries which affect honour   for the satisfaction of these vindictive desires with the least possible prejudice there is only one expedient it is that of showing indulgence to duelling let us recapitulate these different heads   to provide a legal redress for every species of injury the vices and the virtues of the human race depend much upon the circumstances of society hospitality as has been observed is most practised where it is most necessary it is the same with revenge in the state of nature the fear of private vengeance is the only restraint of brute force—the only security against the violence of the passions it corresponds to the fear of punishment in a state of political society each step in the administration of justice tends to diminish the force of the vindictive appetites and to prevent acts of private animosity the interest principally in view in legal redress is that of the party injured but the offender himself finds his profit in this arrangement leave a man to avenge himself and his vengeance knows no limits grant to him what you in cool blood consider as a sufficient satisfaction and prohibit his seeking for more he will choose rather to accept what you give him without running any hazard than expose himself to the judgment of the law by endeavouring to take a greater satisfaction by himself here then is an accessory benefit resulting from care to provide judicial redress reprisals are prevented covered by the buckler of justice the transgressor after his offence finds himself in a state of comparative security under the protection of the law it is sufficiently evident that the more completely legal redress is provided the more the motive will be diminished which might excite the party injured to procure it for himself when every pain which a man is liable to suffer from the conduct of another shall be followed immediately by what shall in his eyes be an equivalent pleasure the irascible appetite will no longer exist the supposition is evidently an exaggerated one but exaggerated as it is it includes enough of truth to show that each amelioration which is made in this branch of justice tends to diminish the force of the vindictive passions hume has observed in speaking of the barbarous times of english history that the great difficulty was to engage the injured party to receive satisfaction and that the laws which related to satisfaction were as much intended to limit his resentment as to procure for him an enjoyment in addition to this institute a legal punishment for an injury you provide a place for generosity—you create a virtue to pardon an injury when the law offers a satisfaction is to exercise a species of superiority over an adversary by the obligation which results from it no one can attribute the pardon to weakness the motive is above suspicion   to provide a competent redress for injuries which attack the point of honour in particular this class of injuries demands so much the more particular attention in as much as they have a more marked tendency to excite the vindictive passions enough has been already said upon this subject in part i ch xiv to render a return to it unnecessary in this respect the french jurisprudence has long been superior to all others english jurisprudence is eminently defective upon this point it knows nothing of honour—it has no means of estimating a corporal insult but by the size of the wound it does not suppose that there can be any other evil in the loss of reputation than the loss of the money which may be the consequence of it it considers money as a remedy for all evils—a palliation for all affronts he who does not possess it possesses nothing he who possesses it can want for nothing it knows only pecuniary reparation but the present generation ought not to be reproached with the rudeness of the ages of barbarism these laws were established when sentiments of honour had not been developed questions of honour are now decided by the tribunal of public opinion and its decrees are pronounced with a power altogether peculiar however it cannot be doubted but that the silence of the law has had a bad effect an englishman cannot enter france without observing how much more the feeling of honour and the contempt of money descends so to speak among the inferior classes in france than in england this difference is especially remarkable in the army the sentiment of glory—the pride of disinterestedness—are everywhere discovered among the common soldiers and they would consider a noble action as tarnished by estimating its value in money an honorary sword is the first of recompenses   to show indulgence to duelling if the individual offended will not be contented with the satisfaction offered by the laws it is proper to be indulgent to duelling poisoning and assassination are hardly heard of where duelling is established the light evil which results from it is like a premium of assurance whereby a nation guarantees itself against the greater evil of other offences duelling is a preservative of politeness and peace the fear of being obliged to give or receive a challenge destroys quarrels in their     germ the greeks and romans it will be said were acquainted with glory and knew nothing of duelling so much the worse for them their sentiment of glory was not opposed either to poisoning or assassination among the political dissensions of the athenians one half of the citizens plotted the destruction of the other compare what passes in england and ireland with the dissensions of greece and rome clodius and milo according to our customs would have fought a duel according to roman customs they reciprocally sought to assassinate each other and he who killed his adversary only forestalled him in the island of malta duelling had become a species of madness and so to speak of civil war one of the grand masters made such severe laws against it and executed them so rigorously that duelling ceased but it was to give place to a crime which unites cowardice with cruelty assassination before unknown among the knights became so common that they soon regretted the loss of duelling and at last expressly tolerated it in a certain place and at certain hours the result was such as had been expected so soon as a course of honourable revenge was opened the clandestine methods were rendered infamous duels are less common in italy than in france and england poisoning and assassinations are much more so in france the laws against duelling were severe but methods were found for eluding them upon an agreement to fight a pretended quarrel was got up as a kind of prelude in england the law confounds duelling and murder but the juries do not confound them they pardon it or what amounts to the same thing find it manslaughter involuntary homicide the people are better guided by their good sense than the jurists have been by their science would it not be better to place the remedy among the laws rather than in their subversion section ii let us turn to indigence we have here to consider the interests of the poor themselves and those of the community a man deprived of the means of subsistence is urged by the most irresistible motives to commit every crime by which he may provide for his wants where this stimulus exists it is useless to combat it by the fear of punishment because there is scarcely one punishment which can be greater and no one which by reason of its uncertainty and its distance can appear so great as the dying of hunger the effects of indigence can therefore only be guarded against by providing necessaries for those who have them not the indigent may be distinguished in this respect into four classes   the industrious poor those who are willing to work that they may live   idle mendicants those who prefer rather to depend upon the precarious charity of passengers for subsistence than to labour for their subsistence   suspected persons those who having been arrested on account of a crime and set at liberty because of the insufficiency of proof have remained with a stain upon their reputation which hinders their obtaining employment   criminals who have been confined for a time in prison and have been set at liberty these different classes ought not to be treated in the same manner and in establishments for the poor particular care ought to be taken to separate the suspected from the innocent classes one scabby sheep says the proverb infects the flock every thing which the poor can be made to earn by their labour is not only a profit for the community but also for themselves their time ought to be occupied as their lives ought to be sustained it is humanity which prescribes the finding occupations for the deaf the blind the dumb the lame the impotent the wages of idleness are never so sweet as the reward of toil if a man have been apprehended and accused of a crime of indigence even when he is acquitted he ought to be required to render an account of his means of subsistence at least for the last six months if he be honest this inquiry can do him no harm if he be not it is proper to act accordingly females especially those a little above ordinary labour have a peculiar disadvantage in finding occupation men having more activity more liberty and perhaps more dexterity even take possession of those labours which belong more properly to the other sex and which are almost indecent in the hands of men men are found selling toys for children keeping shops for fashions c making shoes stays and dresses for women men are found filling the function of midwives i have often doubted whether the injustice of the custom might not be redressed by the law and whether women ought not to be put in possession of these means of subsistence to the exclusion of men it would be an indirect method of obviating prostitution by providing females with suitable employments the practice of employing men as midwives which has excited such lively reclamations is not yet generally adopted except among the higher classes where anxiety is greatest and in those cases when the danger appears extreme it would therefore be dangerous to establish a legal exclusion of men at least until female pupils had been educated capable of replacing them     with respect to the treatment of the poor no universal measure can be proposed it must be determined by local and national circumstances in scotland with the exception of some great towns the government does not interfere with the care of the poor in england the tax raised for their support in      exceeded £ 000000 their condition is however better in scotland than in england the object is better accomplished by the manners of the people than by the laws notwithstanding the inconveniences of the english system it cannot be given up all at once otherwise the one half of the poor would perish before the necessary habits of benevolence and frugality have taken root in scotland the influence of the clergy is highly salutary having only a moderate salary and no tithes the clergymen are known and respected by their parishioners in england the clergy being rich and having tithes the clergyman is often quarrelling with his flock and knows little of them in scotland in ireland in france the poor are moderate in their wants at naples the climate saves the expense of fuel of lodging and almost of clothing in the east indies clothing is hardly necessary except for decency in scotland domestic economy is good in all respects except neatness in holland it is also as good as it can be in every respect in england on the one hand wants are greater than anywhere else and economy is perhaps upon a worse footing than in any country in the world the most certain method of providing for the poor is not to wait for indigence but to prevent it the greatest service which can be rendered to the working classes is the institution of savings banks in which by the attractions of security and profit the poor may be disposed to place their little savings section iii we come now to that class of desires for which no neutral name is found—no name which does not present some accessory idea of praise or of blame but especially of blame the reason of which is easily discovered asceticism has sought to brand and criminalize the desires to which nature has confided the perpetuity of the species poetry has protested against these usurpations and has embellished the images of voluptousness and love its object is praiseworthy when good manners and decency are respected we may observe however that these inclinations have sufficient natural strength and do not require the excitements of exaggerated and seductive representations since this desire is satisfied in marriage not only without prejudice to society but in an advantageous manner the first object of the legislator in this respect should be to facilitate marriage that is to say to place no obstacle which is not absolutely necessary in its way with the same view he ought to authorize divorces under suitable restrictions in place of a marriage broken in point of fact and subsisting only in appearance divorce naturally leads to a real marriage separations permitted in a country where marriages are indissoluble have the inconvenience either of condemning the individuals to the privation of celibacy or leading them to form illicit connexions but if we would speak upon this delicate subject honestly and with a freedom more honest than an hypocritical reserve we shall acknowledge at once that there is an age at which man attains the developement of his powers before his mind is ripe for the conduct of business and the government of a family this is especially true with regard to the superior classes of society among the poor necessary labour diverts the desires from love and retards their developement a frugal nourishment and simple kind of life maintains for a longer period a calm among the feelings and the imagination besides the poor are unable to purchase the favours of the other sex except by the sacrifice of liberty independently of the youth who are not yet marriageable in a moral respect how many men are there who are unable to undertake the charge of a wife and family on the one hand domestic servants soldiers sailors living in a state of dependence and often having no fixed residence on the other hand men of a more elevated rank who expect a fortune or an establishment here is a very numerous class deprived of marriage and reduced to a forced celibacy the first method which presents itself for mitigating this evil would be the rendering legitimate contracts for a limited time this method has great inconveniences still concubinage really exists in all societies in which there is considerable disproportion in fortunes in prohibiting these arrangements they are not prevented they are only rendered criminal and degraded those who dare to acknowledge them proclaim their contempt for manners and laws those who conceal them are exposed to suffer from the moral sanction in proportion to their sensibility in the ordinary course of thinking the idea of virtue is associated with this contract when its duration is indefinite and the idea of vice when it is limited for a time legislators have followed this opinion prohibition against making the contract for a year—permission to make it for life—the same action criminal in the first place will be innocent in the other what can be said for this difference the duration of the engagement—can it change black into white but if marriage for a limited time is innocent     in itself it does not follow that it is so honourable for the woman who contracts it she can never obtain the same respect as a wife for life the first idea which presents itself with respect to her is if this woman were of equal value with others she would have obtained the same condition as others this precarious arrangement is a sign of inferiority either in her condition or in her merit what then would be the advantage resulting from this kind of contract the law which now forbids it would not be continually broken and despised it would also protect the female who lend herself to this arrangement from a humiliation which after having degraded her in her own eyes almost always leads her to the lowest degree of debauchery it would in fine prove the birth of the children and secure to them paternal care in germany marriages known under the name of lefthanded marriages were generally established the object was to conciliate domestic happiness with family pride the woman thus acquired some of the privileges of a wife but neither she nor her children took the name nor the rank of her husband in the code of frederick they were prohibited the king still reserving to himself the right to grant particular dispensations whilst an idea so contrary to received opinions is proposed it may be observed that it is not proposed as a good but as an amelioration of an evil which exists where manners are sufficiently simple where fortunes are sufficiently equal not to require this expedient it would be absurd to introduce it it is not proposed as a rule but as a remedy under a similar apology a more weighty disorder may be spoken of it is an evil which particularly exists in great towns which also arises from the inequality of fortunes and the concurrence of all the causes which increase celibacy this evil is prostitution there are some countries where the laws tolerate it there are others as in england where it is strictly forbidden but though forbidden it is as commonly and as publicly carried on as can be imagined because the government dares not to punish it and the public would not approve of this employment of authority prostitution prohibited as it is is not less extended than it there were no law but it is much more mischievous the infamy of prostitution is not solely the work of the laws there is always a degree of shame attached to this condition even when the political sanction remains neuter the condition of courtezans is a condition of dependence and servitude their resources are always precarious they are always on the borders of indigence and hunger their name connects them with those evils which afflict the imagination they are justly considered as the causes of those disorders of which they are at the same time the victims there is no need to mention the sentiments with which they are regarded by modest females the most virtuous pity them all agree in despising them no one seeks to defend or to uphold them it is therefore natural that they should be crushed by the weight of opinion they have themselves never been able to form a society which could counterbalance this public contempt when they shall wish to form it they will be unable if the interest of a common defence should unite them rivalry and want would separate them the person as well as the name of a prostitute is an object of hatred and disdain to all her fellows it is perhaps the only condition openly despised by the persons who publicly profess it selflove by the most striking inconsistency seeks to blind itself to its own misfortune it appears to forget what is is or to make an exception for itself by severely treating its companions kept mistresses very nearly partake the same infamy with open prostitutes the reason for it is simple they are not yet in that class but they seem always ready to fall into it however the longer the same person has lived with the same man the more she is removed from the degraded condition—the more she approaches to the condition of a modest woman the greater the duration of the connexion the more difficult it appears to be broken the greater the hope it presents of perpetuity what is the result of these observations it is that the remedy so far as a remedy can exist is in the evil itself the more this condition is naturally the object of contempt the less necessary is it to add any legal disgrace it carries with it its natural punishment—punishment which is already too heavy when every thing which should lead to commiseration in favour of this unfortunate class has been considered—the victims of social inequality and always so near to despair how few of these females have embraced this condition from choice and knowing the consequences how few would continue in it if they could quit it—if they could leave this circle of ignominy and misfortune—if they were not repulsed from every career which they may try to open for themselves how many have fallen into it from the error of a moment—from the inexperience of youth—from the corruption of their parents—by the crime of the seducer—from inexorable severity—directed against a first fault—almost all from neglect and misery if opinion be unjust and tyrannical ought the legislator to exasperate this injustice ought he to employ this instrument of tyranny besides what is the effect of these laws     it is to increase the corruption of which these unhappy women are accused—it is to precipitate them into intemperance and excess in the use of intoxicating liquors that they may find in them a momentary oblivion of their misery—it is to render them insensible to the restraint of shame by directing against their misfortune that opprobrium which ought to be reserved for real crimes—it is in fine to prevent the precautions which might soften the inconveniences of this disorder if it were tolerated all these evils which the laws lavish without care are a foolish price which the laws pay for an imaginary good which is not and can never be obtained the empressqueen of hungary undertook to extirpate this evil and laboured with a perseverance praiseworthy in its principles and deserving of a better cause what followed corruption extended itself in public and private life the conjugal bed was violated the seat of justice was corrupted adultery gained all that was lost by prostitution the magistrates made a trade of their connivance fraud prevarication oppression extortion spread themselves in the country and the evil which it was sought to destroy being obliged to hide itself only became more dangerous among the greeks this profession was tolerated sometimes even encouraged but it was not allowed to parents to traffic in the honour of their daughters among the romans in what are called the best times of their republic the laws were silent upon the subject the saying of cato to the young man whom he met on leaving a place of ill name is a proof of it cato was not a man to encourage the violation of the laws in the metropolis of the christian world this vocation is openly exercised this was without doubt one of the reasons for the excessive rigour of the protestants at venice the profession of a courtezan was publicly authorized under the republic in the capital of holland houses of this nature receive a licence from the magistrate retif de la bretonne published an ingenious work entitled pornographe in which he proposed to government to found an institution subject to regulations for the reception and government of prostitutes the toleration of this evil is useful in some respects in great towns its prohibition is useless it has even particular inconveniences the hospitals established in london for repentant girls are good institutions but those who regard prostitution with absolute rigour are not consistent with themselves when they approve of these charitable foundations if they reform some they encourage others the hospital at chelsea is it not an encouragement for soldiers and that at greenwich for sailors it would be desirable to institute annuities commencing at a certain age these annuities should be adapted to this sad condition in which the period of harvest is necessarily short but in which there are sometimes considerable profits the spirit of economy springs up with little encouragement and always goes on increasing a sum too small to offer any resource as actual capital may yield a considerable annuity at a distant period upon points of morality where there are contested questions it is well to consult the laws of different nations this is to the mind a species of travelling in the course of this exercise whilst the usages of other nations pass in review before us we become disengaged from local and national prejudices chapter vi problem iii to avoid furnishing encouragement to crimes to say that government ought not to reward crimes—that it ought not to weaken the moral sanction or the religious sanction in those cases in which they are useful is a maxim which appears too simple to require proof it is however often forgotten striking examples of this forgetfulness will be given but the more striking they are the less will it be necessary to develope them it will be more desirable to dwell upon those cases in which this maxim is violated in a less evident manner   unjust detention of property c if the law suffer a man who unjustly detains the property of another to make a profit by delaying the payment it becomes an accomplice in the wrong the cases in which the english law is defective in this respect are innumerable in many cases a debtor has only to refuse payment till he die in order to free himself from the principal of his debt in many others he may by his delays free himself from the interest in all he may retain the capital and obtain so to speak a forced loan at the ordinary rate of interest to put a stop to this source of iniquity it would be sufficient to establish— st that in matters of civil responsibility with regard to lands the death of one or other of the parties should make no alteration  d that interest should be payable from the commencement of the obligation  d that the obligation should commence not at the ascertaining the amount of the damage but at the time of the damage itself  th that the interest arising     from this obligation exceed the ordinary rate these methods are extremely simple how does it happen that they remain yet to be proposed those who thus inquire know little of the effect of custom indolence indifference to the public welfare and the bigotry of the law without reckoning on the effect of personal interest and party spirit   unlawful destruction when a man insures his goods against any calamity if the value for which he insure exceed the value of the effects insured he has in a certain sense an interest in producing the event insured against—to set fire to his house if he be insured against fire—to sink his vessel if he be insured against sea risks the law which authorizes these contracts may therefore be considered as furnishing a motive to the commission of these crimes does it follow that it ought to refuse them its sanction by no means but only that it ought to direct and suggest to the assurers the precautions most likely to prevent these abuses without being so restrictive as to hinder their operations the taking preliminary informations—requiring certificates of the real value of the goods insured—requiring in cases of accident the testimony of certain respectable persons as to the character and probity of the party who has been insured—submitting the effects insured to examination in every state of the cause when the assurer has any doubts c such are a part of the measures to be taken   treason if it be permitted to insure the vessels of enemies a state may be exposed to two dangers— st the commerce of an inimical nation which is one of the sources of its power is facilitated  d the assurer in order to guarantee himself against a loss may give secret intelligence to the enemy as to the departure of the armaments and cruisers of his own nation with respect to the first inconvenience it is only an evil in case the enemy could not insure his vessels elsewhere or that he could not employ his capital with the same profit in any other branch of trade with respect to the second inconvenience it is absolutely nothing unless the assurer be able to give to the enemy information that he could not obtain in any other manner for money and that the facility of giving this information was so great as to lead him to disregard the infamy and the risk of treason such is the state of things as to its inconveniences on the other hand its advantages for the nation assuring is certain in this species of traffic it has been found that the balance of profit in a given time is on the side of the assurers that is to say in taking all the losses and gains together he receives more in premiums than he pays in reimbursements it is then a lucrative branch of commerce and may be considered as a tax levied upon the enemy   peculation in making a bargain with architects and superintendents it is common to give them a percentage upon the amount of the expense this mode of payment which appears sufficiently natural opens a door for peculation—for peculation of the most destructive kind in which in order that the peculator may make a small profit it is necessary that his employer should suffer a large loss this danger is at its highest degree in public works in which no individual has a particular interest in preventing profusion and each may find his interest in conniving at it one of the means of remedying it is to fix a sum in accordance with an estimate made and to say to the superintendent—thus far you shall have so much per cent above this you shall have nothing if you reduce the expense below the estimate you shall have your profit as upon the whole sum   abuse of the confidence of the sovereign if a statesman who has the power of contributing to war or to peace possess an employment of which the emoluments are larger in time of war than in time of peace an interest is given to him to make use of his power in order to prolong or create a state of war if his emoluments increase in proportion to the expense an interest is given him to conduct such war with the greatest possible prodigality the inverse reason would be much better   offences of every kind when a man lays a wager upon the affirmative side regarding a future event he has an interest proportioned to the value of the wager in the happening of the event if the event be among the number of those prohibited by the laws he has an interest in committing an offence he is even stimulated by a double force one part of which possesses the nature of reward the other possesses the nature of punishment the reward what he will receive if the event happen the punishment what he will have to pay in the contrary case it is as if he were suborned by the promise of a sum of money on the one hand and that he had made an engagement under an explicit punishment on the other if then all wagers without distinction     were recognised as valid without restriction venality of every kind would receive the sanction of the laws and liberty would be given to all the world to enrol accomplices for every kind of crime on the other hand if all wagers without restriction were annulled the insurances so advantageous to commerce so helpful against a multitude of calamities would have no place for these insurances are only a species of wager the desirable medium seems to be this—in all cases when the wager may become the instrument of mischief without answering any useful object prohibit it absolutely in those cases in which as an insurance it may become a means of help admit it but leave a discretion to the judge to make the necessary exceptions when he finds that it has been made a cloak for subornation   reflective offences or offences against ones self when a lucrative place has been conferred upon a man the possession of which depends upon his submission to certain rules of conduct if these rules are such as to be hurtful to himself without producing any benefit to any other person the creation of such an office has the effect of a law diametrically opposed to the principle of utility—of a law which tends to augment the sum of pains and to diminish that of pleasures such institutions are monasteries in catholic countries such also are the remains of the monastic spirit in the english universities but it may be said since no one engages in such a condition without his own consent the evil is only imaginary this answer would be good if the obligation ceased so soon as the consent ceased the misfortune is that the consent is the work of a moment and the obligation is perpetual there is another case indeed in which a transitory consent is admitted as the ground of durable condition it is that of military enlistment but the utility of the rule or to speak more correctly its necessity is its justification the state could not exist without its army and the army could not exist if all who compose it were at liberty to leave it whenever they pleased chapter vii problem iv to augment the responsibility of individuals in proportion as they are more exposed to temptation to do wrong this rule principally regards the public servants the more they have to lose in respect of fortune or honours the more may be taken from them their salaries are a source of responsibility in case of malversation the loss of this salary is a punishment from which they cannot escape even when they can escape from all others this method is especially suitable in those employments which give the management of the public property if you cannot otherwise secure the probity of a cashier make the amount of his appointments a little exceed the interest of the greatest sum which is entrusted to him this excess of salary may be considered as a premium paid for an insurance against his dishonesty he has more to lose by becoming a rogue than by remaining an honest man birth honours family connexions religion may also become so many sources of responsibility—so many pledges for the good conduct of individuals there have been cases in which legislators would not trust bachelors they have regarded a wife and children as hostages given by the citizen to his country chapter viii problem v to diminish sensibility with regard to temptation the preceding chapter referred to precautions against the improbity of an individual the present chapter treats of the means of preserving the probity of the honest man by not exposing him to the overpowering influence of seductive motives we shall first speak of salaries money according to the manner in which it is employed may serve either as a poison or an antidote without regard to the happiness of individuals the interest of the public service requires that public officers should be raised above want in all employments which present the means of acquiring money in a prejudicial manner in russia the greatest abuses in all the departments of government have been found to arise from the insufficiency of salaries when men oppressed by want become avaricious extortioners and thieves the blame ought to be divided between them and the government which has spread the snare for their probity placed between the necessity of living and the impossibility of living honestly they are led to consider extortion as a lawful supplement tacitly authorized by those who employ them will the supply of what is physically nenecessary suffice to place them above want no if there be not a certain proportion between the dignity with which a man is invested and his means of sustaining it he is in a state of suffering and privation because be cannot comply with what is expected of him and he is compelled to remain upon the verge of the class with whom he is called to     associate in a word wants increase with honours and relative necessity changes with condition place a man in an elevated rank without giving him the means of maintaining it what will be the result his dignity will furnish a motive for evildoing and his power will furnish him with the means of evildoing charles ii when restricted by the economy of his parliament sold himself to louis xiv who offered to supply his profusion the hope of relieving the embarrassments in which he was plunged led him like an individual overwhelmed with debts to the employment of criminal resources this miserable economy cost the english two wars and a more disastrous peace it is true that it is difficult to discover what sum would have operated as an antiseptic with a prince thus corrupted but this example is sufficient to show that the civil list of the kings of england which appears exorbitant in the eyes of common calculators is in the eyes of a statesman a measure of general security besides from the intimate connexion which exists between wealth and power every thing which increases the splendour of dignity increases its power and royal pomp may in this respect be compared to those ornaments of architecture which serve at the same time to support and bind the building together this great rule of diminishing as much as possible sensibility to temptation has been singularly violated in the catholic church imposing celibacy upon the priests and confiding to them the most delicate functions—the examination of consciences and the direction of families—was placing them in a trying situation between the unhappiness of observing a useless law and the opprobrium of its violation when gregory vii directed in a council at rome that the married clergy or those who had concubines should not say mass he excited their cries of indignation they accused him of heresy saying according to the historian of the times if he persist we would rather renounce the priesthood than our wives he must seek for angels to govern the churches—histoire de france par labbe millot tom i regne de henri i in our days it has been proposed to allow the french priests to marry but there were no men found among them they were all angels chapter ix problem vi to strengthen the impression of punishments upon the imagination it is the real punishment which produces all the evil it is the apparent punishment which produces all the good it is proper to diminish the first and to augment the second as much as possible humanity consists in the appearance of cruelty speak to the eyes if you would move the heart this precept is as old as the age of horace and the experience which dictated it as old as the first man—every one has felt its force and endeavoured to profit by it the actor the rogue the orator the priest all know its prevailing power render therefore your punishments exemplary give to the ceremonies which accompany them a mournful pomp call to your assistance all the imitative arts and let the representation of these important operations be among the first objects which strike the eyes of childhood a scaffold painted black the livery of grief—the officers of justice dressed in crape—the executioner covered with a mask which would serve at once to augment the terror of his appearance and to shield him from illfounded indignation—emblems of his crime placed above the head of the criminal to the end that the witnesses of his sufferings may know for what crimes he undergoes them these might form a part of the principal decorations of these legal tragedies whilst all the actors in this terrible drama might move in solemn procession—serious and religious music preparing the hearts of the spectators for the important lesson they were about to receive the judges need not consider it beneath their dignity to preside over this public scene and its sombre dignity should be consecrated by the presence of the ministers of religion instruction should not be rejected when it is offered even by the most cruel enemy the vehemic council the inquisition the starchamber may all be consulted all their methods examined and compared a diamond is worth preserving though covered with mud if assassins employ pistols for the commission of murder is this a reason why i should not use them in selfdefence the emblematic dresses of the inquisition might be usefully employed in criminal justice an incendiary under his cloak painted with flames would present to all eyes the image of his crime and the indignation of the spectator would be fixed upon the idea of his crime a system of punishments accompanied with emblems appropriated as much as possible to each crime would possess an additional advantage it would furnish allusions for poetry for eloquence for dramatic authors for ordinary conversation the ideas derived from them would so to speak be reverberated   0 by a thousand objects and disseminated on all sides the catholic priests have known how to derive from this source the greatest assistance for augmenting the efficacy of their religious opinions i recollect having seen at gravelines a striking exhibition a priest showed to the people a picture in which was represented a miserable multitude in the midst of flames and one of them was making a sign that he wanted a drop of water by showing his burning tongue it was a day appointed for public prayers for drawing souls out of purgatory it is evident that such an exhibition would tend less to inspire a horror for crimes than a horror of the poverty which did not allow him to be redeemed the necessary consequence is that money for the purchase of masses must be obtained at any rate for where every thing is to be expiated by money misery alone is the greatest of all crimes the only one which has no resource the ancients have not been more happy than the moderns in the choice of punishments no design no intention no natural connexion between punishments and crimes can be discovered every thing is the work of caprice i shall not dwell upon a point which has for a long time been familiar to all who are capable of reflection the modes of punishment in england form a perfect contrast with every thing which inspires respect a capital execution has no solemnity the pillory is sometimes a scene of buffoonery sometimes a scene of popular cruelty—a game of chance in which the sufferer is exposed to the caprices of the multitude and the accidents of the day the severity of a whipping depends upon the money given to the executioner burning in the hand according as the criminal and the executioner can agree is performed either with a cold or a redhot iron and if it be with a hot iron it is only a slice of ham which is burnt to complete the farce the criminal screams whilst it is only the fat which smokes and burns and the knowing spectators only laugh at this parody of justice but it may be said that every question has two sides—that these real representations these terrible scenes of penal justice will spread dismay among the people and make dangerous impressions i do not believe it if they present to dishonest persons the idea of danger they offer only an idea of security to those who are honest the threat of terrible and eternal punishment for undefined and indefinite crimes working upon an active imagination may have sometimes produced madness but here no undefined threatenings are supposed on the contrary here is a manifest crime proved—a crime which no one need commit and consequently the dread of punishment can never rise to a dangerous height it would however always be desirable to guard against producing false and hateful ideas in the first edition of the code theresa the portrait of the empress was surrounded with medallions representing gibbets racks fetters and other instruments of punishment what a blunder to present the image of the sovereign surrounded by these hideous emblems this scandalous frontispiece was suppressed but the print representing all the instruments of torture was allowed to remain a sad picture which could not be considered without each one saying to himself such are the evils to which i am exposed although innocent but if an abridgment of the penal code were accompanied with prints representing the characteristic punishments set apart for each crime it would form an imposing commentary—a sensible and speaking image of the law each one might say that is what i shall suffer if i become guilty it is thus that in matters of legislation a slight difference sometimes separates what is good from what is bad chapter x problem vii to facilitate the discovery of offences committed in penal matters the judge must be acquainted with two things before he can exercise his office the fact of the offence and     the person of the offender these two things being known his knowledge is complete according to the difference of cases obscurity spreads itself over these two points in different proportions sometimes it is greatest upon the first sometimes upon the second we shall treat in the following articles of what relates to the fact of the offence and of the means by which its discovery may be facilitated art i— require written titledeeds it is only by writing that evidence can be rendered permanent and authentic verbal transactions at least when not of the simplest kind are subject to interminable disputes litera scripta manet mahomet himself has recommended his followers to observe this precaution it is almost the only passage of the koran which has a grain of common sense chapter of the cow art ii— cause the names of the witnesses to be attested upon the head of titledeeds it is one thing to require that there should be witnesses to the execution of a deed it is another point to require that their presence be notified attested enregistered at the head of the deed a third circumstance is to add to it those circumstances by which the witnesses if necessary may be easily found in the attestation of deeds it would be useful to observe the following precautions—   prefer a great number of witnesses to a small number this diminishes the danger of prevarication and increases the chance of finding them if necessary   prefer married to single persons heads of families to servants persons of public character to individuals less distinguished young men in the flower of their age to old and infirm persons persons who are known to those who are unknown   when a deed is composed of many sheets or pieces each piece ought to be signed by the witnesses if there be corrections or erasures a list of these should be made and attested the lines ought to be counted and the number in each page indicated   each witness should add to his christian and surname if it be required his quality his residence his age his condition whether single or married   the time and place of the execution of the deed should be minutely specified the time not only by the day the month the year but also by the hour the place by the district the parish even by the house and by the name of him who occupies it at the time this circumstance is an excellent preservative against forgery a man will fear to embark in such an enterprise when it is necessary to be acquainted with so many details before he affixes a supposititious date to a deed and if he do attempt it it will be more easily discovered   numbers ought to be written in words at length especially dates and sums except in matters of account in which case it is sufficient to state the total in words at length except also when the same date or the same sum frequently recurs in the same deed the reason of this precaution is that figures if they are not very carefully written are liable to be taken the one for the other and besides that they are easily altered and the slightest alteration may have considerable effects  00 is easily converted into  000   the forms to be observed in the execution of a deed ought to be printed upon the margin of the sheets of paper or parchment on which it is written ought these forms to be left to the discretion of individuals as a means of security required by prudence or ought they to be rendered obligatory some ought to be made obligatory others ought not as to those which ought to be made obligatory it will be proper to allow the judges latitude that they may distinguish the cases in which it was not possible to attend to them it may be that a deed has been executed in a place where the prescribed paper could not be obtained where a sufficient number of witnesses could not be found c the deed might be provisionally declared valid until it had been possible to attend to the forms required greater latitude ought to be allowed in wills than in deeds between living parties death waits neither for lawyers nor witnesses and men are accustomed to defer making them to a time when they have neither leisure nor time to correct and review on the other hand these sorts of deeds are those which require the most precaution because they are most subject to imposture in the case of a deed between living parties the party to whom it may be wished to attribute an engagement may chance to be living to contradict it in the case of a will this chance no longer exists it would require many details to point out the points to be established and the exceptions to be made i only observe that great latitude must be left that no formality can be found so simple that its omission ought to render a deed absolutely invalid when such instructions as these shall have been published by government even without being rendered necessary every body will seek to observe them because each one will seek in a deed honestly executed to obtain for himself all possible security the omission of these forms therefore would form a strong ground of suspicion of fraud unless such omission could clearly be attributed to the ignorance of the parties or to circumstances which rendered such omission unavoidable     art iii— institute registers for the preservation of titles why ought deeds to be registered what deeds ought to be registered ought the registers to be secret or public ought registration to be optional or ought its omission to be liable to punishment registers would be useful as guards— st against the fabrication of forged deeds  d against forgery by falsification  d against accidents—the loss or destruction of the original  th against double alienation of the same property to different persons for the first and last of these objects a simple memorial would be sufficient for the second an exact copy would be required for the third an extract would be sufficient but a copy would be better against forgery by fabrication registration would only be useful if it were obligatory nullity in cases of omission with latitude for accidental cases the advantage which would result is that after the period for registration was expired the fabrication of a deed which according to its apparent date ought to be registered would fail of itself the period in which a fraud of this kind could be committed with probability of success would be limited to a short space and that so near a time to that of the supposed deed that the proofs of fraud could scarcely be wanting it would also be necessary that registration should be obligatory under pain of nullity if it be designed to prevent double alienations such as mortgages or marriage contracts without this obligatory clause registration would scarcely take place because neither party would have any interest in it he who alienates has even a contrary interest an honest man may dislike to have it known that he has sold or mortgaged his property a rogue would desire the power of receiving its value twice over wills are the kind of deeds most liable to be fabricated the most certain protection against a fraud of this nature is to require their registration under pain of nullity during the life of the testator it may be objected that this would make him dependent on the mercy of those who surround him in his last moments since he would no longer be able to reward or punish them but this inconvenience might be obviated by allowing a testator to dispose of a tenth of his property by a codicil what deeds ought to be registered all those in which a third person is interested and whose importance is sufficiently great to justify this precaution of what deeds ought the registration to be secret and of what public deeds between living persons in which third persons are interested—mortgages marriagecontracts ought to be public wills during the life of the testator ought to be inviolably secret promissory deeds apprentice indentures marriagecontracts which do not bind landed property might be kept secret reserving the right of communicating them to persons who could present a special title to examine them the office ought then to be divided into secret and public departments free or obligatory free registrations would be frequent if the charge were moderate prudence directs the preservation of copies against accidents but where could copies be better preserved than in a depot of this kind the necessity of registering deeds by which territorial property is charged by way of mortgage would be a species of restraint upon prodigality a man could hardly without some degree of shame borrow upon his possessions to spend in pleasure this consideration which ought to operate in favour of this measure has been urged as an objection against it and has prevented its establishment the jurisprudence of many countries has adopted more or less of this mode of registration that of france appears to have hit the happy medium in england the law varies in middlesex and the county of york registeroffices were established in the reign of queen anne whose principal object has been to prevent double alienations and the good effects have been such that the value of land is higher in these two counties than elsewhere ireland enjoys this benefit but registration is left to the free choice of individuals it has been established in scotland wills ought there to be registered before the death in the county of middlesex registration is only obligatory after the death of the testator art iv— method of preventing forged deeds there is one expedient which might have place as a species of registration a particular kind of paper or parchment should be required for the deed in question those who sold it by retail should be prohibited from selling it without indorsing the day and year of the sale and the names of the seller and buyer the distribution of this kind of paper might be limited to a certain number of persons of whom a list should be kept their books being required to be correct registers should after their death be deposited in an office this precaution would hinder the fabrication of all kinds of deeds pretending to a distant date it would be a further restraint if the paper ought to be of the same date with the deed itself the date of the paper might be marked     in the paper itself in the same manner as the makers name in this case no forged deed could be made without the concurrence of a papermaker art v— institute registers for events which serve to establish titles much need not be said upon the evident necessity of proving births and burials prohibition to inter the dead without the previous inspection of some officer of police is a general precaution against assassination it is singular that in england marriages instead of being by writing were for a long time left to the simple notoriety of a transitory ceremony the only reason which can be given for it is the simplicity of this contract which is the same for all except in particular arrangements relative to fortunes happily under the reign of william iii these events which serve as the foundation of so many titles presented themselves as suitable objects for taxation they were required to be registered the tax has been suppressed but the advantage remains even at the present time the security given to the rights which depend upon these events is neither so certain nor so universal as it ought to be there exists only one copy the register of each parish ought to be transcribed in a more general office in the marriageact under george ii the advantage of this regulation is refused to quakers and jews either from intolerance or inadvertency art vi— put the people on their guard against different offences   against poisoning give instructions with regard to the different poisonous substances the methods of detecting them and their antidotes if such instructions were indiscriminately spread among the multitude they might do more hurt than good this is one of those cases in which knowledge is more dangerous than useful the methods of employing poison are more certain than the means of cure the suitable medium lies in limiting the circulation of these instructions to the class of persons who can make a good use of them whilst their situation their character and their education would be guarantees against their abuse such are the parochial clergy and medical practitioners with this view the instructions might be in latin which these parties are reputed to understand but as to the knowledge of those poisons which present themselves without being sought and which ignorance may innocently administer this ought to be rendered as familiar as possible there must be a strange deprivation in the character of a nation if hemlock which is so easily confounded with parsley and verdigris which so speedily collects in copper vessels when the tinning is worn off were not more often administered by mistake than by design in this case there is more to be hoped for than feared from the communication of knowledge how dangerous soever it may be   against false weights and measures give instructions as to false weights false measures false standards of quality and the methods of deception which may be used when just weights and measures are employed to this head would be referred scales with unequal arms measures with double bottoms c knowledge on these subjects cannot be too widely extended every shop should have such instructions openly exhibited as a proof that there is no wish to deceive   against frauds with respect to money give instructions showing how good may be distinguished from bad money if a particular kind of false coin appear government ought to give notice of this circumstance in a particular manner at vienna the mint does not fail to notify the kinds of counterfeits it discovers but the coinage is upon so good a footing that attempts of this kind are rare   against cheating at play give instructions with regard to false dice as to methods of cheating in dealing cards by making signs to associates by having accomplices among the spectators c these instructions might be suspended in all places of public resort and presented in such a manner as to put youth upon its guard and to exhibit vice as both ridiculous and hateful it would be proper also to offer a reward to those who detect the artifices of sharpers in proportion as they invent new schemes   against the impostures of beggars some though in perfect health counterfeit sickness others cause a slight wound to assume the most disgusting appearances others relate false histories of shipwrecks and fires others borrow or steal children that they may employ them as instruments of their trade it would be proper to accompany the instructions respecting these artifices with an advertisement for fear that the knowledge of so many impostures should harden the heart and render it indifferent to real misery in a country under a well regulated police an individual who presents himself under so unfortunate an aspect ought neither to be neglected nor left to himself the duty of the first person who meets him should be to consign him to the hands of public charity instructions of this kind would form homilies     for the people more amusing than controversial discourses   against theft cheating and other means of obtaining money under false pretences give instructions which should develope all the methods employed by thieves and cheats there are many books upon this subject of which the materials have been furnished by penitent malefactors in the hopes of deserving pardon these compilations are generally very bad but useful extracts might be taken from them one of the best is the discoveries and revelations of poulter otherwise baxter which passed through sixteen editions in the space of twentysix years this shows how wide a circulation an authentic book of this kind published and recommended by government would have the tone which might be given to these works would make them excellent lessons in morality as well as books of amusement   against religious impostures give instructions with regard to crimes committed by means of superstitions relating to the malice of spiritual agents these crimes are too numerous but they are a light matter in comparison with the legal persecutions which have taken their rise in the same errors there is scarcely a christian nation which has not to reproach itself with bloody tragedies occasioned by a belief in sorcery the histories of the first class would furnish an instructive subject for homilies which might be read in the churches but there is no need to give a sad publicity to the second the suffrages of so many respectable and upright judges who have been the miserable dupes of this superstition would rather serve to confirm the populace in their error than to cure them the english statutes were the first which had the honour of expressly rejecting from the penal code the pretended crime of sorcery in the code theresa though compiled in      it occupies a considerable space art vii— publish the price of merchandise in opposition to mercantile extortion if the exaction of an exorbitant price cannot properly be treated as an offence and subjected to punishment it may at least be looked upon as an evil which it would be advantageous to suppress if it could be done without causing greater evils direct punishments being inadmissible indirect methods must be employed happily this is a species of offence of which the evil is diminished rather than increased by the number of offenders what should the law do increase their number as much as possible is an article sold too dear is the profit gained by it exorbitant spread this information the dealers in it will assemble from all quarters and by the effect of their competition alone will lower the price usury may be ranked under the head of mercantile extortion to lend money is to sell present money for future money the time of payment may be either determinate or indeterminate dependent or not upon certain events the amount returnable all at once or by instalments c prohibit usury by rendering the transaction secret you increase the price art viii— publish an account of official rights almost everywhere certain rights are annexed to the services of government offices these rights form part of the pay of the persons employed as an artisan sells his manufacture a public officer sells his labour as dear as possible competition the facility of going to another market retains this disposition within due bounds as respects ordinary labour but by the establishment of an office all competition is taken away the right to sell this particular kind of service becomes a monopoly in the hands of the person employed leave the price to the discretion of the seller and there will be no other limits than those prescribed by the wants of the buyer the rights of officers ought therefore to be exactly determined by law otherwise the extortion which may take place ought to be imputed to the negligence of the legislator rather than the rapacity of the person employed art ix— publish all accounts in which the nation is interested when accounts are rendered in a limited time before a limited number of auditors and these auditors perhaps chosen or influenced by the accountant himself and no one is afterwards called upon to controul them the greatest errors may be passed without being perceived or without being noticed but when accounts are published there can be no want of witnesses nor commentators nor judges each item is examined was this article necessary did it arise from want or was it suggested for the purpose of creating expense is not the public more dearly served than individuals has not a preference been given to a contractor at the public expense     has not a secret advantage been given to a favourite has nothing been granted to him upon false pretences have no manœuvres been practised to prevent competition is there nothing concealed in the accounts there are a hundred questions of the same kind upon which it is impossible to secure complete explanations if accounts are not rendered public in a particular committee some may want integrity others knowledge a mind slow in its operations will pass over what it does not understand for fear of discovering its inaptitude a lively spirit will not trouble itself with details each will leave to others the fatigue of examination but every thing which is wanting in a small body will be found in the assembled public in this heterogeneous and discordant mass the worst principles will lead to the desired end as well as the best envy hatred malice will assume the mask of public spirit and these passions because they are more active and persevering will scrutinize all the parties better and make even a more scrupulous examination hence those who have no other restraint than the desire of human applause will be retained in the discharge of their duty by the pride of integrity and the fear of shame in seeking for exceptions i have only found two the first regards the expenses of this publication the other regards the nature of those services which ought to remain secret it might be useless to publish the accounts of a small parish because the books are accessible to all who are interested in their examination and the publication of the sums destined to secret service could only be thought of under the pain of losing all the information you might otherwise obtain respecting the designs of your enemies art x— establish standards of quantity weights and measures weights indicate the quantity of matter measures the quantity of space their utility consists—first in satisfying each individual as to the quantity of any thing which he wants secondly in terminating disputes thirdly in preventing frauds to establish uniformity in the same state has been the object of many sovereigns to find a common and universal measure for all people has been the object of research with many philosophers and latterly of the french government—a service truly honourable since there is hardly any thing more rare and noble than to see a government labouring upon one of the essential bases of union among mankind uniformity of weights and measures under the same government and among a people who in other respects have the same language is a point upon which it would seem that there is no need of much reasoning to show its utility a measure of which an individual does not know the contents is useless if the measures of two towns are not the same either in name or quantity the trade between the individuals cannot but be exposed to great mistakes or great difficulties these two places in this respect are strangers one to another if the nominal price of the goods measured be the same and the measures are different the real price is different continual attention is requisite and distrust mingles with the course of affairs errors glide into honest transactions and fraud hides itself under deceptive denominations for the introduction of uniformity there are two methods—the first to make standards which should have public authority to send them into every district and to forbid the use of every other the second to make standards and leave to general convenience the case of their adoption the first method has been employed in england the second was practised with success by the archduke leopold in tuscany when a public standard has been provided a punishment may be imposed upon those who make weights and measures not in conformity to the standards and then all bargains which have not been made according to these standards might be declared null and void but this last measure would hardly be necessary the two former would be sufficient in different nations the want of uniformity in this respect cannot produce so many mistakes—the difference of language alone putting every one upon their guard much embarrassment however results from it to commerce and fraud favoured by mystery may often avail itself of the ignorance of purchasers an inconvenience of less extent but which is not less important is felt in medicine if the weights are not exactly the same especially with regard to substances of which small quantities are important the pharmacopœia of one country can with difficulty be employed in another and may lead to fatal errors it is also a considerable obstacle to the free communication of the sciences and the same inconvenience is found in relation to those arts in which success depends upon the most delicate proportions art xi— establish standards of quality it would require many details to state all that government would have to do in order to establish the most suitable criteria of the quality and value of a multitude of objects which are susceptible of different proofs the touchstone is an imperfect proof of the quality and value of metallic compositions mingled with gold and silver the hydrometer is an unfailing proof in so far as identity of quality     results from the identity of specific gravity the adulterations most important to be known are those which are hurtful to health such as the mixture of chalk and burnt bones with flour in the making of bread the use of lead in taking off the acidity of wine or of arsenic in refining it chemistry presents the means of discovering all these adulterations but knowledge is required for their application the intervention of government in this regard may be limited to three points— st the encouragement of the discovery of the means of proof in those cases in which they are still wanting  d the dissemination of this knowledge among the people  d the prescription of their use by officers appointed for the purpose art xii— institute stamps or marks to attest the quantity or quality of articles which ought to be made according to a certain standard such marks are declarations or certificates in an abridged form there are five points to be considered in these documents  st their end  d the person whose attestation they bear  d the extent and the details of the information they contain  th the visibility the intelligibility of the mark  th its permanence its indestructibility the utility of authentic attestations is not doubtful they are successfully employed for the following objects—   to secure the rights of property it may be left to the prudence of individuals to use this precaution in what concerns them but with respect to public property and objects in deposit the employment of such marks ought to be regulated by law it is thus that in england stores for the use of the royal navy bear a particular mark which it is unlawful to employ in the merchant service in the royal arsenals an arrow is marked upon the timber used in building a white thread runs through the cordage which private persons are forbidden to use   to secure the quality or quantity of commercial articles for the benefit of purchasers thus by statute law in england marks are placed upon many articles upon blocks of wood exposed to sale upon leather bread pewter plate money woollen goods stockings c   to secure the payment of taxes if the article liable to the tax has not the mark in question it is a proof that the tax has not been paid the examples are numberless   to secure obedience to the laws which prohibit importation chapter xi problem viii to prevent offences by giving to many persons an interest in preventing them i am about to cite an example which might have been referred to the preceding head as well as to this for it has prevented the offence—it may be by increasing the difficulty of hiding it—it may be by giving to more persons an immediate interest in preventing it the carriage of post letters in england had always wanted diligence and exactness the couriers would stop for their pleasure or their profit the innkeepers would not urge them forward all these circumstances were so many little offences or violations of the established rules what ought the legislature to do to remedy them superintendence was fatiguing punishment was gradually relaxed informations always regarded as odious or embarrassing became rare and the abuse suspended for a moment soon returned to its ordinary course a very simple mode was hit upon which required neither law nor punishment nor information but which was better than all this mode consisted in combining two establishments which had till that time been distinct the carriage of letters and the conveyance of passengers the success was complete the celerity of the post has been doubled and travellers have been better served this deserves the trouble of an analysis the travellers who accompany the postoffice servants become so many inspectors of their conduct they cannot escape from their observation at the same time that they are excited by their praises and by the reward which they expect from them they cannot be ignorant that if they lose their time these travellers have a natural interest in complaining and that they may become informers without being paid for the service or fearing the odium attached to the character such are the advantages of this little combination evidence secured respecting the slightest faults—the motive of reward substituted for that of punishment—informations and examinations spared—occasions for punishment rendered extremely rare and the two services rendered by their union more commodious more prompt and more economical this happy idea of mr palmer is a study in legislation it is well to reflect on what he has successfully done in this respect that we may learn to overcome other difficulties in seeking to develope the cause of this success we shall rise from particulars to general principles     chapter xii problem ix to facilitate the recognition and the finding of individuals the greater number of offences would not be committed if the delinquents did not hope to remain unknown every thing which increases the facility of recognising and finding individuals adds to the general security this is one reason why less is to be feared from those who have a fixed habitation property or a family the danger arises from those who from their indigence or their independence of all ties can easily conceal their movements from the eye of justice tables of population in which are inscribed the dwellingplace the age the sex the profession the marriage or celibacy of individuals are the first materials of a good police it is proper that the magistrate should be able to demand an account from every suspected person as to his means of living and consign those to a place of security who have neither an independent revenue nor other means of support there are two things to be observed with regard to this object that the police ought not to be so minute or vexatious as to expose the subjects to find themselves in fault or vexed by numerous and difficult regulations precautions which are necessary at certain periods of danger and trouble ought not to be continued in a period of quietness as the regimen suited to disease ought not to be followed in a state of health the second observation is that care should be taken not to shock the national spirit one nation would not bear what is borne by another in the capital of japan every one is obliged to have his name upon his dress this measure might appear useful indifferent or tyrannical according to the current of public prejudices characteristic dresses have a relation to this end those which distinguish the different sexes are a means of police as gentle as salutary those which serve to distinguish the army the navy the clergy have more than one object but the principal one is subordination in the english universities the pupils wear a particular dress which restrains them only when they wish to go beyond the prescribed bounds in charity schools the scholars wear not only a uniform dress but even a numbered plate it is to be regretted that the proper names of individuals are upon so irregular a footing those distinctions invented in the infancy of society to provide for the wants of a hamlet only imperfectly accomplish their object in a great nation there are many inconveniences attached to this nominal confusion the greatest of all is that the indication arising from a name is vague suspicion is divided among a multitude of persons and the danger to which innocence is exposed becomes the security of crime in providing a new nomenclature it ought to be so arranged that in a whole nation every individual should have a proper name which should belong to him alone at the present time the embarrassment which would be produced by the change would perhaps surpass its advantages but it might be useful to prevent this disorder in a new state there is a common custom among english sailors of printing their family and christian names upon their wrists in wellformed and indelible characters they do it that their bodies may be known in case of shipwreck if it were possible that this practice should become universal it would be a new spring for morality a new source of power for the laws an almost infallible precaution against a multitude of offences especially against every kind of fraud in which confidence is requisite for success who are you with whom i have to deal the answer to this important question would no longer be liable to evasion this means by its own energy would become favourable to personal liberty by permitting relaxations in the rigour of proceedings imprisonment having for its only object the detention of individuals might become rare when they were held as it were by an invisible chain there are however plausible objections to such a practice in the course of the french revolution many persons owed their safety to a disguise which such a mark would have rendered unavailing public opinion in its present state opposes an insurmountable obstacle to such an institution but opinion might be changed by patiently guiding it with skill and by beginning with great examples if it were the custom to imprint the titles of the nobility upon their foreheads these marks would become associated with the ideas of honour and power in the islands of the south sea the women submit to a painful operation in tracing upon their skin certain figures to which they annex the idea of beauty the impression is made by puncturing the skin and rubbing in coloured powders     chapter xiii problem x to increase the difficulty of escape for delinquents these means depend much upon geographical dispositions—upon natural and artificial barriers in russia the thinness of the population the asperity of the climate the difficulty of the communications give to justice a force which could hardly have been believed to exist in so vast a country at petersburgh and at riga a passport cannot be obtained till the intention to depart has been several times announced in the gazette this precaution taken against fraudulent debtors has greatly increased commercial confidence every thing which increases the communication of intelligence with rapidity may be referred to this head descriptions are very imperfect and doubtful instruments of recognition profiles which may be so easily multiplied at a low price would be much better they might be employed either for prisoners whose escape is feared or for soldiers whose desertion is apprehended or for any suspected person who may have been denounced to the magistrate and whom it is desirable to secure without carrying restraint so far with regard to him as imprisonment chapter xiv problem xi to diminish uncertainty with regard to procedure and punishment it is not my intention here to enter upon the vast subject of procedure this will be the object not of a chapter but of a separate work the present chapter will be confined to two or three general observations has a crime been committed it is the interest of society that the magistrate charged with its punishment should be informed of it and informed in such manner as to authorize the infliction of the punishment incurred is it alleged that a crime has been committed it is the interest of society that the truth or falsehood of this allegation should be made evident hence the rules of evidence and the forms of procedure ought to be such as on one side to admit all true information and on the other to exclude all false information that is to say all that offers more chances of deceiving than enlightening nature has placed before our eyes a model of procedure when we regard what passes in the domestic tribunal—when we examine the conduct of the father of a family among his children and servants of whom he is the head—we there discover the original features of justice which we can hardly recognise after they have been disfigured by men incapable of discerning or interested in disguising the truth a good judge is only the father of a family acting upon a larger scale the methods which are good for the father of a family in his search after truth are equally good for the judge this is the first model of procedure it has been departed from but it ought never to have been discarded it is true that a confidence may be accorded to the father of a family which cannot be accorded to a judge because the last has not the same motives of affection to guide him and may perhaps be led astray by a personal interest but this only proves that it is necessary to guard against the partiality or corruption of the judge by precautions which are not requisite in the domestic tribunal this does not prove that the forms of procedure and rules of evidence ought to be different english jurisprudence admits the following maxims—   that no one shall be witness in his own cause   that no one shall accuse himself   that the testimony of a person interested in the cause is not admissible   that hearsay evidence is not admissible   that no one shall be tried twice for the same offence it is not my intention here to discuss these rules of evidence in treating of procedure in general it will be proper to examine if english jurisprudence superior in so many respects to that of all other nations owes that superiority to these maxims or whether they are not the principal cause of that weakness in the powers of justice from which arises the feebleness of the police in england and the frequency of crimes i shall only observe that all precautions which are not absolutely necessary for the protection of innocence offer a dangerous protection to crime i know no maxim in procedure more dangerous than that which places justice in opposition to itself—which establishes a kind of incompatibility among its duties when it is said for example that it is better to allow one hundred guilty persons to escape than to condemn one that is innocent—this supposes a dilemma which does not exist the security of the innocent may be complete without favouring the impunity of crime it can only be complete upon that condition for every offender who escapes menaces the public safety and to allow of this escape is not to protect innocence but to expose it to be the victim of a new crime to absolve a criminal is to commit by his hands the crimes of which he becomes the author     the difficulty of prosecuting crimes is one cause of their impunity and of weakness on the part of justice when the law is clear—when the judge is appealed to immediately after the commission of the supposed crime the function of accuser is almost confounded with that of witness when the offence is committed under the eyes of the judge only two persons are necessary so to speak in the drama—the judge and the offender it is distance which detaches the function of witness from that of judge but it may happen that all the witnesses to a fact cannot be collected together or that the discovery of the offence may not be made till long after its commission or that the accused has to allege in his defence facts which can only be verified in the place where they are said to have happened all this may require delay this delay may give rise to new incidents which may require further delay the procedure of justice becomes complicated and in order to follow all this chain of operations without confusion and without neglect it becomes requisite to place over these judicial proceedings a person who shall have to conduct them hence arises another function that of accuser the accuser may be either one of the witnesses or a person interested in the affair or an officer expressly appointed for this object judicial functions have often been so divided that the judge who receives the evidence whilst it is recent has no right to decide upon it but must send the affair to another judge who will only have leisure to attend to it when the proofs are half effaced there are beforehand established in most states many useless formalities and it has been necessary to create officers to follow up these formalities the system of procedure is thus rendered so complicated that it becomes an abstruse science he who would prosecute an offence is obliged to put it into the hands of an attorney and the attorney himself cannot proceed without having another man of law of a superior class to direct him by his counsels and to speak for him to these disadvantages may be added two others—   legislators without thinking that they have placed themselves in opposition to themselves have often closed the approaches of the tribunals to those who have most need of them by subjecting procedure to the most objectionable taxes   there is a public dislike attached to all those who employ themselves as public accusers in the execution of the laws this prejudice is foolish and pernicious yet legislators have often had the weakness to encourage it without having made the slightest effort to overcome it what is the effect of all this accumulation of delay and discouragement it is that the laws are not executed when a man can at once address the judge and tell him what he has seen the expense of this proceeding is a trifle in proportion as he is obliged to pass by a great number of intermediates his expenses increase when to this is added the loss of time the disgust the uncertainty of success one is surprised that men are still found sufficiently resolute to engage in such a pursuit there are but few and there would be still fewer if those who adventure in this lottery knew as well as the lawyers what it would cost and the number of adverse chances these difficulties would vanish on the simple institution of a public accuser clothed with the character of a magistrate having the conduct of the prosecution and chargeable with the expenses the informers who would require to be paid need have only a small salary and a hundred gratuitous informers would present themselves for one who required to be paid each law put into execution would exhibit its good or bad effects the good grain would be preserved and the chaff thrown into the fire informers animated by public spirit rejecting all pecuniary recompense would be listened to with the respect and confidence which is their due delinquents would no longer be able to withdraw themselves from the punishment they had incurred by treating with those who have undertaken the prosecution either by engaging them to desist or by turning them to their own favour it is true that in england in every important case the prosecutor is forbidden to make a compromise with the accused without the permission of the judge but if this prohibition were universal what effect would it have in those cases in which it is the interest of both parties to evade it chapter xv problem xii to prohibit accessory offences in order to prevent their principals those acts which have a connexion with a pernicious event as its cause may be considered   0 as accessory offences in relation to the principal offence the principal offence being well determined there may be distinguished as many accessory offences as there are acts which may serve either to prepare or to manifest a projected crime now the more these preparatory acts are distinguished for the purpose of prohibiting them the greater the chance of preventing the execution of the principal crime itself if the criminal be not stopped at the first step of his career he may be at the second or the third it is thus that a prudent legislator like a skilful general reconnoitres all the external posts of the enemy with the intention of stopping his enterprises he places in all the defiles in all the windings of his route a chain of works diversified according to circumstances but connected among themselves in such manner that the enemy finds in each new dangers and new obstacles if we regard legislators in their practice we shall not find one who has worked systematically upon this plan and not one who has not followed it to a certain point offences against the gamelaws have been divided into many accessory offences according to the nature of the snare according to the kind of nets or other instruments necessary for taking the game c smuggling also has been attacked by prohibiting many preparatory acts frauds with regard to different kinds of coin have been combated in the same manner the following are other examples of what may be done under the head of police— against homicide and other corporal injuries prohibition of purely offensive arms which are easily hidden in holland it is said that a kind of instrument shaped like a needle is made which is thrown from a tube which occasions a mortal wound the manufacture the sale the possession of these instruments might be prohibited as accessaries to murder pocketpistols which highway robbers have made use of in england ought they to be prohibited the utility of such a prohibition is problematical of all methods of robbery that which is carried on by means of firearms is the least dangerous to the person attacked in such a case the simple threat is commonly sufficient for the accomplishment of the object the robber who should pull his trigger after the party had delivered his money would be guilty not only of useless cruelty he would disarm himself instead of which by reserving his fire he preserves his means of defence he who employs a club or a sword has not the same motive for refraining to strike the first blow becomes even a reason for a second that he may put his victim out of a condition to pursue him prohibition of the sale of poisons requires that a catalogue be made of poisonous substances the sale of them cannot however be altogether forbidden† it can only be regulated and subjected to precautions requiring that the seller should know the purchaser that he should have witnesses of the sale that he should register the sale in a separate book c these regulations to be complete would require considerable details would the advantages compensate for the trouble this will depend upon the manners and habits of the people if poisoning be a frequent crime it will be necessary to take indirect precautions against it they would have been proper in ancient rome accessory offences may be distinguished into four classes—the first class implies an intention formed to complete the principal offence offences of this class may be comprised under the general name of attempts or preparations‡ the second class does not suppose that the intention to commit the crime is actually formed but that the individual is placed in a situation in which he will form the design for the future gaming prodigality idleness when joined with indigence are offences of this class cruelty towards animals is the road to cruelty towards men c the third implies no criminality either actual intentional or probable but only possible from accident these kinds of offences are created when police regulations are made which have for their object the prevention of calamities—when for example the sale of certain poisons of gunpowder c is forbidden the violation of these regulations separate from all criminal intention is an offence of this third class the fourth class is composed of presumed offences that is to say of acts that are considered as proofs of an offence evidentiary offences acts hurtful or not hurtful in themselves furnishing presumptions of an offence having been committed by an english statute     a certain conduct on the part of a woman was directed to be punished as murder because it was supposed that such conduct was a sure proof of infanticide by another statute it is made a capital crime for bands of men to go about armed in disguise because this is considered a proof of a design to commit murder in protecting smugglers from justice by another statute the possession of stolen goods without being able to give a satisfactory account of the manner in which they were acquired is made an offence this circumstance being considered a proof of complicity again by another statute the obliteration of the marks upon shipwrecked effects is made an offence this being considered a proof of an intention to steal them these offences founded upon these presumptions suppose two things—  mistrust in the system of procedure   mistrust in the wisdom of the judge in england the legislature has thought that juries being too much disposed to pardon would not see in these circumstances a certain proof of a crime and it has made the act itself which furnishes the presumption a separate offence—an offence independent of every other in a country in which the tribunals should possess the entire confidence of the legislature these acts would be placed under the head to which they belong and would be considered as presumptions the judge being allowed to draw from them his conclusions with respect to accessory offences it is essential that the legislator should possess three rules by way of memento—   for each principal offence which he creates he ought to extend his prohibition to the preparatory acts to simple attempts generally under the sanction of a less punishment than is appointed for the principal offence this is the general rule and the exceptions ought to be founded upon particular reasons   he ought then under the description of the principal offence to place all the accessory preliminary and concomitant offences which are susceptible of a specific and precise description   in the description of accessory offences he should take care not to impose too much restraint—not to trespass upon the liberty of individuals so as to expose innocence to danger by his precipitate conclusions the description of an offence of this kind is almost always dangerous if it do not include a clause allowing the judge to estimate the degree of presumption which ought to be drawn from it in this case to create an accessory offence is almost the same thing as suggesting the fact in question to the judge by way of instruction under the character of an indicative circumstance and not allowing him to draw any conclusion from it if he see any special reason for regarding the indication as inconclusive if the punishment for an attempt or preliminary offence be equal to that of the crime when completed without making allowance for the possibility of repentance or prudential desisting the offender seeing himself exposed to the same punishment for the simple attempt will see at the same time that he is at liberty to complete it without incurring any more danger chapter xvi of the cultivation of benevolence the principle of benevolence is in itself distinct from the love of reputation each of these may act without the other the first may be a feeling of instinct a gift of nature but it is in great measure the produce of cultivation the fruit of education for where will be found the greater measure of benevolence—among the english or among the iroquois—in the infancy of society or at its maturity if the feeling of benevolence be susceptible of augmentation which cannot be doubted it must be by the assistance of that other principle of the human heart the love or reputation when a moralist paints benevolence under the most amiable characters and selfishness and hardness of heart in the most hateful colours what does he do he seeks to unite to the purely social principle of benevolence the demipersonal and demisocial principle of the love of reputation he seeks to combine them and give them the same direction—to arm the one by the other if these efforts are successful which of the two principles deserves the praise neither the one nor the other exclusively but their reciprocal concurrence—the love of benevolence as the immediate cause the love of reputation as the remote cause a man who yields with pleasure to the soft accents of the social principle neither knows nor desires to know that it is a less noble principle which has given them their first tone there is a disdainful delicacy in the better element of our nature which wishes to owe its origin only to itself and blushes at all foreign association   to increase the force of the feelings of benevolence   to regulate their application according to the principle of utility such ought to be the two objects of the legislator   would he inspire the citizens with humanity he should set them the first example he should show not only the greatest respect for human life but for all circumstances influencing sensibility sanguinary laws have a tendency to render men cruel either from fear from imitation or from revenge laws     dictated by a spirit of gentleness humanize a nation and the spirit of the government will be found in its families the legislator ought to interdict every thing which may serve to led to cruelty the barbarous spectacles of gladiators introduced at rome during the latter times of the republic without doubt contributed to give the romans that ferocity which they displayed in their civil wars a people accustomed to despise human life in their games could not be expected to respect it amid the fury of their passions it is proper for the same reason to forbid every kind of cruelty exercised towards animals whether by way of amusement or to gratify gluttony cockfights bullbaiting hunting hares and foxes fishing and other amusements of the same kind necessarily suppose either the absence of reflection or a fund of inhumanity since they produce the most acute sufferings to sensible beings and the most painful and lingering death of which we can form any idea it ought to be lawful to kill animals but not to torment them death by artificial means may be made less painful than natural death the methods of accomplishing this deserve to be studied and made an object of police why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being the time will come when humanity will extend its mantle over every thing which breathes we have begun by attending to the condition of slaves we shall finish by softening that of all the animals which assist our labours or supply our wants i know not if the chinese legislators in instituting their minute ceremonial designed to cultivate benevolence or only to maintain peace and subordination politeness in china is a sort of worship—a ritual which is the great object of education and the principal science the exterior movements of this great people always regulated always prescribed by etiquette are almost as uniform as those of a regiment which repeats its exercise this pantomine of benevolence may be as destitute of reality as a devotion charged with trifling practices may be separated from morality so much restraint seems ill to accord with the movements of the human heart and these exhibitions at command do not confer any obligation because they possess no merit there exist some principles of antipathy which are sometimes interwoven with the political constitutions of states which it is difficult to extirpate such are religious enmities which excite their partisans to hate and persecute each other hereditary revenges between powerful families privileged conditions which form insurmountable barriers among the citizens—the consequences of conquests when the conquerors have never become incorporated with and mingled with the conquered animosities founded upon ancient injustice government factions which rise with victory and fall upon defeat in these unfortunate states hearts are more frequently united by the wants of hatred than of love to render them benevolent it is necessary to relieve them from fear and oppression the destruction of those prejudices which render men enemies is one of the greatest services which can be rendered to morality the travels of mungo park in africa have represented the negroes under the most interesting point of view their simplicity the strength of their domestic affections the picture of their innocent manners has increased the public interest in their favour satirists weaken this sentiment when any one has read voltaire does he feel disposed to favour the jews had he possessed more benevolence with respect to them by exposing the degradation in which they are held he would have explained the less favourable points of their character and have exhibited the remedy by the side of the disease the greatest attack upon benevolence has been made by religious exclusionists by those who have incommunicable rites by those who breathe intolerance and represent all unbelievers as infidels and enemies of god in england the art of exciting benevolence by the publicity given to its exhibition is better understood than anywhere besides is it desired to undertake any scheme of benevolence—a charity which requires the concurrence of numbers a committee is formed of its most active and distinguished supporters the amount of the contributions is announced in the public papers the names of the subscribers are printed there day by day this publication serves many purposes its immediate object is to guarantee the receipt and employment of the funds but it is a feast for vanity by which benevolence profits in these establishments of charity the annual subscribers are called governors the superintendence which they exercise the little state which they form interests them in promoting their welfare individuals like to trace the good which has been done to enjoy the power which is conferred the benefactors are brought near to the parties relieved and these being placed in view strengthen benevolence which cools when its object is removed to a distance but is warmed by its presence there are more of these associations of benevolence in london than there are convents in paris many of these charities have particular objects the blind the dumb the lame orphans widows sailors the children of the clergy c every individual is touched with one kind of misery more than by another his     sympathy is always affected by some personal circumstance there is art therefore in diversifying these charities in separating them into different branches which apply to every kind of sensibility so that none of them are lost it is surprising that more draughts have not been made upon this disposition from among females among whom the sentiment of pity is stronger than among men there are two institutions in france well adapted to this end the daughters of charity who devote themselves to the service of the hospitals and the maternal society formed by the ladies in paris who visit poor women in the time of their confinement and take care of the first days of infancy   the feelings of benevolence are liable to be led astray from the principle of general utility this can only be prevented by instruction they cannot be commanded they cannot be forced they can only be persuaded and enlightened men are brought by little and little to distingish the different degrees of utility to proportion their benevolence to the extent of its object the finest model is drawn by fenelon in that saying in which he has so well painted his own heart—i prefer my family to myself my country to my family and the human race to my country the objects sought in these public instructions should be to direct the affections of the citizens to this object to repress the wanderings of benevolence to make them feel their own interest in the general interest to make them ashamed of that spirit of family—of that esprit de corps which militates against the love of country—of that unjust love of country which turns to hatred against other nations to divert them from the exercise of unfounded pity towards deserters smugglers and other persons who offend against the government to disabuse them of the false notion that there is humanity in favouring the escape of the guilty—in procuring impunity for crime—in encouraging mendicity to the prejudice of industry to seek to give to all these sentiments the proportion most advantageous for all by showing the danger and littleness of the caprices the antipathies and momentary attachments which turn the balance against general utility and permanent interests the more we become enlightened the more benevolent shall we become because we shall see that the interests of men coincide upon more points than they oppose each other in commerce ignorant nations have treated each other as rivals who could only rise upon the ruins of one another the work of adam smith is a treatise upon universal benevolence because it has shown that commerce is equally advantageous for all nations—each one profiting in a different manner according to its natural means that nations are associates and not rivals in the grand social enterprise chapter xvii employment of the motive of honour or of the popular sanction to increase the strength of this power—to regulate its application such are the two objects to be accomplished the strength of public opinion is in combined proportion to its extent and intensity its extent is measured by the number of suffrages its intensity by the degree of its blame or approbation for increasing the power of opinion in extent there are many methods the principal are the liberty of the press and the publicity of all acts which interest the nation—publicity of the tribunals publicity of accounts and publicity of the debates upon state affairs when secresy is not required by some particular reason the enlightened public—the depository of the laws and archives of honour the administrator of the moral sanction forms a supreme tribunal which decides upon all causes and all persons by the publicity of affairs this tribunal is in a condition to collect the proofs and to judge—by the liberty of the press to pronounce and to execute its judgment for increasing the power of opinion in intensity there are also a diversity of methods either by punishments which possess a certain character of ignominy or by rewards which have for their principal object the investing with honour those who receive them there is a secret art of governing opinion so that it shall not perceive so to speak the manner in which it is led it consists in so disposing matters that the act to be prevented cannot be performed without also performing an act which popular opinion has already condemned is a tax to be paid according to the circumstances of the case an oath or a certificate may be required that it is correctly paid to take a false oath to fabricate a false certificate are offences which the public is prepared beforehand to mark with the seal of its condemnation whenever there shall be occasion for it this then is a sure method of rendering infamous an offence which without its accessary can never exist     sometimes a simple change in the name of the objects suffices to change the sentiments of men the romans abhorred the name of king but they suffered those of dictator and emperor cromwell would not have been able to place himself upon the throne of england but he possessed under the title of protector an authority more unlimited than that of the king peter i abdicated the title of despot for himself and he directed that the slaves of the nobles should only be called subjects if the people were philosophers this expedient would be worth nothing but upon this point philosophers are only men how much deception is there in the words liberty and equality what contradictions between that luxury which all the world condemns and that prosperity which all the world admires the legislator should take care not to furnish arms to public opinion in those cases in which he finds it opposed to the principle of utility for this reason he ought to efface from the laws all remains of the pretended crimes of heresy and sorcery that there may be no legal foundation for these superstitious ideas if he dare not wound an error too widely extended he ought at least not to give it a new sanction it is very difficult to employ the motive of honour in engaging the citizens in the service of the law against delinquents pecuniary rewards granted for informations have failed in their object the desire of gain has been opposed by that of shame the law instead of gaining strength by offering a reward disapproved by public opinion has been weakened individuals have been suspected of acting from a degrading motive the illchosen reward instead of attracting has repulsed and deprived the law of more gratuitous protectors than it has procured for it mercenary servants the most powerful method of producing an important revolution in public opinion is to strike the mind of the people by some noble example thus peter the great by passing gradually through all the gradations of the public service taught his nobility to bear the yoke of military subordination thus catherine ii surmounted the popular prejudice against inoculation not by trying it upon some criminals as was done in the reign of queen anne but by submitting to it herself chapter xviii of the employment of the religious sanction the cultivation of religion has two objects to increase the force of this sanction to give to this force a suitable direction if this direction be bad it is evident that the less force this sanction possesses the less evil it will do with regard to religion the first thing therefore is to examine into this direction the increase of its force is only a secondary object its direction ought to be conformable to utility as a sanction it is composed of rewards and punishments its punishments should be attached to actions hurtful to society and to these actions exclusively its rewards ought to be promised to actions whose tendency is advantageous to society and to no others such is the fundamental dogma the only method of judging of its direction is to consider it solely with relation to the welfare of political society every thing besides this is indifferent and every thing in religious belief which is indifferent is liable to become pernicious but every article of faith is necessarily hurtful so soon as the legislator in order to favour its adoption employs coercive or penal motives the persons whom he seeks to influence may be considered as forming three classes those who already are of the same opinion with the legislator those who reject this opinion those who neither adopt nor reject it with regard to the conformists the law is not necessary with regard to the nonconformists it is useless by the supposition itself it does not accomplish its object when a man has formed his opinion is it in the power of punishment to make him change it the question appears ridiculous punishments tend rather to an opposite result they tend rather to confirm him in his opinion than to make him give it up partly because the employment of force is a tacit avowal that reasons are wanting—partly because recourse to violent measures produces aversion to the opinions which it is sought to maintain in this manner all that can be obtained by punishments is not to engage a man to believe but to declare that he believes     those who from conviction or honour refuse to make this declaration undergo the evil of the punishment—the persecution for what is called persecution is an evil which is not compensated for by any advantage—an evil in pure waste and this evil inflicted by the hand of the magistrate is precisely the same in kind but much stronger in degree than if it had been inflicted by an ordinary malefactor those who less strong or less noble escape by a false declaration give way to the threats to the danger which immediately presses upon them but the momentary pain which is avoided is converted as to them into pains of conscience if they have any scruples and into pains of contempt on the part of society which charges with baseness these hypocritical recantations in this state of things what happens one part of the citizens must accustom itself to despise the opinions of the other in order to be at peace with themselves they employ themselves in making subtle distinctions between innocent and criminal falsehood in establishing privileged lies because they serve as a protection against tyranny in establishing customary perjuries false subscriptions and consider them as articles of peace in the midst of these subtleties regard for truth is neglected the limits of right and wrong are confounded a train of less pardonable falsehoods is introduced under favour of the first—the tribunal of public opinion is divided the judges who compose it are not guided by the same laws they no longer know clearly what degree of dissimulation they ought to condemn nor what they ought to excuse its voice is drowned in contradictions and the moral sanction having no longer an uniform regulator is weakened and depraved thus the legislator who requires declarations of faith becomes the corrupter of his country he sacrifices virtue to religion instead of making religion an auxiliary to virtue the third class to be examined is that of those who at the establishment of the penal law had not yet formed any opinion either for or against with respect to these it is probable that the law will influence the formation of their opinion seeing danger on one side and security on the other it is natural that they should regard the arguments of the condemned opinion with a degree of fear and aversion which they will not feel for the arguments of the favoured opinion the arguments which they wish to find true will make a more lively impression than those which they wish to find false and by this means a man may come to believe or rather not to reject not to misbelieve a proposition which he would not have adopted if his inclination had been left free in this last case the evil is less than in the two former cases but does not cease to be an evil it may happen but it does not always happen that the judgment gives way entirely to the affections but even when that happens that is to say when the persuasion is as strong as it can be if fear form any part of the motives of this persuasion the mind is never perfectly tranquil what is believed today it is feared may not be believed on the morrow a clear moral truth is never doubtful but the belief of a dogma is always more or less shifting hence arises irritation against those who attack it examination and discussion is dreaded because we do not feel ourselves placed upon solid ground it is not necessary to pull down anything in a building which is firmly put together the understanding becomes weakened the mind seeks only complete repose in a kind of blind credulity it seeks out all the errors which possess affinity with its own it fears clearly to explain itself upon what is possible and impossible and wishes to confound all boundaries it loves to entertain sophistry and every thing which fetters the human mind every thing which would persuade it that it cannot reason with entire certainty it acquires an unhappy dexterity in rejecting evidence—in giving force to half proofs—in listening only to one side—in subtilizing against reason in a word under this system it is proper to put a bandage over the eyes that they may not be wounded by the brightness of day hence every penal method employed for increasing the force of the religious sanction acts indirectly against that essential part of good manners which consists in respect for truth and respect for public opinion all the enlightened friends of religion now think the same there are however but few nations which have acted upon this principle violent persecutions have ceased but there still exist secret persecutions civil punishments political incapacities threatening laws a precatious toleration—a humiliating situation for classes of men who owe their tranquillity only to a tacit indulgence a continual pardon in order to obtain clear ideas as to the advantage which the legislator may derive from increasing the force of the religious sanction it is necessary to distinguish three cases   those in which it is entirely subordinated to him   those in which others partake of this influence with him   those in which it depends upon a stranger in this latter case the sovereignty is really divided between two magistrates—the spiritual as it is commonly called and the temporal the temporal magistrate will be in constant danger of seeing his authority contested or destroyed by that of his rival and what he should do for increasing the force of the religious     sanction might prove a diminution of his own power whilst as to the effects which might result from such a state of strife they may be found on the tables of history the temporal magistrate commands his subjects to perform one action the spiritual magistrate prohibits it whichever they obey they are punished by the one or the other proscribed or damned they are placed between the fear of the civil sword and the fear of eternal fire in protestant countries the clergy are essentially subordinate to the political power their dogmas do not depend upon the prince but those who interpret them depend upon him but the right of interpreting these dogmas is little less than the same thing as the right of making them hence in protestant countries religion is more easily modelled upon the plan of the political authority married priests are more completely citizens they do not form a phalanx among themselves which can become formidable they have neither the power of the confessional nor that of absolution but in considering facts alone whether in protestant or catholic countries it must be acknowledged that religion has played too great a part in the miseries of nations it appears to have been more often the enemy rather than the instrument of civil government the moral sanction has never more force than when it accords with utility but unfortunately the religious sanction seems to have had most force in those cases in which it was most opposed to utility the inefficacy of religion when applied to the promotion of political good is the constant subject of the declamations of those who have the greatest interest in exaggerating its good effects too little powerful for the production of good it has often been too powerful in the production of evil it was the moral sanction which animated codrus regulus russell and sidney it was the religious sanction which worked in philip ii the scourge of the low countries in bloody mary of england and in charles ix the executioner of france the ordinary solution of this difficulty is to attribute all the good to religion and all the evil to superstition but this distinction in this sense is purely verbal the thing itself is not changed because the name is changed and it is called religion in the one case and superstition in the other the motive which acts upon the mind in both the cases is precisely the same it is always the fear of evil and the hope of good from an almighty being respecting whom different ideas have been formed hence in speaking of the conduct of the same man on the same occasion some will attribute it to religion and others to superstition another observation as trivial as the first and as weak as trivial is that it is unjust to argue against the use of any thing from its abuse and that the best instruments are those which do the most evil when they are misused the futility of this argument is easily pointed out the good effects of a thing are called its use the bad effects are called its abuse to say that you ought not to argue against the use from the abuse is to say that in making a just appreciation of the tendency of a cause you ought only to regard the good it occasions and not to consider the evil instruments of good ill employed may often become instruments of evil this is true but the principal character in the perfection of an instrument is not to be liable to be ill employed the most efficacious ingredients in medicine are convertible into poisons i allow but those which are dangerous are not so good upon the whole as those which render the same service if such there be without being liable to the same inconveniences mercury and opium are very useful bread and water are still more so i speak without circumlocution and with entire freedom i have elsewhere explained myself upon the utility of religion but i must not omit to observe here that it tends more and more to disengage itself from futile and pernicious dogmas and to coincide with sound morality and sound policy irreligion on the contrary i refuse to pronounce the word atheism has manifested itself in our days under the most hideous forms of absurdity immorality and persecution this experience is sufficient to show to all good minds in what direction they should exert their efforts but if government act too openly in favour of this direction it will fail in its object it is freedom of inquiry which has corrected the errors of the ages of ignorance and restored religion to its right direction freedom of inquiry will continue still to purify it and to reconcile it with public utility this is not the place to examine all the services which religion may render either as a source of consolation under the ills which man is heir to or as a moral teaching best adapted to the most numerous class of society or as a means of exciting beneficence and of producing useful acts of selfdevotion which could not be obtained upon purely human motives     the principal use of religion in civil and penal legislation is the giving a new degree of force to an oath—another foundation for confidence an oath includes two different bonds—the religious and the moral the one obligatory upon all the other only upon those who think in a certain manner the same formulary which professes to expose a man in case of perjury to religious punishments exposes him in the same case to legal punishments and the contempt of men the religious bond is the most striking but the greatest part of the force of an oath depends upon the moral bond the influence of the first is partial that of the second is universal it would be therefore highly imprudent to employ the one and neglect the other there are some cases in which an oath is of the greatest force when it operates in concert with public opinion—when it has the support of the popular sanction there are cases in which it has no force at all when public opinion acts in opposition to it or only does not second it such are customhouse oaths and those which are required of the students in certain universities it is the interest of the legislator no less than that of a military chief to know the true state of the forces under his command to shun the examination of a weak point because the appearance of this weak part will not yield satisfaction would be pusillanimity but if the weakness of the religious bond in an oath has been thus laid open it is the fault of the professors of religion the abuse which they have made of it by lavishing it without measure has robbed it of the efficacy which it possessed of itself separated from the sanction of honour the force of an oath is necessarily weakened when it turns upon matters of belief upon opinions why because it is impossible to detect the perjury and also because human reason always fluctuating always subject to variation cannot pledge itself for the future can i be certain that my belief of today will remain the same ten years hence all such oaths are a monopoly bestowed upon men with consciences of little scrupulosity in opposition to those who possess consciences of more sensibility oaths are degraded when they regard trifles when they are employed upon occasions in which they will be violated by a kind of universal convention and more especially when they are required in cases in which justice and humanity will make an excuse for and almost a merit of their violation the human mind which always resists tyranny confusedly perceives that god on account of his perfections cannot ratify frivolous or unjust laws indeed man by imposing an oath would exercise authority over god himself man ordains a punishment and it is for the supreme judge to execute it deny this position and the religious force of an oath vanishes it is very astonishing that in england among a nation otherwise prudent and religious this great security has been almost destroyed by the trivial and indecent use which has been made of it to show to what an extent habit may deprave moral opinions in certain respects i quote a passage extracted from lord kames a judge of the court of session in scotland upon education— customhouse oaths nowadays go for nothing not that the world grow more wicked but because no person lays any stress upon them the duty on french wine is the same in scotland and in england but as we cannot afford to pay this high duty the permission underhand to pay spanish duty for french wine is found more beneficial to the revenue than the rigour of the law the oath however must be taken that the wine we import is spanish to entitle us to the ease of the spanish duty such oaths at first were highly criminal because directly a fraud against the public but now that the oath is only exacted for form sake without any faith being intended to be given or received it becomes very little different from saying in the way of civility i am sir your friend or your obedient servant and in fact we every day see merchants dealing in such oaths whom no man scruples to rely upon in the most material affairs who would believe that this is the language of a moralist and a judge the quakers have raised their simple asseveration to the dignity of an oath—a magistrate degrades an oath to the simple formula of a ceremony the oath implies neither faith given nor faith received why then require it why take it why this farce is religion then the last of objects and if it be thus to be contemned why should it be so dearly paid for how great the absurdity of paying a religious establishment for preaching up the importance of an oath and having judges and legislators who amuse themselves with destroying it† chapter xix uses to be drawn from the power of instruction instruction does not form a separate head but the above title is convenient as a centre     around which to collect sundry scattered ideas government ought not to do every thing by force by this it can only move the bodies of men by its wisdom it extends its empire over their minds when it commands it gives its subjects a factitious interest in obedience when it enlightens it gives them an internal motive which cannot be weakened the best method of instruction is simply to publish facts but it is sometimes proper to assist the public in forming its judgment upon those facts when we see government measures which are excellent in themselves fail from the opposition of an ignorant people we at first feel irritated against the senseless multitude but when we come to reflect—when we observe that this opposition might have been easily foreseen and that the government in proud exercise of authority has taken no steps to prepare the minds of the people to dissipate their prejudices to conciliate their confidence—our indignation is transferred from the ignorant and deceived people to its disdainful and despotic leaders experience has shown contrary to general expectation that newspapers are one of the best means of directing opinion—of quieting feverish movements—of causing the lies and artificial rumours by which the enemies of the state may attempt to carry on their evil designs to vanish in these public papers instruction may descend from the government to the people or ascend from the people to the government the greater the freedom allowed the more correctly may a judgment be formed upon the course of opinion—with so much the greater certainty will it act rightly to estimate their utility it is necessary to refer to the times when public papers did not exist and consider the scenes of imposture both political and religious which were played off with success in countries where the people could not read the last of these grand impostors with a royal mantle was pugatcheff would it have been possible in our days to have supported this personage in france or in england the cheat would have been discovered as soon as announced these are crimes which are not attempted among enlightened nations—the facility of detecting impostors preventing their birth there are many other snares against which governments may guard the people by public instruction how many are the frauds practised in commerce in the arts in the price and quality of goods which it would be easy to cause to cease by unveiling them how many dangerous remedies or rather real poisons are sold with impudence by empirics as marvellous secrets of which it would be easy to disabuse the minds of the most credulous by publishing their composition—how many mischievous opinions how many dangerous or absurd errors might be stopped in their birth by enlightening the public when the folly of animal magnetism after having seduced the idle societies of paris began to spread throughout europe one report of the academy of sciences by the force of truth alone precipitated mesmer into the crowd of despicable charlatans and left him no other disciples than incurable fools whose admiration served to complete his disgrace would you cure an ignorant and superstitious people send into their towns and villages in quality of missionaries jugglers workers of prodigies who shall begin by astonishing the people by producing the most singular phenomena and shall finish by explaining them the more we know of natural magic the less shall we be the dupes of magicians it were to be wished that with certain precautions the miracle of st januarius at naples were repeated in all public places and that it were made a toy for children the principal instruction which governments owe to the people regards the knowledge of the laws how can these be obeyed if they are unknown how can they be known if they are not published in the simplest form—in such manner that each individual may find for himself what ought to regulate his conduct the legislator might influence public opinion by composing a code of political morality analogous to the code of laws and divided in the same manner into a general and particular code the most delicate questions relative to every profession might there be explained he need not confine himself to cold lessons but by mingling with them well chosen historical anecdotes such a code might be made a manual of amusement for all ages to compose such codes would be so to speak to dictate the judgments which public opinion ought to pronounce upon the different questions of morals and politics to these codes might with the same intention be added a collection of popular prejudices with the considerations which might serve as their antidotes if ever sovereign power showed itself with dignity among men it was in the instructions which were published by catherine ii for a code of laws when this unique example is considered for a moment and it is separated from the recollection of an ambitious government it is impossible to see without admiration a woman descend from the car of victory for the purpose of civilizing so many semibarbarous nations and of presenting to them the noblest maxims of philosophy sanctioned by the touch of the sceptre superior to the vanity of herself composing this work she borrowed whatever was excellent from     the writings of the sages of the time but by adding to their works the sanction of her authority she did more for them than they had done for her she seemed to say to her subjects—you owe me so much the more confidence since i have called to my counsels the noblest geniuses of my time i fear not thus to associate with me these masters of truth and virtue since they will make me ashamed before the universe if i dare to disgrace them she was seen animated with the same spirit sharing with her courtiers the labours of legislation and if she were often found in contradiction to herself like tiberius who was fatigued with the servitude of the senate and would have punished a movement of liberty yet these solemn engagements contracted in the face of the whole world were as barriers which she had imposed upon her own power and which she rarely ventured to break chapter xx use to be made of the power of education education is only government acting by means of the domestic magistrate the analogies between a family and a kingdom are of a kind which are obvious at the first glance the differences are less striking but it is not less useful to indicate them—   domestic government may be more active more vigilant more occupied with details than civil government without continued attention families could not subsist civil authority has nothing better to trust to than a reliance upon the prudence of individuals in the conduct of their personal interests but the head of a family must continually supply the inexperience of those committed to his care it is here that censorship may be exercised a policy which we have condemned in civil governments domestic government may keep from those subject to it knowledge which might become hurtful to them it may watch over their connexions and their reading it may accelerate or retard the progress of their knowledge according to circumstances   this continued exercise of power which would be subject to so many abuses in a state is much less subject to them in the interior of a family indeed the father or the mother have for their children a natural affection much stronger than that of the civil magistrate for the persons who are subordinate to him indulgence is in them the most frequent movement in nature severity is only the result of reflexion   domestic government may employ punishment in many circumstances in which civil authority could not the head of a family knows individuals the legislator knows only the species the one proceeds upon certainties the other upon presumptions a certain astronomer may perhaps be capable of solving the problem of the longitude can the civil magistrate know this ought he to direct him to solve it and to punish him if he do not but the private tutor may know if his pupil understand an elementary problem in geometry—that obstinacy has put on the mask of impotence the tutor can scarcely be deceived the magistrate necessarily would be so in the same manner there are many vices which the public magistrate cannot repress because it would require the establishment of offices of detection in every family the private magistrate having under his eyes under his hands those whom he is charged to conduct may stop in their origin those vices which the laws can only punish in their last excess   it is especially in the power of rewarding that these two governments differ all the wants all the amusements of youth may be clothed with a remuneratory character according to the manner in which they are bestowed upon certain conditions after certain work is done in the island of minorca the subsistence of the young boys is made dependent upon their skill with the bow the honour of suffering in public was among the lacedemonians one of the prizes for virtue among the youthful warriors there is no government so rich as to do much by rewards there is no father so poor as not to possess an inexhaustible store of them it is especially in youth that season of lively and durable impressions that the legislator ought to keep in view the directing of the course of the inclinations towards those things which are most conformable to the public interest in russia the young nobility have been seen engaged in the public service by means as powerful as they were well imagined there have arisen perhaps fewer good effects as respects military spirit than as respects civil life they have been accustomed to order to vigilance to subordination it has obliged them to leave their retreats where they exercised a corrupting domination over slaves and placed them upon a wider theatre where they have met with equals and superiors the necessity of association has given rise to the desire to please the mingling of different conditions has diminished reciprocal prejudices and the pride of birth has been obliged to bow before the gradations of service an unlimited despotism as that of russia was could not fail to gain by being converted into a military government in which authority has its limits hence in the given circumstances of that   0 empire it was difficult to discover a plan of general education which would answer more useful objects but in regarding education as an indirect mode of preventing offences it requires an essential reform the most neglected class must become the principal object of care the less parents are able to discharge this duty the more necessary is it for government to fulfil it it ought not only to watch over orphans left in indigence but also over the children whose parents no longer deserve the confidence of the law with regard to this important charge—over those who have already committed crimes or who destitute of protectors and resources are given up to all the seduction of misery these classes absolutely neglected in most states become the hotbeds of crime a man of rare benevolence le chevalier paulet had formed an establishment at paris for more than two hundred children whom he took from among the most indigent class among the beggars every thing turned upon four principles—to offer to the pupils many objects of study and labour and allow the greatest possible latitude to their tastes—to employ them in reciprocal instruction by presenting to the pupil the honour of becoming master in his turn as the greatest recompense for his progress—to entrust all the domestic service to them in order to unite the double advantage of their instruction and economy—to govern them by themselves and to place each one under the inspection of one older in such manner as to render them securities for each other in this establishment every thing wore the appearance of liberty and happiness there were no other punishments than forced idleness and a change of dress the more advanced pupils were as interested in its success as its founder and every thing advanced towards perfection when the revolution overwhelmed this little colony amid its public disasters greater extent might be given to institutions of this kind and they might be rendered less expensive either by multiplying the number of workmen in them or by keeping the pupils until the age of eighteen or twentyone that they might have time to pay for the expense of their education and to contribute to that of those who were younger schools upon this plan instead of costing the state any thing might become lucrative enterprises but it would be necessary to interest the pupils themselves in their labour by paying them nearly the same as free labourers and by forming for them a saving fund to be given them when they leave the establishment chapter xxi general precautions against the abuse of authority i proceed to certain means that governments may employ for the prevention of the abuse of authority on the part of those to whom they confide a portion of their power constitutional law has its direct and its indirect legislation its direct legislation consists in the establishment of offices among which all political power is divided this is not considered in this work its indirect legislation consists in general precautions which have for their object the prevention of the misconduct the incapacity or malversation of those who administer these offices either in chief or in subordination a complete enumeration of these indirect methods will not be attempted it is here only intended to direct attention towards this object and perhaps to lessen the enthusiasm of certain political writers who having caught a glimpse of one or other of these methods have flattered themselves that they have established a science of which they have not even drawn the outline   divide power into different branches every division of power is a refinement suggested by experience the most natural plan that which first presents itself is that which places power altogether in the hands of a single individual command on the one side obedience on the other is a species of contract the terms of which are easily arranged when the governor has no associate among all the nations of the east the frame of government has preserved this primitive structure the monarchial power descends without division from stage to stage from the highest to the lowest from the great mogul to the simple havildar when the king of siam heard the dutch ambassador speak of an aristocratic government he laughed at the idea as an absurdity this principal method is only indicated here to examine into how many branches the power of government may be divided and which of all the possible divisions deserves to be preferred would be to write a treatise upon a political constitution i only observe that this division ought not to form separate and independent powers this would introduce anarchy into a state an authority must be recognised superior to all others which receives no law but only gives it and     which remains master even of the rules themselves which it imposes upon its manner of acting   distribute the particular branches of power each among different copartners—advantages and disadvantages of this policy in the provinces of russia before the regulations of catherine ii all the different branches of power military fiscal judicial were placed in a single body a single council so far the constitution of these subordinate governments sufficiently resembled the form of oriental despotism but the power of the governor was a little limited by the powers of the council and in this respect the form approached an aristocracy at present the judicial power is separated into many branches and each branch is shared between many judges who exercise their functions conjointly a law of the nature of the habeas corpus in england has been established for the protection of individuals against arbitrary power and the governor has no more right to injure than a governor of jamaica or barbadoes the advantages of this division are principally these—   it diminishes the danger of precipitation   it diminishes the danger of ignorance   it diminishes the danger from want of probity this last advantage can only be the constant result when the number of copartners is large that is to say when it is such that it would be difficult to separate the interests of the majority from the interests of the body of the people the division of powers has also its disadvantages because it causes delays and foments quarrels which may produce the dissolution of the government it is possible to obviate the evil of these delays by graduating the division according as the functions to which it is applied admit of more or less of deliberation the legislative power and the military power form in this respect the two extremes the first admits the greatest deliberation and the second requires the greatest celerity whilst as to the dissolution of the government it is only an evil on one or the other of these two suppositions— st that the new government is worse than the old  d that the passage from the one to the other is marked by calamities and civil wars the greatest danger in plurality either in a tribunal or an administrative council is that it diminishes responsibility in many ways a numerous body may reckon upon a kind of deference on the part of the public and may allow itself to perpetrate injuries which a single person would not dare to do in a confederation of many persons the single individuals may throw the odium of a measure upon the others it is done by all it is acknowledged by none does public censure rise against them the more numerous the body the more it is fortified against external opinion the more it tends to form a kingdom within a kingdom—a little public having a peculiar spirit and which protects by its applause those of its members who have incurred general disgrace unity in all cases in which it is possible that is in all cases which do not require the combined knowledge and wills of many as in a legislative body—unity i say is desirable because it makes the whole responsibility whether moral or political to rest upon a single head it divides with no one the honour of its actions it bears at the same time the whole weight of the blame it sees itself set against all with no other support than integrity of conduct no other defence than general esteem when the individual is not honest from inclination he becomes so in opposition to himself in virtue of the position in which his interest is inseparable from his duty besides unity in the subordinate person employed is a certain means for enabling the sovereign to discover in a short time the real capacity of individuals a false and limited mind may hide itself for a long time in a numerous company but if it act alone upon a public theatre its insufficiency is soon unmasked men of mediocrity or inefficiency always ready to seek for places where they may shelter themselves under the merit of others will be afraid to expose themselves in a dangerous career in which they will be reduced to their own value but it is possible to unite in certain cases the advantages which result from combination and those which necessarily belong to the responsibility of an individual in subordinate councils there is always an individual who presides and upon whom the principal reliance is placed associates are given to him that he may profit by their advice and that there may be witnesses against him when he neglects his duty but it is not necessary for the accomplishment of this object that they should be his equals in power nor that they should have a right of voting all that is necessary is that the chief should be obliged to communicate to them all that he does and that each one should make a declaration in writing respecting each of his acts testifying his approbation or blame—such communication in ordinary cases ought to be made before an order is given but in those which demand particular celerity it would be sufficient if made immediately after this arrangement could not fail in general to obviate the danger of disscusions and delay       place the power of displacing in other hands than the power of appointing this idea is borrowed from an ingenious pamphlet published in america in      by a deputy of the convention charged with examining the form of government proposed for the state of massachusetts the pride of man is interested in not condemning his own choice independently of all affection a superior will be less disposed to listen to complaints against one of his own nominees than he would be against an indifferent person and will have a prejudice arising from selflove in his favour this consideration serves in part to explain those abuses of power so common in monarchies when a subaltern is charged with great authority for which he has only to render an account to the same individual who appointed him to his office in popular elections the part that each individual has in the nomination of a magistrate is so small that this kind of illusion hardly exists in england the choice of the ministers belongs to the king but the parliament can effectively displace them by forming a majority against them this however is only an indirect application of this principle   suffer not governors to remain long in the same districts this principle particularly applies to considerable governments in distant provinces especially when separated from the principal body of the empire a governor armed with great power may if leisure be given him seek to establish his independence the longer he remains in place the more he may strengthen himself by creating a party or by uniting himself with a previously existing party from oppression towards some and partiality for others though he may have no party he may render himself culpable by a thousand abuses of authority without any one daring or seeking to complain to the sovereign the duration of his power gives birth to hopes or fears which are equally favourable to him he makes some his creatures who regard him as the sole distributor of favours whilst those who suffer fear lest they should suffer more if they offend a chief whom they have no hope to see changed for many years this will be true especially with regard to offences which are more hurtful to the state than to individuals the disadvantage of rapid changes is that it removes a man from his employment when he has acquired knowledge and experience as to its business new men are liable to err through ignorance this inconvenience will be palliated by the institution of a subordinate and permanent council which would continue the progress and routine of affairs what you gain by this means is the diminution of a power that may be turned against you what you risk is the diminution of the degree of knowledge there is no equality between these two dangers when revolt is apprehended the arrangement ought to be permanent to avoid giving umbrage to individuals it is proper to accustom the minds of men to regard the change as fixed and necessary at determinate periods if it take place only in certain cases it may serve to provoke the evil it is destined to prevent the danger of revolt on the part of governors only exists in feeble and illconstituted governments in the roman empire from the time of cæsar to augustus nothing else is seen but governors and generals raising the standard of independence it was not that this means of which we speak was neglected changes were frequent but either they knew not how to make a good use of this preservative or they wanted vigilance and firmness or from other causes they knew not how to hinder the frequency of revolt the want of a permanent arrangement of this nature is the most evident cause of the continual revolts to which the turkish empire is subject and nothing more completely proves the stupidity of this barbarous court among the european governments which have stood in need of this policy may be mentioned spain in her american colonies and england in the east indies in the better civilized christian states nothing is more uncommon than the revolt of a governor that of prince gagarin the governor of siberia under peter i is i believe the only example which can be cited in the last two centuries and this happened in an empire which has not even yet lost its asiatic character the revolutions which have burst forth have owed their origin to a more powerful and more reputable principle—the opinions the sentiments of the people the love of liberty   renew the governing body by rotation the reasons for not allowing a governor to remain long in office all apply with still more force to a council or a body of directors     render them permanent if they agree among themselves with regard to the generality of their measures it is probable that among these measures there are many whose object is to serve themselves and their friends at the expense even of the community which has confided its interests to them if they divide and are afterwards reconciled it is highly probable that the price of their reunion will still be at the expense of the community but on the contrary if you remove a certain number at a time and there are abuses you have a chance of seeing them reformed by the newcomers whom their associates will not have had time to corrupt one portion ought always to be left to continue the current of affairs without interruption ought this reserved part to be greater or less than the part renewed if it be greater it is to be feared that the ancient system of corruption will maintain itself in vigour if it be less it is to be feared that a good system of administration may be overturned by capricious innovations whichever it be the simple right of removal will scarcely answer the end especially if the power of replacing belongs to the body itself this right should never be exercised but upon extraordinary occasions those who have been removed ought they to be ineligible for ever or only for a time if they are ineligible for a time only it will happen in the end that they will be reelected and that the spirit of federation will run its course in the body if they are ineligible for ever the community will be deprived of the talents and experience of its most skilful servants upon the whole this species of policy appears only an imperfect substitute for other means which will be hereafter mentioned and especially for the publicity of all proceedings and all accounts this arrangement of rotation has been adopted in england in the great commercial companies and for some years past it has been introduced into the direction of the east india company this political view is not the only one which has been taken of rotation it has often been adopted for the simple object of effecting a more equal distribution of the privileges which belong to office the great political work of harrington oceana turns almost entirely upon a system of rotation among the members of government a man of wit who does not see the full extent of a science seizes a single idea developes it applies it to all cases and sees nothing beside it it is thus that in medicine the less the extent of the art is perceived the more are people inclined to believe in an elixir of life a universal remedy a marvellous secret classification is useful for the purpose of directing the attention successively to all the means   admit secret informations every one knows that at venice secret informations were received boxes were placed in different situations about the palace of st mark whose contents were regularly examined by the inquisitors of state according to these anonymous accusations it is pretended that certain persons have been seized imprisoned sent into exile and even punished with death without any ulterior proof if this were true there was nothing more salutary and more reasonable than the first part of the institution—nothing more pernicious and abominable than the second the arbitrary tribunal of the inquisitors has been a reasonable ground of reproach to the venetian government which must have been in other respects wise since it maintained itself for so long a period in a state of prosperity and tranquillity it is a great evil when a good institution has been connected with a bad one all eyes are not able to use the prism which separates them in what consists the evil of receiving secret informations even though anonymous in the first instance without doubt it would not be right to hurt a hair upon a mans head upon a secret information nor to give the slightest uneasiness to an individual but with this restriction why should the advantage which may result from them be lost the magistrate considers if the object denounced deserve his attention if it do not deserve it he disregards the information in the contrary case he directs the informer personally to appear after examining the facts if he find him in error he dismisses him praising his good intentions and concealing his name if he have made a malicious and perfidious accusation his name and accusation ought to be communicated to the party accused but if his accusation has foundation judicial proceedings commence and the informer is obliged to appear and give his depositions in public is it asked upon what principle an institution of this kind may be advantageous precisely upon the same principle that votes are collected by ballot in the course of the procedure the defendant ought certainly to be informed who the witnesses are who depose against him but where is the necessity that he should know them before the process commences in this last case a witness who may have any thing to fear from a delinquent would not expose himself to a certain inconvenience for the chance of rendering a doubtful service to the public it is hence that offences remain so frequently unpunished because individuals will not make personal enemies to themselves without being sure of serving the public this means has been considered under the head of abuses of authority because it is in     opposition to official persons that its efficacy is most marked seeing that in this case the power of the supposed delinquent is one more weight in the scale of dissuasive motives in this kind of case the superior having received a warning which puts him upon his guard may pass by the first offence and discover the guilty party in the commission of a second the resolution to receive secret and even anonymous informations would be good for nothing unless publicly known but once known the dread of these informations will soon render the occasion of their occurrence most rare and thereby diminish their number and whom will this fear affect only the guilty and those who intend to become so for with publicity of procedure the innocent cannot be endangered and malice will be confounded and punished   introduce the lot in requests addressed to the sovereign when informations reach the minister only they may have their use but to secure their utility they ought to come to the knowledge of the sovereign frederick the great received directly the letters of the lowest of his subjects and often wrote the answer to them himself this fact would be incredible if it were not well attested it must not be concluded from this example that the same thing could be done under all governments in england every one has liberty to present a petition to the king but the destination of these petitions delivered at the same moment to a gentleman of the chamber is proverbial they furnish curl papers for the maids of honour it may be believed after this that such petitions are not frequently presented but they also are not very necessary in a country in which the subject is protected by the laws which do not depend for their execution upon the sovereign there are other means for the private man to obtain information there are other channels of information for the prince it is in absolute monarchies that it is essential to keep a constant communication open between the subject and the monarch it is necessary for the subject that he may be sure of protection it is necessary for the monarch that he may be sure of being free though the people may be called canaille populace or what you will the prince who refuses to listen to the lowest individual of this populace very far from increasing his power by so doing in reality diminishes it from this moment he loses the faculty of governing by himself and becomes an instrument in the hands of those whom he calls his servants he may imagine that he does what he likes—that he determines for himself but in fact it is they who determine for him for to determine all the causes which a man has for action is to determine all his actions he who can neither see nor hear but as it pleases those who surround him is subject to all the impulses which they may choose to give him to place an unlimited confidence in ministers is to place an unlimited confidence in the hands of those who have the greatest interest in abusing it and the greatest facility for so doing whilst as to a minister himself the more upright he is the less need will he have of such confidence and it may be affirmed without a paradox that the more he deserves it the less will he desire to possess it the sovereign who cannot read all these petitions without sacrificing precious time may have recourse to different expedients for relieving himself from dependence upon those in whom he confides and assuring himself that they do not withdraw the most important from him he may take certain ones at hazard he may have them distributed under different heads and have them presented without selection the details of such an arrangement are neither sufficiently important nor sufficiently difficult to require a particular development it is sufficient to have suggested the idea   liberty of the press listen to all counsel you may find yourself the better for it you run no risk of being the worse this is what good sense says to establish the liberty of the press is to admit the counsels of every body it is true that on many occasions the public judgment is not listened to before a measure is determined upon but after it is executed this judgment however may always be useful either with reference to measures of legislation which may be reformed or with respect to those of administration which may have to be repeated the best advice given to a minister alone may be lost but good advice given to the public if it serve not upon one occasion may serve upon another if it be not employed today it may be employed in future if it be not offered in a suitable form it may receive from the hands of another those ornaments which shall make it relished instruction is a seed which so to speak must be tried in a diversity of soils and cultivated with patience because its fruits are often of slow growth this measure is far preferable to that of petitions as a means of emancipating the sovereign whatever may be his discernment in the choice of his ministers he can only take them from a small number of candidates whom the chances of birth or fortune present to him he may therefore reasonably think that there are other men more enlightened     than them and the wider he extends his faculty of knowing and hearing the more he extends his power and his liberty but insolence and drollery may mingle themselves with the manner of giving this advice in place of confining an examination to measures its criticisms may extend to persons and indeed how difficult is it to keep these two operations properly separated how can a measure be censured without attacking in some degree either the judgment or the probity of its author there is the rock hence it is that the liberty of the press is as rare as its advantages are manifest it has ranged against it all the fears of selflove joseph ii and frederick ii however had the magnanimity to establish it it exists in sweden it exists in england it might exist everywhere with some modifications which would prevent its greatest abuses if owing to the habits of the government or from particular circumstances the sovereign cannot permit the examination of the acts of his administration he ought at least to permit the examination of the laws though he claim the privilege of infallibility for himself he need not claim it for his predecessors if he be so jealous of the supreme power as to make every thing respected which has been touched by the sceptre he might leave open to discussion mere science principles of right procedure and subordinate administration if the liberty of the press may have its inconveniences arising from pamphlets and loose sheets being spread among the public addressed to the ignorant as well as to the enlightened part of a nation the same reason need not be applied to serious works of greater length—to books which can only have a certain class of readers and which cannot produce any immediate effect but which allow time to prepare an antidote under the ancient french regime it was sufficient that a book of moral science had been printed at paris to raise an unfavourable prejudice against it the instructions of the empress of russia to the assembly of deputies were prohibited in france the style and the sentiments were too popular to be tolerated under the french monarchy it is true that in france as elsewhere negligence and inconsistency palliated the evils of despotism a strange title served as a passport to genius the rigour of the censorship serves only to drive the trade in books to other nations and to render the satire which it seeks to suppress only the more severe   publish the reasons and the facts which serve as the foundation for the laws and other acts of government this is a necessary link in the chain of a generous and magnanimous policy and an indispensable accompaniment to the liberty of the press the one of these institutions is due to the people the other is due to the government if the government disdain to inform the nation of its motives upon important occasions it thereby announces that it depends upon force and counts the opinion of its subjects for nothing the partisan of arbitrary power does not think thus he does not wish that the people should be enlightened and he despises them because they are not enlightened you are not able to judge he says because you are ignorant and you shall always be kept ignorant that you may not be capable of judging such is the eternal circle in which he entrenches himself what is the consequence of this vulgar policy general discontent is formed and increased by degrees sometimes founded upon false and exaggerated imputations which are believed from want of discussion and examination a minister complains of the injustice of the public without thinking that he has not given them the means of being just and that the false interpretations given of his conduct are a necessary consequence of the mystery with which it is covered there are only two methods of acting with men if it be desired to be systematic and consistent absolute secresy or entire freedom—completely to exclude the people from the knowledge of affairs or to give them the greatest degree of knowledge possible—to prevent their forming any judgment or to put them in a condition to form the most enlightened judgment—to treat them as children or to treat them as men a choice must be made between these two methods the first of these plans has been followed by the priests of ancient egypt by the bramins in indostan by the jesuits in paraguay the second is practically established in england it is established by law in the united states of america only the greater number of european governments fluctuate continually between the one and the other system without having the courage to attach themselves exclusively to either and never cease placing themselves in contradiction to themselves by the desire of having industrious and enlightened subjects and the dread of encouraging a spirit of examination and discussion in many branches of administration it would be useless—it might be dangerous to publish beforehand the reasons which determine measures it is requisite only to distinguish the cases in which it is necessary to enlighten public opinion to prevent its going astray but in matters of legislation this principle is always applicable it may be laid down as a general rule that no law ought ever to be made without a reason either expressly assigned or     tacitly understood for what is a good law if it be not a law for which good reasons can be given there must always be a reason good or bad for making a law since there is no effect without a cause but oblige a minister to assign his reasons and he will be ashamed not to have good ones he will be ashamed to offer you base coin when he is required to present you with a touchstone to ascertain its quality it is a means whereby a sovereign may reign after his death if the reasons for his laws are good he gives them support that they can never lose his successors will be obliged to maintain them from a sentiment of honour thus the more happiness he has bestowed upon his people the more happiness will he secure to his posterity  0 exclude arbitrary power clotaire made a law says montesquieu that an accused person should not be condemned without being heard this proves that a contrary practice prevailed in particular cases or among a barbarous people—esprit des lois chap xii montesquieu dared not speak out could he have written this passage without thinking of lettres de cachet and the administration of the police such as it was in his time a lettre de cachet might be defined to be—an order to punish without any proof for a fact against which there is no law it was in france and at venice that this abuse reigned with the greatest violence these two governments in other respects moderate have calumniated themselves by this foolery they exposed themselves to imputations often false and to the reaction of terror for these precautions themselves by inspiring alarm created danger behave yourself well it is said and the government will not be your enemy but how may i assure myself of this i am hated by the minister or by his valet or by his valets valet if i am not hated today i may be tomorrow or some other day—and i may be taken for another person it is not upon my conduct that i depend but upon the opinion of men more powerful than me under louis xv lettres de cachet were an article of commerce if this could happen under a government which passed for gentle what would it be in countries where manners are less civilized in default of justice and humanity it seems to me that the pride of governments ought to suffice for the abolition of these remains of barbarity lettres de cachet may have been established under the veil of maxims of state at the present day this pretence has lost its magic the first thought which presents itself to the mind is that of the incapacity and weakness of those who employ them if you dared to hear that accused person you would not close his mouth if you keep him silent it is because you fear him    direct the exercise of power by rules and forms this is another head of police with regard to subordinate offices no less applicable to absolute monarchies than to mixed governments if the sovereign consider himself interested in remaining independent of the laws he is not interested in communicating this same independence to all his agents the laws which limit subordinate officers in the exercise of their power may be distinguished into two classes—to the first belong those which limit the causes with regard to which they are permitted to exercise certain powers to the second those which determine the formalities with which they shall exercise them these causes and these formalities ought to be all specifically enumerated in the body of the law this being done the subjects ought to be informed that these are the causes and these the only causes for which an attack can be legally made upon their security their property their honour hence the first law with which a great code ought to be begun should be a general law of liberty—a law which should restrain delegated powers and limit their exercise to certain particular occasions for certain specific causes such was the intention of magna charta and such would have been its effect without that unfortunate indeterminate expression lex terræ c an imaginary law which spreads uncertainty over the whole because by unceasingly referring to the custom of ancient times examples and authorities have been sought among the abuses which it was intended to prevent    establish the right of association that is to say of assemblies of the citizens for the expression of their sentiments and their wishes upon the public measures of government among the rights that a nation ought to reserve to itself when it institutes a government this is the principal as being the foundation of every other however it is almost useless expressly to mention it here the people who possess it need not to be told to preserve it and those who do not possess it have little hope of obtaining it for what is there which can induce their chiefs to give it them at first sight this right of association     would appear incompatible with government and i allow that to consider the right as a means of repressing government would be absurd and contradictory but the case is very different if the slightest act of violence be committed by one or many of the members of the association punish them as if it had been committed by any other individual if you find that you want the power to punish them it is a proof that the association has made such progress as it could not have made without just cause indeed that it is not an evil or that it is a necessary evil i suppose that the government possess a public force an organized authority everywhere if then these associations have become so strong as to intimidate it in the midst of all its regular sources of power—if it have not formed associations on its own side though it possess such superior means for establishing them it is an infallible sign that the calm and reflecting judgment of the nation is in opposition to such government this being settled what reason can be offered for continuing in the same state—for not satisfying the public wish i cannot find any without doubt a nation being composed of men is not infallible a nation as well as its chiefs may be deceived as to its true interests nothing is more certain but if the great majority of a nation be found on one side and its government on the other may it not be presumed in the first instance that this general discontent is founded upon real grievances far from being causes of insurrection i consider associations as the most powerful means of preventing this evil insurrections are the convulsions of weakness which finds strength in the moments of despair they are the efforts of men who have not been permitted to express their feelings or whose projects could not have succeeded had they been known—of conspirators who being opposed to the general feelings of the people can only succeed by surprise and violence those who frame them can therefore only hope for success by means of force but those who can believe that the people are on their side—those who can flatter themselves with the hopes of triumph through the influence of public opinion—why should they employ violence why should they expose themselves to manifest danger without utility i am therefore persuaded that men who have full liberty of associating and who can do so under the protection of the laws will never have recourse to insurrection except in those rare and unfortunate cases in which rebellion is become necessary whether associations are permitted or prohibited rebellions will never break out sooner the associations which were openly formed in ireland in    0 produced no evil but served rather to maintain tranquillity and security in the country though this country half civilized was torn by every possible cause of civil war i even believe that associations might be permitted and become one of the principal means of government in the most absolute monarchies these kinds of states are more tormented than others by revolts and risings every thing is done by sudden movements associations would prevent disorders if the subjects of the roman empire had been in the habit of association the empire and the life of the emperor would not have been continually sold by auction by the prætorian guards associations however cannot be permitted to slaves too much injustice has been done them not to afford reason to fear every evil from their ignorance or their resentment it is not in the west indies it is not in mexico that the people may be armed and permitted to associate but there are countries in europe in which this strong and generous policy might be set up it must also be acknowledged that there is a degree of ignorance which renders associations dangerous this proves that ignorance is a great evil and not that associations are not a great good besides this measure itself may serve as an antidote against its ill effects in proportion as an association gains in extent being formed in security all its bases are discovered the public is enlightened the government employs every means in disseminating the knowledge of facts and dissipating errors freedom and instruction join hand in hand freedom facilitates the progress of knowledge and the progress of knowledge represses the wanderings of freedom i know not how the establishment of this right can give uneasiness to the government there is no one which does not fear the people which does not consider it necessary to consult their wishes and to accommodate itself to their opinions the most despotic are the most timid what sultan is so quiet so secure in the exercise of his power as the king of england the janissaries and the populace make the seraglio tremble in london the voice of the people is heard in legitimate assemblies in constantinople it speaks in outrages in london the people speak by petitions at constantinople by fires the case of poland may be presented as an objection in which associations produced so many evils but this is deceptive the associations were produced by anarchy and did not produce it besides in speaking of this means as a restraint upon governments an established government is supposed—a medicine and not the daily food is spoken of i observe again that even in the states in which this right exists circumstances may     arise in which it will be proper not entirely to suspend but to regulate its exercise an absolute and inflexible rule is not requisite in this respect we have seen in the course of the last war the british parliament restraining the right of assembling not allowing political unions till the object had been publicly announced and sanctioned by the magistrates who possessed the power of dissolving them and these restrictions taking place at the same time that the citizens were called upon to form military bodies for the defence of the state and whilst the government announced the noblest confidence in the general spirit of the nation when these restraints ceased every thing remained in the same condition it might have been supposed that the restrictive law continued it was because a people secure of its rights enjoys them with moderation and tranquillity if it abuse them it is because it is doubtful of them precipitation is the effect of fear chapter xxii measures to be taken against the ill effects of an offence already committed—conclusion of the subject the general result of the principles which have been laid down in relation to penal legislation present a happy prospect and wellfounded hopes of reducing the number of crimes and mitigating punishments this subject at first only presents to the mind sombre images of suffering and terror but in considering this class of evils these doleful sentiments soon give place to gentle and consoling sentiments when it is discovered that the heart of man has not within it any original and incurable perversity that the multiplicity of offences arises only from errors in legislation easy to be reformed and that even the evil which results from them is capable of being repaired in many ways the great problem in penal legislation is—   to reduce as much as possible all the evil of offences to that which a pecuniary compensation will cure   to throw the expense of this cure upon the authors of the evil and in their default upon the public what may be done in this respect goes far beyond what is imagined at the first glance the term cure is employed the individual or community injured being considered under the character of an invalid who has suffered from a crime the comparison is just and indicates the most suitable procedure without mingling with them popular passions and the antipathies which the ideas of crime are too apt to awaken among legislators there are three principal sources of crime incontinence—enmity—rapacity the crimes to which incontinence gives birth are scarcely of a nature to be cured by a pecuniary compensation this remedy may be applied in certain cases to seduction and even to conjugal infidelity but it never cures that portion of the evil which consists in the attack upon the honour and peace of families it may be observed that in opposition to other offences whose evil effects are more surely arrested the more completely they are published the offences of incontinence only become hurtful when made public thus a good citizen who would esteem it a duty to publish an act of fraud would take care to conceal a secret fault arising from love to leave a fraud undetected is to become an accomplice in its success to publish in open day an unknown weakness is to do an injury without compensation since it lacerates the sensibility of those who are held up to shame and repairs nothing i reckon among the establishments which do honour to the humanity of our age the secret asylums for accouchements and hospitals for foundlings which have so often prevented the evil effects of despair by covering with the shades of mystery the consequences of a transient wandering the rigour which rises up against this indulgence is founded upon a false principle the crimes to which enmity gives birth are often such that a compensation in money cannot be applied to them even this compensation when it can be applied is rarely complete it cannot undo what is done it cannot restore a limb which is lost it cannot restore a son to his father a father to his family but it may act upon the condition of the party injured it may furnish him with a lot of good in consideration of a lot of evil and in balancing the account of his prosperity place an item upon the favourable side to balance an item upon the disadvantageous side the most essential observation with respect to these offences is that they are daily diminishing from the progress of civilization it is wonderful to observe among the greater number of european states how few crimes are produced by the angry passions so natural to man and so violent in the infancy of society how noble an object of emulation for those tardy governments which have not yet attained this degree of police and among whom the sword of justice has not yet vanquished the stilettoes of revenge but the inexhaustible source of crimes is rapacity here is an enemy always active always ready to seize all advantages—against whom it is necessary to wage continual war this war demands tactics whose particular principles have been much misunderstood be indulgent to this passion so long as it confines itself to attacking you by peaceful     means attach yourself to taking away all the unjust profit that it makes become severe with regard to it in proportion as it carries on its enterprises openly—when it has recourse to threats and violence still however reserve means of additional severity when it gives way to atrocities such as murder and incendiarism it is in the proper management of these gradations that the art of penal legislation consists it must never be forgotten that all penal police consists in a choice of evils the wise administrator of punishments will always have the balance in his hands and in his zeal for the exclusion of small offences will not imprudently give birth to greater ones death is almost always a remedy which is not necessary or which is inefficacious it is not necessary with respect to those whom an inferior punishment may deter from crime—whom simple imprisonment can restrain from it it is not efficacious with respect to those who precipitate themselves upon it so to speak as an asylum against despair the policy of the legislator who punishes every thing with death resembles the pusillanimity of the child who crushes the insect which he dares not look upon but if the circumstances of society—if the frequency of a great crime require the employment of this terrible punishment dare without aggravating the torments of death itself to give to it a more formidable aspect than that of nature surround it with mournful accessaries—the emblems of crime and the pomp of tragic ceremonies be hard however to be convinced of the necessity of putting any one to death by avoiding it as a punishment you will also prevent its occurrence as a crime when a man is placed between two crimes it is important to give him a sensible interest not to commit the greater it is proper in a word to convert the assassin into a pickpocket that is to say to give him a reason for preferring the crime which can be repaired to that which cannot be repaired everything which can be repaired is nothing everything which may be compensated by a pecuniary forfeiture is almost as nonexistent as if it had never existed for if the injured individual always receive an equivalent compensation the alarm caused by the crime ceases entirely or is reduced to its lowest term the desirable object is that the funds for compensation on account of crimes should be drawn from the mass of delinquents themselves—either from the goods they have acquired or from labour imposed on them if this were the case security would be the inseparable companion of innocence and sorrow and anguish would only be the portion of the disturbers of the social order such is the point of perfection which should be aimed at though there may be no hope of attaining it but by degrees and by continued efforts the goal is pointed out the happiness of reaching it will be the reward of an enlightened and persevering administration during the insufficiency of this source it is proper to draw compensation either from the public treasure or private insurances the imperfection of our laws is very evident under this point of view has a crime been committed those who have suffered by it either in their person or their fortune are abandoned to their evil condition the society which they have contributed to maintain and which ought to protect them owes them however an indemnity when its protection has not been effectual when an individual has prosecuted a criminal at his own expense even in his own cause he is no less a defender of the state than he who fights against foreign enemies the losses he experiences in defending the state ought to be compensated at the public expense but when an innocent person has suffered from an error of the tribunals—when he has been arrested detained rendered suspected condemned to all the anxieties of a trial and a long captivity it is not only on his own account but on account of justice itself that he ought to receive an indemnity instituted for the redress of wrongs is it desirable that the wrongs they perpetrate should be without redress governments have not provided for either of these indemnities in england some voluntary associations have been formed to supply them if the institution of assurance be good in a single case it is good in all under the precautions requisite for the prevention of negligence and fraud the inconvenience of frauds is common to all funds public and private they may diminish the utility of assurances without destroying it shall no fruittrees be cultivated because the crop may be destroyed by   0 a thousand accidents banks of piety have succeeded in many countries an establishment of this kind formed in london in the middle of the past century failed at its commencement from the unfaithfulness of its directors and this robbery has left a prejudice which has hindered all other attempts of this kind according to the same logic it might be proved that ships are bad war machines because the royal george whose portholes were left open sunk whilst at anchor assurances against crimes might have two objects—  to create a fund for the indemnification of parties injured in case the delinquent were unknown or insolvent   to defray in the first instance the expenses of judicial prosecution and might even be extended in favour of the poor to causes purely civil but the method of settling these indemnities would be foreign to the present subject it has been treated of elsewhere i confine myself here to an enunciation of the general result of this work it is that by good laws almost all crimes may be reduced to acts which may be repaired by a simple pecuniary compensation and that when this is the case the evil arising from crimes may be made almost entirely to cease this result simply announced does not at first strike the imagination it is necessary to meditate upon it in order to perceive all its importance and solidity the brilliant society of the world cannot be interested by a formula almost arithmetical it is to statesmen that it is presented as a subject for consideration and it belongs to them to judge of it the science whose foundations we have explored can only please those elevated minds with whom the public good is a passion this is not a subversive and shuffling policy which prides itself upon clandestine projects—which builds its glory upon misfortunes—which beholds the prosperity of one nation in the abasement of another and mistakes the convulsions of government for the conceptions of genius it has reference to the greatest interests of humanity—to the art of forming the manners and characters of nations—to the means of insuring the highest degree of security to individuals—and of deriving results equally advantageous from different forms of government such is the object of this noble and generous political science which seeks only to be known—which desires nothing exclusive—and which knows no more certain method of perpetuating its benefits than sharing them among all the great family of nations  among the various practical reforms suggested by bentham the following are instances in which his views have been partially or wholly adopted by the legislature—reform in the representative system municipal reform in the abolition of exclusive privileges mitigation of the criminal code the abolition of transportation and the adoption of a system of prison discipline adapted to reformation example and economy removal of defects in the jury system abolition of arrest in mesne process substitution of an effectual means of appropriating and realizing a debtors property to the practice of imprisonment abolition of the usury laws abolition of oaths abolition of law taxes and fees in courts of justice removal of the exclusionary rules in evidence repeal of the test and corporation acts the catholic disabilities acts and other laws creating religious inequalities abolition or reduction of the taxes on knowledge a uniform system of poor laws under central administration with machinery for the eradication of mendicancy and idleness a system of training pauper children calculated to raise them from dependent to productive members of society savings banks and friendly societies on a uniform and secure system postage cheap

happiness to the extent of   each or eight people happiness to the extent of   each is the preferable measure the former statement of the principle would leave it doubtful which of the two should be adopted for though the extent of four be but half of that of eight twelve is a greater number than eight by the latter principle the process is simply arithmetic   times   being    and   times    only    the happiness to the extent of   each distributed among eight people is to be preferred like everything else in benthams philosophy it is by its reference to practice and an observation of the extent to which it is acted on that the direction of the argument thus abstractly stated will be observed in cases of distribution the greatest quantity of happiness is produced where the number among which it takes place is the largest and almost all human laws have a tendency more or less strong to prevent individuals from absorbing in their own persons an exorbitant proportion of the elements of happiness at the disposal of the community again on arithmetical principles property in the ordinary case removed from one person and given to another adds a smaller element of happiness to the person who receives it than that which the person deprived of it loses hence the laws for the protection of property and vested rights but the following quotation from a pupil of bentham equally clear in his explanations and happy in his illustrations will make the matter more distinct the latest improvement therefore of the philosopher whose long life has been dedicated to the diffusion of the principle—and of which the present article has to boast of being the announcement and the organ—is to dismiss the superfluous greatest number and declare that the just object of politics and morals is simply the greatest happiness in this manner the magnificent proposition emerges clearly and disentangled from its accessory and the accessory proposition is that the greatest aggregate of happiness must always include the happiness of the greatest number for the greatest number must always be composed of those who individually possess a comparatively small portion of the good things of life and if anything is taken from one of these to give to the others it is plain that what he loses in happiness is greater than what the others gain it is the mathematical assertion that a quantity x is greater in comparison of a small quantity it is taken from than of a large one it is added to it is the avowal that halfacrown is of more consequence to the porter who loses it than to the duke of bedford who should chance to find it—that a chief portion of the baseness of the rich man who seized the poors ewe lamb consisted in taking what caused so much greater pain to the sufferer than happiness to the receiver—colonel thompsons works vol i p     in the deontology there is the following statement on the subject of the authors abbreviation of his axiom— in the later years of mr benthams life the phrase greatest happiness of the greatest number appeared on a closer scrutiny to be wanting in that clearness and correctness which had originally recommended it to his notice and adoption and these are the reasons for his change of opinion given in his own words—  be the community in question what it may divide it into two unequal parts call one of them the majority the other the minority lay out of the account the feelings of the minority include in the account no feelings but those of the majority—you will find that to the aggregate stock of the happiness of the community loss not profit is the result of the operation of this proposition the truth will be the more palpable the greater the ratio of the number of the minority to that of the majority in other words the less the difference between the two unequal parts and suppose the undivided parts equal the quantity of the error will then be at its maximum  number of the majority suppose  00  number of the minority  000 suppose in the first place the stock of happiness in such sort divided that by every one of the  00  an equal portion of happiness shall be possessed take now from every one of the  000 his share of happiness and divide it any how among the  00  instead of augmentation vast is the diminution you will find to be the result the feelings of the minority being by the supposition laid entirely out of the account for such in its enlarged form is the import of the proposition the vacuum thus left may instead of remaining a vacuum be filled with unhappiness positive suffering in magnitude intensity and duration taken together the greatest which it is in the power of human nature to endure  take from your  000 and give to your  00  all the happiness you find your  000 in possession of insert in the room of the happiness you have taken out unhappiness in as large a quantity as the receptacle will contain to the aggregate amount of the happiness possessed by the  00  taken together will the result be net profit on the contrary the whole profit will have given place to loss how so because so it is that such is the nature of the receptacle the quantity of

bentham is behind the knowledge of the present age his works on political economy were almost all written in the   th century is in his views of the incidence of machinery on the wages of labour taking the direct advantages of machinery on the one side—cheapness of production and the command of foreign markets arising out of that cheapness—he deducted from these the loss to labour vol iii pp         he had forgotten to keep in view that of the capital exhausted on handmade and that on machinemade produce it is not a necessary fact that a less proportion of the latter should go in the form of wages of labour than of the former in the case for instance of a certain capital spent on the production of stockings if they are handknit the wages go to the knitter while if they be machinemade the wages go to the miner the smelter the machinemaker c the elements of the prices of commodities are rent of land on which the raw material is produced—wages of labour—and profits of stock these elements will vary in their proportions according to incidental circumstances but it does not follow that they will be necessarily different in the case of handproduce from what they are in the case of machineproduce another discovery of modern science in this department which seems not to have been anticipated by bentham is the fallacy as to the influence of the sinking fund so clearly exposed

happiness principle this principle said wedderburn is a dangerous one saying so he said that which to a certain extent is strictly true a principle which lays down as the only right and justifiable end of government the greatest happiness of the greatest number—how can it be denied to be a dangerous one dangerous it unquestionably is to every government which has for its actual end or object the greatest happiness of a certain one with or without the addition of some comparatively small number of others whom it is matter of pleasure or accommodation to him to admit each of them to a share in the concern on the footing of so many junior partners dangerous it therefore really was to the interest—the sinister interest—of all those functionaries himself included whose interest it was to maximize delay vexation and expense in judicial and other modes of procedure for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense in a government which had for its end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number alexander wedderburn might have been attorney general and then chancellor but he would not have been attorney general with £  000 ayear nor chancellor with a peerage with a veto upon all justice with £  000 ayear and with  00 sinecures at his disposal under the name of ecclesiastical benefices besides et cœteras  asceticism ascetic is a term that has been sometimes applied to monks it comes from a greek word which signifies exercise the practices by which monks sought to distinguish themselves from other men were called their exercises these exercises consisted in so many contrivances they had for tormenting themselves by this they thought to ingratiate themselves with the deity for the deity said they is a being of infinite benevolence now a being of the most ordinary benevolence is pleased to see others make themselves as happy as they can therefore to make ourselves as unhappy as we can is the way to please the deity if any body ask them what motive they could find for doing all this oh said they you are not to imagine that we are punishing ourselves for nothing we know very well what we are about you are to know that for every grain of pain it costs us now we are to have a hundred grains of pleasure by and by the case is that god loves to see us torment ourselves at present indeed he has as good as told us so but this is done only to try us in order just to see how we should behave which it is plain he could not know without making the experiment now then from the satisfaction it gives him to see us make ourselves as unhappy as we can make ourselves in this present life we have a sure proof of the satisfaction it will give him to see us as happy as he can make us in a life to come  so thought anno    0 and     —not so anno     —j bentham  the following note was first printed in january     — it ought rather to have been styled more extensively the principle of caprice where it applies to the choice of actions to be marked out for injunction or prohibition for reward or punishment to stand in a word as subjects for obligations to be imposed it may indeed with propriety be termed as in the text the principle of sympathy and antipathy but this appellative does not so well apply to it when occupied in the choice of the events which are to serve as sources of title with respect to rights where the actions prohibited and allowed the obligations and rights being already fixed the only question is under what circumstances a man is to be invested with the one or subjected to the other from what incidents occasion is to be taken to invest a man or to refuse to invest him with the one or to subject him to the other in this latter case it may more appositely be characterized by the name of the phantastic principle sympathy and antipathy are affections of the sensible faculty but the choice of titles with respect to rights especially with respect to proprietary rights upon grounds unconnected with utility has been in many instances the work not of the affections but of the imagination when in justification of an article of english common law calling uncles to succeed in certain cases in preference to fathers lord coke produced a sort of ponderosity he had discovered in rights disqualifying them from ascending in a straight line it was not that he loved uncles particularly or hated fathers but because the analogy such as it was was what his imagination presented him with instead of a reason and because to a judgment unobservant of the standard of utility or unacquainted with the art of consulting it where affection is out of the way imagination is the only guide when i know not what ingenious grammarian invented the proposition delegatus non potest delegare to serve as a rule of law it was not surely that he had any antipathy to delegates of the second order or that it was any pleasure to him to think of the ruin which for want of a manager at home may befal the affairs of a traveller whom an unforeseen accident has deprived of the object of his choice it was that the incongruity of giving the same law to objects so contrasted as active and passive are was not to be surmounted and that atus chimes as well as it contrasts with are when that inexorable maxim of which the dominion is no more to be defined than the date of its birth or the name of its father is to be found was imported from england for the government of bengal and the whole fabric of judicature was crushed by the thunders of ex post facto justice it was not surely that the prospect of a blameless magistracy perishing in prison afforded any enjoyment to the unoffended authors of their misery but that the music of the maxim absorbing the whole imagination had drowned the cries of humanity along with the dictates of common sensea fiat justitia ruat cælum says another maxim as full of extravagance as it is of harmony go heaven to wreck—so justice be but done—and what is the ruin of kingdoms in comparison of the wreck of heaven so again when the prussian chancellor inspired with the wisdom of i know not what roman sage proclaimed in good latin for the edification of german ears servitus servitutis non datur cod fred tom ii par   liv   tit x §   p  0  it was not that he had conceived any aversion to the lifeholder who during the continuance of his term should wish to gratify a neighbour with a right of way or water or to the neighbour who should wish to accept of the indulgence but that to a jurisprudential ear tus tutis sound little less melodious than atus are whether the melody of the maxim was the real reason of the rule is not left open to dispute for it is ushered in by the conjunction quia reasons appointed harbinger quia servitus servitutis non datur neither would equal melody have been produced nor indeed could similar melody have been called for in either of these instances by the opposite provision it is only when they are opposed to general rules and not when by their conformity they are absorbed in them that more specific ones can obtain a separate existence delegatus potest delegare and servitus servitutis datur provisions already included under the general adoption of contracts would have been as unnecessary to the apprehension and the memory as in comparison of their energetic negatives they are insipid to the ear were the inquiry diligently made it would be found that the goddess of harmony has exercised more influence however latent over the dispensations of themis than her most diligent historiographers or even her most passionate panegyrists seem to have been aware of every one knows how by the ministry of orpheus it was she who first collected the sons of men beneath the shadow of the sceptre yet in the midst of continual experience men seem yet to learn with what successful diligence she has laboured to guide it in its course every one knows that measured numbers were the language of the infancy of law none seem to have observed with what imperious sway they have governed her maturer age in english jurisprudence in particular the connexion betwixt law and music however less perceived than in spartan legislation is not perhaps less real nor less close the music of the office though not of the same kind is not less musical in its kind than the music of the theatre that which hardens the heart than that which softens it—sostenutos as long cadences as sonorous and those governed by rules though not yet promulgated not less determinate search indictments pleadings proceedings in chancery conveyances whatever trespasses you may find against truth and common sense you will find none against the laws of harmony the english liturgy justly as this quality has been extolled in that sacred office possesses not a greater measure of it than is commonly to be found in an english act of parliament dignity simplicity brevity precision intelligibility possibility of being retained or so much as apprehended every thing yields to harmony volumes might be filled shelves loaded with the sacrifices that are made to this insatiate power expletives her ministers in grecian poetry are not less busy though in different shape and bulk in english legislation in the former they are monosyllablesa in the latter they are whole linesb to return to the principle of sympathy and antipathy a term preferred at first on account of its impartiality to the principle of caprice the choice of an appellative in the above respects too narrow was owing to my not having at that time extended my views over the civil branch of law any otherwise than as i had found it inseparably involved in the penal but when we come to the former branch we shall see the phantastic principle making at least as great a figure there as the principle of sympathy and antipathy in the latter in the days of lord coke the light of utility can scarcely be said to have as yet shone upon the face of common law if a faint ray of it under the name of the argumentum ab inconvenienti is to be found in a list of about twenty topics exhibited by that great lawyer as the coordinate leaders of that allperfect system the admission so circumstanced is as sure a proof of neglect as to the statues of brutus and cassius exclusion was a cause of notice it stands neither in the front nor in the rear nor in any post of honour but huddled in towards the middle without the smallest mark of preference coke littleton    a nor is this latin inconvenience by any means the same thing with the english one it stands distinguished from mischief and because by the vulgar it is taken for something less bad it is given by the learned as something worse the law prefers a mischief to an inconvenience says an admired maxim and the more admired because as nothing is expressed by it the more is supposed to be understood not that there is any avowed much less a constant opposition between the prescriptions of utility and the operations of the common law such constancy we have seen to be too much even for ascetic fervor supra par x from time to time instinct would unavoidably betray them into the paths of reason instinct which however it may be cramped can never be killed by education the cobwebs spun out of the materials brought together by the competition of opposite analogies can never have ceased being warped by the silent attraction of the rational principle though it should have been as the needle is to the magnet without the privity of conscience a additional note by the author july     — add and

they have done for ireland with her seven millions of souls the authorised deniers and perverters of justice have done for hindostan with her hundred millions in this there is nothing wonderful the wonder is—that under such institutions men though in ever such small number should be found whom the view of the injustices which by english judgemade law they are compelled to commit and the miseries they are thus compelled to produce deprive of health and rest witness the letter of an english hindostan judge sept        which lies before me i will not make so cruel a requital for his honesty as to put his name in print indeed the house of commons documents already published leave little need of it a μεν τοι γε νυν c b and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that—provided always and it is hereby further enacted and declared that—c c  it is curious enough to observe the variety of inventions men have hit upon and the variety of phrases they have brought forward in order to conceal from the world and if possible from themselves this very general and therefore very pardonable selfsufficiency   one man lord shaftesbury hutchinson hume c says he has a thing made on purpose to tell him what is right and what is wrong and that it is called a moral sense and then he goes to work at his ease and says such a thing is right and such a thing is wrong—why because my moral sense tells me it is   another man dr beattie comes and alters the phrase leaving out moral and putting in common in the room of it he then tells you that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong as surely as the others moral sense did meaning by common sense a sense of some kind or other which he says is possessed by all mankind the sense of those whose sense is not the same as the authors being struck out of the account as not worth taking this contrivance does better than the other for a moral sense being a new thing a man may feel about him a good while without being able to find it out but common sense is as old as the creation and there is no man but would be ashamed to be thought not to have as much of it as his neighbours it has another great advantage by appearing to share power it lessens envy for when a man gets up upon this ground in order to anathematize those who differ from him it is not by a sic volo sic jubeo but by a velitis jubeatis   another man dr price comes and says that as to a moral sense indeed he cannot find that he has any such thing that however he has an understanding which will do quite as well this understanding he says is the standard of right and wrong it tells him so and so all good and wise men understand as he does if other mens understandings differ in any point from his so much the worse for them it is a sure sign they are either defective or corrupt   another man says that here is an eternal and immutable rule of right that that rule of right dictates so and so and then he begins giving you his sentiments upon any thing that comes uppermost and these sentiments you are to take for granted are so many branches of the eternal rule of right   another man dr clark or perhaps the same man its no matter says that there are certain practices conformable and others repugnant to the fitness of things and then he tells you at his leisure what practices are conformable and what repugnant just as he happens to like a practice or dislike it   a great multitude of people are continually talking of the law of nature and then they go on giving you their sentiments about what is right and what is wrong and these sentiments you are to understand are so many chapters and sections of the law of nature   instead of the phrase law of nature you have sometimes law of reason right reason natural justice natural equity good order any of them will do equally well this latter is most used in politics the three last are much more tolerable than the others because they do not very explicitly claim to be any thing more than phrases they insist but feebly upon the being looked upon as so many positive standards of themselves and seem content to be taken upon occasion for phrases expressive of the conformity of the thing in question to the proper standard whatever that may be on most occasions however it will be better to say utility utility is clearer as referring more explicitly to pain and pleasure   we have one philosopher woolaston who says there is no harm in any thing in the world but in telling a lie and that if for example you were to murder your own father this would only be a particular way of saying he was not your father of course when this philosopher sees any thing that he does not like he says it is a particular way of telling a lie it is saying that the act ought to be done or may be done when in truth it ought not to be done   the fairest and openest of them all is that sort of man who speaks out and says i am of the number of the elect now god himself takes care to inform the elect what is right and that with so good effect that let them strive ever so they cannot help not only knowing it but practising it if therefore a man wants to know what is right and what is wrong he has nothing to do but come to me it is upon the principle of antipathy that such and such acts are often reprobated on the score of their being unnatural the practice of exposing children established among the greeks and romans was an unnatural practice unnatural when it means any thing means unfrequent and there it means something although nothing to the present purpose but here it means no such thing for the frequency of such acts is perhaps the great complaint it therefore means nothing nothing i mean which there is in the act itself all it can serve to express is the disposition of the person who is talking of it the disposition he is in to be angry at the thoughts of it does it merit his anger very likely it may but whether it does or no is a question which to be answered rightly can only be answered upon the principle of utility unnatural is as good a word as moral sense or common sense and would be as good a foundation for a system such an act is unnatural that is repugnant to nature for i do not like to practise it and consequently do not practise it it is therefore repugnant to what ought to be the nature of every body else the mischief common to all these ways of thinking and arguing which in truth as we have seen are but one and the same method couched in different forms of words is their serving as a cloke and pretence and aliment to despotism if not a despotism in practice a despotism however in disposition which is but too apt when pretence and power offer to show itself in practice the consequence is that with intentions very commonly of the purest kind a man becomes a torment either to himself or his fellowcreatures if he be of the melancholy cast dr price he sits in silent grief bewailing their blindness and depravity if of the irascible dr beattie he declaims with fury and virulence against all who differ from him blowing up the coals of fanaticism and branding with the charge of corruption and insincerity every man who does not think or profess to think as he does if such a man happens to possess the advantages of style his book may do a considerable deal of mischief before the nothingness of it is understood these principles if such they can be called it is more frequent to see applied to morals than to politics but their influence extends itself to both in politics as well as morals a man will be at least equally glad of a pretence for deciding any question in the manner that best pleases him without the trouble of inquiry if a man is an infallible judge of what is right and wrong in the actions of private individuals why not in the measures to be observed by public men in the direction of those actions accordingly not to mention other chimeras i have more than once known the pretended law of nature set up in legislative debates in opposition to arguments derived from the principle of utility but is it never then from any other considerations than those of utility that we derive our notions of right and wrong i do not know i do not care whether a moral sentiment can be originally conceived from any other source than a view of utility is one question whether upon examination and reflection it can in point of fact be actually persisted in and justified on any other ground by a person reflecting within himself is another whether in point of right it can properly be justified on any other ground by a person addressing himself to the community is a third the two first are questions of speculation it matters not comparatively speaking how they are decided the last is a question of practice the decision of it is of as much importance as that of any can be i feel in myself say you a disposition to approve of such or such an action in a moral view but this is not owing to any notions i have of its being a useful one to the community i do not pretend to know whether it be an useful one or not it may be for aught i know a mischievous one but is it then say i a mischievous one examine and if you can make yourself sensible that it is so then if duty means any thing that is moral duty it is your duty at least to abstain from it and more than that if it is what lies in your power and can be done without too great a sacrifice to endeavour to prevent it it is not your cherishing the notion of it in your bosom and giving it the name of virtue that will excuse you i feel in myself say you again a disposition to detest such or such an action in a moral view but this is not owing to any notions i have of its being a mischievous one to the community i do not pretend to know whether it be a mischievous one or not it may be not a mischievous one it may be for aught i know an useful one—may it indeed say i an useful one but let me tell you then that unless duty and right and wrong be just what you please to make them if it really be not a mischievous one and any body has a mind to do it it is no duty of yours but on the contrary it would be very wrong in you to take upon you to prevent him detest it within yourself as much as you please that may be a very good reason unless it be also a useful one for your not doing it yourself but if you go about by word or deed to do any thing to hinder him or make him suffer for it it is you and not he that have done wrong it is not your setting yourself to blame his conduct or branding it with the name of vice that will make him culpable or you blameless therefore if you can make yourself content that he shall be of one mind and you of another about that matter and so continue it is well but if nothing will serve you but that you and he must needs be of the same mind ill tell you what you have to do it is for you to get the better of your antipathy not for him to truckle to it  king james the first of england had conceived a violent antipathy against arians two of whom he burnta this gratification he procured himself without much difficulty the notions of the times were favourable to it he wrote a furious book against vorstius for being what was called an arminian for vorstius was at a distance he also wrote a furious book called a counterblast to tobacco against the use of that drug which sir walter raleigh had then lately introduced had the notions of the times cooperated with him he would have burnt the anabaptist and the smoker of tobacco in the same fire however he had the satisfaction

grammatical transition any thing which serves to bind a man to wit to the observance of such or such a mode of conduct according to a latin grammariana the import of the word is derived by rather a farfetched process such as those commonly are and in a great measure indeed must be by which intellectual ideas are derived from sensible ones from the word sanguis blood because among the romans with a view to inculcate into the people a persuasion that such or such a mode of conduct would be rendered obligatory upon a man by the force of what i call the religious sanction that is that he would be made to suffer by the extraordinary interposition of some superior being if he failed to observe the mode of conduct in question certain ceremonies were contrived by the priests in the course of which ceremonies the blood of victims was made use of a sanction then is a source of obligatory powers or motives that is of pains and pleasures which according as they are connected with such or such modes

simple pleasures and pains of which human nature is susceptible insomuch that if upon any occasion whatsoever a man feels pleasure or pain it is either referable at once to some one or other of these kinds or resolvable into such as are it might perhaps have been a satisfaction to the reader to have seen an analytical view of the subject taken upon an exhaustive plan for the purpose of demonstrating the catalogue to be what it purports to be a complete one the catalogue is in fact the result of such an analysis which however i thought it better to discard at present as being of too metaphysical a cast and not strictly within the limits of this design see ch xv cases unmeet par   note  there are also pleasures of novelty excited by the appearance of new ideas these are pleasures of the imagination see infra xiii † for instance the pleasure of being able to gratify the sense of hearing by singing or performing upon any musical instrument the pleasure thus obtained is a thing superadded to and perfectly distinguishable from that which a man enjoys from hearing another person perform in the same nanner ‡ see ch iii sanctions ∥ see ch iii sanctions  in contradistinction to these all other pleasures may be termed pleasures of enjoyment † the pleasure of the sexual sense seems to have no positive pain to correspond to it it has only a pain of privation or pain of the mental class the pain of unsatisfied desire if any positive pain of body result from the want of such indulgence it belongs to the head of pains of disease ‡ the pleasures of novelty have no positive pains corresponding to them the pain which a man experiences when he is in the condition of not knowing what to do with himself that pain which in french is expressed by a single word ennui is a pain of privation a pain resulting from the absence not only of all the pleasures of novelty but of all kinds of pleasure whatsoever the pleasures of wealth have also no positive pains corresponding to them the only pains opposed to them are pains of privation if any positive pains result from the want of wealth they are referable to some other class of positive pains principally to those of the senses from the want of food for instance result the pains of hunger from the want of clothing the pains of cold and so forth  it may be a question perhaps whether this be a positive pain of itself or whether it be nothing more than a pain of privation resulting from the consciousness of a want of skill it is however but a question of words nor does it matter which way it be determined † in as far as a mans fellowcreatures are supposed to be determined by any event not to regard him with any degree of esteem or good will or to regard him with a less degree of esteem or good will than they would otherwise not to do him any sorts of good offices or not to do him so many good offices as they would otherwise the pain resulting from such consideration may be reckoned a pain of privation as far as they are supposed to regard him with such a degree of aversion or disesteem as to be disposed to do him positive ill offices it may be reckoned a positive pain the pain of privation and the positive pain in this case run one into another indistinguishably ‡ there seem to be no positive pains to correspond to the pleasures of power the pains that a man may feel from the want or the loss of power in as far as power is distinguished from all other sources of pleasure seem to be nothing more than pains of privation ∥ the positive pains of piety and the pains of privation opposed to the pleasures of piety run one into another in the same manner as the positive pains of enmity or of an ill name do with respect to the pains of privation opposed to the pleasures of amity and those of a good name if what is apprehended at the hands of god is barely the not receiving pleasure the pain is of the privative class if moreover actual pain be apprehended it is of the class of positive pains § in contradistinction to these all other pains may be termed pains of sufferance  see chap x motives † by this means the pleasures and pains of amity may be the more clearly distinguished from those of benevolence and on the other hand those of enmity from those of malevolence the pleasures and pains of amity and enmity are of the selfregarding cast those of benevolence and malevolence of the extraregarding ‡ it would be a matter not only of curiosity but of some use to exhibit a catalogue of the several complex pleasures and pains analyzing them at the same time into the several simple ones of which they are respectively composed but such a disquisition would take up too much room to be admitted here a short specimen however for the purpose of illustration can hardly be dispensed with the pleasures taken in at the eye and ear are generally very complex the pleasures of a country scene for instance consist commonly amongst others of the following pleasures i pleasures of the senses   the simple pleasure of sight excited by the perception of agreeable colours and figures green fields waving foliage glistening water and the like   the simple pleasure of the ear excited by the perceptions of the chirping of birds the murmuring of waters the rustling of the wind among the trees   the pleasures of the smell excited by the perceptions of the fragrance of flowers of newmown hay or other vegetable substances in the first stages of fermentation   the agreeable inward sensation produced by a brisk circulation of the blood and the ventilation of it in the lungs by a pure air such as that in the country frequently is in comparison of that which is breathed in towns ii pleasures of the imagination produced by association   the idea of the plenty resulting from the possession of the objects that are in view and of the happiness arising from it   the idea of the innocence and happiness of the birds sheep cattle dogs and other gentle or domestic animals   the idea of the constant flow of health supposed to be enjoyed by all these creatures a notion which is apt to result from the occasional flow of health enjoyed by the supposed spectator   the idea of gratitude excited by the contemplation of the allpowerful and beneficent being who is looked up to as the author of these blessings these four last are all of them in some measure at least pleasures of sympathy the depriving a man of this group of pleasures is one of the evils apt to result from imprisonment whether produced by illegal violence or in the way of punishment by appointment of the laws  the exciting cause the pleasure or pain produced by it and the intention produced by such pleasure or pain in the character of a motive are objects so intimately connected that in what follows i fear i have not on every occasion been able to keep them sufficiently distinct i thought it necessary to give the reader this warning after which should there be found any such mistakes it is to be hoped they will not be productive of much confusion † thus in physical bodies the momentum of a ball put in motion by impulse will be influenced by the circumstance of gravity being in some directions increased in others diminished by it so in a ship put in motion by the wind the momentum and direction will be influenced not only by the attraction of gravity but by the motion and resistance of the water and several other circumstances ‡ an analytical view of all these circumstances will be given at the conclusion of the chapter to which place it was necessary to refer it as it could not well

must confine myself to dry and general instruction discarding illustration although sensible that without it instruction cannot manifest half its efficacy the subject however is so difficult and so new that i shall think i have not ill succeeded if without pretending to exhaust it i shall have been able to mark out the principal points of view and to put the matter in such a method as may facilitate the researches of happier inquirers the great difficulty lies in the nature of the words which are not like pain and pleasure names of homogeneous real entities but names of various fictitious entities for which no common genus is to be found and which therefore without a vast and roundabout chain of investigation can never be brought under any exhaustive plan of arrangement but must be picked up here and there as they happen to occur ∥ it may be thought that in a certain degree of health this negative account of the matter hardly comes up to the case in a certain degree of health there is often such a kind of feeling diffused over the whole frame such a comfortable feel or flow of spirits as it is called as may with propriety come under the head of positive pleasure but without experiencing any such pleasurable feeling if a man experience no painful one he may be well enough said to be in health  the most accurate measure that can be given of a mans strength seems to be that which is taken from the weight or number of pounds and ounces he can lift with his hands in a given attitude this indeed relates immediately only to his arms but these are the organs of strength which are most employed of which the strength corresponds with most exactness to the general state of the body with regard to strength and in which the quantum of strength is easiest measured strength may accordingly be distinguished into general and particular weakness is a negative term and imports the absence of strength it is besides a relative term and accordingly imports the absence of such a quantity of strength as makes the share possessed by the person in question less than that of some person he is compared to weakness when it is at such a degree as to make it painful for a man to perform the motions necessary to the going through the ordinary functions of life such as to get up to walk to dress ones self and so forth brings the circumstance of health into question and

which children grow tired of their playthings and throw them away is an instance of unsteadiness the perseverance with which a merchant applies himself to his traffic or an author to his book may be taken for an instance of the contrary it is difficult to judge of the quantity of pleasure or pain in these cases but from the effects which it produces in the character of a motive and even then it is difficult to pronounce whether the change of conduct happens by the extinction of the old pleasure or pain or by the intervention of a new one  see ch v pleasures and pains  see ch v pleasures and pains  this is one reason why legislators in general like better to have married people to deal with than single and people that have children than such as are childless it is manifest that the stronger and more numerous a mans connexions in the way of sympathy are the stronger is the hold which the law has upon him a wife and children are so many pledges a man gives to the world for his good behaviour  the characteristic circumstances whereby one mans frame of body or mind considered at any given period stands distinguished from that of another have been comprised by metaphysicians and physiologists under the name idiosyncrasy from διος peculiar and συνϰϱασις composition † those who maintain that the mind and the body are one substance may here object that upon that supposition the distinction between frame of mind and frame of body is but nominal and that accordingly there is no such thing as a frame of mind distinct from the frame of body but granting for argumentsake the antecedent we may dispute the consequence for if the mind be but a part of the body it is at any rate of a nature very different from the other parts of the body a mans frame of body cannot in any part of it undergo any considerable alteration without its being immediately indicated by phænomena discernible by the senses a mans frame of mind may undergo very considerable alterations his frame of body remaining the same to all appearance that is for any thing that is indicated to the contrary by phenomena cognizable to the senses meaning those of other men ‡ humes hist ∥ the quantity of the sort of pain which is called grief is indeed hardly to be measured by any external indications it is neither to be measured for instance by the quantity of the tears nor by the number of moments spent in crying indications rather less equivocal may perhaps be afforded by the pulse a man has not the motions of his heart at command as he has those of the muscles of his face but the particular significancy of these indications is still very uncertain all they can express is that the man is affected they cannot express in what manner nor from what cause to an affection resulting in reality from such or such a cause he may give an artificial colouring and attribute it to such or such another cause to an affection directed in reality to such or such a person as its object he may give an artificial bias and represent it as if directed to such or such another object tears of rage he may attribute to contrition the concern he feels at the thoughts of a punishment that awaits him he may impute to a sympathetic concern for the mischief produced by his offence a very tolerable judgment however may commonly be formed by a discerning mind upon laying all the external indications exhibited by a man together and at the same time comparing them with his actions a remarkable instance of the power of the will over the external indications of sensibility is to be found in tacituss story of the roman soldier who raised a mutiny in the camp pretending to have lost a brother by the lawless cruelty of the general the truth was he never had had a brother  upon reflection i seem to have overlooked in the chapter on circumstances influencing sensibility the circumstance of the face or rather texture of the country that being a circumstance which the purpose for which i was then considering the subject did not necessarily bring to view had i strictly pursued the exhaustive plan this oversight would probably not have happened the article which comes nearest is that of climate but the word climate will scarcely with propriety serve to bring to view that of the texture of the country the word climate denotes primarily the situation or inclination of the part of the earth in question with reference to the part marked out by that planet in its orbit round the sun and thence derivatively the degree of heat which during a given period is excited in that part it may thence again serve to bring to view the state of the air in respect to density purity and dryness or moisture but the evenness or unevenness of the surface of the earth with its elevation or depression the proportion between earth and water in any given spot and the quality of each these are particulars which can not properly be referable any of them to the head of climate it is evident that the circumstances comprehended under the head of texture of the earth may have an influence on those which in a secondary manner are included under the head of climate the density of the air its dryness and moistness and the temperature of the atmosphere and the earth together in respect of heat and cold depend for the most part on the elevation or depression of the earths surface the proportion between earth and water and quality of both these elements but the texture of the earth does not except in as far as it influences the climate exert any direct influence on the state and condition of the men themselves who are its inhabitants it exerts indeed partly through the medium of climate and partly by its own immediate efficacy an influence over the vegetables and animals which are of a nature to be either of use or detriment to man and thence again by another channel over the state and condition of man himself it was the remoteness of this latter influence which is exerted by the texture of the earth upon man that was the reason of its being overlooked on the occasion before mentioned  the ways in which a religion may lessen a mans means or augment his wants are various

in general so does the profit he makes from the occupation which furnishes him with the means of livelihood but the occupation itself concerns his own person and comes under the same head as his habitual amusements as likewise his habits of expense his connexions in the ways of profit and of burthen under the same head as his connexions in the way of sympathy and the circumstances of his

offences and sometimes makes a material difference with regard to their consequences to reconcile us the better to the extensive and as it may appear on some occasions the inconsistent signification here given to the word act it may be considered   that in many cases where no exterior or overt act is exercised the state which the mind is in at the time when the supposed act is said to happen is as truly and directly the result of the will as any exterior act how plain and conspicuous soever the not revealing a conspiracy for instance may be as perfectly the act of the will as the joining in it in the next place that even though the mind should never have had the incident in question in contemplation insomuch that the event of its not happening should not have been so much as obliquely intentional still the state the persons mind was in at the time when if he had so willed the incident might have happened is in many cases productive of as material consequences and not only as likely but as fit to call for the interposition of other agents as the opposite one thus when a tax is imposed your not paying it is an act which at any rate must be punished in a certain manner whether you happened to think of paying it or not † exterior an exterior act is also called by lawyers overt ‡ the distinction is well known to the later grammarians it is with them indeed that it took its rise

agency is concerned if therefore it be just and useful here it might be found not impossible perhaps to find some use for it in natural philosophy ¶ on this occasion the words voluntary and involuntary are commonly employed these however i purposely abstain from on account of the extreme ambiguity of their signification by a voluntary act is meant sometimes any act in the performance of which the will has had any concern at all in this sense it is synonymous to intentional sometimes such acts only in the production of which the will has been determined by motives not of a painful nature in this sense it is synonymous to unconstrained or uncoerced sometimes such acts only in the production of which the will has been determined by motives which whether of the pleasurable or painful kind occurred to a man himself without being suggested by any body else in this sense it is synonymous to spontaneous the sense of the word involuntary does not correspond completely to that of the word voluntary involuntary is used in opposition to intentional and to unconstrained but not to spontaneous it might be of use to confine the signification of the words voluntary and involuntary to one single and very narrow case which will be mentioned in the next note  to render the analysis here given of the possible states of the mind in point of intentionality absolutely complete it must be pushed to such a farther degree of minuteness as to some eyes will be apt to appear trifling on this account it seemed advisable to discard what follows from the text to a place where any one who thinks proper may pass by it an act of the body when of the positive kind is a motion now in motion there are always three articles to be considered   the quantity of matter that moves   the direction in which it moves and   the velocity with which it moves correspondent to these three arictles are so many modes of intentionality with regard to an act considered as being only in its first stage to be completely unintentional it must be unintentional with respect to every one of these three particulars this is the case with those acts which alone are properly termed involuntary acts in the performance of which the will has no sort of share such as the contraction of the heart and arteries upon this principle acts that are unintentional in their first stage may be distinguished into such as are completely unintentional and such as are incompletely unintentional and these again may be unintentional either in point of quantity of matter alone in point of direction alone in point of velocity alone or in any two of these points together the example given further on may easily be extended to this part of the analysis by any one who thinks it worth the while there seem to be occasions in which even these disquisitions minute as they may appear may not be without their use in practice in the case of homicide for example and other corporal injuries all the distinctions here specified may occur and in the course of trial may for some purpose or other require to be brought to mind and made the subject of discourse what may contribute to render the mention of them pardonable is the use that might possibly be made of them in natural philosophy in the hands of an expert metaphysician these together with the foregoing chapter on human actions and the section on facts in general in title evidence of the book of procedure might perhaps be made to contribute something towards an exhaustive analysis of the possible varieties of mechanical inventions † or concurrently ‡ there is a difference between the case where an incident is altogether unintentional and that in which it being disjunctively intentional with reference to another the preference is in favour of that other in the first case it is not the intention of the party that the incident in question should happen at all in the latter case the intention is rather that the other should happen but if that cannot be then that this in question should happen rather than that neither should and that both at any rate should not happen all these are distinctions to be attended

notes and observations london      hunter st pauls church yard  vo pp    the word inducement has of late presented itself as being in its signification more comprehensive than the word motive and on some occasions more apposite ¶ when the effect or tendency of a motive is to determine a man to forbear to act it may seem improper to make use of the term motive since motive properly speaking means that which disposes an object to move we must however use that improper term or a term which though proper enough is scarce in use the word determinative by way of justification or at least apology for the popular usage in this behalf it may be observed that even forbearance to act or the negation of motion that is of bodily motion supposes an act done when such forbearance is voluntary it supposes to wit an act of the will which is as much a positive act as much a motion as any other act of the thinking substance  whether it be the expectation of being burnt or the pain that accompanies that expectation that is the immediate internal motive spoken of may be difficult to determine it may even be questioned perhaps whether they are distinct entities both questions however seem to be mere questions of words and the solution of them altogether immaterial even the other kinds of motives though for some purposes they demand a separate consideration are however so intimately allied that it will often be scarce practicable and not always material to avoid confounding them as they have always hitherto been confounded † under the term esse must be included as well past existence with reference to a given period as present they are equally real in comparison with what is as yet but future language is materially deficient in not enabling us to distinguish with

and helvetius to the unsoundness of their opinions and with still greater injustice to the corruption of their hearts was often imputed what was most commonly owing either to a want of skill in matters of language on the part of the author or a want of discernment possibly now and then in some instances a want of probity on the part of the commentator ‡ happily language is not always so intractable but that by making use of two words instead of one a man may avoid the inconvenience of fabricating words that are absolutely new thus instead of the word lust by putting together two words in common use he may frame the neutral expression sexual desire instead of the word avarice by putting together two other words also in common use he may frame the neutral expression pecuniary interest this accordingly is the course which i have taken in these instances indeed even the combination is not novel the only novelty there is consists in the steady adherence to the one neutral expression rejecting altogether the terms of which the import is infected by adventitious and unsuitable ideas in the catalogue of motives corresponding to the several sorts of pains and pleasures i have inserted such as have occurred to me i cannot pretend to warrant it complete to make sure of rendering it so the only way would be to turn over the dictionary from beginning to end an operation which in a view to perfection would be necessary for more purposes than this see b i tit defamation and append tit composition ∥ hunger and thirst considered in the light of motives import not so much the desire of a particular kind of pleasure as the desire of removing a positive kind of pain they do not extend to the desire of that kind of pleasure which depends on the choice of foods and liquors  it will not be worth while in every case to give an instance in which the action may be indifferent if good as well as bad actions may result from the same motive it is easy to conceive that also may be indifferent † love indeed includes sometimes this idea but then it can never answer the purpose of exhibiting it separately since there are three motives at least that may all of them be included in it besides this the love of beauty corresponding to the pleasures of the eye and the motives corresponding to those of amity and benevolence we speak of the love of children of the love of parents of the love of god these pious uses protect the appellation and preserve it from the ignominy poured forth upon its profane associates even sensual love would not answer the purpose since that would include the love of beauty  see chap vi pleasures and pains par    note † a mans bearing an affront patiently that is without taking this method of doing what is called wiping it off is thought to import one or other of two things either that he does not possess that sensibility to the pleasures and pains of the moral sanction which in order to render himself a respectable member of society a man ought to possess or that he does not possess courage enough to stake his life for the chance of gratifying that resentment which a proper sense of the value of those pleasures and those pains it is thought would not fail to inspire true it is that there are divers other motives by any of which the same conduct might equally be produced the motives corresponding to the religious sanction and the motives that come under the head of benevolence piety towards god the practice in question being generally looked upon as repugnant to the dictates of the religious sanction sympathy for your antagonist himself whose life would be put to hazard at the same time with your own sympathy for his connexions the persons who are dependent on him in the way of support or connected with him in the way of sympathy sympathy for your own connexions and even sympathy for the public in cases where the man is such that the public appears to have a material interest in his life but in comparison with the love of life the influence of the religious sanction is known to be in general but weak especially among people of those classes who are here in question a sure proof of which is the prevalence of this very custom where it is so strong as to preponderate it is so rare that perhaps it gives a man a place in the calendar and at any rate exalts him to the rank of martyr moreover the instances in which either private benevolence or public spirit predominate over the love of life will also naturally be but rare and owing to the general propensity to detraction it will also be much rarer for them to be thought to do so now when three or more motives any one of them capable of producing a given mode of conduct apply at once that which appears to be the most powerful is that which will of course be deemed to have actually done the most and as the bulk of mankind on this as on other occasions are disposed to decide peremptorily upon superficial estimates it will generally be looked upon as having done the whole the consequence is that when a man of a certain rank forbears to take this chance of revenging an affront his conduct will by most people be imputed to the love of life which when it predominates over the love of reputation is by a not unsalutary association or ideas stigmatized with the reproachful name of cowardice  i am aware or at least i hope that people in general when they see the matter thus stated will be ready to acknowledge that the motive in these cases whatever be the tendency of the acts which it produces is not a bad one but this will not render it the less true that hitherto in popular discourse it has been common for men to speak of acts which they could not but acknowledge to have originated from this source as proceeding from a bad motive the same observation will apply to many of the other cases  among the greeks perhaps the motive and the conduct it gave birth to would in such a case have been rather approved than disapproved of it seems to have been deemed an act of heroism on the part of hercules to have delivered his friend theseus from hell though divine justice which held him there should naturally have been regarded as being at least upon a footing with human justice but to divine justice even when acknowledged under that character the respect paid at that time of day does not seem to have been very profound or wellsettled at present the respect paid to it is profound and settled enough though the name of it is but too often applied to dictates which could have had no other origin than the worst sort of human caprice † here as elsewhere it may be observed that the same words which are mentioned as names of motives are also many of them names of passions appetites and affections fictitious entities which are framed only by considering pleasures or pains in some particular point of view some of them are also names of moral qualities this branch of nomenclature is remarkably entangled to unravel it completely

that if they be they will not be referred to that class by others afraid of being taken for a dupe and anxious to show the reach of his penetration each man takes care in the first place to impute the conduct of every other man to the least laudable of the motives that can account for it in the next place when he has gone as far that way as he can and cannot drive down the individual motive to any

speak of prosecutions undertaken from public spirit which is a branch as we have seena of the principle of benevolence far be it from me to deny but that such a principle may very frequently be an ingredient in the sum of motives by which men are engaged in a proceeding of this nature but whenever such a proceeding is engaged in from the sole influence of public spirit uncombined with the least tincture of selfinterest or illwill it must be acknowledged to be a proceeding of the heroic kind now acts of heroism are in the very essence of them but rare for if they were common they would not be

less loves money accordingly although a man by his quarrelsomeness should for once have been engaged in a bad action he may nevertheless remain a long while or even his whole lifetime without engaging in another bad action of the same kind for he may very well remain his whole lifetime without engaging in so violent a quarrel nor at any rate will he quarrel with more than one or a few people at a time but if a man by his love of money has once been engaged in a bad action such as a scheme of robbery he may at any time by the influence of the same motive be engaged in acts of the same degree of

nature of each and of its advantages and disadvantages and various other disquisitions which did not seem absolutely necessary to be inserted here a very few words however concerning the ends of punishment can scarcely be dispensed with the immediate principal end of punishment is to controul action this action is either that of the offender or of others that of the offender it controuls by its influence either on his will in which case it is said to operate in the way of reformation or on his physical power in which case it is said to operate by disablement that of others it can influence no otherwise than by its influence over their wills in which case it is said to operate in the way of example a kind of collateral end which it has a natural tendency to answer is that of affording a pleasure or satisfaction to the party injured where there is one and in general to parties whose illwill whether on a selfregarding account or on the account of sympathy or antipathy has been excited by the offence this purpose as far as it can be answered gratis is a beneficial one but no punishment ought to be allotted merely to this purpose because setting aside its effects in the way of controul no such pleasure is ever produced by punishment as can be equivalent to the pain the punishment however which is allotted to the other purpose ought as far as it can be done without expense to be accommodated to this satisfaction thus administered to a party injured in the shape of a dissocial pleasureb may be styled a vindictive satisfaction or compensation as a compensation

one is to enable men to understand the things that are the subjects of it to understand a thing is to be acquainted with its qualities or properties of these properties some are common to it with other things the rest peculiar but the qualities which are peculiar to any one sort of thing are few indeed in comparison with those which are common to it with other things to make it known in respect of its difference would therefore be doing little unless it were made known also by its genus to understand it perfectly a man must therefore be informed of the points in which it agrees as well as of those in which it disagrees with all other things when a number of objects composing a logical whole are to be considered together all of these possessing with respect to one another a certain congruency or agreement denoted by a certain name there is but one way of giving a perfect knowledge of their nature and that is by distributing them into a system of parcels each of them a part either of some other parcel or at any rate of the common whole this can only be done in the way of bipartition dividing each superior branch into two and but two immediately subordinate ones beginning with the logical whole dividing that into two parts then each of those parts into two others and so on these firstdistinguished parts agree in respect of those properties which belong to the whole they differ in respect of those properties which are peculiar to each to divide the whole into more than two parcels at once for example into three would not answer the purpose for in fact it is but two objects that the mind can compare together exactly at the same time thus then let us endeavour to deal with offences or rather strictly speaking with acts which possess such properties as seem to indicate them fit to be constituted offences the task is arduous and as yet at least perhaps for ever above our force there is no speaking of objects but by their names but the business of giving them names has always been prior to the true and perfect knowledge of their natures objects the most dissimilar have been spoken of and treated as if their properties were the same objects the most similar have been spoken of and treated as if they had scarce any thing in common whatever discoveries may be made concerning them how different soever their real congruencies and disagreements may be found to be from those which are indicated by their names it is not without the utmost difficulty that any means can be found out of expressing those discoveries by other more apposite denominations change the import of the old names and you are in perpetual danger of being misunderstood introduce an entire new set of names and you are sure not to be understood at all complete success then is as yet at least unattainable but an attempt though imperfect may have its use and at the worst it may accelerate the arrival of that perfect system the possession of which will be the happiness of some

into genera correspondent and collateral to the several genera distinguished by other appellations they may be considered as so may specific differences respectively applicable to those genera thus in the case of a simple personal injury in the operation of which a plan of falsehood has been employed it seems more simple and more natural to consider the offence thus committed as a particular species or modification of the genus of offence termed a simple personal injury than to consider the simple personal injury when effected by such means as a modification of the division of offences entitled offences through falsehood by this means the circumstances of the intervention of falsehood as an instrument and of the existence of a particular obligation of the nature of a trust will be reduced to a par with various other classes of circumstances capable of affording grounds of modification commonly of aggravation or extenuation to various genera of offences instance premeditation and conspiracy on the one hand provocation received and intoxication on the other this class will appear but too plainly as a kind of botch in comparison of the rest but such is the fate of science and more particularly of the moral branch the distribution of things must in a great measure be dependent on their names arrangement the work of mature reflection must be ruled by nomenclature the work of popular caprice in the book of the laws offences must therefore be treated of as much as possible under their accustomed names generical terms which are in continual use and which express ideas for which there are no other terms in use cannot safely be discarded when any such occur which cannot be brought to quadrate with such a plan of classification as appears to be most convenient upon the whole what then is to be done there seems to be but one thing which is to retain them and annex them to the regular part of the system in the form of an appendix though they cannot when entire be made to rank under any of the classes established in the rest of the system the divisions to which they give title may be broken down into lesser divisions which may not be alike intractable by this means how discordant soever with the rest of the system they may appear to be at first sight on a closer inspection they may be found conformable this must inevitably be the case with the names of offences which are so various and universal in their nature as to be capable each of them of doing whatever mischief can be done by any other kind or kinds of offences whatsoever offences of this description may well be called anomalous such offences it is plain cannot but shew themselves equally intractable under every kind of system upon whatever principle the system be constructed they cannot any of them with any degree of propriety be confined to any one division if therefore they constitute a blemish in the present system it is such a blemish as could not be avoided but at the expense of a greater the class they are here thrown into will traverse in its subordinate ramifications the other classes and divisions of the present system true but so would they of any other an irregularity and that but a superficial one is a less evil than continual error and contradiction but even this slight deviation which the fashion of language seemed to render unavoidable at the outset we shall soon find occasion to correct as we advance for though the first great parcels into which the offences of this class are divided are not referable any of them to any of the former classes yet the subsequent lesser subdivisions arc  see ch vii actions par   and    if by reason of the word relation this part of the division should appear obscure the unknown term may be got rid of in the following manner our ideas are derived all of them from the senses pleasurable and painful ones therefore among the rest consequently from the operation of sensible objects upon our senses a mans happiness then may be said to depend more or less upon the relation he bears to any sensible object when such subject is in a way that stands a chance greater or less of producing to him or averting from him pain or pleasure now this if at all it must do in one or other of two ways   in an active way properly so called viz by motion or   in a passive or quiescent way by being moved to or acted upon and in either case either   in an immediate way by acting upon or being acted on by the organs of sense without the intervention of any other external object or   in a more or less remote way by acting upon or being acted on by some other external object which with the intervention of a greater or less number of such objects and at the end of more or less considerable intervals of time will come at length to act upon or be acted upon by those organs and this is equally true whether the external objects in question be things or persons it is also equally true of pains and pleasures of the mind as of those of the body all the difference is that in the production of these the pleasure or pain may result immediately from the perception which it accompanies in the production of those of the mind it cannot result from the action of an object of sense any otherwise than by association to wit by means of some connexion which the perception has contracted with certain prior ones

adversaries give force enough to robbery and it swells into rebellion give permanence enough to rebellion and it settles into hostility ∥ it must be confessed that in common speech the distinction here established between the public wealth and the national wealth is but indifferently settled nor is this to be wondered at the ideas themselves though here necessary to be distinguished being so frequently convertible but i am mistaken if the language will furnish any other two words that would express the distinction better those in question will i imagine be allowed to be thus far well chosen that if they were made to change their places the import given to them would not appear to be quite so proper as that which is given to them as they stand at present  i should have been afraid to have said necessarily in the united provinces in the helvetic or even in the germanic body where is that one assembly in which an absolute power over the whole resides where was there in the roman commonwealth i would not undertake for certain to find an answer to all these questions  see par    with regard to justice † it may be observed that upon this occasion i consider religion in no other light than in respect of the influence it may have on the happiness of the present life as to the effects it may have in assuring us of and preparing us for a better life to come this is a matter which comes not within the cognizance of the legislator see tit offences against religion i say offences against religion the fictitious entity not offences against god the real being for what sort of pain should the act of a feeble mortal occasion to a being unsusceptible of pain how should an offence affect him should it be an offence against his person his property his reputation or his condition it has commonly been the way to put offences against religion foremost the idea of precedence is naturally enough connected with that of reverence ex διος αϱχωμεαθα but for expressing reverence there are other methods enough that are less equivocal and in point of method and perspicuity it is evident that with regard to offences against religion neither the nature of the mischief which it is their tendency to produce nor the reason there may be for punishing them can be understood but from the consideration of the several mischiefs which result from the several other sorts of offences in a political view it is only because those others are mischievous that offences against religion are so too ‡ this division of falsehoods it is to be observed is not regularly drawn out that being what the nature of the case will not here admit of falsehood may be infinitely diversified in other ways than these in a particular case for instance simple falsehood when uttered by writing is distinguished from the same falsehood when uttered by word of mouth and has had a particular name given to it accordingly i mean where it strikes against reputation in which case the instrument it has been uttered by has been called a libel now it is obvious that in the same manner it might have received a distinct name in all other cases where it is uttered by writing but there has not happened to be any thing in particular that has disposed mankind in those cases to give it such a name the case is that among the infinity of circumstances by which it might have been diversified those which constitute it a libel happen to have engaged a peculiar share of attention on the part of the institutors of language either in virtue of the influence which these circumstances have on the tendency of the act or in virtue of any particular degree of force with which on any other account they may have disposed it to strike upon the imagination ∥ see b i tit falsehoods  there are two other circumstances still more material viz   the parties whose interest is affected by the falsehood   the point or article in which that interest is affected these circumstances however enter not into the composition of the generical character their use is as we shall see to characterize the several species of each genus see b i tit falsehoods † ibid ‡ powers though not a species of rights for the two sorts of fictitious entities termed a power and a right are altogether disparate are yet so far included under rights that wherever the word power may be employed the word right may also be employed the reason is that wherever you may speak of a person as having a power you may also speak of him as having a right to such power but the converse of this proposition does not hold good there are cases in which though you may speak of a man as having a right you can not speak of him as having a power or in any other way make any mention of that word on various occasions you have a right for instance to the services of the magistrate but if you are a private person you have no power over him all the power is on his side this being the case as the word right was employed the word power might perhaps without any deficiency in the sense have been omitted on the present occasion however as in speaking of trusts this word is commonly made more use of than the word right it seemed most eligible for the sake of perspicuity to insert them both it may be expected that since the word trust has been here expounded the words power and right upon the meaning of which the exposition of the word trust is made to depend should be expounded also and certain it is that no two words can stand more in need of it than these do such exposition i accordingly set about to give and indeed have actually drawn up but the details into which i found it necessary to enter for this purpose were of such length as to take up more room than could consistently be allotted to them in this place with respect to these words therefore and a number of others such as possession title and the like which in point of import are inseparably connected with them instead of exhibiting the exposition itself i must content myself with giving a general idea of the plan which i have pursued in framing it and as to every thing else i must leave the import of them to rest upon whatever footing it may happen to stand upon in the apprehension of each reader power and right and the whole tribe of fictious entities of this stamp are all of them in the sense which belongs to them in a book of jurisprudence the results of some manifestation or other of the legislators will with respect to such or such an act now every such manifestation is either a prohibition a command or their respective negations viz a permission and the declaration which the legislator makes of his will when on any occasion he leaves an act uncommanded now to render the expression of the rule more concise the commanding of a positive act may be represented by the prohibition of the negative act which is opposed to it to know then how to expound a right carry your eye to the act which in the circumstances in question would be a violation of that right the law creates the right by prohibiting that act power whether over a mans own person or over other persons or over things is constituted in the first instance by permission but in as far as the law takes an active part in corroborating it it is created by prohibition and by command by prohibition of such acts on the part of other persons as are judged incompatible with the exercise of it and upon occasion by command of such acts as are judged to be necessary for the removal of such or such obstacles of the number of those which may occur to impede the exercise of it for every right which the law confers on one party whether that party be an individual a subordinate class of individuals or the public it thereby imposes on some other party a duty or obligation but there may be laws which command or prohibit acts that is impose duties without any other view than the benefit of the agent these generate no rights duties therefore may be either extraregarding or selfregarding extraregarding have rights to correspond to them selfregarding none that the exposition of the words power and right must in order to be correct enter into a great variety of details may be presently made appear one branch of the system of rights and powers and but one are those of which property is composed to be correct then it must among other things be applicable to the whole tribe of modifications of which property is susceptible but the commands and prohibitions by which the powers and rights that compose those several modifications are created are of many different forms to comprise the exposition in question within the compass of a single paragraph would therefore be impossible to take as many paragraphs for it as would be necessary in order to exhibit these different forms would be to engage in a detail so ample that the analysis of the several possible species of property would compose only a part of it this labour uninviting as it was i have accordingly undergone but the result of it as may well be imagined seemed too voluminous and minute to be exhibited in an outline like the present happily it is not necessary except only for the scientific purpose of arrangement to the understanding of any thing that need be said on the penal branch of the art of legislation in a work which should treat of the civil branch of that art it would find its proper place and in such a work if conducted upon the plan of the present one it would be indispensable of the limits which seem to separate the one of these branches from the other a pretty ample description will be found in the next chapter from which some further lights respecting the course to be taken for developing the notions to be annexed to the words right and power may incidentally be collected see in particular §   and   see also par    of the present chapter i might have cut this matter very short by proceeding in the usual strain and saying that a power was a faculty and that a right was a privilege and so on following the beaten track of definition but the inanity of such a method in cases like the present has been already pointed outa a power is not a—any thing neither is a right a—any thing the case is they have neither of them any superior genus these together with duty obligation and a multitude of others of the same stamp being of the number of those fictitious entities of which the import can by no other means be illustrated than by showing the relation which they bear to real ones a see fragmen on government ch v §   note  the first of these parties is styled in the law language as well as in common speech by the name here given to him the other is styled in the technical language of the english law a cestuy que trust in common speech as we have observed there is unfortunately no name for him as to the law phrase it is antiquated french and though complex it is still elliptical and to the highest degree obscure the phrase in full length would run in some such manner as this cestuy al use de qui le trust est créé he to whose use the trust or benefit is created in a particular case a cestuy que trust is called by the roman law fideicommissarius in imitation of this i have seen him somewhere or other called in english a fidecommittee this term however seems not very expressive a fidecommittee or as it should have been a fideicommittee seems literally speaking to mean one who is committed to the good faith of another good faith seems to consist in the keeping of a promise but a trust may be created without any promise in the case it is indeed common enough to exact a promise in order the more effectually to oblige a man to do that which he is made to promise he will do but this is merely an accidental circumstance a trust may be created without any such thing what is it that constitutes a legal obligation in any case a command express or virtual together with punishment appointed for the breach of it by the same means may an obligation be constituted in this case as well as any other instead of the word beneficiary which i found it necessary to adopt the sense would be better expressed by some such word as beneficiendary a word analogous in its formation to referendary were it such an one as the ear could bring itself to endure this would put it more effectually out of doubt that the party meant was the party who ought to receive the benefit whether he actually receives it or no whereas the word beneficiary might be understood to intimate that the benefit was actually received while in offences against trust the mischief commonly is that such benefit is reaped not by the person it was designed for but by some other for instance the trustee  it is for shortness sake that the proposition is stated as it stands in the text if critically examined it might be found perhaps to be scarcely justifiable by the laws of language for the fictitious entities characterised by the two abstract terms trust and condition are not subalternate but disparate to speak with perfect precision we should say that he who is invested with a trust is on that account spoken of as being invested with a condition viz the condition of a trustee we speak of the condition of a trustee as we speak of the condition of a husband or a father † infra par     for object of property say now      subjectmatter † it is to be observed that in common speech in the phrase the object of a mans property the words the object of are commonly left out and by an ellipsis which violent as it is is now become more familiar than the phrase at length they have made that part of it which consists of the words a mans property perform the office of the whole in some cases then it was only on a part of the object that the acts in question might be performed and to say on this account that the object was a mans property was as much as to intimate that they might be performed on any part in other cases it was only certain particular acts that might be exercised on the object and to say of the object that it was his property was as much as to intimate that any acts whatever might be exercised on it sometimes the acts in question were not to be exercised but at a future time nor then perhaps but in the case of the happening of a particular event of which the happening was uncertain and to say of an object that it was his property was as much as to intimate that the acts in question might be exercised on it at any time sometimes the object on which the acts in question were to have their termination or their commencement was a human creature and to speak of one human creature as being the property of another is what would shock the ear every where but where slavery is established and even there when applied to persons in any other condition than that of slaves among the first romans indeed the wife herself was the property of her husband the child of his father the servant of his master in the civilized nations of modern times the two first kinds of property are altogether at an end and the last unhappily not yet at an end but however verging it is to be hoped towards extinction the husbands property is now the companya of his wife the fathers the guardianship and service of his child the masters the service of his servant a the consortium says the english law  to condition in this case should be added the words in life  we shall have occasion a little farther on to speak of the person in whose hands the trust exists under the description of the person who possesses or is in possession of it and thence of the possession of the trust abstracted from the consideration of the possessor however different the expression the import is in both cases the same so irregular and imperfect is the structure of language on this head that no one phrase can be made to suit the idea on all the occasions on which it is requisite it should be brought to view the phrase must be continually shifted or new modified so likewise in regard to conditions and in regard to property the being invested with or possessing a condition the being in possession of an article of property that is if the object of the property be corporeal the having a legal title defeasible or indefeasible to the physical possession of it answers to the being in possession of a trust or the being the person in whose hands a trust exists in like manner to the exercise of the functions belonging to a trust or to a condition corresponds the enjoyment of an article of property that is if the object of it be corporeal the occupation these verbal discussions are equally tedious and indispensable striving to cut a new road through the wilds of jurisprudence i find myself continually distressed for want of tools that are fit to work with to frame a complete set of new ones is impossible all that can be done is to make here and there a new one in cases of absolute necessity and for the rest to patch up from time to time the imperfections of the old as to the bipartition which this paragraph sets out with it must be acknowledged not to be of the nature of those which to a first glance afford a sort of intuitive proof of their being exhaustive there is not that marked connection and opposition between the terms of it which subsists between contradictory terms and between terms that have the same common genus i imagine however that upon examination it would be found to be exhaustive notwithstanding and that it might even be demonstrated so to be but the demonstration would lead us too far out of the ordinary track of language † see ch vii actions par   ‡ if advantageous it will naturally be on account of the powers or rights that are annexed to the trust if disadvantageous on account of the duties ∥ it may seem a sort of anachronism to speak on the present occasion of a trust condition or other possession as one of which it may happen that a man ought or ought not to have had possession given him by the law for the plan here set out upon is to give such a view all along of the laws that are proposed as shall be taken from the reasons which there are for making them the reason then it would seem should subsist before the law not the law before the reason nor is this to be denied for unquestionably upon the principle of utility it may be said with equal truth of those operations by which a trust or any other article of property is instituted as of any other operations of the law that it never can be expedient they should be performed unless some reason for performing them deduced from that principle can be assigned to give property to one man you must impose obligation on another you must oblige him to do something which he may have a mind not to do or to abstain from doing something which he may have a mind to do in a word you must in some way or other expose him to inconvenience every such law therefore must at any rate be mischievous in the first instance and if no good effects can be produced to set against the bad it must be mischievous upon the whole some reasons therefore in this case as in every other there ought to be the truth is that in the case before us the reasons are of too various and complicated a nature to be brought to view in an analytical outline like the present where the offence is of the number of those by which person or reputation are affected the reasons for prohibiting it lie on the surface and apply to every man alike but property before it can be offended against must be created and at the instant of its creation distributed as it were into parcels of different sorts and sizes which require to be assigned some to one man and some to another for reasons of which many lie a little out of sight and which being different in different cases would take up more room than could consistently be allotted to them here for the present purpose it is sufficient if it appear that for the carrying on of the several purposes of life there are trusts and conditions and other articles of property which must be possessed by somebody and that it is not every article that can nor every article that ought to be possessed by everybody what articles ought to be created and to what persons and in what cases they ought to be respectively assigned are questions which cannot be settled here nor is there any reason for wishing that they could since the settling them one way or another is what would make no difference in the nature of any offence whereby any party may be exposed on the occasion of any such institution to sustain a detriment  in the former case it may be observed the act is of the negative kind in the latter it will commonly be of the positive kind as to the expression noninvestment of trust i am sensible that it is not perfectly consonant to the idiom of the language the usage is to speak of a person as being invested that is clothed with a trust not of a trust as of a thing that is itself invested or put on the phrase at length would be the noninvestment of a person with a trust but this phrase is by much too longwinded to answer the purpose of an appellative i saw therefore no other resource than to venture upon the ellipsis here employed the ancient lawyers in the construction of their appellatives have indulged themselves in much harsher ellipsises without scruple see above    note it is already the usage to speak of a trust as a thing that vests and as a thing that may be divested † detrectation i do not find that this word has yet been received into the english language in the latin however it is very expressive and is used in a sense exactly suitable to the sense here given to it militiam detrectare to endeavour to avoid serving in the army is a phrase not unfrequently met with in the roman writers  what is here meant by abuse of trust is the exercise of a power usurped over strangers under favour of the powers properly belonging to the trust the distinction between what is here meant by breach of trust and what is here meant by abuse of trust is not very steadily observed in common speech and in regard to public trusts it will even in many cases be imperceptible the two offences are however in themselves perfectly distinct since the persons by whom the prejudice is suffered are in many cases altogether different it may be observed perhaps that with regard to abuse of trust there is but one species here mentioned viz that which corresponds to positive breach of trust none being mentioned as corresponding to negative breach of trust the reason of this distinction will presently appear in favour of the parties for whose benefit the trust was created the trustee is bound to act and therefore merely by his doing nothing they may receive a prejudice but in favour of other persons at large he is not bound to act and therefore it is only from some positive act on his part that any prejudice can ensue to them † see infra and ch xx indirect legislation ‡ see ch xi dispositions par     to bribe a trustee as such is in fact neither more nor less than to suborn him to be guilty of a breach or an abuse of trust now subornation is of the number of those accessory offences which every principal offence one as will as another is liable to be attended with see infra and b i tit accessory offences this particular species of subornation however being one that besides its having a specific name framed to express it is apt to engage a particular share of attention and to present itself to view in company with other offences against trust it would have seemed an omission not to have included it in that catalogue † see ch vi sensibility par   ‡ in the enumeration of these genera it is all all along to be observed that offences of an accessory nature are not mentioned except unless it be here and there where they have obtained current names which seemed too much in vogue to be omitted accessory offences are those which without being the very acts from which the mischief in question takes its immediate rise are in the way of causality connected with those acts see ch vii actions par    and b i tit accessory offences  ch vii actions par   † of these and the several other leading expressions which there is occasion to bring to view in the remaining part of this analysis ample definitions will be found in the body of the work conceived in terminis legis to give particular references to these definitions would be incumbering the page to little purpose ‡ injurious restrainment at large and injurious compulsion at large are here styled simple in order to distinguish them from confinement banishment robbery and extortion all which are in many cases but so many modifications of one or other of the two firstmentioned offences to constitute an offence an act of simple injurious restrainment or simple injurious compulsion it is sufficient if the influence it exerts be in the first place pernicious in the next place exerted on the person by the medium of the will it is not necessary that that part of the person on which it is exerted be the part to which it is pernicious it is not even necessary that it should immediately be pernicious to either of these parts though to one or other of them it must be pernicious in the long run if it be pernicious at all an act in which the body for example is concerned may be very disagreeable and thereby pernicious to him who performs it though neither disagreeable nor pernicious to his body for instance to stand or sit in public with a label on his back or under any other circumstances of ignominy  it may be observed that wrongful menacement is included as well in simple injurious restrainment and simple injurious compulsion except in the rare case where the motives by which one man is prevented by another from doing a thing that would have been materially to his advantage or induced to do a thing that is materially to his prejudice are of the alluring kind † although for reasons that have been already given supra par    no complete catalogue nor therefore any exhaustive view of either semipublic or selfregarding offences can be exhibited in this chapter it may be a satisfaction however to the reader to see some sort of list of them if it were only for the sake of having examples before his eyes such lists cannot any where be placed to more advantage than under the heads of the several divisions of private extraregarding offences to which the semipublic and selfregarding offences in question respectively correspond concerning the two latter however and the last more particularly it must be understood that all i mean by inserting them here is to exhibit the mischief if any which it is of the nature of them respectively to produce without deciding upon the question whether it would be worth while see ch xv cases unmeet in every instance for the sake of combating that mischief to introduce the evil of punishment in the course of this detail it will be observed that there are several heads of extraregarding private offences to which the correspondent heads either of semipublic or selfregarding offences or of both are wanting the reasons of these deficiencies will probably in most instances be evident enough upon the face of them lest they should not they are however specified in the body of the work they would take up too much room were they to be inserted here i semipublic offences through calamity calamities by which the persons or properties of men or both are liable to be affected seem to be as follows   pestilence or contagion   famine and other kinds of scarcity   mischiefs producible by persons deficient in point of understanding such as infants idiots and maniacs for want of their being properly taken care of   mischief producible by the ravages of noxious animals such as beasts of prey locusts c c   collapsion or fall of large masses of solid matter such as decayed buildings or rocks or masses of snow   inundation or submersion   tempest   blight   conflagration  0 explosion in as far as a man may contribute by any imprudent act of his to give birth to any of the above calamities such act may be an offence in as far as a man may fail to do what is incumbent on him to do towards preventing them such failure may be an offence ii semipublic offences of mere delinquency a whole neighbourhood may be made to suffer   simple corporal injuries in other words they may be made to suffer in point of health by offensive or dangerous trades or manufactures by selling or falsely puffing off unwholsome medicines or provisions by poisoning or drying up of springs destroying of aqueducts destroying woods walls or other fences against wind and rain by any kinds of artificial scarcity or by any other calamities intentionally produced   and   simple injurious restrainment and simple injurious compulsion for instance by obliging a whole neighbourhood by dint of threatening handbills or threatening discourses publicly delivered to join or forbear to join in illuminations acclamations outcries invectives subscriptions undertakings processions or any other mode of expressing joy or grief displeasure or approbation or in short in any other course of conduct whatsoever   and   confinement and banishment by the spoiling of roads bridges or ferryboats by destroying or unwarrantably preoccupying public carriages or houses of accommodation   by menacement as by incendiary letters and tumultuous assemblies by newspapers or handbills denouncing vengeance against persons of particular denominations for example against jews catholics protestants scotchmen gascons catalonians c   simple mental injuries as by distressful terrifying obscene or irreligious exhibitions such as exposure of sores by beggars exposure of dead bodies exhibitions or reports of counterfeit witchcrafts or apparitions exhibition of obscene or blasphemous prints obscene or blasphemous discourses held in public spreading false news of public defeats in battle or of other

offences   incontinence in females   incest † supra par    ‡ see ch ix consciousness par   ∥ the light in which the offence of insolvency is here exhibited may perhaps at first consideration be apt to appear not only novel but improper it may naturally enough appear that when a man owes you a sum of money for instance the right to the money is yours already and that what he withholds from you by not paying you is not the legal title to it possession of it or power over it but the physical possession of it or power over it only but upon a more accurate examination this will be found not to be the case what is meant by payment is always an act of investitive power as above explained an expression of an act of the will and not a physical act it is an act exercised with relation indeed to the thing said to be paid but not in a physical sense exercised upon it a man who owes you ten pounds takes up a handful of silver to that amount and lays it down on a table at which you are sitting if then by words or gestures or any means whatever addressing himself to you he intimates it to be his will that you should take up the money and do with it as you please he is said to have paid you but if the case was that he laid it down not for that purpose but for some other for instance to count it and examine it meaning to take it up again himself or leave it for somebody else he has not paid you yet the physical acts exercised upon the pieces of money in question are in both cases the same till he does express a will to that purport what you have is not properly speaking the legal possession of the money or a right to the money but only a right to have him or in his default perhaps a minister of justice compelled to render you that sort of service by the rendering of which he is said to pay you that is to express such will as above mentioned with regard to some corporeal article or other of a certain species and of value equal to the amount of what he owes you or in other words to exercise in your favour an act of investitive power with relation to some such article true it is that in certain cases a man may perhaps not be deemed according to common acceptation to have paid you without rendering you a further set of services and those of another sort a set of services which are rendered by the exercising of certain acts of a physical nature upon the very thing with which he is said to pay you to wit by transferring the thing to a certain place where you may be sure to find it and where it may be convenient for you to receive it but these services although the obligation of rendering them should be annexed by law to the obligation of rendering those other services in the performance of which the operation of payment properly consists are plainly acts of a distinct nature nor are they essential to the operation by themselves they do not constitute it and it may be performed without them it must be performed without them wherever the thing to be transferred happens to be already as much within the reach physically speaking of the creditor as by any act of the debtor it can be made to be this matter would have appeared in a clearer light had it been practicable to enter here into a full examination of the nature of property and the several modifications of which it is susceptible but every thing cannot be done at once  supra par    †

utmost latitude negative included as well as positive this one head would be enough to cover the whole law to this place then are to be referred such services only the withholding of which does not coincide with any of the other offences for which separate denominations have been provided there are some services we may observe the withholding of which may affect the person and by that means come

the head of usurpation or wrongful investment of property the distinction seems hardly hitherto to have been attended to it turns like another mentioned above upon the distinction between legal possession and physical the same observation may be applied to the case of extortion hereafter following † vide supra par    ‡ usury which if it must be an offence is an offence committed with consent

postconnubial all i mean at present to bring to view is the mere physical union apart from the ceremonies and legal engagements that will afterwards be considered as accompanying it † the vague and undetermined nature of the fictitious entity called a relation is on occasions like the present apt to be productive of a good deal of confusion a relation is either said to be borne by one of the objects which are parties to it to the other or to subsist between them the latter mode of phraseology is perhaps rather the more common in such case the idea seems to be that from the consideration of the two objects there results but one relation which belongs as it were in common to them both in some cases this perhaps may answer the purpose very well it will not however in the present case for the present purpose it will be necessary we should conceive two relations as resulting from the two objects and borne since such is the phrase by the one of them to or towards the other one relation borne by the first object to the second another relation borne by the second object to the first this is necessary on two accounts   because for the relations themselves there are in many instances separate names for example the relations of guardianship and wardship in which case the speaking of them as if they were but one may be productive of much confusion   because the two different relationships give birth to so many conditions which conditions are so far different that what is predicated and will hold good of the one will in various particulars as we shall see not hold good of the other  see ch xix limits §   † two persons who by any means stand engaged to live together can never live together long but one of them will choose that some act or other should be

decided long before any such office as that of legislator had existence this then being the order of things which the legislator finds established by nature how should he do better than to acquiesce in it the persons who by the influence of causes that prevail every where stand engaged to live together are   parent and child during the infancy of the latter   man and wife   children of the same parents parent and child by necessity since if the child did not live with the parent or with somebody standing in the place of the parent it could not live at all husband and wife by a choice approaching to necessity children of the same parents by the necessity of their living each of them with the parents as between parent and child the necessity there is of a power on the part of the parent for the preservation of the child supersedes all farther reasoning as between man and wife that necessity does not subsist the only reason that applies to this case is the necessity of putting an end to competition the man would have the meat roasted the woman boiled shall they both fast till the judge comes in to dress it for them the woman would have the child dressed in green the man in blue shall the child be naked till the judge comes in to clothe it this affords a reason for giving a power to one or other of the parties but it affords none for giving the power to the one rather than to the other how then shall the legislator determine supposing it equally easy to give it to either let him look ever so long for a reason why he should give it to the one rather than to the other and he may look in vain but how does the matter stand already for there were men and wives or what comes to the same thing male and female living together as man and wife before there were legislators looking round him then he finds almost every where the male the stronger of the two and therefore possessing already by purely physical means that power which he is thinking of bestowing on one of them by means of law how then can he do so well as by placing the legal power in the same hands which are beyond comparison the more likely to be in possession of the physical in this way

servant but more particularly and more frequently an apprentice in this case though the superior is in point of usage known by no other name than that of a master the relationship is in point of fact a mixed one compounded of that of master and that of guardian  it may seem at first that a person who is in the condition of a slave could not have it in his power to engage in such course of proceeding as would be necessary in order to give him an apparent title to be reckoned among the slaves of another master but though a slave in point of right it may happen that he has eloped for instance and is not a slave in point of fact or suppose him a slave in point of fact and ever so vigilantly guarded still a person connected with him by the ties of sympathy might do that for him which though willing and assenting he might not be able to do for himself might forge a deed of donation for example from the one master to the other  consider them together indeed take the sum of the

be and yet the former may continue guardian notwithstanding how then it may be asked is he divested of his guardianship the answer is certainly not of the whole of it but however of a part of it of such part as is occupied if one may so say that is of such part of the powers and rights belonging to it as are exercised by the usurper  at first view it may seem a solecism to speak of the condition of parentality as one which a man can have need to be invested with the reason is that it is not common for any ceremony to be required as necessary to a mans being deemed in law the father of such or such a child but the institution of such a ceremony whether advisable or not is at least perfectly conceivable nor are there wanting cases in which it has actually been exemplified by an article in the roman law adopted by many modern nations an illegitimate child is rendered legitimate by the subsequent marriage of his parents if then a priest or other person whose office it was were to refuse to join a man and woman in matrimony such refusal besides being a wrongful noninvestment with respect to the two matrimonial conditions would be a wrongful noninvestment of parentality and filiation to the prejudice of any children who should have been legitimated † in english we have no word that will serve to express with propriety the person who bears the relation opposed to that of parent the word child is ambiguous being employed in another sense perhaps more frequently than in this more frequently in opposition to a person of full age an adult than in correlation to a parent for the

either of the coercive or the discoercive kind as already subsisting of the existence of some document expressive of some act of the will exercised not at the time but at some former period if it does any thing more than give information of this fact viz of the prior existence of a law of either the coercive or the discoercive kind it ceases pro tanto to be what is meant by a declaratory law and assuming either the coercive or the discoercive quality   every coercive law creates an offence that is converts an act of some sort or other into an offence it is only by so doing that it can impose obligation that it can produce coercion   a law confining itself to the creation of an offence and a law commanding a punishment to be administered in case of the commission of such an offence are two distinct laws not parts as they seem to have been generally accounted hitherto of one and the same law the acts they command are altogether different the persons they are addressed to are altogether different instance let no man steal and let the judge cause whoever is convicted of stealing to be hanged they might be styled the former a simple imperative law the other a punitory but the punitory if it commands the punishment to be inflicted and does not merely permit it is as truly imperative as the other only it is punitory besides which the other is not   a law of the discoercive kind considered in itself can have no punitory law belonging to it to receive the assistance and support of a punitory law it must first receive that of a simply imperative or coercive law and it is to this latter that the punitory law will attach itself and not to the discoercive one example discoercive law the sheriff has power to hang all such as the judge proceeding in due course of law shall order him to hang example of a coercive law made in support of the above discoercive one let no man hinder the sheriff from hanging such as the judge proceeding in due course of law shall order him to hang example of a punitory law made in support of the above coercive one let the judge cause to be imprisoned whosoever attempts to hinder the sheriff from hanging one whom the judge proceeding in due course of law has ordered him to hang   but though a simply imperative law and the punitory law attached to it are so far distinct laws that the former contains nothing of the latter and the latter in its direct tenor contains nothing of the former yet by implication and that a necessary one the punitory does involve and include the import of the simple imperative law to which it is appended to say to the judge cause to be hanged whoever in due form of law is convicted of stealing is though not a direct yet as intelligible a way of intimating to men in general that they must not steal as to say to them directly do not steal and one sees how much more likely to be efficacious   it should seem then that wherever a simply imperative law is to have a punitory one appended to it the former might be spared altogether in which case saving the exception which naturally should seem not likely to be a frequent one of a law capable of answering its purpose without such an appendage there should be no occasion in the whole body of the law for any other than punitory or in other words than penal laws and this perhaps would be the case were it not for the necessity of a large quantity of matter of the expository kind of which we come now to speak  0 it will happen in the instance of many probably of most possibly of all commands endued with the force of a public law that in the expression given to such a command it shall be necessary to have recourse to terms too complex in their signification to exhibit the requisite ideas without the assistance of a greater or less quantity of matter of an expository nature such terms like the symbols used in algebraical notation are rather substitutes and indexes to the terms capable of themselves of exhibiting the ideas in question than the real and immediate representatives of those ideas take for instance the law thou shalt not steal such a command were it to rest there could never sufficiently answer the purpose of a law a word of so vague and unexplicit a meaning can no otherwise perform this office than by giving a general intimation of a variety of propositions each requiring to convey it to the apprehension a more particular and ample assemblage of terms stealing for example according to a definition not accurate enough for use but sufficiently so for the present purpose is the taking of a thing which is anothers by one who has no title so to do and is conscious of his having none even after this exposition supposing it a correct one can the law be regarded as completely expressed certainly not for what is meant by a mans having a title to take a thing to be complete the law must have exhibited amongst a multitude of other things two catalogues the one of events to which it has given the quality of conferring title in such a case the other of the events to which it has given the quality of taking it away what follows that for a man to have stolen for a man to have had no title to what he took either no one of the articles contained in the first of those lists must have happened in his favour or if there has some one of the number of those contained in the second must have happened to his prejudice    such then is the nature of a general law that while the imperative part of it the punctum saliens as it may be termed of this artificial body shall not take up above two or three words its expository appendage without which that imperative part could not rightly perform its office may occupy a considerable volume but this may equally be the case with a private order given in a family take for instance one from a bookseller to his foreman remove from this shop to my new one my whole stock according to this printed catalogue remove from this shop to my new one my whole stock is the imperative matter of this order the catalogue referred to contains the expository appendage    the same mass of expository matter may serve in common for may appertain in common to many commands many masses of imperative matter thus amongst other things the catalogue of collative and ablative events with respect to titles above spoken of see no   of this note will belong in common to all or most of the laws constitutive of the various offences against property thus in mathematical diagrams one and the same base shall serve for a whole cluster of triangles    such expository matter being of a complexion so different from the imperative it would be no wonder if the connection of the former with the latter should escape the observation which indeed is perhaps pretty generally the case and so long as any mass of legislative matter presents itself which is not itself imperative or the contrary or of which the connection with matter of one of those two descriptions is not apprehended so long and so far the truth of the proposition that every law is a command or its opposite may remain unsuspected or appear questionable so long also may the incompleteness of the greater part of those masses of legislative matter which wear the complexion of complete laws upon the face of them also the method to be taken for rendering them really complete remain undiscovered    a circumstance that will naturally contribute to increase the difficulty of the discovery is the great variety of ways in which the imperation of a law may be conveyed—the great variety of forms which the imperative part of a law may indiscriminately assume some more directly some less directly expressive of the imperative quality thou shalt not steal let no man steal whoso stealeth shall be punished so and so if any man steal he shall be punished so and so stealing is where a man does so and so the punishment for stealing is so and so to judges so and so named and so and so constituted belong the cognizance of such and such offences viz stealing and so on these are but part of a multitude of forms of words in any of which the command by which stealing is prohibited might equally be couched and it is manifest to what a degree in some of them the imperative quality is clouded and concealed from ordinary apprehension    after this explanation a general proposition or two that may be laid down may help to afford some little insight into the structure and contents of a complete body of laws—so many different sorts of offences created so many different laws of the coercive kind so many exceptions taken out of the descriptions of those offences so many laws of the discoercive kind to class offences as hath been attempted to be done in the preceding chapter is therefore to class laws to exhibit a complete catalogue of all the offences created by law including the whole mass of expository matter necessary for fixing and exhibiting the import of the terms contained in the several laws by which those offences are respectively created would be to exhibit a complete collection of the laws in force in a word a complete body of law a pannomion if so it might be termed    from the obscurity in which the limits of a law and the distinction betwixt a law of the civil or simply imperative kind and a punitory law are naturally involved results the obscurity of the limits betwixt a civil and a penal code betwixt the civil branch of the law and the penal the question what parts of the total mass of legislative matter belong to the civil branch and what to the penal supposes that divers political states or at least that some one such state are to be found having as well a civil code as a penal code each of them complete in its kind and marked out by certain limits but no one such state has ever yet existed to put a question to which a true answer can be given we must substitute to the foregoing question some such one as that which follows suppose two masses of legislative matter to be drawn up at this time of day the one under the name of a civil code the other of a penal code each meant to be complete in its kind in what general way is it natural to suppose that the different sorts of matter as above distinguished would be distributed between them to this question the following answer seems likely to come as near as any other to the truth the civil code would not consist of a collection of civil laws each complete in itself as well as clear of all penal ones neither would the penal code since we have seen that it could not consist of a collection of punitive laws each not only complete in itself but clear of all civil ones but    the civil code would consist chiefly of mere masses of expository matter the imperative matter to which those masses of expository matter respectively appertained would be found—not in that same code—not in the civil code—nor in a pure state free from all admixture of punitory laws but in the penal code—in a state of combination—involved in manner as above explained in so may correspondent punitory laws    the penal code then would consist principally of punitive laws involving the imperative matter of the whole number of civil laws along with which would probably also be found various masses of expository matter appertaining not to the civil but to the punitory laws the body of penal law enacted by the empressqueen maria theresa agrees pretty well with this account    the mass of legislative matter published in french as well as german under the auspices of frederic ii of prussia by the name of code frederic but never established with force of lawa appears for example to be almost wholly composed of masses of expository matter the relation of which to any imperative matter appears to have been but very imperfectly apprehended  0 in that enormous mass of confusion and inconsistency the ancient roman or as it is termed by way of eminence the civil law the imperative matter and even all traces of the imperative character seem at last to have been smothered in the expository esto had been the language of primæval simplicity esto had been the language of the twelve tables by the time of justinian so thick was the darkness raised by clouds of commentators the penal law had been crammed into an odd corner of the civil—the whole catalogue of offences and even of crimes lay buried under a heap of obligations—will was hid in opinion—and the original esto had transformed itself into videtur in the mouths even of the most despotic sovereigns    among the barbarous nations that grew up out of the ruins of the roman empire law emerging from under the mountain of expository rubbish reassumed for a while the language of command and then she had simplicity at least if nothing else to recommend her    besides the civil and the penal every complete body of law must contain a third branch the constitutional the constitutional branch is chiefly employed in conferring on particular classes of persons powers to be exercised for the good of the whole society or of considerable parts of it and prescribing duties to the persons invested with those powers the powers are principally constituted in the first instance by discoercive or permissive laws operating as exceptions to certain laws of the coercive or imperative kind instance a taxgatherer as such may on such and such an occasion take such and such things without any other title the duties are created by imperative laws addressed to the persons on whom the powers are conferred instance on such and such an occasion such and such a taxgatherer shall take such and such things such and such a judge shall in such and such a case cause persons so and so offending to be hanged the parts which perform the function of indicating who the individuals are who in every case shall be considered as belonging to those classes have neither a permissive complexion nor an imperative they are so many masses of expository matter appertaining in common to all laws into the texture of which the names of those classes of persons have occasion to be inserted instance imperative matter—let the judge cause whoever in due course of law is convicted of stealing to be hanged nature of the expository matter—who is the person meant by the word judge he who has been invested with that office in such a manner and in respect of whom no event has happened of the number of those to which the effect is given of reducing him to the condition of one divested of that office    thus it is that one and the same law one and the same command will have its matter divided not only between two great codes or main branches of the whole body of the laws the civil and the penal but amongst three such branches the civil the penal and the constitutional    in countries where a great part of the law exists in no other shape than that of what in england is called common law but might be more expressively termed judiciary there must be a great multitude of laws the import of which cannot be sufficiently made out for practice without referring to this common law for more or less of the expository matter belonging to them thus in england the exposition of the word title that basis of the whole fabric of the laws of property is no where else to be found and as uncertainty is the very essence of every particle of law so denominated for the instant it is clothed in a certain authoritative form of words it changes its nature and passes over to the other denomination hence it is that a great part of the laws in being in such countries remains uncertain and incomplete what are those countries to this hour every one on the surface of the globe    had the science of architecture no fixed nomenclature belonging to it—were there no settled names for distinguishing the different sorts of buildings nor the different parts of the same building from each other—what would it be it would be what the science of legislation considered with respect to its form remains at present were there no architects who could distinguish a dwellinghouse from a barn or a side wall from a ceiling what would architects be they would be what all legislators are at present    from this very slight and imperfect sketch may be collected not an answer to the questions in the text but an intimation and that but an imperfect one of the course to be taken for giving such an answer and at any rate some idea of the difficulty as well as of the necessity of the task if it were thought necessary to recur to experience for proofs of this difficulty and this necessity they need not be long wanting take for instance so many wellmeant endeavours on the part of popular bodies and so many wellmeant recommendations in ingenious books to restrain supreme representative assemblies from making laws in such and such cases or to such and such an effect such laws to answer the intended purpose require a perfect mastery in the science of law considered in respect of its form—in the sort of anatomy spoken of in the preface to this work but a perfect or even a moderate insight into that science would prevent their being couched in those loose and inadequate terms in which they may be observed so frequently to be conceived as a perfect acquaintance with the dictates of utility on that head would in many if not in most of those instances discounsel the attempt keep to the letter and in attempting to prevent the making of bad laws you will find them prohibiting the making of the most necessary laws perhaps even of all laws quit the letter and they express no more than if each man were to say your laws shall become ipso facto void as often as they contain any thing which is not to my mind of such unhappy attempts examples may be met with in the legislation of many nations but in none more frequently than in that newlycreated nation one of the most enlightened if not the most enlightened at this day on the globe    take for instance the declaration of rights enacted by the state of northcarolina in convention in or about the month of september      and said to be copied with a small exception from one in like manner enacted by the state of virginiaa the following to go no farther is the first and fundamental article— that there are certain natural rights of which men when they form a social compact cannot deprive or divest their posterity among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty with the means of acquiring possessing and protecting property and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety not to dwell on the oversight of confining to posterity the benefit of the rights thus declared what follows that—as against those whom the protection thus meant to be afforded includes—every law or other order divesting a man of the enjoyment of life or liberty is void therefore this is the case amongst others with every coercive law therefore as against the persons thus protected every order for example to pay money on the score of taxation or of debt from individual to individual or otherwise is void for the effect of it if complied with is to deprive and divest him pro tanto of the enjoyment of liberty viz the liberty of paying or not paying as he thinks proper not to mention the species opposed to imprisonment in the event of such a mode of coercion being resorted to likewise of property which is itself a means of acquiring possessing and protecting property and of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety therefore also as against such persons every order to attack an armed enemy in time of war is also void for the necessary effect of such an order is to deprive some of them of the enjoyment of life the abovementioned consequences may suffice for examples amongst an endless train of similar onesb leaning on his elbow in an attitude of profound and solemn meditation what a multitude of things there are exclaimed the dancingmaster marcel in a

french work above quoted to have been enacted the  st of june      is not inserted in the publication entitled the constitutions of the several independent states of america c published by order of

rational a cause should be rested upon reasons so much fitter to beget objections than to remove them but with men who are unanimous and hearty about measures nothing so weak but may pass in the

several chapters and sections partly from the anticipation of them it cannot be considered as completed till expression has been given to the whole of the code in the very words of it or as the phrase

endeavoured and is supposed to be covered to a student an instructive sort of exercise would be—the finding or endeavouring to find a species of maleficent act which is not comprised in it this

prohibition may be considered as so many acts of codelinquency with relation to the so widely comprehensive genera of offence designated by the hereinabovementioned denominations of codelinquency

concurring will collectively or severally be liable to suffer dislocation at the hands and by the votes of the members of the constitutive authority   —axioms—correspondent are these to the several acts of maleficence to which in consideration of such their quality it is thought fit to assign the character of acts of delinquency and the denomination of offences with correspondent treatment for the purpose of remedy as per chap xvi these axioms are enunciative of the sufferance or say pain respectively produced by those same offences and of the preponderancy of this pain over any pleasure producible by those same acts to the agent   —exemptions—so many distinguishable sorts of burthens as are imposed—whatsoever be the purpose—whether satisfaction or punishment—so many are the correspondent exemptions possible   —part ii—in this part is contained the remainder of the work it is composed of what relates to the several offences in so many chapters in each chapter so much being given of the general matter as is applicable to the offence which is the subject matter of that same chapter under the heads constituted by the denominations of the several genera of supposed maleficent acts which on account of their being so are spoken of as acts of delinquency and constituted offences—the several arrangements and enactments thereto belonging are grounded all of them on considerations derived from the contemplation of the more general propositions contained in the several chapters of part i reference to which will all along be given as also per contra in part i will reference be made to the several occasions on which in part ii application is made of them respectively   —offences severally—in the work will be seen a definition of each genus of offence as designated by the name by which it is designated here and where the genus is divided into species a definition of each species   —private—in the method here pursued commencement is made with those offences the conception of which is more simple and clear and from these it proceeds on with those of which the conception is more and more complex and obscure on this occasion why it may be asked does no such class appear as that of selfregarding offences especially as in the authors former works this class makes its appearance along with the others answer—   needless with relation to the present purpose would have been any such additional matter from the names of the several acts which correspond to them in the list here given of extraregarding offences the names of the several selfregarding offences may without difficulty be inferred   burthensome would the addition have been in proportion to the space occupied by it   discussion occupying additional space would have been necessitated by it   to the practical purpose of taking the acts in question for subjectmatter of prohibition backed by appropriate punishment—no more than a part of the whole list of extraregarding offences would have furnished corresponding articles to the list of selfregarding offences   of these articles scarcely would there have been any others than those affecting property and those affecting condition in life in the first case prodigality in the other case illassorted marriage and improvidently contracted engagement of servitude and in neither case would any demand for punishment have place   so much for the offences themselves by which disorders in the body politic are produced now as to the corresponding remedies in relation to maleficent acts of this class needless is—absurdly employed would be—the punitive plainly inapplicable the satisfactive which see part i chap xvi   in the case of prodigality the sole remedy applicable with advantage is the suppressive even in this case whether with advantage or not depends upon the system of procedure   under the existing system the remedy would be but an exacerbation of the disease expenditure going on but employed in the purchase of pain at the hands of lawyers instead of pleasure at the hands of all other sorts of dealers   under the proposed system with little or no expense the diarrhœa might be stopt at any time the case of nonage excepted if on the part of the judicial authority interference in any shape is in this case justifiable it is more on account of the interest of the family connexion of the prodigal than on the account of the prodigal himself and in this case no otherwise than in so far as by ties legal or moral in the event of his falling into indigence they would find themselves bound for his maintenance  0 common to all selfregarding offences is this highly material circumstance and quality—by no offence of this description is evil of the second order—danger or alarm in any shape to other persons at large—ever produced nor yet in the opinion of him who generally speaking is the best qualified judge any preponderant and nett quantity of evil even of the first order at the same time from evil done to the offender himself though by himself results commonly it must be acknowledged a derivative evil to other individuals to wit to those connected with him by the tie of interest—of the one sort or the other—selfregarding or sympathetic or both on this ground therefore—principally if not exclusively—will be found to stand any reason by which the legislature can be called upon to make or be justified in making any arrangements the effect of which would be—to produce in a table of this sort a demand for the insertion of any such class as that composed of selfregarding private offences   —wrongful—exceptions excepted in the case of every one of the several sorts of acts ranked in this table under the denomination of offences—to the name of the act this word wrongful it will be observed stands prefixed the case is—that on the present occasion an addition to this effect to the denomination and thereby a correspondent limitation applied to the idea could not it will be seen be refused the reason is—that of all these several instances no one is there in which to the act in question as designated by its name in the table it may not happen to be made lawful made lawful—that is to say on the consideration that in the instance in question whatever be the evil produced by the maleficent act it is balanced or outweighed by some equivalent or more than equivalent good made lawful—namely by the establishment of some power or right—private semipublic or public as the case may be as to the exceptions—these are constituted by the several denominations in the signification of which an assertion of the unlawfulness of the act in question is involved examples are   usurpation   seduction   rape   theft   embezzlement   peculation   robbery   rioting   rebellion  0 treason    contrabandism    mistrading    international maleficence   —simple—in the cases in which from the magnitude of the extent over which the suffering spreads the offence receives the quality and denomination of semipublic—it receives thereby a complexion quite different from the more ordinary and natural one and of the appropriate remedy the nature becomes correspondingly different in the case of an offence levelled at the person of an assignable individual the motive is most commonly antipathy or say illwill in the case in which the persons affected are so numerous that the offence takes a semipublic character seldom has illwill anything to do with it the motive is a selfregarding one—namely the love of wealth or say pecuniary desire as to the means by the conjunction of which with the motive the temptation is produced—where antipathy is the motive persons of all classes stand alike exposed to it in the case where pecuniary desire is the motive it is by the matter of wealth in considerable quantities that the means—the instrument by which the evil effect is produced—is most commonly afforded of the thus widespreading annoyance the most commonly exemplified efficient cause is—either some manufacturing course of operations carried on in a certain edifice or spot of ground or some particular quality in the situation of the edifice or spot of ground itself   —morbification c—these might be considered as constituting nothing more than so many aggravations of the one offence first mentioned—namely simple corporal vexation in which case they would fall under the head of that offence constituting so many aggravations of it instead of constituting as here so many genera of offences and as such occupying so many places in the list of those same genera  0 —inventorship—in the case of offences affecting property in general the subject matters of the acts prohibited are individual things in the case of offences affecting

insert in the sentence that which being inserted turns it into nothing after the word censure with contempt he adds and rudeness as if there needed a professor to inform us that to treat any thing with contempt and rudeness is arrogance indecency he had already called it to set up private judgment in opposition to public and this without restriction qualification or reserve this was in the

adjudged burglaries though there was no actual breaking for the law will not suffer itself to be trifled with by such evasions can it be more egregiously trifled with than by such reasons i must own i have been ready to grow out of conceit with these useful little particles for because since and others of that fraternity from seeing the drudgery they are continually put to in these commentaries the appearance of any of them is a sort of warning to me to prepare for some tautology or some absurdity for the same thing dished up over again in the shape of a reason for itself or for a reason which

distance of time from that instant either had been in force or were about to be his words are as follows all these rights and liberties it is our birthright to enjoy entire unless where the laws of our country have laid them under necessary restraints restraints in themselves so gentle and moderate as will appear upon further inquiry that no man of sense or probity would wish to see them slackened for all of us have it in our choice to do every thing that a good man would desire to do and are restrained from nothing but what would be pernicious either to ourselves or our fellowcitizens if the reader would know what these rights and liberties are i answer him out of the same page they are those in opposition to one or other of which every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act having no other object upon which it can possibly be employed the liberty for example of worshiping god without being obliged to declare a belief in the xxxix articles is a liberty that no good man—no man of sense or probity would wish for q   comm  0 if no reason can be found for an institution we are to suppose one and it is upon the strength of this supposed one we are to cry it up as reasonable it is thus that the law is justified of her children the words are—not that the particular reason of every rule in the law can at this distance of time be always precisely assigned but it is sufficient that there be nothing in the rule flatly contradictory to reason and then the law will presume it to be well founded and it hath been an ancient observation in the laws of england he might with as good ground have added—and in all other laws that whenever a standing rule of law of which the reason perhaps could not be remembered or decerned hath been wantonly broke in upon by statutes or new resolutions the wisdom of the rule hath in the end appeared from the inconveniences that have followed the innovation when a sentiment is expressed and whether from caution or from confusion of ideas a clause is put in by way of qualifying it that turns it into nothing in this case if we would form a fair estimate of the tendency and probable effect of the whole passage the way is i take it to consider it as if no such clause were there nor let this seem strange taking the qualification into the account the sentiment would make no impression on the mind at all if it makes any the qualification is dropped and the mind is affected in the same manner nearly as it would be were the sentiment to stand unqualified this i think we may conclude to be the case with the passage above mentioned the word wantonly is in pursuance of our authors standing policy put in by way of salvo with it the sentiment is as much as comes to nothing without it it would be extravagant yet in this extravagant form it is probably if in any that it passes upon the reader the pleasant part of the contrivance is the mentioning of statutes and resolutions resolutions to wit that is decisions of courts of justice in the same breath as if whether it were by the one of them or the other that a rule of law was broke in upon made no difference by a resolution indeed a new resolution to break in upon a standing rule is a practice that in good truth is big with mischief but this mischief on what does it depend upon the rules being a reasonable one by no means but upon its being a standing an established one reasonable or not reasonable is what makes comparatively but a trifling difference a new resolution made in the teeth of an oldestablished rule is mischievous—on what account in that it puts mens expectations universally to a fault and shakes whatever confidence they may have in the stability of any rules of law reasonable or not reasonable that stability on which every thing that is valuable to a man depends beneficial be it in ever so high a degree to the party in whose favour it is made the benefit it is of to him can never be so great as to outweigh the mischief it is of to the community at large make the best of it it is general evil for the sake of partial good it is what lord bacon calls setting the whole house on fire in order to roast one mans eggs here then the salvo is not wanted a new resolution can never be acknowledged to be contrary to a standing rule but it must on that very account be acknowledged to be wanton let such a resolution be made and inconveniences in abundance will sure enough ensue and then will appear—what not by any means the wisdom of the rule but what is a very different thing the folly of breaking in upon it it were almost superfluous to remark that nothing of all this applies in general to a statute though particular statutes may be conceived that would thwart the course of expectation and by that means produce mischief in the same way in which it is produced by irregular resolutions a new statute it is manifest cannot unless it be simply a declaratory one be made in any case but it must break in upon some standing rule of law with regard to a statute then to tell us that a wanton one has produced inconveniences what is it but to tell us that a thing that has been mischievous has produced mischief of this temper are the arguments of all those doting politicians who when out of humour with a particular innovation without being able to tell why set themselves to declaim against all innovation because it is innovation it is the nature of owls to hate the light and it is the nature of those politicians who are wise by rote to detest every thing that forces them either to find what perhaps is impossible reasons for a favourite persuasion or what is not endurable to discard it r   comm     at the end of ch xvii which concludes with three pages against reformation our author had better perhaps on this occasion have kept clear of allegories he should have considered whether they might not be retorted on him with severe retaliation he should have considered that it is not easier to him to turn the law into a castle than it is to the imaginations of impoverished suitors to people it with harpies he should have thought of the den of cacus to whose enfeebled optics to whose habits of dark and secret rapine nothing was so hateful nothing so dangerous as the light of day s   comm     it is from the decisions of courts of justice that those rules of law are framed on the knowledge of which depend the life the fortune the liberty of every man in the nation of these decisions the records are according to our author   comm    the most authentic histories these records were till within these fiveandforty years in lawlatin a language which upon a high computation about one man in a thousand used to fancy himself to understand in this lawlatin it is that our author is satisfied they should have been continued because the pyramids of egypt have stood longer than the temples of palmyra he observes to us that the latin language could not express itself on the subject without borrowing a multitude of words from our own which is to help to convince us that of the two the former is the fittest to be employed he gives us to understand that taking it altogether there could be no room to complain of it seeing it was not more unintelligible than the jargon of the schoolmen some passages of which he instances and then he goes on this technical latin continued in use from the time of its first introduction till the subversion of our ancient constitution under cromwell when among many other innovations on the body of the law some for the better and some for the worse the language of our records was altered and turned into english but at the restoration of king charles this novelty was no longer countenanced the practisers finding it very difficult to express themselves so concisely or significantly in any other language but the latin and thus it continued without any sensible inconvenience till about the year    0 when it was again thought proper that the proceedings at law should be done into english and it was accordingly so ordered by statute   geo ii c    this was done continues our author in order that the common people might have knowledge and understanding of what was alleged or done for and against them in the process and pleadings the judgment and entries in a cause which purpose i know not how well it has answered but am apt to suspect that the people are now after many years experience altogether as ignorant in matters of law as before in this scornful passage the words novelty—done into english—apt to suspect—altogether as ignorant—sufficiently speak the affection of the mind that dictated it it is thus that our author chuckles over the supposed defeat of the legislature with a fond exultation which all his discretion could not persuade him to suppress the case is this a large portion of the body of the law was by the bigotry or artifice of lawyers locked up in an illegible character and in a foreign tongue the statute he mentions obliged them to give up their hieroglyphics and to restore the native language to its rights this was doing much but it was not doing every thing fiction tautology technicality circuity irregularity inconsistency remain but above all the pestilential breath of fiction poisons the sense of every instrument it comes near the consequence is that the law and especially that part of it which comes under the topic of procedure still wants much of being generally intelligible the fault then of the legislature is their not having done enough his quarrel with them is for having done any thing at all in doing what they did they set up a light which obscured by many remaining clouds is still but too apt to prove an ignis fatuus our author instead of calling for those clouds to be removed deprecates all light and pleads for total darkness not content with representing the alteration as useless he would persuade us too look upon it as mischievous he speaks of inconveniences what these inconveniences are it is pleasant to observe in the first place many young practisers spoilt by the indulgence of being permitted to carry on their business in their mothertongue know not how to read a record upon the old plan many clerks and attornies says our author are hardly able to read much less to understand a record of so modern a date as the reign of george the first what the mighty evil is here that is to outweigh the mischief of almost universal ignorance is not altogether clear whether it is that certain lawyers in a case that happens very rarely may be obliged to get assistance or that the business in such a case may pass from those who do not understand it to those who do in the next place he observes to us it has much enhanced the expense of all legal proceedings for since the practisers are confined for the sake of the stampduties which are thereby considerably increased to write only a stated number of words in a sheet and as the english language through the multitude of its particles is much more verbose than the latin it follows that the number of sheets must be very much augmented by the change i would fain persuade myself were it possible that this unhappy sophism could have passed upon the inventor the sum actually levied on the public on that score is upon the whole either a proper sum or it is not if it is why mention it as an evil if it is not what more obvious remedy than to set the duties lower after all what seems to be the real evil notwithstanding our authors unwillingness to believe it is that by means of this alteration men at large are in a somewhat better way of knowing what their lawyers are about and that a disinterested and enterprising legislator should happily such an one arise would now with somewhat less difficulty be able to see before him  vide infra ch iii par   p  0  t in the seventh chapter of the first book the king has attributes† he possesses ubiquity‡ he is allperfect and immortal∥ these childish paradoxes begotten upon servility by false wit are not more adverse to manly sentiment than to accurate apprehension far from contributing to place the institutions they are applied to in any clear point of view they serve but to dazzle and confound by giving to reality the air of fable it is true they are not altogether of our authors invention it is he however that has revived them and that with improvements and additions one might be apt to suppose they were no more than so many transient flashes of ornament it is quite otherwise he dwells upon them in sober sadness the attribute of ubiquity in particular he lays hold of and makes it the basis of a chain of reasoning he spins it out into consequences he makes one thing follow from it and another thing be so and so for the same reason and he uses emphatic terms as if for fear he should not be thought to be in earnest from the ubiquity says our author   comm p   0 it follows that the king can never be nonsuit for a nonsuit is the desertion of the suit or action by the nonappearance of the plaintiff in court—for the same reason also the king is not said to appear by his attorney as other men do for he always appears in contemplation of law in his own proper person this is the case so soon as you come to this last sentence of the paragraph for so long as you are at the last but two it is the regal office and not the royal person that is always present all this is so dryly and so strictly true that it serves as the groundwork of a metaphor that is brought in to embellish and enliven it the king we see is that is to say is not present in court the kings judges are present too so far is plain downright truth these judges then speaking metaphorically are so many lookingglasses which have this singular property that when a man looks at them instead of seeing his own face in them he sees the kings his judges says our author are the mirror by which the kings image is reflected †   comm     ‡   comm ch vii p             first edition ∥   comm ch vii p   0 first edition v the word demonstration may here seem at first sight to be out of place it will

perfect in the ratio of the number of acts of obedience to those of disobedience    the habit of obedience in this country appears to have been more perfect in the time of the saxons than in that of the britons unquestionably it is more so now than in the time of the saxons it is not yet so perfect as well contrived and well digested laws in time it is to be hoped may render it but absolutely perfect till man ceases to be man it never can be a very ingenious and instructive view of the progress of nations from the least perfect states of political union to that highly perfect state of it in which we live may be found in lord kames historical law tracts    for the convenience and accuracy of discourse it may be of use in this place to settle the signification of a few other expressions relative to the same subject persons who with respect to each other are in a state of political society may be said also to be in a state of political union or connexion    such of them as are subjects may accordingly be said to be in a state of submission or of subjection with respect to governors such as are governors in a state of authority with respect to subjects    when the subordination is considered as resulting originally from the will or it may be more proper to say the pleasure of the party governed we rather use the word submission when from that of the party governing the word subjection on this account it is that the term can scarcely be used without apology unless with a note of disapprobation especially in this country where the habit of considering the consent of the persons governed as being in some sense or other involved in the notion of all lawful that is all commendable government has gained so firm a ground it is on this account then that the term subjection excluding as it does or at least not including such consent is used commonly in what is called a bad sense that is in such a sense as together with the idea of the object in question conveys the accessary idea of disapprobation this accessary idea however annexed as it is to the abstract term subjection does not extend itself to the concrete term subjects—a kind of inconsistency of which there are many instances in language c it is true that every person must for some time at least after his birth necessarily be in a state of subjection with respect to his parents or those who stand in the place of parents to him and that a perfect one or at least as near to being a perfect one as any that we see but for all this the sort of society that is constituted by a state of subjection thus circumstanced does not come up to the idea that i believe is generally entertained by those who speak of a political society to constitute what is meant in general by that phrase a greater number of members is required or at least a duration capable of a longer continuance indeed for this purpose nothing less i take it than an indefinite duration is required a society to come within the notion of what is ordinarily meant by a political one must be such as in its nature is not incapable of continuing for ever in virtue of the principles which gave it birth this it is plain is not the case with such a family society of which a parent or a pair of parents are at the head in such a society the only principle of union which is certain and uniform in its operation is the natural weakness of those of its members that are in a state of subjection that is the children a principle which has but a short and limited continuance i question whether it be the case even with a family society subsisting in virtue of collateral consanguinity and that for the like reason not but that even in this case a habit of obedience as perfect as any we see examples of may subsist for a time to wit in virtue of the same moral principles which may protract a habit of filial obedience beyond the continuance of the physical ones which gave birth to it i mean affection gratitude awe the force of habit and the like but it is not long even in this case before the bond of connexion must either become imperceptible or lose its influence by being too extended these considerations therefore it will be proper to bear in mind in applying the definition of political society above given in par  0 and in order to reconcile it with what is said further on in par    d

the party is ignorant either of his having done the act itself which is forbidden by the law or else of his having done it in those circumstances in which alone it is forbidden   disobedience may be said to be unconscious with respect to the law when although he may know of his having done the act that is in reality forbidden and that under the circumstances in which it is forbidden he knows not of its being forbidden or at least of its being forbidden in these circumstances   so long as the business of spreading abroad the knowledge of the law continues to lie in the neglect in which it has lain hitherto instances of disobedience unconscious with respect to the law can never be otherwise than abundant g if examples be thought necessary theft may serve for an example of fraudulent

criminality in the eyes of some and the merits in the eyes of others have since been almost effaced by the splendour of more recent productions of the same pen the magnanimity of our author scorned perhaps or his circumspection feared to derive instruction from an enemy or what is still more probable he knew not that the subject had been so much as touched upon by that penetrating and acute metaphysician whose works lie so much out of the beaten tract of academic reading but here as it happens there is no matter for such fears those men who are most alarmed at the dangers of a free inquiry those who are most intimately convinced that the surest way to truth is by hearing nothing but on one side will i dare answer almost find nothing of that which they deem poison in this third volume i would not wish to send the reader to any other than this which if i recollect aright stands clear of the objections that have of late been urged with so much vehemence against the work in general as to the two first the author himself i am inclined to think is not illdisposed at present to join with those who are of opinion that they might without any great loss to the science of human nature be dispensed with the like might be said perhaps of a considerable part even of this but after all retrenchments there will still remain enough to have laid mankind under indelible obligations that the foundations of all virtue are laid in utility is there demonstrated after a few exceptions made with the strongest force of evidence but i see not any more than helvetius saw what need there was for the exceptions   for my own part i well remember no sooner had i read that part of the work which touches on this subject than i felt as if scales had fallen from my eyes i then for the first time learned to call the cause of the people the cause of virtue perhaps a short sketch of the wanderings of a raw but wellintentioned mind in its researches after moral truth may on this occasion be not unuseful for the history of one mind is the history of many the writings of the honest but prejudiced earl of clarendon to whose integrity nothing was wanting and to whose wisdom little but the fortune of living something later and the contagion of a monkish atmosphere these and other concurrent causes had listed my infant affections on the side of despotism the genius of the place i dwelt in the authority of the state the voice of the church in her solemn offices all these taught me to call charles a martyr and his opponents rebels i saw innovation where indeed innovation but a glorious innovation was in their efforts to withstand him i saw falsehood where indeed falsehood was in their disavowals of innovation i saw selfishness and an obedience to the call of passion in the efforts of the oppressed to rescue themselves from oppression i saw strong countenance lent in the sacred writings to monarchic government and none to any other i saw passive obedience deep stamped with the seal of the christian virtues of humility and selfdenial conversing with lawyers i found them full of the virtues of their original contract as a recipe of sovereign efficacy for reconciling the accidental necessity of resistance with the general duty of submission this drug of theirs they administered to me to calm my scruples but my unpractised stomach revolted against their opiate i bid them open to me that page of history in which the solemnization of this important contract was recorded they shrunk from this challenge nor could they when thus pressed do otherwise than our author has done confess the whole to be a fiction this methought looked ill it seemed to me the acknowledgement of a bad cause the bringing a fiction to support it to prove fiction indeed said i there is need of fiction but it is the characteristic of truth to need no proof but truth have you then really any such privilege as that of coining facts you are spending argument to no purpose indulge yourselves in the licence of supposing that to be true which is not and as well may you suppose that proposition itself to be true which you wish to prove as that other whereby you hope to prove it thus continued i unsatisfying and unsatisfied till i learnt to see that utility was the test and measure of all virtue of loyalty as much as any and that the obligation to minister to general happiness was an obligation paramount to and inclusive of every other having thus got the instruction i stood in need of i sat down to make my profit of it i bid adieu to the original contract and i left it to those to amuse themselves with this rattle who could think they needed it  by dr beattie in his essay on the immutability of truth i a compact or contract for the two words on this occasion at least are used in the same sense may i think be defined a pair of promises by two persons reciprocally given the one promise in consideration of the other k the importance which the observance of promises is of to the happiness of society is placed in a very striking and satisfactory point of view in a little apologue of montesquieu entitled the history of the troglodytes the troglodytes are a people who pay no regard to promises by the natural consequences of this disposition they fall from one scene of misery into another and are at last exterminated the same philosopher in his spirit of laws copying and refining upon the current jargon feigns a a law for this and other purposes after defining a law to be a relation how much more instructive on this head is the fable of the troglodytes than the pseudometaphysical sophistry of the esprit des loix  see the collection of his works  vide supra par    note i l to this denomination has of late been added or substituted the greatesthappiness or greatestfelicity principle this for shortness instead of saying at length that principle which states the greatest happiness of all those whose interest is in question as being the right and proper and only right and proper and universally desirable end of human action of human action in every situation and in partitular in that of a functionary or set of functionaries exercising the powers of government the word utility does not so clearly point to the ideas of pleasure and pain as the words happiness and felicity do nor does it lead us to the consideration of the number of the interests affected of the number as being the circumstance which contributes in the largest proportion to the formation of the standard here in question—the standard of right and wrong by which alone the propriety of human conduct in every situation can with propriety be tried this want of a sufficiently manifest connexion between the ideas of happiness and pleasure on the one hand and the idea of utility on the other i have every now and then found operating and with but too much efficiency as a bar to the acceptance that might otherwise have been given to this principle for further elucidation of the principle of utility or say greatesthappiness principle it may be some satisfaction to the reader to see a note inserted in a second edition now printing of a later work of the authors entitled an introduction to the principles of morals and legislation in chapter i subjoined to paragraph    is a note in these words—the principle of utility i have heard it said is a dangerous principle it is dangerous on certain occasions to consult it this is as much as to say—what that it is not consonant to utility to consult utility in short that it is not consulting it to consult it in the second edition to this note is added the following paragraph— explanation written   th july      relative to the above note not long after the publication of the fragment on government anno      in which in the character of an allcomprehensive and allcommanding principle the principle of utility was brought to view one person by whom observation to the above effect was made was alexander wedderburne at that time attorney or solicitorgeneral afterwards successively chiefjustice of the common pleas and chancellor of england under the successive titles of lord loughborough and earl of rosslyn it was made—not indeed in my hearing but in the hearing of a person by whom it was almost immediately communicated to me so far from being selfcontradictory it was i now see and confess a shrewd and perfectly true one by that distinguished functionary the state of the government was thoroughly understood by the obscure individual at that time not so much as supposed to be so his disquisitions had not been as yet applied with any thing like a comprehensive view to the field of constitutional law nor therefore to those features of the english government by which the greatest happiness of the ruling one with or without that of a favoured few are now so plainly seen to be the only ends to which the course of it has at any time been directed the principle of utility was an appellative at that time employed—employed by me as it has been by others to designate that which in a more perspicuous and instructive manner may as above be designated by the name of the greatesthappiness principle this principle said wedderburne is a dangerous one saying so he said that which to a certain extent is strictly true a principle which lays down as the only right and justifiable end of government the greatest happiness of the greatest number—how can it be denied to be a dangerous one dangerous to every government which has for its actual end or object the greatest happiness of a certain one with or without the addition of some comparatively small number of others whom it is matter of pleasure or accommodation to him to admit each of them to a share in the concern on the footing of so many junior partners dangerous it therefore really was to the interest—the sinister interest of all those functionaries himself included whose interest it was to maximize delay vexation and expense in judicial and other modes of procedure for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense in a government which had for its end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number alexander wedderburne might have been attorneygeneral and then chancellor but he would not have been attorneygeneral with £  000 ayear nor chancellor with a peerage

board navy board board of ordnance and board of works excepting from the business of all these offices the power of appointing persons to fill other subordinate offices a power which seems to be of a distinct nature from that of making disposition of any article of public property power political power is either over persons or over things the powers then that have been mentioned above in as far as they concern things are powers over such things as are the property of the public powers which differ in this from those which constitute private ownership in that the former are in the main not beneficial that is to the possessors themselves and indiscriminate but fiduciary and limited in their exercise to such acts as are conducive to the special purposes of public benefit and security c

from time to time to sit there by creation wisdom valour and property in common among the temporal peers and piety singly but entirely among my lords the bishops as to the other three endowments if there were any of them to which these right reverend persons could lay any decent claim it would be wisdom but since worldly wisdom is what it would be an ill compliment to attribute to them and the wisdom which is from above is fairly included under piety i conclude that when secured in the exclusive possession of this grand virtue they have all that was intended them there is a remarkable period in our history at which measuring by our authors scale these three virtues seem to have been at the boiling point it was in queen annes reign not long after the time of the hard frost i mean in the year      in that auspicious year these three virtues issued forth it seems with such exuberance as to furnish merit enough to stock no fewer than a dozen respectable persons who upon the strength of it were all made barons in a day unhappily indeed so little read was a right reverend and cotemporary historian in our authors method of discerning of spirits as to fancy it was neither more nor less than the necessity of making a majority that introduced so large a body of new members thus suddenly into the house but i leave it to those who are read in the history of that time to judge of the ground there can be for so romantic an imagination as to piety the peculiar endowment of the mitre the stock there is of that virtue should to judge by the like standard be at all times pretty much upon a level at all times without question at a maximum this is what we can make the less doubt of since with regard to ecclesiastical matters in general our author as in another place he assures

faith and to avoid irritating the body of the nation to take some method for making the establishment of the new law depend upon their sentiments one such method might be as follows—let the new law in question be enacted in the common form but let its commencement be deferred to a distant period suppose a year or two let it then at the end of that period be in force unless petitioned against by persons of such a description and in such number as might be supposed fairly to represent the sentiments of the people in general persons for instance of the description of those who at the time of the union constituted the body of electors to put the validity of the law out of dispute it would be necessary the fact upon which it was made ultimately to depend should be in its nature too notorious to be controverted to determine therefore whether the conditions upon which the invalidation of it was made to depend had been complied with is what must be left to the simple declaration of some person or persons for instance the king i offer this only as a general idea and as one amongst many that perhaps might be offered in the same view it will not be expected that i should here answer objections or enter into details  comm p    a with this note let no man trouble himself who is not used or does not intend to use himself to what are called metaphysical speculations in whose estimation the benefit of understanding clearly what he is speaking of is not worth the labour   that may be said to be my duty to do understand political duty which you or some other person or persons have a right to have me made to do i have then a duty towards you you have a right as against me   what you have a right to have me made to do understand a political right is that which i am liable according to law upon a requisition made on your behalf to be punished for not doing   i say punished for without the notion of punishment that is of pain annexed to an act and accruing on a certain account and from a certain source no notion can we have of either right or duty   now the idea belonging to the word pain is a simple one to define or rather to speak more generally to expound a word is to resolve or to make a progress towards resolving the idea belonging to it into simple ones   for expounding the words duty right power title and those other terms of the same stamp that abound so much in ethics and jurisprudence either i am much deceived or the only method by which any instruction can be conveyed is that which is here exemplified an exposition framed after this method i would term paraphrasis   a word may be said to be expounded by paraphrasis when not that word alone is translated into other words but some whole sentence of which it forms a part is translated into another sentence the words of which latter are expressive of such ideas as are simple or are more immediately resolvable into simple ones than those of the former such are those expressive of substances and simple modes in respect of such abstract terms as are expressive of what locke has called mixed modes this in short is the only method in which any abstract terms can at the long run be expounded to any instructive purpose that is in terms calculated to raise images either of substances perceived or of emotions—sources one or other of which every idea must be drawn from to be a clear one   the common method of defining—the method per genus et differentiam as logicians call it will in many cases not at all answer the purpose among abstract terms we soon come to such as have no superior genus a definition per genus et differentiam when applied to these it is manifest can make no advance it must either stop short or turn back as it were upon itself in a circulate or a repetend   fortitude is a virtue—very well—but what is a virtue a virtue is a disposition—good again—but what is a disposition a disposition is a    and there we stop the fact is a disposition has no superior genus a disposition is not a    anything—this is not the way to give us any notion of what is meant by it a power again is a right and what is a right it is a power an estate is an interest says our author somewhere where he begins defining an estate—as well might he have said an interest was an estate as well in short were it to define in this manner a conjunction or a preposition as well were it to say of the preposition through or of the conjunction because a through is a    or a because is a    and so go on defining them   of this stamp by the bye are some of his most fundamental definitions of consequence they must leave the reader where they found him but of this perhaps more fully and methodically on some future occasion in the mean time i have thrown out these loose hints for the consideration of the curious b   one may conceive three sorts of duties political moral and religious correspondent to the three sorts of sanctions by which they are enforced or the same point of conduct may be a mans duty on these three several accounts after speaking of the one of these to put the change upon the reader and without warning begin speaking of another or not to let it be seen from the first which of them one is speaking of cannot but be productive of confusion   political duty is created by punishment or at least by the will of persons who have punishment in their hands persons stated and certain—political superiors   religious duty is also created by punishment by punishment expected at the hands of a person certain—the supreme being   moral duty is created by a kind of motive which from the uncertainty of the persons to apply it and of the species and degree in which it will be applied has hardly yet got the name of punishment by various mortifications resulting from the illwill of persons uncertain and variable—the community in general that is such individuals of that community as he whose duty is in question shall happen to be connected with   when in any of these three senses a man asserts a point of conduct to be a duty what he asserts is the existence actual or probable of an external event viz of a punishment issuing from one or other of these sources in consequence of a contravention of the duty an event extrinsic to and distinct from as well the conduct of the party spoken of as the sentiment of him who speaks—if he persists in asserting it to be a duty but without meaning it should be understood that it is on any one of these three accounts that he looks upon it as such all he then asserts is his own internal sentiment all he means then is that he feels himself pleased or displeased at the thoughts of the point of conduct in question but without being able to tell why in this case he should een say so and not seek to give an undue influence to his own single suffrage by delivering it in terms that purport to declare the voice either of god or of the law or of the people   now which of all these senses of the word our author had in mind in which of them all he meant to assert that it was the duty of supreme governors to make laws i know not political duty is what they cannot be subject to and to say that a duty even of the moral or religous kind to this effect is incumbent on them seems rather a precipitate assertion in truth what he meant was neither more nor less i suppose than that he should be glad to see them do what he is speaking of to wit make laws that is as he explains himself spread abroad the knowledge of them—would he so so indeed should i and if asked why what answer our author would give i know not but i for my part have no difficulty i answer—because i am persuaded that it is for the benefit of the community that they its governors should do so this would be enough to warrant me in my own opinion for saying that they ought to do it for all this i should not at any rate say that is was their duty in a political sense no more should i venture to say it was in a moral or religious sense till i were satisfied whether they themselves thought the measures useful and feasible and whether they were generally supposed to think so were i satisfied that they themselves thought so god then i might say knows they do god we are to suppose will punish them if they neglect pursuing it it is then their religious duty were i satisfied that the people supposed they thought so the people i might say in case of such neglect—the people by various manifestations of its illwill will also punish them it is then their moral duty in any of these senses it must be observed there can be no more propriety in averring it to be the duty of the supreme power to pursue the measure in question than in averring it to be their duty to pursue any other supposable measure equally beneficial to the community to usher in the proposal of a measure in this peremptory and assuming guise may be pardonable in a loose rhetorical harangue but can never be justifiable in an exact didactic composition modes of private moral conduct there are indeed many the tendency whereof is so well known and so generally acknowledged that the observance of them may be well styled a duty but to apply the same term to the particular details of legislative conduct especially newly proposed ones is going i think too far and tends only to confusion  see the note following c i mean

necessary causes up to a certain point also it is in our power to repulse evil from and attract good to ourselves there is also in human nature a feeling of confidence in happiness which prevails over the fear of its loss this is evidenced by the success of lotteries  a general right of property in any thing is possessed when it may be used every way with the exception of certain uses which are forbidden by special reasons these reasons may be referred to three heads—   private detriment—when a certain use of the thing would be injurious to a certain other individual either in his fortune or otherwise sic utere tuo ut alium non lædas sic utere tuo ut alienum non lædas   public detriment—such as may result to the community in general sic utere tuo ut rem publicam non lædas   detriment to

unlimited right over any object of property would be the right to commit nearly every crime if i had such a right over the stick i am about to cut i might employ it as a mace to knock down the

certain motives it is another thing to perceive their influence there is no action or judgment without motive no effect without a cause but in order to understand the influence which a motive has over

english public the editor has taken the volume entitled théorie des peines published by m dumont as the groundwork of his labours but having availed himself wherever he could of the original manuscripts his will in many instances not be found a literal translation of m dumonts work  in the french there exists for the designation of the act one name viz punition—acte de punition and for the designation of the evil the result or produce of that act another name viz peine but though exempt from the ambiguity by which as above the english language is deteriorated the french labours under another by the word peine the result is indeed secured against being confounded with the act that caused it but on the other hand the use of this word is not confined to the case in which the object designated by it is the result of an act emanating from the will of a sentient being it is at least as frequently employed to designate the object itself without regard to the cause by which it has been produced besides being too broad in one direction the import of it is too narrow in another it is synonymous to and not more than coextensive with douleur it fails of including that modification of evil which is of the purely negative cast consisting of the absence certain or more or less probable of this or that modification of pleasure  to him who would understand what he hears or what he says positive and negative are adjuncts the use of which is not more necessary in electricity and galvanism than in law and especially in penal law  the distinctions between these several objects may be illustrated by an example in      a jury gave a verdict of £ 000 damages against the earl of halifax for the wrongful imprisonment of john wilkes esq on suspicion of being the author of a state libel it may be inquired what sort of act did the jury perform when by giving this verdict they appointed the sum in question to be paid by the one person to the other it was intended to be an act of punishment if any juryman being angry with lord halifax also intended to produce pain in him on account of the pleasure he took in thinking of that pain in the case of such juryman it was an act of vengeance being done however on account of an act that had been done viz the imprisonment of mr wilkes it was not an act of antipathy if any juryman did it with a view of deterring lord halifax or any one who might occupy that noblemans place in future from doing acts of the like kind and of preventing the mischief apprehended from such acts it was in him an act for amendment and determent it could not however operate for the purpose of disablement the paying of a sum of money having no tendency to disable lord halifax or those holding the same office from imprisoning others who might become the objects of their dislike it was not an act of immediate selfdefence for selfdefence implies attack that is implies that there is some person who is actually using his endeavours to do mischief to the party defending himself if however any juryman thinking himself in danger of suffering in the like or any other manner from lord h and persons liable to act as he did joined in the verdict with the view of preserving himself from such suffering to wit by means of the restraint which the fear of similar punishment might be expected to impose on lord halifax and such other persons on the part of such juryman it was an act of selfpreservation the payment of the fine imposed could contribute nothing to the purposes of safe custody or physical restraint neither was it an act of compulsion for it was not designed as a means of compelling him to do anything it was not an act of torture the penalty if paid was paid instantaneously the act of paying ceasing of itself and not being capable of being protracted so as to be made to cease only at a future given instance if any juryman did it with the view of making mr wilkes amends for the pain he had suffered by the supposed injury in question in such juryman it was an act of compensation and if the juryman who intended to make compensation to mr wilkes also thought that it was right to tax lord halifax to the amount of the compensation proper to be given to mr wilkes it was an act of taxation  introduction to principles of morals and legislation † see principles of morals and legislation ch    page    of the consequences of a mischievous act—the mischief of an offence may frequently be distinguished as it were into two shares or parcels the one containing what may be called the primary the other what may

fallen into this mistake speaking of smuggling he says the law contrary to all the ordinary principles of justice first creates the temptation and then punishes those who yield to it and it commonly enhances the punishment too in proportion to the very circumstance which ought certainly to alleviate it—the temptation to commit the crime—wealth of nations b v ch   † it is easy to estimate the profit of a crime in cases of rapacity but how are we to ascertain it in those of malice and enmity the profit may be estimated by the nature of the mischief that the offender has done to his

degree of suffering he has inflicted in this in his own opinion consists the profit of his offence if then he is punished in an analogous manner he is struck in the most sensible part which has so to speak been pointed out by himself for it is not possible but that the mischief which he has chosen as the instrument of his vengeance must appear hurtful to himself ‡ montesquieu after having recommended this rule of proportion adds quand il ny a point de difference dans la peine il faut en mettre dans lesperance de la gráce en angleterre on nassassine point il auroit du dire peu parce que les voleurs peuvent esperer dêtre transportés dans les colonies non pas les assassines—esprit des lois lib vi ch    this expectation of favour no doubt contributes to the effect of which he speaks but why should this manifest imperfection in the laws remain that it may be corrected by an arbitrary act of the sovereign if an uncertain advantage produces this measure of good a certain advantage would operate more surely  see introduction to morals and legislation—circumstances influencing sensibility  senec de clem chap xxii note by dumont i subjoin to this chapter an example of the progressive march of thought and of the utility of these enumerations to which every new observation may be referred so that nothing may be lost i have sought out from the works of montesquieu all the qualities which he appears to have regarded as necessary in a lot of punishment i have found only four and these are either expressed by indefinite terms or periphrasis—   he says that punishments should be drawn from the nature of the crimes and he appears to mean that they should be characteristic   that they should be moderate an expression which is indeterminate and does not yield any point of comparison   that they should be proportional to the crime this proportion has reference however rather to the quantity of the punishment than to its quality he has neither explained in what it consists nor given any rule respecting it   that they should be modest beccaria has mentioned four qualities—   he requires that punishments should be analogous to the crimes but he does not enter into any detail upon this analogy   that they should be public and he means by that exemplary   that they be gentle an improper and unsignificant term whilst his observations upon the danger of excess in punishment are very judicious   that they should be proportional but he gives no rule for this proportion he requires besides this that they should be certain prompt and inevitable but these circumstances depend upon the forms of procedure in the application of punishment and not upon its qualities in his commentary upon beccaria voltaire often recurs to the idea of rendering punishments profitable—a dead man is good for nothing one of the heroes of humanity the good and amiable howard had continually in view the amendment of delinquents confining our attention to those who are considered as oracles in this branch of science we cannot but observe that between these scattered ideas and vague conceptions which have not yet received a name and a regular catalogue in which these qualities are distinctly presented to us with names and definitions there is a wide interval by thus placing them under one point of view another advantage is gained their true worth and comparative importance is determined montesquieu was dazzled by the merit of analogy in a punishment and has attributed to it wonderful effects which it does not possess—esprit des lois xii   these considerations appear to afford a sufficient answer to the objection often raised against the methodic forms employed by mr bentham i refer to his divisions tables and classifications which have been called his logical apparatus all this it has been said is only the scaffold which ought to be taken down when the building is erected but why deprive his readers of the instruments which the author has employed why hide from them his analytical labours and process of invention these tables form a machine for thought—organum cogitativum the author discloses his secret he associates his readers with him in his labour he gives them the clue which has guided him in his researches and enables them to verify his results the singularity is this—the extent of the service diminishes its value i am sensible that by employing these logical methods as a secret—by not exhibiting so to speak the skeleton the muscles the nerves much would be gained in elegance and interest by using the method of analysis everything is announced beforehand—there is nothing unexpected—the whole is clear and there are no points of surprise—no flashes of genius to dazzle for a moment and then leave you in darkness it requires courage to follow up so severe a method but it is the only method which can completely satisfy the mind  thus from the idea of a giant the mind passes on to every thing that is great the liliputians called gulliver the manmountain or from the idea of a giant the mind may pass to that of a dwarf † the employment of this means of destruction ought however to be considered an aggravation if there has been any danger of the fire communicating to contiguous objects note by dumont i am not aware of any objection having been urged against the utility of analogy in punishments whilst it is spoken of only in general terms everybody acknowledges its propriety when we proceed to apply the principle the imagination being the chief judge of the propriety of its application the diversity of opinion is infinite hence some persons have been struck with extreme repugnance in contemplating the analogous punishments proposed by mr benthama whilst others have considered them only as fit subjects for ridicule and caricature success depends upon the choice of the means employed those sources of analogy ought therefore to be avoided which are not of a sufficiently grave character to be used as punishments but it may be observed that with relation to certain offences those for instance which are accompanied by insolence and insult that an analogous punishment which excites ridicule is well calculated to humble the pride of the offender and gratify the offended party every thing ought also to be avoided which has an appearance of great study and refinement punishment ought only to be inflicted of necessity and with feelings of regret and repugnance the multitude of instruments possessed by a surgeon may be contemplated with satisfaction as intended to promote the cure and lessen the weight of our sufferings the same satisfaction will not however be felt in contemplating a variety of punishments and they will most likely be considered as degrading to the character of the legislator with these precautions analogy is calculated to produce only good effects it puts us in the track of discovering the most economical and efficacious punishments i cannot resist the pleasure of citing an example furnished me by a captain in the english navy he had not studied the principles of mr bentham but he knew how to read the human heart the leave of absence generally granted to sailors was for twentyfour hours if they exceeded this time the ordinary punishment was the catoninetails the dread of this punishment was a frequent cause of desertions many captains in order to prevent both these offences refused all leave of absence to their sailors so that they were kept on shipboard for years together the individual to whom i refer discovered a method of reconciling the granting of leave with the security of the service he made a simple change in the punishment—every man who exceeded his prescribed time of leave lost his right to a future leave in proportion to his fault if he remained on shore more than twentyfour hours he lost one turn if more than fortyeight hours he lost two turns and so of the rest the experiment was perfectly successful the fault became less frequent and desertions were unknown a traites de legislation  the law of retaliation was often adopted in the early attempts at legislation among the laws of alfred we find the following article—si quis alterius occulum effoderit compenset proprio dentem pro dente manum pro manu pedem pro pede adustionem pro adustione vulnus pro vulnere vimen pro vimine—wilk ll ang sax p  0 art     it is said that in one of the cities of greece among the young women instigated by i know not what disease of the imagination the practice of suicide was for a time extremely prevalent the magistrates alarmed by its frequency ordered that as a sort of posthumous punishment their bodies in a state of nudity should be drawn through the public places into the truth of the relation it is needless to inquire but the narrator adds the offence thenceforth altogether ceased here then is an instance of the utility of a law offensive to modesty proved by its efficacy for what higher degree of perfection can be looked for in any penal law than that of preventing the offence  i am sensible how imperfectly the word afflictive is calculated to express the particular kind of punishment i have here employed it to express in contradistinction to all others but i could find no other word in the language that would do it better it may be some reason for employing it thus that in french it is employed in a sense nearly if not altogether as confineda and the pains it is the nature of the punishments in question to produce cicero expresses by a word of the same root—adflictatio says that

the chinese owing perhaps to the extensive use they make of this mode of punishment have attempted by fixing the length and breadth at the extremities and weight of the bamboo to render uniform the amount of the suffering produced by this mode of punishment but one material circumstance that they have omitted to regulate and certainly the most difficult to regulate is the degree of force with which the stroke is to be applied an omission that leaves the uncertainty nearly in the same state as in this country—see the penal code of china translated by sir g t staunton p     the first may be included under the general name of deformation the second under the name of dishabilitation they render the organ impotent and useless the third has already a proper name—mutilation † scarification

accidental incision may leave a similar one corrosion by chemical caustics may not be liable to the same inconvenience but its effects have not been tried  stedman relates a fact which proves what has been above said of the indefinite consequences of these punishments speaking of a frenchman named destrades who had introduced the culture of indigo into surinam and who during many years had enjoyed general esteem in that colony he states that being at the house of one of his friends in demerara he became ill of an abscess which formed in his shoulder he would not suffer it to be examined it became dangerously worse but his resistance remained still the same at last not hoping for a cure he put an end to his life with a pistolball when the secret was revealed it was found that his shoulder was marked with a letter v or voleur—narrative of an expedition against the revolted negroes of surinam by major stedman ch     this inconvenience would be apt to be attended with effects of

for the forgery for which he was afterwards tried under the laws of great britain and executed proper care was not taken to protect him from this ideal contamination if this be true before he was

circumstances that could not but serve to determine such a choice would naturally be such as were of a temporary nature this accordingly was the case with an act of the british parliament which

properly noticed here—it destroys one source of testimonial proof the archives of crime are in a measure lodged in the bosoms of criminals at their death all the recollections which they possess relative to their own crimes and those of others perish their death is an act of impunity for all those who might have been detected by their testimony whilst innocence must continue oppressed and the right can never be established because a necessary witness is subtracted whilst a criminal process is going forward the accomplices of the accused flee and hide themselves it is an interval of anxiety

honour which unites him to them it needs only a moment of repentance to snatch from him those discoveries which he only can make and without his repentance what is more natural than a feeling of vengeance against those who caused him to lose his liberty and who though equally culpable with himself yet continue in the enjoyment of liberty he need only listen to his interest and purchase by some useful information some relaxation of the rigour of his punishment  observe that juryman in a blue coat said one of the judges at the old bailey to judge nares do you see him yes well there will

tom i disc prelim c the way in which the import of the word forfeiture is connected with sensible ideas seems to be as follows the words to forfeit come either immediately or through the medium of the old french from the modern latin word forisfacere foris means out of doors or out of the house facere is to make or to cause to be the conceit then is that when any object is in a mans possession it is as it were within doors—within his house any act therefore which in consequence of some operation of the law has the effect of causing the object to be no longer in his possession has the effect of causing it as it were to be out of his doors and no longer within his house † forfeiture is in some cases though rarely applied to corporal punishments thus capital punishment is called forfeiture of life mutilation forfeiture of limbs or members it is also with the addition of the word liberty applied to corporal punishments of the restrictive classes as in the case of imprisonment and quasi imprisonment the other modes of confinement require further additions to be made to them as to express foreign banishment forfeiture of the liberty of residing in any part of the dominions of the

strictly spontaneous gratuitous depend altogether upon goodwill upon the goodwill of the party rendering them to the party to whom they are rendered this goodwill depends in great measure upon the reputation of the party to whom they are rendered † a share beneficial or fiduciary in the use of such a quantity of money of such an estate in land a share in such an office of power or trust an exemption from such a tax or other public burthen the exclusive privilege of such or such an occupation  forfeiture of protection may be considered also in another point of view as being the forfeiture of the services of such ministers of justice whose office it is to afford a man protection in the enjoyment of the possession in question  i am conscious that the distinction here stated between the direct and indirect way of rendering ill offices is far enough from being explicit but there would be no way of making it so without despatching a large and intricate title of the doctrine of offences  though infamy is the more common for feiture of reputation is the more convenient expression of the two infamy is a term which appears forced when applied to any other than very high degrees of the punishment in question the phrase forfeiture of reputation is accommodated to one degree as well as another for the quantity of reputation may be conceived to be divided into as many lots or degrees as there can be reason for the turn and structure of language having put a mans reputation like his estate upon the footing of his possessions men have considered and spoken of the subject as if it were a quantity alike determinate and as if a man might be made to forfeit the whole of his reputation at a single stroke as he may the whole of his estate but that this though possible in the latter instance is impossible in the former will presently be seen by tracing up these fictitious objects of possession to the real objects from whence they are respectively derived a mans estate is derived out of things out of certain determinate allotments of things moveable or immoveable or if any part of it be derived immediately out of persons it is derived out of the services of a few persons and those persons and very frequently those services due from each person determinate and certain but a mans reputation is derived immediately out of persons out of the services of persons out of any services of any persons whatsoever out of the services of as many persons be they who they may as choose to render him any this is a stock which the political magistrate can never perhaps by any one operation nor indeed by any number of operations of any kind be certain of exhausting much less by any such vague and feeble operations as those are by which an offender is commonly understood to have been made to incur the forfeiture of reputation that is the punishment of infamy if there be it is that punishment which if the vulgar tradition is to be depended upon was inflicted by richard iii on jane shore—the direct prohibiting of all persons from rendering to the offender any kind of service but this is but in other words the punishment of starving the same punishment has sometimes been denounced in other countries where being strictly executed it has been as it could not but be attended with that effecta a case of the albigenses—see rapin monfort—see watsons phil  d

of that stamp  in certain offences against the police—for instance in selling bread by shortweight—it is not an uncommon thing where the degree of delinquency appears to be considerable for the magistrate to threaten the offender that upon the next conviction he shall be advertised in the newspapers such a punishment seems to be looked upon as more severe than the fine imposed by statute † when the punishment is capital or the sentence discretionary it is common with us in england to preface it with such a speech ‡ aware of this circumstance the roman lawyers have taken a distinction

expectations of the people can never keep pace differently narrowed and modified by the different laws of various states with us it is not in every instance that a man is permitted to succeed to his

of the evils he points out continue unabated—ed if convicts are still to be transported hither the only chance of their reformation consists in scattering them widely over the country and giving them pastoral habits convict transportation is at best a bad system of colonization and governor macquarrie by his preference of the convict to the free made it worse for the plantation and totally inoperative as the penalty of felony or the penitentiary of vice the evils and expense of the transportation system would certainly be lessened by placing the convicts more in the service of farming and grazing settlers out of the reach of the temptations and evil communications of large towns the establishment of which was too much the policy of the late governor the salutary life of a shepherd or a stockman would gradually soften the heart of the most hardened convict but instead of this governor macquarries system was to keep them congregated in barracks and employed at a ration of a pound and a half of meat and the same quantity of flour per diem upon showy public buildings of wretches possessed of no better means of reformation than these it could not be expected that industrious

preparatory act if he had fired at a person or an assemblage of persons this would have been an attempt—if he had killed any one he would have committed the crime known under the name of homicide  the following anecdote is related on good authority there was a riot at madrid under charles iii occasioned by the prohibition against wearing round hats this prohibition was not a matter of caprice the large and slouched hats prohibited served when a cloak was thrown over the shoulders completely to conceal the person under this disguise a thief or an assassin could strike his blow and never be recognised the prohibition was therefore proper but no preparation had been made for it it wounded a general custom—it appeared to be an attack upon liberty the people assembled round the palace the guards wished to repulse them the tumult became violent blood was shed the court was intimidated and left madrid and the minister was obliged to give way a short time after this triumph of the round hats the count daranda being made minister he enjoined all the executioners in all the towns of spain to wear round hats in a fortnight no more round hats were seen this is an example of indirect legislation which may be referred to this head  care ought to be taken not to encourage that spirit of foundations and alms which has too frequently arisen from the vulgar notions of christianity they increase the number of the poor more than they relieve them such are the convents of the monks and their daily distributions in spain and italy which create a numerous class of beggars and are equivalent to a law whereby industry is taxed in favour of idleness  loose hints on education p     † by an act of william iv the treasury are authorized to dispense with all oaths which they do not consider necessary in the collection of the revenue and to substitute declarations as to the acts in their stead  the two punishments employed were called one the little idleness the other the great idleness nothing could be more ingenious than thus giving to punishment itself the name and character of a vice the salutary association of ideas which results from it is immediately perceived  this is the plan adopted by the east india company formerly it was the council of madras or calcutta which decided every thing by a plurality of votes at present the governor ought to consult the council and each member ought to give his opinion in writing but they have no vote—they are simply advisers the governor decides every thing in the last resort consequently it is not sufficient for him to gain a majority in the council to elude the responsibility which rests altogether upon him  reprinted in almons remembrancer no    p      this does not extend to extraordinary circumstances similar to those under which the habeas corpus act has been suspended in england with known precautions  assurance is good because the assurer is prepared to sustain the loss and considers the premium he has received as the equivalent for the risk which he runs but this remedy is imperfect in itself because it is always necessary to pay the premium which is a certain loss in order to guarantee ones self against an uncertain loss in this point of view it is to be desired that all unforeseen losses which can fall upon individuals without their fault were covered at the public expense the greater the number of contributors the less sensible is the loss for each one it must be observed on the other side that a public fund is more exposed to fraud and waste than the funds of individuals lowes which fall directly upon individuals give the greatest possible force to the motives to vigilance and economy
