wood mr weston mr warner mr williams mr wilson mr yates mr zuckert to mr william powell sir the following pieces are the production of my leisure hours they are imperfect to a degree too full of expletives and incongruity nothing could have induced me to have published them now but my having promised them my friends these two years and rather than they should accuse me of being worse than my word i have ventured to expose myself to the censure of the world and the judgment of the reviewers but as they are my first productions i could wish to be overlooked on the promise they shall be my last  when i wrote them indeed i had the vanity like all young authors to think i was smitten with the muses but now to my grief i too clearly see that i have smitten them with a stab of disgrace having disturbed and made muddy the peerless stream of helicon my pretensions to letters must appear the highest presumption from many reasons first from my humble and obscure situation and secondly from my being deprived of a classical education etc for great scholars like great rogues can take such liberties as little ones dare not think of  i have only this one consolation that as my reputation as an author is but little i have the less to loose  i dont doubt but this will be an unwelcome offering but i have presumed to inscribe it to you because i know you bear me that friendship that were you sure to derogate by such a reception you would take it as it was meant the only acknowledgment i had left in return for the many favors i have received and the good endeavors you have made to serve me though they unfortunately proved ineffectual dependence on theaters are as fatal and as transitory as at court and the promises of a manager are as baseless as those of a statesman so fond are all degrees of apeing their betters this i have a right to speak being prompted both by fact and experience i cannot say indeed i had ever any great dependence at court but to my sorrow i know it and at this moment feel the fatal consequence of depending on theaters and the alluring promises bound with the sacred ties of honor and friendship of managers  had i not been told by my friends and these too in my opinion the best judges of the age such as mr churchill mr lloyd mrs cibber and yourself that i was possessed of some requisites for the stage i had never attempted it prompted by this and conscious of the right i as an individual had to an attempt and strenghtend by the obligations that the theaters when in a drooping state were once under to my father for his many excellent and received entertainments i was flattered into hope and expectation giving up all my other connections in life and sacrificing all other interests to the seeming friendship and solemn promises of mr l  who like a sorcerer led me into a labyrinth of delusion and left me to bewail my situation in oblivion could i but recall the whole two years expense the loss of time and prevent the inevitable destruction of a dear and tender family i would forgive the heavy load of anxiety the daily expectations and the hourly disappointments that i met with their frowns of authority their shafts of impunity their stare of despotism and their sneers of contumely all these i could forget but that my wounds still bleed and pain begets remembrance  i am dear sir with the greatest respect and sincerity your very humble servant george saville carey  the inoculator a comedy in three acts  dramatis personae pittem an inoculating doctor blandford a young gentleman in love with miss danbury hierapicra pittems apothecary pestle his servant jerry servant to blandfords uncle knabbem a bailiff mrs buzby mr blandford in disguise the inoculator act i scene i pittems parlour pittem solus what a pleasure there is in getting money could we but forget we were to die it would be the zenith of felicity  enter pestle pestle sir mr blandford is below and desires to speak with you   pit odds so i am very busy too just now tell him to call again byandby  no no pestle pestle tell him to walk up do you hear   pestle i will sir exit pestle   pit what the plague does he want here again so soon it was but yesterday that he was plaguing me to death about miss danbury and if i thought he had been come again on the same errand i would have sent him word i was sick but here he comes   enter blandford bland good morning to you doctor   pit mr blandford your very humble servant how do you this dull morning igad i was threatening to go to bed again   bland to bed doctor what before you are well up or have your medical studies kept you from sleeping all night   pit no  but i have got a nasty something hanging on my spirits   bland youre safe enough you know a dog and a doctor know how to choose their physic   pit an excellent compliment aside as your kind of gentry know how to choose the best wh  res   bland i beg your pardon doctor there is no best in the case the best of the bad is not worth choosing but if you have no more skill in medicines than i have in filles de joye i would not give a fig for your practice talking of the fair puts me in mind of poor miss danbury never was so good a heart so much depressed with blooming beauty and a soul angelic she drags a life of woe and keeps the shield of virtue on her arm while her hand rejects with scorn the tempting bribes of gay debauchery   pit what then you young rogue you have tried her i suppose but she knew you had nothing to give her but promises and so thought in that case she might as well put on the prude as not   bland let me tell you doctor that is a damned illnatured surmise and did i not think you spoke it more out of raillery than sincerity i should for ever hold the most contemptible opinion of you as a man   pit why you did not think i was in earnest did you ned   bland no  if i had   pit you would have been for running me through the body i suppose but i assure you the world says strange things of the girl   bland aye it is a strange world doctor   pit nay but from the many pitiful tricks that i have detected her in myself i am determined to have nothing to do with her   bland you would have had it is well known if she would have let you   pit there is for you now that is like her i did imagine indeed when i ceased to support the ungrateful hussy in her flaunting expectations she would raise some scandalous report or other to hurt me in my character and business oh the jade had it not been for the great regard i had for the father she should have shifted for herself long ago   bland your regard for her father   pit aye my regard for her father   bland why what great regard could you have for him when i have often heard you say he died five hundred pounds in your debt   pit why though he was an unfortunate man he was an honest one as far as his circumstances would go   bland that is one of the most grateful confessions i ever heard you make of any man before   pit i had ever the most favorable opinion of every man and was always more inclined to hide than expose their misfortunes   bland that is well again so shall your own words convict you   pit as how   bland why if you were inclined to think the most favorably of man you must in reason think the same of woman kind   pit and so i do   bland good again and what has poor miss danbury done that every thought of her is bad and your best opinion but a sordid one   pit aye but facts my dear ned are facts and the general and perpetual complaints of the world are circumstances too glaring to be overlooked   bland what the world says in those cases ought never to be regarded for such reports generally arise from the inventive gossips of a tea table and there is a species of barbarity that reigns predominant in the breasts of the lowminded vulgar whenever they perceive an object of merit that was once their envy under the least misfortune they are never so happy as when doing that person some secret injury or till by some malignant conspiracy they have reduced them to a state of adversity   pit and can you say that this is her case   bland yes truly for it is well known that miss danbury was scarce three years ago the admiration and envy of the country for ten miles round and now the veriest drab that was wont to think herself honored with a courtsy from her will with a provoking sneer tell her to shorten her furbelows and since they have found her whole dependence is on you they have injured her by imposing on you some malicious falsehood on the mere supposition of which i find you are determined to complete her misery   pit nay mr blandford it is not for that entirely but from the very great expense she has been to me of late and as i find that hurts my circumstances considerably it is a duty i owe myself not to let her ruin me entirely i have made her many good offers nay i made interest for her to a gentleman and lady who were going to south carolina where they told her she would have the greatest opportunity in the world of making her fortune all which she ungratefully rejected and as i am under no manner of obligation to her or hers i think i have done for her already what hundreds would not have done in truth therefore she must now shift for herself as well as she can   bland poor girl i cannot blame her it is strange so great a tenderness mr danbury had for her when living that he did not make some provision for her at his death   pit that is the astonishment of every one but what could a man do that had it not in his power   bland that is still more strange for every body thought him a man of property   pit ah ned you see with what art some people can support a false reputatian and when their affairs come once to be laid open to inspection many a worthy family that has trusted their all in their hands from too good an opinion of their circumstances find too often a broken back in the consequence   bland well i wish the dear creature was better provided for or that i had it in my power to make her the happiest woman in the universe   pit how would you do that   bland why i would endeavor to do it by marrying her and setting her above the frowns of the world   pit and a promising dame you would get for your pains  ah ned i pity you i must confess  but plague on it if you are so wonderfully smitten with the wench why dont you marry her   bland because i am not at present possessed of those requisites that would be essential to our happiness   pit that is a little money i suppose   bland you suppose right would the kind powers be pleased to take that dear pious mercenary uncle to themselves i should be glad to fill up his vacancy here below without any further consideration   pit aye my dear boy but your uncle takes a deal of care of his constitution and is as likely to live thirty years longer as yourself you should have taken better care of the last five hundred ned   bland why i confess if i had been as penurious as you i probably might have increased it to a thousand by this time and neither have done myself nor any body else any good with it   pit if you had it now i dont think you would do yourself much good with it by marrying miss danbury   bland you are determined i find to do her no good either by word or deed and therefore doctor i beg you would not give me any more of your cool opinions since you cannot give her a good word you shall not dare to give her a bad one in my company without the warmest resentment   pit well well mighty well then there let it drop  there let it drop in the name of goodness may not one talk of matrimony without having ones brains beat out  zounds i wish  i could meet with a good wife with all my heart   bland and a special good husband you would make if you thought you could kill her with kindness  if i thought you serious now i would help you to a good one but what will you give me for my trouble   pit give you  what do you call a good one though   bland the lady is not very handsome to be sure nor yet very young but she is worth a confounded deal of money i assure you and such a woman can have nothing bad about her i am persuaded at least in your eyes   pit she cannot be bad that is certain if she is rich for money was never bestowed on any but those that were good and knew how to keep it when they had got it but how rich do you think the lady may be   bland why i have heard my uncle say that she is worth ten thousand pounds at least but dont take the least notice of it to him for he wants to get her himself only she thinks him rather too old  now such a middleagd man as you would be the very thing besides she was asking me who was our best inoculator in this neighborhood i told her i knew a very infallible one meaning you and she has been teazing me about you ever since   pit odds so but that is one of the most lucky circumstances that could have happened in my favor where does the lady live and i will pay her a visit tomorrow   bland oh no not for the world she has boarded some time in a private family in this neighborhood but as the major part of them have not had the smallpox it is to be kept a profound secret   enter pestle pestle sir there is a gentleman below desires to speak with you   pit tell the gentleman i will wait on him immediately  exit pestle in faith ned if you can bring this matter to bear i will make you a present the greatest gentleman in the land would not refuse exit pit   bland and that is a pill or a dose of physic to take when i am sick to make me the more so for i know he has neither the spirit or resolution to do any thing like a man the yellow mammon has caught his soul and avarice holds his purse strings i dont know what the hopes of getting this pretended wife may do  but if he should put me to the proof i dont know where i should find one that would choose to throw herself away upon him i must do something to deceive him hey let me see egad i think i could do very well for an old maid myself  an excellent thought  but what shall i do for a dress  a plague on it i have interest enough among the fair sex to get such a thing as that to be sure  the old maid and her money is the thing yet bait for gudgeons with worms and a miser with gold and you are sure to catch em i will even go after the doctor and tell him i am going to the lady directly exit bland   scene ii enter pittem pit so ned is gone after the lady ten thousand pounds a charming sum  nay a fortune a very good fortune of itself  let me see ten thousand pounds and five thousand of my own makes just fifteen thousand pounds  that will certainly enable me to keep a chariot of my own the thing i have been striving for these fourteen years for what is a doctor without a chariot the appearance of a chariot is the sign of good practice and it is a common remark when the world thinks you have much you shall have more and when but little you shall have less a knock at the door pray walk in  enter hierapicra o is it you mr hierapicra what news what news any more patients   hi we have just now lost one sir   pit lost one how do you mean   hi dead sir   pit dead   hi i assure you sir it it true   pit o he

wish you would send jerry to me i want to speak to him   hi i will sir exit hi   pit the deuce take me but i have walked upon thorns and laid upon nettlebeds ever since i first heard of this fortune and i am terribly afraid that old sly uncle of neds will snap her up before me   enter jerry jerry did you want any thing with me sir   pit yes my little jerry your master is not at home i suppose   jerry he was not when i came out   pit pray jerry i hope it is no secret have not you a maiden lady of about forty that often pays your old master a visit   jerry we have sir   pit know you where she lives   jerry a few miles off   pit you do not know the name of the place then do you   jerry why yes i do   pit could not you inform me then   jerry i should not choose to do such a thing without my masters authority   pit no  pray what could be the consequence   jerry a very bad one sir for aught i know as she is a kind of a sweetheart of my old masters and is worth a deal of money i dont know if you should find out where the lady lives but you may endeavor to rival him the consequence would then be very bad on my side i believe   pit why he should never know who told me   jerry that he would   pit twill be impossible man  he never shall from me   jerry but in the course of his examination it would come to my turn and then i must confess or tell him a lie which i will not do for you or any body else and therefore sir to avoid any apprehensions of that kind it will be the best way to say nothing at all about it   pit a stubborn son of a gun aside you seem to have a great regard for your word jerry and i applaud you for it  though i should be glad to know one thing however which cannot be of much consequence to you or danger to any body  and that is whether the lady keeps much company or no   jerry very little i believe   pit hum  ah  she has a pretty good stomach i suppose    jerry sir   pit a good stomach i say   jerry a very moderate one and as worthy a lady as ever was born  what a miserable wretch aside   pit is she indeed she often gives you money then i suppose   jerry sometimes sir  what a scurvy scoundrel aside   pit ha   enter pestle pestle sir mr

lived   pit o lackaday lackaday now was there ever any thing so provoking in this world   bland nay upon second consideration though i am glad on it   pit how so how so pray that is strange indeed   bland why because i look upon it that were she to visit you the business would be half done   pit so much the better so much the better man   bland and pray what am i to have for my trouble   pit plague on it have not i told you i would make you a handsome present   bland yes but what surety have i for that but your own bare word which i would not take for a shilling where money is concerned i must have your note doctor i must have your note   pit and so you shall i will give you a note of five pounds on demand from the very moment she consents to marry me   bland a note of five pounds scandalous and pitiful  wretch devil why thou art a very skinflint  five pounds for ten thousand oh horrible horrible the very summit of meanness  a gentleman who knew what influence i had over the lady but this very day offered me two hundred pounds only to be introduced to her  five pounds for ten thousand doctor your servant exit blandford   pit nay but mr blandford hear me hear me hollowing after blandford was there ever such a hotheaded rascal sdeath if i should lose her now he talks of an offer of two hundred pounds a great sum a very great sum but ten thousand  i must outbid the gentleman i believe for if i should read of miss suchaone a maiden lady of ten thousand pounds being married to  oh i shall go distracted the very thought of losing such a prize is worse than being

fathers letter astonishes me it is strange she never showed it me before he informs her but three hours before his death that he had provided for her very handsomely instead of that we find her destitute and forlorn and by what i understand pittem was the only person that attended him in his latest hours sdeath there must have been foul play pittem is either an errant knave or her father must have deceived her but when i compare the two characters the first surmise carries with it many glaring circumstances and the latter seems improbable i will not rest till i am satisfied   enter pestle with a letter pestle sir my master desired i would give this letter into your own hands   bland very well  is he at home   pestle yes sir ex pestle   blandford reads dear ned i have considered

afraid i should have found you as i left you full of gunpowder   bland no no doctor your letter stopped all fear of explosion   pit to tell you the truth i was under great apprehensions of your accepting of the gentlemans proposal that you told me of   bland no doctor though i received a letter from the gentleman since i saw you last importuning me in the most pressing manner to introduce him yet from the regard i bear you i was determined to give you the preference and intended to have waited a day or two till you had better considered the matter   pit that was acting the friend indeed but to the purpose my dear boy you read my letter i presume   bland i did   pit and have you any objection to a couple of hundreds   bland not the least   pit then i think i have nothing to fear no doubt of success   bland none in the world   pit flea me but i shall think every hour an age till i see her   bland so i suppose   pit had i not better go give her an invitation myself as i am an utter stranger to the lady she will undoubtedly expect that compliment   bland i beg you would not think of such a thing but bless your stars that she has consented to visit you for as i have been acquainted with her from my infancy i think myself a tolerable judge of her disposition   pit well i shall be advised by you   bland if you hope to succeed i beg you would one material thing i should advise you to that is not to make above twelve hours courtship on it for i have often heard her say she could never bear to be courted above a day and this resolution she has taken i am informed from being crossed in her first love   pit that is an excellent notion i assure her  for i should hate one of your plaguey long courtships myself to have an hundred fallingsout and fallingsin in a week

i shall give the note to her and pay off my debt and if she should desire you to make it into money tomorrow to show her what a principle you bear you may pay it her which will be only paying to

often makes merit look too coolly on itself   mrs buz why true sir true it is very certain where  is real ability diffidence is sure to oppress it and jgment is often referred to the vain and talkative coxcb while it sets doubtful and timorous in the breast of modesty  but dont think sir i meant to pay myself a compliment by such an observation   pit i do not imagine you did madam but give me leave to say it is a very sensible a nay a very excellent observation indeed madam  what a charming tongue she has if i should loose her now i shall wish i would never seen her aside   mrs buz but love sir was not the business i came here upon it was of another nature my business was of another nature quite   pit no to be sure madam i had not the vanity to imagine it was love pray madam what might it be   mrs buz inoculation sir  i have been under the greatest apprehensions of catching the smallpox for this month past it being almost so generally spread about the country and as my cousin ned has persuaded me that you have discovered a most infallible method of eradicating that malignant disorder i have made bold to visit you on that business   pit madam i am infinitely obliged to mr blandford for his kind and generous recommendation and more so to you madam for imbibing so good an opinion of me  but i could wish pardon me madam i could wish you would consent to evade the subject of inoculation a few minutes and dwell a little longer on that more excellent topic love   mrs buz sir if you can convince me that the danger of the one is not more imminent to me than the other is to you i shall very readily comply with your request   pit then madam i fancy i shall prevail with you   mrs buz pray explain youself sir   pit does your apprehensions of the smallpox give you at present any real pain   mrs buz i cannot say it does sir   pit but mine of love madam really does   mrs buz how can that be sir even supposing me the object of your affections since both passions proceed from fear yours of losing what you never had and there it ends mine of catching that i would not wish to have which may possibly end in death but however sir since you are so very desirous of continuing the theme of love i will even set aside my apprehensions a few minutes and listen to you  i fancy it will be best to get that part over first least i should be discovered before i nail him for the two hundred aside   pit such a condescension madam bespeaks you every thing that is amiable   mrs buz sir if i thought i was really so in your eyes i would endeavor to return the compliment in the best manner i could   pit if there was any other way in the world more expressive than simple words i wish i knew it that i might convince you madam i really think you  nay you really are the most amiable lady i ever met with in my life and the only woman i ever yet wished my wife   mrs buz sir   pit pardon me madam if my passion has made my tongue oerrun the bounds of decency if i have offended you madam i beg your pardon  but hope you will forgive me   mrs buz i believe the doctor is in love with me indeed  aside sir i forgive you with all my heart but cannot help thinking it the strangest thing in the world that so slight an acquaintance should breed so strong an affection   pit o madam the very illustrious character mr blandford has often given you to me made me almost in love with you before you came but since i have seen you i am in love indeed to find you so far exceed the best of characters   mrs buz sir i am infinitely obliged to my cousin ned but must confess he has always been very liberal in his commendations of you   pit i am equally obliged to mr blandford madam but am afraid you have found that he has said more in my behalf than you find true   mrs buz sir i must confess i dont find that he has deceived me in the least   pit madam you make me very happy indeed   mrs buz i am glad on it sir and should be very glad if it were in my power to make you always so   pit that it is in your power madam there is nothing so sure   mrs buz then sir you may depend upon it i will do my utmost   pit but suppose madam nothing would make me so but your own person and liberty   mrs buz sir i should have no objection of resigning them both were i sure they would make you happy   pit i would venture my happiness nay my life madam on such a resignation if you would venture to give me your hand on this fair promise i shall be completely happy   mrs buz then here it is with all my heart for to tell you the truth sir i have long been tired of the appellation of old maid and most terribly afraid of dying one   pit  takes her hand and kisses it with great eagerness and i do assure you madam the musty and fulsome name of old bachelor has been no less hateful to me nor do i care how soon i get rid of it   mrs buz though i cannot help thinking but i have made too brief a capitulation forwardness in women generally gives disgust but to be plain you must know sir i hate to be courted the heyday of youth is over in me about sixteen or seventeen years i used to take a pleasure in denying on purpose to obtain a number of new and useless solicitations till at last i teased my lovers out of patience   pit well i declare to you madam i have been served so twenty times for i never paid my addresses to a young lady in my life but before i could settle my affections she tired my patience with a feigned coyness giving me the greatest encouragement today and tomorrow would hardly look at me till i had dangled from morning to night after her and all the excuse she had for it was  i should not think her too forward but i soon let her see i could be as capricious as herself and so broke her acquaintaintance with a cool billetdoux and farewell   mrs buz i cannot help thinking this visit was an arch design of my cousin neds and to get us acquainted with no other view than what it has turned out he is a strange creature he has great good nature but it is great pity he has not a little more economy in regard to his pocket moneys like chaff to him it flies with every wind that blows   pit o that is an unpardonable sin madam in my opinion   mrs buz and in mine too sir though his great fault is i believe being too charitable he pretends that when he sees a friend or a neighbor in distress he cannot sleep till he has relieved em   pit ah that is an abominable fault for what is anothers poverty to me let every one take care of themselves i say besides giving to the poor is the most unprofitable way of bestowing charity in the world you are sure of never having any return   mrs buz true sir very true i have been obliged to lend him money at different times to the amount of two hundred pounds though it went very much against me to do it had he not been a pretty near relation i would not have done it on any account but he has certainly a deal of good nature and i know too that he will pay when he has it for i lent him a hundred and twenty pounds before and i must say he paid me very honestly again with good interest into the bargain but if i could get him to pay the good two hundred pounds he owes me now i should hardly risk any more with him i think   pit i am glad to find you are come to that resolution madam i assure you  once or twice a person may do a good natured thing but i would have em beware of the third time least they be flung at last   mrs buz he has no given me a note of two hundred pounds on you sir i am amazed to think what he can have done for it   pit why it was a particular kind of business to be ure madam the purport of which i shall make bold to acquaint you with some other opportunity   mrs buz i have no very great relish for secrets sir   pit then you are not a native of this country i am sure madam for the people here make it as great a merit to discover the secrets of their neighbors as the astronomers do to discover new spots in the sun and take as great a pride in declaring em to the world   mrs buz that is a very despicable character pray what time of the day is it i must begin to think of going i promised to call on a lady in my way home upon some very particular business i should be glad now to know your terms of inoculation perhaps it is not convenient just now sir to pay the note i mentioned   pit quite so quite so madam i have it at hand i am never so happy as when my debts are paid   mrs buz nay as for that matter if it had not been convenient you need not have been under any uneasiness on my account sir it will save me the trouble of sending to my bankers tomorrow that is all   pit here it is madam   mrs buz and here is your note sir with a receipt in full on the back   pit madam i am very much obliged to you   mrs buz o sir it is i that am obliged puts it in her pocket   pit now maam now for inoculation when shall you be ready to prepare   mrs buz immediately sir   pit very well madam you shall have your medicines tomorrow morning   mrs buz my heart almost fails me already i declare   pit my dear madam you need not be under the least apprehensions of danger it is the mildest undertaking in the world i have had some hundred thousands under my hands but never had a patient while under the operation that had the least apprehensions of death nor one that ever made the least complaint since they left me   mrs buz amazing   pit it is amazing indeed madam but you must imagine i have taken no small pains in the studies of physics and metaphysics to have made a discovery of this nature   mrs buz that is very apparent sir   pit i do assure you madam it has been a work of thirty years study i have spared no pains in consulting the best authors and was at a vast expense in traveling for experience to the most celebrated capitals in europe and am happy to find at last that my endeavors were not thrown away but that my discovery has proved of such general utility   mrs buz what an excellent knack the doctor has at lying  aside there is nothing more conducive to happiness than the general approbation of the public nor nothing so hard to obtain   pit very well observed indeed madam but i can very well sa with a favorite author of mine successo filicitatibusque and in another part where he compares a great genius to a skyrocket skirockitum skirocteribus   mrs buz so so the doctor is going to purge me with doglatin  aside your authors excellence is thrown away upon me sir i am quite a stranger to latin french was always my favorite language i ever considered latin as too masculine a study for the ladies   pit madam there is such a

wanting in sincerity because i have sent no stale apology say shall it be less welcome cause it came signaturd by one beneath the heed of fame reduced by fortune to an humble state denied by genius ever to be great alas i am lost in thinking what to say till thought kills thought and drives my muse away at length i doze and wander in my dreams hunting new epithets sentiments and themes then pleased i wake but find my treasures flown before my eager hand can set em down how hard to please myself  what shall i do in such a case how please the world and you my fancy breeds apace no mortals more but then the produce proves so very poor twill scarce deserve admittance at your door my days thank fate are well employed at night i spin a rhyme or two by candlelight to aim at fame is dangerous indeed scores make attempt but very few succeed far be the thought the fatal thought from me for ever let me boast humility to please a few and that same few my friends will be the summit of my hopes  my ends would be fulfilled could i with humble stride tread the smooth plain with h  d by my side let others try the lofty hill to climb soaring scholastic bove the reach of rhyme clad in the vest of sophs regardless stand the praise or censure of the critics hand thirsting for pathos to confound the sense like useless gewgaws shaming the expense o be it mine to speak in natures strain

woodlands green there can i seek for themes when fancy dies walk through the forest and observe the skies nor seek in vain  each day sends something new some newborn beauty rises to my view could i but steal the art of painting here these scenes in verse as they to me appear had i the power with that art to please to paint em well and paint em too with ease could i like you at once ensnare the mind engage the eye and keep the heart confined and do it too with such engaging grace with manly strides the paths of nature trace the muses then should claim each mite of time and every thought i would jingle into rhyme vain hopes alas  but hopes are apt to please and fancied pleasures sometimes give us ease credulity a mild and simple maid too often alas by promises betrayed follows the fantom hope with steps so fast till disappointment kills her at the last never let me be so cursed as to depend upon a promise or to lose a friend nor pin my hopes too closely on the sleeve of old or young i have found em both deceive the silvered pole is ap er ever to sin than he who never felt razor on his chin old age breeds craft and near his elbow chair sets folly placed his favorite and heir peace to all such if such can peace enjoy whose shallow promise tends but to destroy their neighbors peace  that wretch i envy not who boasts a name by broken friendship got for ever will i bar my homely door against the greatest knave so meanly poor conscience shall haunt the disingenuous slave and time shall lead him blindfold to his grave i boast no art thence can no credit lose i paint to show my meaning not confuse no rogue to flatter nor no friend abuse the meanest figure claims as great a share of skill to paint it well as the most fair but those the meanest of the mean i call who gain with all my pains no praise at all you that by nature have an heart designed to hear and heal the sufferings of mankind may you never trust the wretch whose friendship tends to no ones good but his own private ends the banks of chelmer though windsor boasts her tyrants and her kings her shady groves her forest and her springs her lofty temples and her costly gems her murmuring loddon and her sister thames admit my muse to tread in humble lays and sing though lowly in fair chelmers praise what though thy banks by kings were never trod no stately savage graced thee with a nod thou happly scapd the arbitrary frown nor felt the curse of being near a crown once on a time there lived a rural pair the gentle philo and salina fair the sad leander loved not more than he when armed with love he dared the raging sea no storyd fair could ever boast a mind more pure no maid could show an heart more kind than she her tresses played about her waist in flowing curls her head with posies graced like the fair lilly essencd every gale while over the lawn she tript or through the dale on chelmers banks the gentle pair first trod ere this fair land felt vile oppressions rod in golden times when love over interest stood and statesmen sought their king and countrys good he tended flocks while she the distaff played upon the brow or near some friendly shade long had their breasts felt cupids gentle flame and stifled love with common friendships name till bursting forth the blaze dispelled the smoke and philo first to his salina spoke  we have long my fair salina trod these plains in summers heat and winters drenching rains we often steal the honey from the bees and often we pluck the blossom from the trees their tempting sweetness urge us to the deed but yet we find em cloy us as we feed there grows one flower yet that i revere survives in bloom throughout the killing year whose tempting blush and neverfading smell by far all blossoms of the spring excel whose damask leaves distill a balmy dew that breeds desire and maintains it too i often behold it as i tread the mead and every day my longing eyes i feed with fond desire till at last i pine sigh to myself and wish the blossom mine still must i pine still must i sigh in vain it is ou must ease my hopes and cure my pain within your reach it hangs within your breast to make me wretched or to make me blessed nay cease to grieve the fair salina cried have you ever asked me ought that i denied sure you have found me selfish and unkind to think i bear about so poor a mind did ou a lambkin or an heifer choose you never knew me such a boon refuse then bring me philo where this wonder grows be it a lilly hyacinth or rose be  the fairest bud that ever sprung the sweetest bluebell ever fair rung within my reach or in my power to give if philo ask it philo shall receive thanks lovely maid  but o you will change your mind when you this fair this blooming beauty find nay doubt me not nor yet my truth decry let not my word upon suspicion die let not your thoughts be timid and unkind till i have my promise and my truth declined no tempting sweet no rose that ever sprung shall make me faulter in my heart or tongue never let me tread these fertile banks again nor walk with philo over the verdant plain when i forget the promise i have made banish salina to some distant shade nay lovely maid be ever ever near should you should fair salina disappear these lonely plains would be more lonely still and burs and thistles grow on every hill to yonder brook then let us bend our way and there behold the prodigy of may and there behold my heart my souls delight my wish by day and all my dreams by night methinks it is strange that one poor simple flower should over an heart like yours obtain such power the be it is true and butterfly will rove and sport around with animated love when every flower rising to their sight invites the heart and yields em new delight  the sun declines apace let us instant go and try if i will not keep my word or no then straight they tript together over the plain and bands of cupids followed in a train to bind two hearts with wreaths that never fade and prove the promise of a tender maid the banks they reach and next the crystal brook in which young philo bid salina look the banks are pleasant and the stream is clear but yet i see rose or lilly near some cruel swain has stole it ever we came in such a case can i be ought to blame say can you nothing in the stream behold no perfect beauty of celestial mould see you not something like yourself appear the substance of that shadow i revere  thou art the substance thou my boasted bloom it is thou must ease my heart or seal my doom ungenrous swain how could you thus ensnare with studied arts a poor unguarded fair am i the fairest philo ever saw could poor salina such desire draw alas i grieve to think what i have done things end in sorrow that are rash begun let me recall it sure i was asleep must i indeed my artless promise keep must i perforce then give myself away to be the idol of a single day to be forgot if philo ere should see some other maid still fairer yet than me but o remember should you ever find some other maid more fair more true more kind forget not then who once you deemed a prize nor make your captive fair a sacrifice o never never talk not so again such fancied ills will rive my heart in twain  here do i vow and when i prove unkind teem down ye clouds and unloose the wind let forked lightning through my cottage shoot and thunder tear whole forests by the root let every lamb that in my pastures stray by turgid floods be caught and washed away let me be sunk in famine and despair beneath the horror of the warring air nay gentle swain my heart would bleed to see thee made the spectacle of misery should thou prove kind and keep thy passion true i would not wish a fairer swain than you when i prove false  but that can never be my health my life my every hopes in thee if this fond heart should ever a traitor prove and violate the sacred laws of love let shame be painted on my guilty breast and sorrow hunt me from the bed of rest what shall i say  for o i cannot feign what i am not were i the world to gain what shall i say to make my fair believe these tears are real cease o cease to grieve here take my hand my heart i would resign but that has fled this many a day to thine my breast forlorn often led me to despair save when methought i felt my philos there o let me clasp it to my panting breast heal my fond heart and give it endless rest ye woods and vales that heard the lovely sound tell it in ecchos to the plains around let the sweet woodlark raise his notes divine telling each swain that fai as mine the prologue to the merry midnight mistake with much reluctance they have brought me here to try your patience and to cure my fear but if in trying i should chance to fail you soon shall see me frenchmanlike turn tail our authors here behind in a such a taking scratching his head shivering and shaking i or fear his comic bantling should not please  he here presents you with his prologue fees a little cating and a thousand smiles  for complimenting more than truth beguiles so he poor man since canting is the mode must needs go plodding in the common road begs you would permit his brat walk unmolested should the poor thing chance to be divested

poor declining thing by kindly catching hold the leadingstring some proudly pleased in finding out a fault but mostly those who cannot digest a thought rude nature gave em rancour to condemn but buried all their candor in their phlegm or like enough some sage good dame may frown displeased with every notion but her own and in her pride from pious motives say there is nothing good can come from out a play and kindly showing it is not from her spleen but judges wisely what she is never seen for many authors have unjustly bled their plays being damned before a line was read the actors too your candor must implore if actors those who never played before unskilled unstudied in these stage affairs  they have other business to engross their cares  they only do it to oblige a friend no

am so teased  the author thinks his firstling has not pleased i say he is quite mistaen but all wont do he will not be easy till he hears from you he wants poor me your anger to amuse by trumping up some frivolous excuse i fain would lay it on the acting now but that is modesty will not allow  i would lay it on the prompter  if i knew how you plainly see i have no excuse at all the best wayll be to let the curtain fall  yet hold  i have something yet to say  aye right well do it better sirs another night well be more perfect act with better spirit for application is the way to merit fears the great tyrant in a doubtful breast from thence our first attempts are seldom best could we have acted as we did intend not one soul here but would have been our friend thanks for that smile  by jove mehinks i hear you kindly say  we need not be in fear because there is none but friends and neighbors here thanks for this good confession it is very kind i long to carry this good news behind they are all distressed to know what i have done and i am as much impatient to be gone the prologue to redowald a masque were it not sirs impossible to find a subject suiting every readers mind a prologue

all our woe and brought my eddie to my arms all the ills that teased us so vanish now before her charms  she our former sufferings are repaid by this mutual joy at last nor shall our future joys ever fade by thinking on the ills that is past  both but thus in transport spend each day until our griefs are drove away     the end the first of may my tale i take from times of old when truth was more esteemed than gold when pride walked threadbare and despised when folks were better exercised than nowadays when broils and strife defiles the narra of each life a country villa near a green inhabitants but twice sixteen an honest squire held the hall surrounded by a turfen wall the friend and landlord of em all a neighborhood so well inclined so simple honest and so kind each tried his neighbor to excel in friendship and in doing well as soon as morning dawn appeared or early chanticleer was heard ever the fond herds began to feed or faires fled the rising mead the thrifty villagers arose and from the bed of sweet repose they met the labors of the day and cheerful sung the time away at eventide when work was done they all returned at setting sun and met upon the plain  with glee they pipd and danced upon the lee there in a lowly simple state they felt the joys that fly the great no load of conscience galled their breast content and labor gave em rest twas now the rosy morn of may when flora in her best array bedeekd each little rising hill with cowslips sweet or daffodil a may pole tall with garlands hung and rows of birds eggs neatly strung was placed upon a verdant green a tribute to the mornings queen each rustic summons forth his fair and round the pole they all repair the squire amongst the rest arose as twas his custom to dispose of various gifts upon that day and gave good ale and cakes away twelve garlands one small hillock graced in simple order each was placed the honest squire now proposed that each by choice should be disposed said every swain had equal right to any garland now in sight and all beneath if ought should be to claim his right and property for each some little prize contained so that the loser something gained though some were greater than the rest each swain now strove to choose the best young ralph a fair and comely swain the very hero of the plain beheld fair alecy on her way no star so bright no nymph so gay her small and easy waist was bound with wreaths most sweet her head was crowned with every flower of the field that floras self to her might yield she on her head a garland bore its equal never was seen before young ralph set off full speed to meet this lovely maid this nymph complete and struck the rest with great surprise to see him claim her for his prize he first bereaved her of her crown and claimed the maiden all his own now every youngster on the plain looked with envy on the swain but all in justice did declare he won the maid  the trick was fair the squire pauzd and shook his head his hearty smile of humor fled to see his child anothers claim and now he gan himself to blame the swain beheld the good mans eyes with tears he offered back his prize the squire charmed at such a deed cried you deserve her now indeed it glads me much young swain to find thou bear so great so good a mind here take her lad  i murmur not if she is contented with her lot she smiled consent and cheered the drooping swain she gave her hand her meaning to explain the squire saw and blessed the blooming pair and three loud vollies broke the peaceful air christmas eve in the country the mountain tops were tipped with driven snow and silver white were all the vales below when ceasing through the frozen field to roam each country bumpkin ambles to his home enjoys what often his betters do admire in winter time  a comfortable fire there with his spouse and rosy brats regale in simple mirth all round a mug of ale and now when some sage venerable squire does from the noise of this great town retire to end his days forgetting king and court and turns once more unto his youthful sport but feels the want of strength the want of sight and feels the winter more severely bite than when his blood some forty years ago would reek with ardour in decembers snow climb the steep hill the flowing rivlet fly and join with speed the cheerful huntsmans cry till the deep valley echoed to the sky less exercise poor man will now content infirmity will teach him to repent and make atonement for a life of sin  at threescore years it is time sure to begin the night approached each friend receives his guest to drink an health or crack some merry jest to eat and drink in hearty free good will and all the troubles of the day to kill though venson fumes never taint their homely board the feast on what they better can afford a good sir loin a pudding full of plumbs smoking and hot upon the table comes no prince on earth could here refuse to eat so nice the pudding and so sweet the meat once on a time the fire side was graced with six true pair of lovers round it placed when biting frost and snow bespread the green the lads here served their lasses for a skreen by holding them as we do often see the lads in town  their lasses on their knee now each in turn would sing a merry song and some would tell a story very long while all attentive would with wonder hear and showed with eyes of love an heart of fear one who refused in his turn to sing told a sad story of a murdered king another cried he heard his granny say as she was passing through a lonely way the night was dark and glowworms did appear when every tree then added to her fear and passing by a lonely church yard wall the grave stones moved the steeple shook and all another now began a woeful tale the very thought of which often turned him pale  once said he a lady fair and tall did walk a nights upon our garden wall she sometimes like a sow and pigs appeared and sometimes like a jew with a long beard and sometimes like a greyhound sleek and trim sometimes like a lion very grim and once my father said he saw it stand with a bleeding heart graspt within its hand and once he heard it like a raven croak and thrice they say it to our parson spoke at this sad tale not one in all the house but even feared the moving of a mouse o lack a day cried one fair trembling maid i fear to move i am so much afraid another listening thought she heard a voice another cried i am sure i heard a noise hush was the word while each with listening fear did as it were all statuestruck appear nor eye nor finger now was seen to move but each pale maid clingd fast about her love and all the more from fear than from desire moved by degrees almost into the fire a dreadful clatter all at once was heard and in a trice the fire side was cleared out at the door they helterskelter ran nor till the morning did there one return the parson and the clerk at noon were brought with faces full of fear and heads of thought gravely they entered with a solemn look the parson held his breech the clerk his book and step by step with caution stard around thinking most sure twas all enchanted ground but first they both into the oven peept thinking perhaps it might in there have crept but turning to the cupboard there did lie a nice plumbpudding and a christmas pie that puss had in her thieving tricks thrown down and struck with wonder all the simple town the parson with a knavish leer and grin stroakd with great sanctity his double chin cried twas a shame such pudding should be lost and in an instant down his throat he tossed a piece that would almost have choked a hog and gave old sly the clerk a frienldy jog who likewise cried indeed it was a shame and by the priests example did the same then both turned home with safety and content and left the losers only to repent telling em of the worst to make the most to rest content by giving up the ghost finis
