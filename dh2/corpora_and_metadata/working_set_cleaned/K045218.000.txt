the stage defended from scripture reason experience and the common sense of mankind for two thousand years  occasioned by mr laws late pamphlet against stageentertainments  in a letter to        by mr dennis  london printed for n blandford at the londongazette charing cross and sold by j peele at lockeshead in paternoster row mdccxxvi price one shilling  to the right honorable george dodington esquire one of the lords commissioners of his majestys treasury sir the following little treatise is to all appearance so very a trifle that i should not have the assurance to address it to a gentleman of your distinguished rank if my chief design were not to engage you in order to promote the honor of your country and the good of the learned world to take upon you the protection of the british dramatical muses so far at least as to pronounce in their favor it is the sense of all who have the honor to be acquainted with you that you have a perfect knowledge of the merits of the cause and ability and authority to determine it in the last appeal the british dramatick muses make this request to you sir who have been barbarously used both by their friends and their enemies for by their friends they have been more than once poorly deserted and abandoned to the slanders and the unjust accusations of their most inveterate enemies  i appeal to you sir if they are not idle dreamers who believe that a great a powerful and an opulent people can be without public diversions or if it is fitting they should be without them i appeal to you sir if a great and a brave people by being often assembled and pleased together will not be the more pleased with one another and the more among themselves united  but as all pleasures and diversions both public and private are barbarous or gentle rational or sensual manly or effeminate noble or base and degenerate it is agreed on by all the sensible world that the public diversions of a free nation ought neither to be barbarous nor sensual nor base nor effeminate because public diversions of the first kind reflect dishonor upon a brave nation and diversions of the other three kinds have a natural tendency to the introducing a general and total corruption of manners which is inconsistent with liberty  the public diversions which are at present established in great britain are either the combats of our modern gladiators or the italian operas or the masquerades or tragedies and comedies which are the only genuine legitimate entertainments of the stage  as for the first of these the combats of our modern gladiators i appeal to you sir who by traveling have had the advantage of knowing the sentiments and manners of other nations if they are not regarded by all europe excepting our selves with horror and esteemed to be neither agreeable to the spirit of christianity nor to the manners of a civilized people  as to the italian operas they are allowed by all the impartial world to be sensual and effeminate compared to the genuine drama and a greater real promoter of wanton and sensual thoughts than ever the drama was pretended to be because too great a part of them consisting of softness of sound and of wantonness of thought they have nothing of that good sense and reason and that artful contrivance which are essential to the drama no you know very well sir that good sense and reason and every strict attention to an artful design are so many natural and moral restraints upon wanton and sensual thoughts  i now sir desire leave to say something concerning masquerades which mr law affirms to be more innocent than the drama which is a frontless assertion and the very reverse of reason i remember one of our comic poets observes that young ladies run a greater risk of their reputations by being familiar with fools than with men of sense because fools have but one way of passing their time with them so masquerades having neither the sense of the drama nor the sound of the opera persons of both sexes may go to them either with no design or with a very vile one to which i might add the late remark of a wise and pious prelate which is that masquerades deprive virtue and religion of their last refuge shame which says he keeps multitudes of sinners within the bounds of decency after they have broke through all the ties of principle and conscience but this invention sets them free from that also being neither better nor worse than an opportunity to say and do there what virtue decency and good manners will not permit to be said or done in any other place  this wise and pious prelate in this very passage censures the persons of either sex who frequent lewd and profane plays but he does not assert here that there are no plays but what are lewd and profane and he affirms that masquerades are of more dangerous consequence to virtue and good manners than even plays which are profane  thus sir i have endeavored to show that of three of the present reigning diversions one is cruel and barbarous and not at all becoming either of a christian or a civilized nation the second effeminate wanton and sensual and the third either very unmeaning or else neither moral nor christian  no art of man in the most happy age of the most happy nation has been able to find out a public diversion that has been reasonable noble manly and virtuous but the drama when it is writ as it ought be and yet these wild enthusiasts who have shot their bolts against the stage have said not a word against the other three which cannot be defended by the least pretense that any of them can have to goodness or moral instruction  sir the following treatise is not only a defense of dramatick poetry but of the established government in the administration of which the wisdom of the king has given you an illustrious share and against which mr laws pamphlet is obliquely designed as were the writings which his two predecessors collier and bedford published against the stage collier by his action and bedford by his other writings because professed and declared enemies to the government one of them absolved an impenitent traitor who died with treason in his mouth and the other upon publishing his book upon hereditary right was imprisoned for high treason  but sir the following treatise was likewise designed in defense of all the people of quality of both sexes in england and of all the people in any country throughout the christian world where they frequent any theaters all which numerous people he has very charitably given to the devil to have and to hold for ever  nor engine nor device polemick disease nor doctor epedemic ever sent so vast a colony to the infernal world as he but all that i have been able to do in the defense of so good a cause is to show that i heartily wish well to it it belongs to you sir and to those few who resemble you who have discernment and taste that qualify you to determine surely and honor and justice enough to engage you to pronounce and judge impartially to take the british drama into your protection and patronage in order to retrieve its former luster and augment its glory  by taking the british theater into your protection and patronage you would protect and patronize every other branch of the british poetry for as the british theater as long as it was justly and judiciously managed among us was the only public rewarder of dramatick poetry so it has been the only chief support and encouragement of every other species of that noble art it has cherished and inflamed the spirit of poetry and raised a noble emulation among us more than all our kings and all our ministers together from the very building of london to the erecting the first theater in it which time contains about thirty centuries we had but two british poets who deserve to be read but from the establishment of our theaters to the present time which contains scarce a century and a half we may boldly affirm that more than ten times that number of poets have appeared and flourished in england  and here sir i beg leave to observe the advantage of genius that great britain has over france with relation to the drama for our neighbors the french notwithstanding the vast encouragement that was given by cardinal richlieu and by lewis the xivth at the instigation of monsieur colbert his first minister never could with justice boast of more than one comic and two tragic poets whereas more than ten of our countrymen have without any public encouragement but what they derived from the stage itself and that how inconsiderable signalized themselves in comedy alone within the compass of those fifty years that followed the restoration  i know indeed very well sir that other reasons may be assigned besides the want of a theater why no more poets flourished before queen elizabeths time but i am at the same time convinced that the reason why we have had so many since has been the establishment of our theaters for the dramatick poets the case is plain few would have given themselves the trouble to write dramatick poems if there had not been theaters in which they might be acted and some who were by nature qualified to succeed better in other kinds of poetry than the dramatick had by reason of the lowness of their fortunes been incapable of exerting their geniuss in those other kinds if they had not been first encouraged and raised and supported by the stage and it is very natural to conceive that several others who at the same time that they had large revenues were qualified both by nature and art to excel in the other kinds were rouzed and excited to try their fortunes in them by the animating applauses which they saw that our dramatick poets received from their ravished audiences the sentiment of virgil might on such occasions very naturally present itself to their minds  tentanda via est qua me quoque possim tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora   and now sir since the chief encouragement not only of plays but of every other kind of the british poetry which is none of the meanest branches of the british learning depends upon the stage and consequently the honor of great britain in some measure depends upon it i humbly conceive that the flourishing condition of our theater is a matter of importance and public concern and not unworthy the consideration of the greatest men in the state  since dramatick poetry was first introduced into england it never was sunk so deplorably low as it is at present and every other branch of poetry is declined proportionably i mean as far as it has been managed by most of those who have listed themselves under apollos standard and who engage for their pay that little that has appeared that has been writ with more spirit and more grace than ordinary has come for the most part from volunteers  sir with submission to your better judgment there is but one way of reviving the expiring drama of restoring its original innocence and of augmenting its ancient luster and that is by establishing two annual prizes of two hundred pound each the one for comedy the other for tragedy to be given besides the ordinary profits of the theater to him who performs best in each of them which is to be decided by judges appointed on purpose and sworn to determine impartially with this proviso that no play shall be received that shall be judged to be ever so little offensive to good manners and that every play shall be rejected whose author can be proved to have taken the least step toward the forming a cabal which design i humbly conceive is in your power to reduce to practice if you would vouchsafe to recommend it to the government or to a number of gentlemen who may be every way qualified to engage in so good a cause  several causes may be assigned of the decay of dramatick peotry as the italian opera which never was established in any country but it immediately debased the poetry of that nation the strangers who have been introduced among us by several great events as the revolution the union the hanover succession who not understanding our language have been very instrumental in introducing sound and show the new gentry that has started up among us some by the fortune of war and some by the fortune of exchangealley who are fond of their old entertainments of jackpudding but yet none of these has done half the harm that has been done by cabal for it is in poetry as it is in politics things go quite wrong when merit pines while clamor is preferred and long attachment waits among the herd when no distinction where distinctions due marks from the many the superior few   a cabal to espouse a coxcomb may get him money but at the same time it will procure him infamy writers who have genius will leave the stage with the utmost indignation and every man who understands it will have it in contempt  the men who contradict the public voice and strive to dignify a worthless choice attempt a task that on that choice reflects and lend us light to point out new defects one worthless man that gains what he pretends disgusts a thousand unpretending friends and therefore every writer who pretends to succeed by cabals ought to be banished from every theater but to show the judgment or the integrity of our managers of the stage they have for several years past rejected every play that has not had a cabal to support it  and now sir though i am sensible that i have already detained you a great deal too long for which i humbly and heartily beg your pardon yet before i take leave of you i cannot help acquainting you that this is the fourth time that i have appeared in defense of the stage and in this fourth defense i have no manner of interest but that it has been purely extorted from me by the force of truth and by the love of my country in the former three i might appear to be maintaining my own interests but i have since the publishing them been used with such extreme ingratitude by the present managers of the playhouse that i have this ten years been obliged by the most barbarous treatment to take leave of the playhouse for ever  i am sir your most obedient and most humble servant john dennis  the stage defended etc to  esquire sir when you desire to know my sentiments concerning mr laws late pamphlet against the stage you make a request which it is not so easy for me to satisfy as you may perhaps imagine for i really never was so much at a loss to know what an author meant sometimes i am inclined to think him in good earnest and sometimes i believe that there are grounds to susbect that he designed this whole pamphlet for nothing but a spiritual banter for there seems to me to be a necessity of believing either that a clergyman as mr law is should be profoundly ignorant of the sacred writings a man of letters of the nature of dramatick poems and one who had lived long enough in the world to have some experience of the present state of religion and virtue and vice among us or a necessity of concluding that while mr law is declaiming with so much furious zeal against the stage and players he is all that while acting a part and showing himself a great comedian  when mr law is putting idolatry and frequenting the playhouse upon an equal foot he seems to be playing a part for he cannot but know that st paul was of another mind who when he was at athens the very source of dramatick poetry said a great deal publicly against their idolatry but not one word against their stage when he was afterward at corinth as little did he say against theirs for st paul who was educated in all the learning of the grecians who had read all their poets who in the vjth chapter of the acts ver    quotes aratus and epimenides in the first chapter of his epistle to titus ver  0 could not but have read all their noble dramatick poems and yet has been so far from speaking one word against them that he has made use of them for the instruction and conversion of mankind and when afterward he wrote his first epistle to the corinthians he did not scruple for their instruction to make use of an athenian play for all the world knows that evil communications corrupt good manners   cor xv    is taken from an athenian dramatick poet does mr law believe that that epistle and consequently that verse was dictated by the holy ghost or not can mr law believe that st paul was guided by the spirit of god to make choice of that verse for the instruction and conversion of the corinthians and can he believe at the same time that the theater as he more than once declares it is the temple of the devil if any one should affirm that st paul was guided by the spirit of god to take a verse from the temple of the devil would it not be such horrid blasphemy as would make even the blood of the most profligate of all players to curdle within the miscreants veins but if st paul had in the least believed that the athenian stage was the sink of sin and corruption as mr law says every stage is he would not have failed to reproach them with it in order to check the spreading evil he who dares talk openly and boldly against the national religion of a people may very well venture to condemn their vices and evil customs but st paul not only says nothing at all against dramatick poetry but makes use of it for the conversion and reformation of mankind now i would fain know if quoting a dramatick poet without giving the least caution against the stage be not a downright approbation of dramatick poetry and establishing the stage by no lesser an authority than that of the spirit of god himself  if we look into the old testament we shall find that the kings of israel and judah they and their reigns were declared righteous or wicked according as those kings were idolaters or not idolaters and that no sin whatever was reckoned so abominable as idolatry solomon who had seven hundred wives had no less than three hundred concubines and yet when god threatened to rend ten tribes of his subjects from him it was only for his idolatry because he had forsaken god and had worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the sidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammon   kings xj for it came to pass that when solomon was old his wives turned away his hear after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father ibid ver   now david committed adultery with bathsheba and murdered her husband uriah yet these sin that were of so flagrant a nature that they brought a plague upon israel were venial compared to idolatry they brought indeed a plague upon the people but they deposed the king from no part of his subjects as the idolatry of solomon did his son rehoboam in short idolatry is by so much more criminal than the transgression of any other divine commandment as the attempt to depose a king and to set up a pretender is a crime of a higher nature than the breach of any other human law  as it is hard to imagine that mr law should be ignorant of what has been said above it gave me just cause to suspect his sincerity but when i came to the passage which he quotes from archbishop tillotson in the   th page of his pamplet i found that he prevaricated so vilely in it that the hypocrisy became immediately manifest for he has omitted the former part of the passage because it makes directly against him it is as follows  to speak against them  viz plays in general may be thought too severe and that which the present age cannot so well brook and would not perhaps be so just and reasonable because it is very possible they might be so framed and governed by such rules as not only to be innocent and diverting but instructive and useful to put some vices and follies out of countenance which cannot perhaps be so decently reproved nor so effectually exposed and corrected any other way all this as i have said above he has purposely omitted because it makes point blank against him  for after he has told us in this blessed pamphlet that the playhouse is the temple of the devil a more delightful habitation for him than ever any temple that he had in the heathen world where impurity and filthiness immodest songs profane rants lust and passions entertain the audience a place the peculiar pleasure of the devil where all they who go yield to the devil go over to his party and become members of his congregation where all the laughter is not only vain and foolish but that it is a laughter among devils that all who are there are upon profane ground and hearing music in the very porch of hell after he has bestowed all this fine language upon it and all these fragrant flowers of rhetoric he assures us that the playhouse is all that he has said not through any accidental abuse as any innocent or good thing may be abused but by its genuine hellish nature which is directly contrary to what the forementioned illustrious prelate has said mr law says that every entertainment of the stage is in its nature unlawful abominable and infernal the archbishop assures us that the entertainments of the stage may be so managed as not only to be innocent but useful and instructive nay that they may even become necessary for the exposing some certain follies and the correcting some certain vices  as mr law has shown his want of sincerity in the foresaid quotation he gives us great reasons to suspect it in his invectives against the drama for it is hard to conceive that a man of letters should be so ignorant of the nature of a legitimate dramatick poem as those invectives suppose him for it is such only that we pretend to defend and abhor the productions of ignorant and impure poetasters as much as he does it is hard to conceive that a man who has read the classicks should not know that a legitimate dramatick poem either of the comic or tragic kind is a fable and as much a fable as any one of aesops agreeing in genus and differing only in species terence has told him in almost every one of his prologues that every comedy is a fable and he begins his very first to andrea with it poeta cum primum animum ad scribendum appulit id sibi negoti credidit solum dari populo ut placerent quas fecisset fabulas and horace tells us the same thing concerning tragedy more than once or twice neve minor quinto neu sit productior actu fabula de art poet and we find in the same treatise interdam speciosa locis morataque recte fabula and likewise again nec quodcunque volet poscat sibi fabula credi   mr law cannot but know that the instruction by fables and parables which mean the same thing was mightily in use among the wise ancients and especially among the sacred writers that we have an example of it of about three thousand years standing in the parable of jothan and that jesus christ who best knew the nature of men made use of fables or parables as most proper at the same time both to please and instruct and persuade for a fable is a discourse most aptly contrived to form the manners of men by instructions disguised under the allegory of an action and therefore he could not choose but know that every legitimate dramatick poem either of the comic or tragic kind is not a mere diversion as he pretends but a philosophical and moral lecture in which the poet is teacher and the spectators are his disciples as horace insinuates in the three following verses nec minimum meruere decus vestigia graeca ausi deserere and celebrare domestica facta vel qui praetextas vel qui docuere togatas and knowing all this he could not but know that it is very hard if not very extravagant to put the frequenting moral lectures upon the same foot with idolatry  if mr law has read either aristotle or any of his interpreters as it is hard to imagine that he should think himself qualified to write against the stage if he had read none of them he cannot but know that as the action of a dramatick fable is universal and allegorical the characters are so likewise for as when aesop introduces a horse or a dog or a wolf or a lion he does not pretend to show us any singular animal but only to show the nature of that creature as far as the occasion where it appears admits of so when a dramatick poet sets before us his characters he does not pretend to entertain us with particular persons though he may give them particular names but proposes to lay before us general and allegorical fantoms and to make them talk and act as persons compounded of such and such qualities would talk and act upon like occasions in order to give proper instructions  now as a dramatick fable is a discourse invented to form the manners by instructions disguised under the allegory of an action it follows that in a dramatick fable for the proving the moral it is as necessary to introduce vicious as virtuous characters and to make them speak and act as all persons compounded of their qualities would be obliged by nature to speak and act upon the like occasions as aesop for the sake of his morals does not only introduce innocent and peaceable creatures as horses and sheep and cows and dogs but likewise noxious and violent ones as lions and bears and wolves and foxes but the poet at the same time ought to take care that the vices should be shown after such a manner as to render them odious or ridiculous and not agreeable or desirable and that the reader should reap no pleasure from the agreeableness of the vices but only from a just imitation of nature  i make no doubt sir but that i have said enough to satifie you or any of your friends to whom you may happen to show this letter that as every true dramatick poem is a fable as much as any one of aesops it has in its nature a direct tendency to teach moral virtue and can therefore never be contrary to a christian temper and cirit which wherever it is incites us to good works that is to the performance of moral duties but there is every jot as much difference between a true dramatick poem and the production of an ignorant obscene poetaster as there is between two religious books the bible and the alcoran now will mr law affirm that because the alcoran is full of egregious falsehoods and of monstrous fanatic extravagancies therefore we ought not to read the bible it belongs to none but to an atheist or some other unbelieving sceptick to make such a conclusion  sir as it is hard to conceive that mr law should be ignorant of what we have said above both concerning the sacred writings and the nature of a dramatick poem and equally hard if he is not ignorant to believe him a writer of sincerity and integrity so it seems to be as hard to conceive that a man of his years and consequently of his experience should be utterly a stranger to the present state of religion and virtue and vice among us or that if he is not a stranger to it he should be capable of writing so malicious or so erroneous a treatise as that which he has lately published against the stage  before i come to speak of the present state of religion among us i desire leave to translate a passage from daciers preface to his excellent comment on aristotles art of poetry if the quotation appears to be of more than ordinary length to you i comfort my self with this reflection that you will attend to an author of more than ordinary learning and judgment and who can speak s much better in this cause than myself  poetry says that most judicious critic is an art which was invented for the instruction of mankind and an art which is by consequence useful it is a truth acknowledged by all the world that every art is in itself good because there is none whose end and design is not so but as it is no less true that men are apt to abuse the very best things and to pervert the very best designs that which was at first invented as a wholesome remedy may afterward become a very dangerous poison i am obliged to declare then that in what i say of tragedy i speak not of corrupted tragedy fortis not in works that are depraved and vicious that we are to search for the reason and the design of nature but in those which are sound and entire when i say this speak of ancient tragedy of that which is conformable to the rules of aristotle which i dare pronounae to be the most useful and most necessary of all diversions whatever  if it were in our power to oblige all men to follow the precepts which the gospel lays down nothing could be more happy for mankind in living conformably to them they would find true repose solid pleasure and a sure remedy for all their infirmities and they might then look upon tragedy as a useless thing and which would be infinitely below them how could they look upon it in any other light since the heathens themselves beheld it in the very same as soon as they had embraced the study of philosophy they confess that if people could be always nourished with the solid truths of philosophy the philosophers had never had recourse to fables in order to give them instruction but as so much corruption could not bear so much wisdom the philosophers were obliged to look for a remedy for the disorder which they saw in mens pleasures for which they invented tragedy and they offered it to the world not as the most excellent thing of which men could make their employment and their study but yet as a means to correct those excesses in which they were wont to be plunged at their solemn feasts and to render those diversions useful to them which custom and their weakness had rendered necessary and their corruption very dangerous  what men were formerly they are today and what they are today they will be hereafter they have the same passions which they always had and run with the same eagerness after pleasure to undertake to reduce them in this condition by the severity of precepts is endeavoring to put a bridle on a mad horse in the greatest rapidity of his course in the mean time there is no middle men will fall into the most criminal excesses unless we find pleasures for them which are wise and regular it is some degree of happiness that a remnant of reason inclines them to love such diversions as are consistent with order and such amusements as are not incompatible with truth and i am persuaded that we are obliged in charity to make our advantage of this inclination that we may not give time to debauchery entirely to quench that spark of right reason which still may be seen to glimmer in them we prescribe to distempered persons and tragedy is the only remedy from which in their present condition they can reap any advantage for it is the only diversion in which they can find the profitable united with the pleasant  thus far monsieur dacier and here sir i beg leave to observe that notwithstanding our reformation we have as few persons here in england who have the true spirit of christianity in them as there are in france but there is this difference between them and us in france all own themselves christians publicly none of them dare renounce the name though few of them are the thing but among us how many open dissenters are there from christianity itself how many atheists how many deists how many freethinkers of a thousand kinds who all of them refuse to join in our sacred rites some of them as the atheists believing them to be sens lessand ridiculous and others as the deists esteeming them to be blasphemous and idolatrous then what school of public virtue and of public spirit have we for too great a part of our youth but our theaters only  it is very strange that mr law should be so ignorant of the present state of religion among us as not to foresee that the wild enthusiasm and the spiritual fanatical rant which abounds so much in his late pamphlet would afford matter of scorn and laughter to infidels and freethinkers of all sorts and render our most sacred religion still more contemptible among them  when mr law says in the   th page of his pamphlet that it cannot be doubted by any one that the playhouse is a nursery of vice and debauchery and that the effect it has upon peoples manners is as visible as the sun at noon he seems to know as little of the present state of vice among us as he pretends to do of religion the present reigning vices of the town are drinking gaming cursing swearing profaneness corruption of all sorts as bribing tricking oppression cheating whoring and execrable sodomy and mr law forsooth has the face to tell the world that the playhouse encourages all these that it is the sink of corruption and debauchery and that that is not the state of it through any accidental abuse but that corruption and debauchery are the truly natural and genuine effects of the stageentertainment that is of any stageentertainment now to show the folly and the arrogance of these assertions let us consider these vices one by one  first then does the theater encourage drunkenness no it neither does nor can encourage it to show it is enough to render it odious or ridiculous to show a man drunk is to show a fool or a madman in whom the creators image is for a time entirely defaced and who while he continues in that state stands in need of a guardian besides nothing is more certain than that brutal vice rages most in the scum and offscowring of the people who neither have nor ever had the least communication with the playhouse it is true men of thought may be sometimes drawn into it but they naturally hate it for drunkenness is a mortal enemy to thought and consequently thought to that  does the playhouse encourage gaming so far from that that gaming has increased tenfold since colliers books against the stage were published and since when whole plays have been writ to show it dangerous and destructive to show the unspeakable harm it does to both sexes and particularly to the women to show that gaming by giving men a privilege of being familiar with and sometimes rude to women removes that awe which nature has placed between the sexes as the strongest bulwark of chastity that when a young lady even of the strictest the most unblemished honor loses a sum of money which she dares not own to her relations and which she cannot pay without them and loses it to an agreeable young fellow who perhaps loves her and has a secret design upon her she finds a temptation that trys her utmost virtue  does the playhouse encourage swearing and cursing both reason and experience assure us that it does not they who walk the streets in the west end of the town may be sufficiently convinced that it rages most in the lees of the people who never knew what a playhouse was it infects even their wives and their children as it very rarely does those of the better sort as common swearing is a foolish brutal vice that brings neither pleasure nor profit with it and is the result of want of thought it follows that the foolish brutal part of the people must be most infected with it of the women that frequent the playhouse few are addicted to it but the common strumpets and of the men none but bullies rakes and giddy coxcombs if a comic poet draws any of these in order to correct and amend them he is obliged to show them sometimes swearing or he leaves out one of their characteristicks but he cannot fail of showing that very quality either odious or ridiculous when it appears in persons who are themselves both the one and the other and if he shows it either odious or ridiculous that surely will invite none of the audience to imitate it  we equally deny that the playhouse encourages any other sort of profaneness but as a play is a fable that is a composition of truth and fiction as we have observed above as the action is feigned and the moral true as characters are necessary for the carrying on the action and or proving the moral and vicious characters as necessary and perhaps sometimes more necessary than are the good ones as to show vicious characters and to expose them it is absolutely necessary to put vicious sentiments into their mouths it follows that the most criminal sentiments and the most violent passions are allowable in vicious and violent characters the most ungoverned fury and the most outrageous blasphemy itself not excepted provided they are adapted to the character and the occasion and the character and the occasion are necessary for the moral virgil has every where shown mezentius a contemner of the gods and a blasphemer of them yet we never heard that the most bigoted of his cotemporaries ever accused virgil upon that account milton in the second book of paradise lost makes the devils in their infernal council blaspheme in a most outrageous manner and yet as they speak agreeably to their characters and the occasion no man has ever been so weak or so unjust as to accuse milton for that blasphemy or to give all his readers to the devil for being entertained with it on the contrary all men of good understanding and good taste have been peculiarly charmed with that very book as one of the most beautiful of that admirable poem cowley makes not only the devil but goliath blaspheme thus he blasphemed aloud the hills around flattering his voice restored the dreadful sound and yet has been never blamed for it the book of job is canonical and is firmly believed to have been writ by divine inspiration though it is full of uncharitable judgments and is not free from blasphemy yet the instructions which that divine parable or fable gives proceed in a great measure from that very blasphemy and those uncharitable judgments but now if a poet is allowed to put blasphemy into the mouth of one of his characters provided he takes care to punish him for it he is certainly at liberty to do the like by any inferior profaneness  the three nonjuring priests who have attacked the stage have made such a noise about nothing as profaneness it sometimes drops three or four times in one page from their tautologous pens and they have chiefly accused our comedies for it the unreasonableness of which may appear from hence that all our true comedies are but copies of the foolish or vicious originals of the age certainly never man knew what a comedy was better than did moliere now when in the critic of the ecole des femmes he is endeavoring to prove by the mouth of dorante that comedy is harder to write than tragedy he gives the following reason for it lors que vous peignez des heroes vous faites ce que vous voulez ce sont des portraits a plaisir ou lou ne cherche de ressemblance et vous navez qua suivre les traits dune imagination qui se done lessor et qui souvent laisse le vrai pour atraper le merveilleux mais lors que vous peignez les hommes il faut peindre dapres nature on veut qui ces portraits ressemblent et vous navez rien fait si vous ny faites reconnoitre le gens de votre siecle that is to say when you draw heroes you are at your own liberty those are pictures at the painters pleasure in which no body looks for likeness and you have nothing to do but to indulge the flight of a soaring imagination but when you paint men you must draw after nature the world expects that those pictures should be like and you have done nothing at all unless you show your readers or your spectators the people of the age you live in  now with regard to profaneness our comedies are the faintest copies in the world and you may often hear more profaneness in one nights conversation at a tavern or an eatinghouse than you shall hear from the stage in a year for atheists deists arians and socinians are wont to say at their private meetings what no one dares to pronounce on the stage now are not these nonjuring priests either very wise or very conscientious persons our comedies are but copies of the foolish and vicious originals of the age and it is the business of the copies to expose and satyrize and ridicule those foolish and those vicious originals now these nonjuring priests having nothing to say against those foolish and those vicious originals which most certainly corrupt and debauch the age make it their business to fall foul on the copies which chastise and satyrize and ridicule the originals  what i have said of the stage with relation to profaneness is in proportion true with regard to all other vices now since our comedies are but copies of the foolish and the vicious originals of the age in which we live and copies which do by no means come up to the originals i appeal to all the world if it does not unanswerably follow from what i have said that the originals of the age debauch the stage by which latter the age never possibly can be debauched the stage was established in england toward the beginning of queen elizabeths reign whereas the manners of the people continued generally sound till beyond the middle of the last century and the manners of the people continuing generally sound the stage remained generally chaste but at the restoration of charles the second the court returning from abroad corrupted by foreign luxury quickly debauched the town and the court and the town jointly endeavored to debauch the stage because our comic poets were obliged to copy their lewd originals in order to expose and reform them  as for corruption of any sort whether it be tricking oppressing bribing sharping cheating the true poet who  perfectly free from all avarice is least of all addicted to it   vatis avarus non temere est animus versus amat hoc studet unum detrimenta fugas servorum incendia ridet non fraudem socio puerove incogitat ullam pupillo horace epist ad augustum their usual poverty is a signal proof of this for as the love of money is the source of all corruption he who despises gold is above all the vices that attend it and poverty attended with great parts may very well pass for a pretty sure sign of honesty a dramatick poet therefore being averse from all corruption himself if ever he describes any kind of it is sure to make it both odious and ridiculous  i come now to almost the only charge against the stage which seems to have any thing of real weight in it and that is that it excites in mens minds the natural love of women and here by this charge may be meant two things the one is that it excites in men a desire to the unlawful enjoyment of women the other is that it inclines them to that violent passion of love which is sometimes between the two sexes  as to the first part of the charge that it excites in men a desire to the unlawful enjoyment of women if there are any passages in our plays that are chargeable with that guilt or that defile the imaginations of an audience with unchaste and immodest images they are neither natural to the drama nor necessary but flagrant abuses of it and contrary to the very design of the art and those passages ought to be banished from the stage for ever and yet i cannot help thinking that if ever those passages could be excusable they would be so at this juncture when the execrable sin of sodomy is spread so wide that the foresaid passages might be of some use to the reducing mens minds to the natural desire of women let fornication be ever so crying a sin yet sodomy is a crime of a thousand times a deeper dye a crime that forced down supernatural fire from heaven to extinguish its infernal flames a crime that would have obliged even righteous lot to prostitute his two chaste and virgin daughters in order to prevent it i cannot here omit observing one thing that this unnatural sin has very much increased since colliers books were published against the stage there were no less than four persons condemned for it the last sessions and i am informed that several more have been since apprehended for it the like of which was never heard of in great britain before  as for the passion of love by which the hearts of men and women are sometimes mutually and violently inclined to each other if the passion is kept within the bounds of nature if the object and the intention of it is lawful or if it is punished when it is unlawful i am of the opinion that it cannot have the least ill consequence it is certainly a check upon wandering loose desires it gives a very great and very harmless pleasure and has a direct tendency to the keeping the two sexes steadfast and firm to the natural love of each other for not only the affections of the men have wildly wandered from nature as is manifest to all the world but not a few of the women too have endeavored to make themselves the center of their own happiness st paul is pleased to reprove this unnatural affection of the roman dames in the first chapter of his epistle to the romans and mr law is desired to take notice that he lays those unnatural desires not upon their going to plays but upon their idolatry verse    professing themselves to be wise they became fools verse    and changed the glory of the incorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things verse    wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness to dishonor their own bodies between themselves verse    who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed for ever amen verse    for this cause god gave them up to vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature verse    and likewise the men leaving the natural use of the women burned in their own lusts one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their errors which was meet and mr law may be pleased to observe that the apostle here gives us another signal proof that he does not put idolatry and going to plays upon an equal foot and here sir i desire leave to make another remark and that is that of all the countries of the christian world that country has been is and is like to be the most infamous for this execrable vice in which idolatry has set up its head quarters  sir you are very well acquainted with the exact judgment of the late french satyrist who was an honor to france that he was very far from being a friend to the corruption of the stage will appear from the following passage of the fourth canto of his art of poetry where he is giving his advice to the poets who were his cotemporaries que votre ame and vos moeurs peints dans tous vos ouvrages noffrent jamais de vous que de nobles images je ne puis estimer ces dangereux auteurs qui de lhonneur en verse infames deserteurs trahissant la virtue sur un papier coupable aux yeux de leurs lectures rendent le vice aimable though i know very well that no one understands this author better than you do yet as this letter is to pass through your hand to the press i desire leave to translate the passage for the benefit of those who are not used to french let your soul and your manners appearing in your works to your readers never offer any but noble ideas of you i can have no esteem for those dangerous authors those infamous deserters of honor in their verses who being traitors to virtue in their guilty lines render vice lovely to the eyes of those who peruse them and yet immediately after comes his approbation of love in dramatick poems je ne suis pas pourtant de ces tristes esprits qui bannissant lamour de tous chastes ecrits dun si rich ornement veulent priver la scene traitent dempoisonneurs and rodrigue and chimene lamour le moins honneste exprime chastement nexcite point en nous de honteux movement didon a beau gemir and metaler ses charms je condamne sa fault en partageant ses larmes and yet says he i am none of those splenetick souls who banishing love from all chaste composures endeavor to deprive the stage of so rich an ornament the most dishonorable love if it is chastely expressed excites no shameful motion in us in vain does dido lament and groan exposing all her charms to me i condemn her conduct at the very time that i partake of her grief  i now return to the charge of hypocrisy for which there are very just grounds of suspicion from the style and language of this pamphlet for is not this little treatise which is pretended to be writ through a zeal for the christian religion writ in downright antichristian language is this pamplet writ in the language of modesty of humility of meekness is it writ in the attractive language of charity on the contrary does not mr law seem to have taken all his degrees at a certain university between the bridge and the tower and as the disciples of our savior from dealers in fish became the apostles of their master this false apostle seems to set up for water doctor and from a priest to become a dealer in fish for he has not only the tropes and the figures and all the rhetorical flowers but the very tautologies of those obstreperous dealers in quiet and mute animals for the foresaid obstreperous dealers are not contented with calling rogue or whore or bitch or villain once they will repeat it fifty times and their fellowcollegiate who disputes with them will return it fiftyfold  i desire that you would give me leave to present you with some of mr laws rhetorical flowers  at the bottom of the second page of his pamphlet he tells us that there is more to be said in behalf of popery than of going to plays for that is plainly his meaning though he disguises it by the terms that he uses and toward the top of the third page he is no less positive that god is less displeased with popery than he is with going to plays it looks as if mr law would be very glad to exchange plays for popery  in all the rest of the second page he puts them upon an equal foot and assures us that the entertainment of the stage is contrary to more doctrines of scripture than the worship of images  what though we grant it intemperance in eating drinking and venery is contrary to more doctrines of scripture than is either murder or high treason and yet either murder or high treason singly is ten times a greater sin than all the forementioned three together sometimes he is making idolatry that is popery less criminal than going to plays sometimes he is for making them equal and endeavoring to revive the old stoical opinion omnia peccata sunt aequalia all sins are equal a paradox that would tend to make christianity as ridiculous as it helped to do pagan stoicism  in the first paragraph of the  th page you go to hear plays you say  i tell you says mr law you go to hear ribaldry and profaneness that you entertain your mind with extravagant thoughts wild rant blasphemous speeches wanton amors profane jests and impure passions ay now the language of the college begins and a little lower he who goes to a play diverts himself with the lewdness impudence profaneness and impure discourses of the stage and a little lower in the same page this is plainly the case of the stage it is an entertainment that consists of lewd impudent profane discourses and page   it is an entertainment made up of lewdness profaneness and all the extravagant rant of disordered passions at the top of page   he is endeavoring once more to make popery less sinful than going to plays and by the same piece of spiritual sophistry he confirms this religious lie because forsooth the stage with its lewd profane discourses offends against more doctrines of plain scripture than popery which is proving one gross piece of falsehood by another that is much greater  about the middle of the same page he brings an argument against the stage from the iniquity of the players against whom he inveighs with his usual sophistry and uncharitableness which is full as wise and as just as it would be to bring an argument against the church from the vices of some spiritual comedians the players are men and women says he equally bold in all instances of profaneness passion and immodesty whose business page   is profane wicked lewd and immodest and a little lower in the same page whose employment is less christian than that of robbers for he must know very little of the nature of religion says mr law who can look upon lust profaneness and disordered passions to be less contrary to religion than the taking money from the right owner which is directly contrary to common sense and to common utility  queis paria esse fere placuit peccata laborant cum ventum ad verum est sensus moresque repugnant atque ipsa utilitas justi prope matter and aequi hor page  0 he speaks of the blasphemy profaneness lewdness immodesty and wicked rant of plays and a little lower in the same page he mentions a collection of all the wicked profane blasphemous lewd impudent detestable things that are said in the playhouse and page    he speaks of the entertainment of the stage as it consists of loveintrigues blasphemous passions profane discourses lewd descriptions filthy jests and all the most extravagant rant of wanton profligate persons of both sexes heating and inflaming one another with all the wantonness of address the immodesty of motion and the lewdness of thought that wit can invent  and here i desire leave to say a word by the way in defense of players whose profession he very wisely humanely and christianly makes as unlawful as that of robbers is he to be told at this time of day that the players say nothing of themselves they only speak what the poet puts into the mouths of his universal allegorical fantoms which fantoms the players represent can this poor gentleman be so simple as to believe that reynard bruin isgrim and grimalkin say really of themselves the things that aesop puts into their mouths the players are only the poets instruments by which he carries on his action and proves his moral if any musician sings a treasonable song and plays to it at the same time he ought to suffer for his crime but would you indict the fiddle or the flute upon which the tune is played  what turn mr law designed to serve by being so profuse of so much fine language he best can tell though we perhaps may guess but he could never possibly think of making poets or players or spectators good christians by railing at them for an hour together and treating them worse than the great archangel dared to treat the devil who durst not bring against him a railing accusation but only said the lord rebuke thee if he designed to convert people by such a proceeding he might as well pretend to begin a friendship with another by abusing him and throwing dirt at him  but to make some amends for treating his fellow creatures with so much antichristian language he uses the devil with a great deal of respect and civility for besides the gentle terms in which he speaks of him of his honor of his glory of his joy his delight his pleasure his peculiar pleasure as if damnation were an honorable and a happy state besides this i say he is pleased out of his great bounty to settle upon him and his to have and to hold for ever the freehold and feesimple of all our theaters one may with the same assurance affirm says he that the playhouse not only when some profane play is on the stage but in its daily common entertainments is as certainly the house of the devil as the church is the house of god page    and a little lower in the same page the manner and matter of stageentertainments is as undeniable a proof and as obvious to common sense that the house belongs to the devil and is the place of his honor as the matter and manner of church service prove that the place is appropriated to god  now my opinion is that if the devil should once become the headlandlord of our theaters he would immediately turn them into so many jacobite conventicles for those are properly his houses those are properly his temples for the sins which the theaters are accused by mr law of encouraging are not the devils sins but our own the sins of men and women the devil neither drinks nor whores nor games nor rants nor gormandizes but the sins which are carried on in a jacobite conventicle are the devils own sins his two great original sins lying and rebellion there all those false doctrines are carried on of hereditary right divine right indefeasible right absolute power uncontrollable power passive obedience unconditional obedience doctrines invented on purpose to make and flatter tyrants who are the devils viceroys for as good kings are gods vicegerents sure a tyrant is hells viceroy the place where the pretenders cause is carried on is properly the temple of the devil the original pretender  when mr law affirms that the playhouse is the sink of corruption and debauchery page    and that this is not the state of it through any accidental abuse as any innocent or good thing may be abused but that corruption and debauchery are the truly natural and genuine effects of the stage entertainments is it possible that he can be so ignorant as he pretends to make himself can he be ignorant that by affirming this he contradicts what has been the common sense of mankind for two thousand years and that he contradicts the opinions and the judgments of the greatest and wisest and most virtuous men of the greatest and wisest and most virtuous nations during that vast space of time if corruption and debauchery were the natural and genuine effects of theatrical entertainments would they have been encouraged by the great legislators the most learned philosophers and the wisest rulers of the freest states in the world  no body knows better than mr law that of all public diversions the drama is the most reasonable manly noble and instructive diversion the excelling in which shows the excellence and the strength of genius of that particular nation where it appears and by that means advances its reputation with other nations and augments its power and that therefore dramatick performances have been so cherished and esteemed by the wisest rulers of the noblest nations that they have been maintained by the public treasure and the magistrate has not thought it at all below him to have the regulation and the immediate inspection of it which is an undeniable proof that they did not at all mistrust that it was natural to those entertainments to corrupt and debauch their people  the drama is in itself so excellent and to excel in it requires so many great qualities that of all the nations we hear of among the ancients but two were capable of proper constant theatrical entertainments and those two were the wisest bravest and most virtuous of all the nations so famous for their great actions in war and so illustrious for the arts of peace that to know what they were is become a principal part of the learning of us moderns and it is accounted scandalous in a gentleman to be ignorant of what they said and wrote and did and yet to know what their tragic and comic poets were and what they wrote is none of the meanest branches of that very learning  what opinion the grecians themselves had of their drama how far they believed their tragic poets able to inspire their countrymen with the love of their country with the love of liberty of virtue and of true glory and with a magnanimous contempt of death for the public good may be gathered from the unanimous consent of greece and particularly from the honors done by the athenians to their tragic poets who made them governors of provinces generals of their armies and guardians of the public liberty for when the athenians settled a greater fund for the supporting the magnificence of their tragic representations than for the maintenance of their fleets and armies we may justly conclude that it was their opinion that their tragic poets by constantly setting before them the calamities of tyrants defended them from far more dangerous enemies than those which their armies were sent to encounter and that was from their own aspiring citizens as no people were ever more jealous of their liberties than the athenians none ever knew better that corruption and debauchery are inconsistent with liberty and therefore it never in the least entered into the thoughts of that great people that corruption and debauchery were the natural effects of dramatick entertainments  nor can it be objected with any manner of justice that it was the fury of the athenian populace running mad after their pleasures that made them so warmly espouse the drama the greatest and the wisest philosophers of that renowned republic declared most warmly and most loudly for it aristotle writ an admirable system of rules for the composing dramatick poems with that right hand that has given us so many excellent lessons of morality and socrates the wisest and the most virtuous of all the philosophers who made it the whole business of his life to instruct his countrymen in moral virtue did not think it in the least below his wisdom and his virtue to assist euripides in the writing his tragedies  that the romans did not yield to the grecians in the esteem which they had for dramatick entertainments and the belief that they were capable of contributing to the glory and the felicity of a mighty state and to the glory and felicity of the authors of them we may gather from the actions of their wisest statesmen their greatest captains and their severest philosophers their greatest captains and their wisest statesmen not only encouraged dramatick poems but vouchsafed to write them themselves scipio the wise the virtuous scipio writ comedy with that conquering hand that won the empire of the world at zama augustus caesar as famous for the arts of peace as his success in war renowned for the wholesome laws he enacted and for his reforming the manners of the people begun the tragedy of ajax though he could not finish it but found it easier to make himself emperor of the world than a great dramatick poet cicero the champion of the roman liberties in twenty places of his philosophic treatises quotes the roman tragic poets and seneca who through the opinion which agrippina had of the strictness and the severity of his virtue was entrusted with the education of a prince upon whose conduct the happiness of mankind depended seneca who by so many admirable lessons of moral virtue has obliged all the lovers of wit and virtue for ever did not think writing tragedy an employment at all below him  now sir i appeal to you whether it does not logically and necessarily follow from what has been said that either mr law must believe that the great men among the ancient grecians and romans their captains statesmen and philosophers wanted common sense or he cannot possibly believe that corruption and debauchery are the natural effects of theatrical entertainments and consequently must be guilty of very vile hypocrisy  there remains another strong presumption of hypocrisy against mr law for what is mr law and what are his two predecessors collier and bedford who attacked the stage before him why jacabite nonjuring parsons all three of them who have disowned our established church and disowned our government how come they to take up this great concern for our salvation in a matter about which all our pastors who have the immediate care of our souls are silent have they more capacity to see the enormous crimes of theaters and the pretended fatal consequences of them than so many great and good men who have been the exalted lights of the church since the restoration no all the world knows that there is not the least pretense for it nor the least comparison have they more true zeal and concern for the christian religion no that as we observed above is inconsistent with their manner of treating us the language of billingsgate can never be the language of charity nor consequently of christianity truth has not the impetuous stormy air which mr law assumes but comes in the soft and still voice like the god who inspires it and truth detests and abominates the equivocating and prevaricating of mr collier and mr bedford  but now let us consider the time that these people have chose to exert their pretended zeal it has been always when something has been about to be done which it was thought might prove favorable to the pretender mr collier published his short view when france declared for the chevalier upon the death of james ii and his dissuasive upon the great storm when the great devastation which that huricane wrought had amazed and astonished the minds of men and made them obnoxious to melancholy and desponding thoughts i formerly exposed the egregious hypocritical folly of making that storm a divine judgment upon the nation for the enormities of our theaters mr law has taken the opportunity to attack the stage upon the great preparations which he heard were making abroad and which the jacobites flattered themselves were designed in their favor as for mr bedfords serious remonstrance though i know nothing of the time of publishing it yet i dare to lay odds it was either upon the duke daumonts being at somerset house or upon the late rebellion now all these attacks upon the stage have been attacks upon the government and those three worthy persons seem to me to have been at the beck of some certain superiors and always ready at their command to divert the people of great britain from their real danger by giving them alarms in a wrong place  finis errata p   last line but one a after experience
