fable i edinburg at the apollo press by the martins anno       the life of edward moore of the life of this ingenious writer few particulars are known and none respecting his descent birth education or death at least none which we have been able to discover  mr moore was bred a linendraper but whether from a stronger attachment to the study than the counter from a more ardent zeal in the pursuit of fame than in the search after fortune or whether from the cause assigned by our author himself in the preface to the quarto edition of his works in      that his marriage with the muses like most other marriages into that noble family was more from necessity than inclination he quitted business to join the retinue of these ladies and he certainly had a very happy and pleasant talent in poetry in his trial of selim the persian which is a compliment to the first and worthy lord lyttelton he has shown himself a perfect master of the most elegant kind of panegyric that which is couched under the appearance of accusation and his fables for the female sex not only in the freedom and ease of the verfification but also in the forcibleness of the moral and poignancy of the satire approach nearer to the manner of mr gay than any of the numerous imitations of that author which have been attempted since the publication of his fables  as a dramatick writer mr moore has by no means met with the success his pieces have merited which are three in number the foundling and gil blas comedies and the gamester a tragedy the first has been condemned for its supposed resemblance to the celebrated comedy of the conscious lovers and the gamester met with a cold reception for no other apparent reason but because it too nearly touched a favorite and fashionable vice the gamester was also objected to as too prosaick in the language and too horrible in the catastrophe as observed and apologized for by the author in his preface to the gamester quarto edition of       yet on the whole his plots are interesting his characters well drawn his sentiments delicate and his language poetical and pleasing and what crowns all and more forcibly claims for his writings public notice the greatest purity pervades the whole the obvious tendency of every piece being the promotion of morality and virtue as is indeed observed by the author himself in the preface already referred to when speaking of his writings in general such as the work now is i submit it to the public defects in it there are many  its merit if it has any and i may be allowed to name it is its being natural and unaffected and tending to promote virtue  mr moore married a lady of the name of hamilton daughter to the tabledecker to the princesses she had a poetical turn and has been said to have assisted her husband in the writing of his plays one specimen of her poetry was handed about before their marriage and has since appeared in different collections of songs it was addressed to a daughter of the famous stephen duck and begins with the following stanza would you think it my duck for the fault i must own your jenny at last is quite covetous grown though millions if fortune should lavishly pour i still should be wretched if i had not more after halfadozen other stanzas in which with great ingenuity and delicacy and yet in a manner that expresses a sincere affection she has quibbled on our authors name she concludes with the following lines you will wonder my girl who this dear one can be whose merit can boast such a conquest as me but you sh nt know his name though i told you before it begins with an m but i dare not say more   in the year      mr moore commenced a weekly miscellaneous paper entitled the world by adam fitzadam in which undertaking he was assisted by lord chesterfield and other distinguished characters this paper was collected and published in four volumes and mr moore died soon thereafter  preface most of the following poems have already made their appearance in detached pieces but as many of them were printed without a name i was advised by some particular friends to collect them into a volume and publish them by subscription the painful task of soliciting such a subscription was chiefly undertaken by those friends and with such spirit and zeal that i should be greatly wanting in gratitude if i neglected any opportunity either public or private of making them my most sincere acknowledgments i am also obliged to a very valuable friend in ireland for a considerable number of subscribers in that kingdom a list of whose names i have not been favored with and for which i was desired not to delay publication i mention this seeming neglect that my friends on that side the water may not accuse me of any disrespect  such as the work now is i submit it to the public defects in it there are many which i have wanted both time and abilities to amend as i could wish its merit if it has any and i may be allowed to name it is its being natural and unaffected and tending to promote virtue and good humor those parts of it that have been published singly had the good fortune to please those that are now added will i hope be no discredit to them upon the whole i have sent this my offspring into the world in as decent a dress as i was able a legitimate one i am sure it is and if it should be thought defective in strength spirit or vigor let it be considered that its fathers marriage with the muses like most other marriages into that noble family was more from necessity than inclination  to his grace thomas holles duke of newcastle my lord had i the honor of being personally known to your grace i had not thus presumptuously addressed you without previous solicitation for so great an indulgence but that your grace may neither be surprised nor offended at the liberty i am taking my plea is that the great and good man whose name is prefixed to the first of these poems was a friend and benefactor to me the favors i have received at his hands and the kind assurances he was pleased to give me of their continuance which his death only prevented have left me to lament my own private loss amidst the general concern it is from these favors and assurances that i flatter myself with having a kind of privilege to address your grace upon this occasion and to entreat your patronage of the following sheets i pretended to no merit with mr pelham except that of honoring his virtues and wishing to have been serviceable to them i pretend to no other with your grace my hopes are that while you are fulfilling every generous intention of the brother whom you loved your grace will not think me unworthy of some small share of that notice with which he was once pleased to honor me  i will not detain your grace to echo back the voice of a whole people in favor of your just and prudent administration of public affairs that the salutary measures you are pursuing may be as productive of tranquillity and honor to your grace as they are of happiness to these kingdoms is the sincere wish of  my lord your graces most humble most obedient and most devoted servant edward moore tullys head pall mall feb   th      fables for the ladies fable

hence the eagle cries it is conscience conscience that applies the virtuous mind takes no alarm secured by innocence from harm while guilt and his associate fear are startled at the passing air fable ii the panther the horse and other beasts the man who seeks to win the fair so custom says must truth forbear must fawn and flatter cringe and lie and raise the goddess to the sky for truth is hateful

i say your lips disclose the freshness of the opening rose or that your cheeks are beds of flowers enripend by refreshing showers yet certain as these flowers shall fade time every beauty will invade the butterfly of various hue more than the flower resembles you fair fluttering fickle busy thing to pleasure ever on the wing gayly coquetting for an hour to die and never be thought of more would you the bloom of youth should last it is virtue that must bind it fast an easy carriage wholly free from sour reserve or levity goodnaturd mirth an open heart and looks unskilled in any art humility enough to own the frailties which a friend makes known and decent pride enough to know the worth that virtue can bestow these are the charms which never decay though youth and beauty fade away and time which all things else removes still heightens virtue and improves you ll frown and ask to what intent this blunt address to you is sent i ll spare the question and confess i d praise you if i loved you less but rail be angry or complain i will be rude while you are vain beneath a lions peaceful reign when beasts met friendly on the plain a panther of majestic port the vainest female of the court with spotted skin and eyes of fire filled every bosom with desire wherever she moved a servile crowd of fawning creatures cringd and bowed assemblies every week she held like modern belles with coxcombs filled where noise and nonsense and grimace and lies and scandal filled the place behold the gay fantastic thing encircled by the spacious ring lowbowing with important look as first in rank the monkey spoke gad take me madam but i swear no angel ever looked so fair forgive my rudeness but i vow you were not quite divine till now those limbs that shape and then those eyes o close them or the gazer dies nay gentle pug for goodness hush i vow and swear you make me blush i shall be angry at this rate it is so like flattery which i hate the fox in deeper cunning versed the beauties of her mind rehearsed and talked of knowledge taste and sense to which the fair have vast pretense yet well he knew them always vain of what they strive not to attain and played so cunningly his part that pug was rivalld in his art the goat avowed his amorous flame and burnt  for what he durst not name yet hoped a meeting in the wood might make his meaning understood half angry at the bold address she frowned but yet she must confess such beauties might inflame his blood but still his phrase was somewhat rude the hog her neatness much admired the formal ass her swiftness fired while all to feed her folly strove and by their praises shared her love the horse whose generous heart disdained applause by servile flattery gained with graceful courage silence broke and thus with indignation spoke when flattering monkies fawn and prate they justly raise contempt or hate for merit is turned to ridicule applauded by the grinning fool the artful fox your wit commends to lure you to his selfish ends from the vile flattrer turn away for knaves make friendships to betray dismiss the train of fops and fools and learn to live by wisdoms rules such beauties might the lion warm did not your folly break

nymph whose cheeks disclose the lily and the blushing rose from public view her charms will screen and rarely in the crowd be seen this simple truth shall keep her wise the fairest fruits attract the flies one night a glowworm proud and vain contemplating her glittering train cried sure there never was in nature so elegant so fine a creature all other insects that i see the frugal ant industrious

hopes deride and cut the knot that hymen tied shall not the bloody and the bold the miser hoarding up his gold the harlot reeking from the stew alone thy fell revenge pursue but must the gentle and the kind thy fury undistinguished find the monarch calmly thus replied weigh well the cause and then decide that friend of yours you lately named cupid alone is to be blamed then let the charge be justly laid that idle boy neglects his trade and hardly once in twenty years a couple to your temple bears the wretches whom your office blends silenus now or plutus sends hence care and bitterness

sonnets at the playhouse sung high waving over his laboring head the goddess want her pinions spread and with poetic fury fired what phoebus faintly had inspired a noble youth of taste and wit approved the sprightly things he writ and sought him in his cobweb dome discharged his rent and brought him home behold him at the stately board who but the poet and my lord each day deliciously he dines and greedy quaffs the generous wines his sides were plump his skin was sleek and plenty wantoned on his cheek astonished at the change so new away the inspiring goddess slew now dropped for politics and news neglected lay the drooping muse unmindful whence his fortune came he stifled the poetic flame nor tale nor sonnet for my lady lampoon nor epigram was ready with just contempt his

the sheep and the lamb duty demands the parents voice should sanctify the daughters choice in that is due obedience shown to choose belongs to her alone may horror seize his midnight hour who builds upon a parentspowr and claims by purchase vile and base the loathing maid for his embrace hence virtue sickens and the breast where peace had built her downy nest becomes the troubled seat of care and pines with anguish and despair a wolf rapacious rough and bold whose nightly plunders thinnd the fold contemplating his illspent life and cloyed with thefts would take a wife his purpose known the savage race in numerous crowds attend the place for why a mighty wolf he was and held dominion in his jaws her favorite whelp each mother brought and humbly his alliance sought but cold by age or else too nice none found acceptance in his eyes it happened as at early dawn he solitary crossed the lawn strayed from the fold a sportive lamb skippd wanton by her fleecy dam when cupid foe to man and beast discharged an arrow at his breast the timorous breed the robber knew and trembling over the meadow flew their nimblest speed the wolf oertook and courteous thus the dam bespoke stay fairest and suspend your fear trust me no enemy is near these jaws in slaughter ost imbrued at length have known enough of blood and kinder business brings me now vanquished at beautys feet to bow you have a

discourse like this attention claimed grandeur the mothers breast inflamed now fearless by his side she walked of settlements and jointures talked proposed and doubled her demands of flowery fields and turnip lands the wolf agrees her bosom swells to miss her happy fate she tells and of the grand alliance vain contemns her kindred of the plain the loathing lamb with horror hears and wearies out her dam with prayers but all in vain mamma best knew what unexperienced girls should do so to the neighboring meadow carried a formal ass the couple married torn from the tyrantmothers side the trembler goes a victimbride reluctant meets the rude embrace and bleats among the howling race with horror often her eyes behold her murdered kindred of the fold each day a sister lamb is served and at the gluttons table carved the crashing bones he grinds for food and slakes his thirst with streaming blood love who the cruel mind detests and lodges but in gentle breasts was now no more enjoyment past the savage hungerd for the feast but as we find in human race a mask conceals the villains face justice must authorize the treat till then he longed but durst not eat as forth he walked in quest of prey the hunters met him on the way fear wings his flight the marsh he sought the snuffing dogs are set at fault his stomach balkd now hunger gnaws howling he grinds his empty jaws food must be had and lamb is nigh his maw invokes the fraudful lie is this dissembling rage he cried the gentle virtue of a bride that leagued with mans destroying race she sets her husband for the chase by treachry prompts the noisy hound to scent his footsteps on the ground thou traitress vile for this thy blood shall glut my rage and dye the wood so saying on the lamb he flies beneath his jaws the victim dies fable vii the goose and the swans i hate the face however fair that carries an affected air the lisping tone the shape constrained the studied look the passion feigned are fopperies which only tend to injure what they strive to mend with what superior grace enchants the face which natures pencil paints where eyes unexercisd in art glow with the meaning of the heart where freedom and good humor sit and easy gaiety and wit though perfect beauty be not there the master lines the finished air we catch from every look delight and grow enamored at the sight for beauty though we all approve excites our wonder more than love while the agreeable strikes sure and gives the wounds we cannot cure why then my amoret this care that forms you in effect less fair if nature on your cheek bestows a bloom that emulates the rose or from some heavenly image drew a form apelles never knew your illjudgd aid will you impart and spoil by meretricious art or had you natures error come abortive from the mothers womb your forming care she still rejects which only heightens her defects when such of glittering jewels proud still press the foremost in the crowd at every public show are seen with look awry and awkward mien the gaudy dress attracts the eye and magnifies deformity nature may underdo her part but seldom wants the help of art trust her she is your surest friend nor made your form for you to mend a goose affected empty vain the shrillest of the cackling train with proud and elevated crest precedence claimed above the rest says she i laugh at human race who say geese hobble in their pace look here the slandrous lie detect not haughty man is so erect that peacock yonder lord how vain the creature is of his gaudy train if both were stripped i d pawn my word a goose would be the finer bird nature to hide her own defects her bungled work with finery decks were geese set off with half that show would men admire the peacock no thus vaunting cross the mead she stalks the cackling breed attend her walks the sun shot down his noontide beams the swans were sporting in the streams their snowy plumes and stately pride provoked her spleen why there she cried again what arrogance we see those creatures how they mimick me shall every fowl the waters skim because we geese are known to swim humility they soon shall learn and their own emptiness discern so saying with extended wings lightly upon the wave she springs her bosom swells she spreads her plumes and the swans stately crest assumes contempt and mockery ensued and bursts of laughter shook the flood a swan superior to the rest sprung forth and thus the fool addressed conceited thing elate with pride thy affectation all deride these airs thy awkwardness impart and show thee plainly as thou art among thy equals of the flock thou had escaped the public mock and as thy parts to good conduce been deemed an honest hobbling goose learn hence to study wisdoms rules know foppry is the pride of fools and striving nature to conceal you only her defects reveal fable viii the lawyer and justice love thou divinest good below thy pure delights few mortals know our rebel hearts thy sway disown while tyrant lust usurps thy

knowledge taste and sense and courage for the fairs defense her frame resistless to each wrong demands protection from the strong to man she flies when fear alarms and claims the temple of his arms by natures author thus declared the womans sovereign and her guard shall man by treacherous wiles invade the weakness he was meant to aid while beauty given to inspire protecting love and soft desire lights up a wildfire in the heart and to its own breast points the dart becomes the spoilers base pretense to triumph over innocence the wolf that tears the timorous sheep was never set the fold to keep nor was the tiger or the pard meant the benighted travllers guard but man the wildest beast of prey wears friendships semblance to betray his strength against the weak employs and where he should protect destroys past twelve oclock the watchman cried his brief the studious lawyer plied the allprevailing fee lay nigh the earnest of tomorrows lie sudden the furious winds arise the jarring casement shattered flies the doors admit a hollow sound and rattling from their hinges bound when justice in a blaze of light revealed her radiant form to sight the wretch with thrilling horror shook loose every joint and pale his look not having seen her in the courts or found her mentioned in reports he asked with faltring tongue her name her errand there and whence she came sternly the whiterobd shade replied a crimson glow her visage died can thou be doubtful who i am is justice grown so strange a name were not your courts for justice raised it was there of old my altars blazed my guardian thee did i elect my sacred temple to protect that thou and all thy venal tribe should spurn the goddess for the bribe aloud the ruined client cries justice has neither ears nor eyes in soul alliance with the bar against me the judge denounces war and rarely issues his decree but with intent to baffle me she paused her breast with fury burned the trembling lawyer thus returned i own the charge is justly laid and weak the excuse that can be made yet search the spacious globe and see if all mankind are not like me the gownman skilled in romish lies by faiths false glass deludes our eyes over conscience rides without control and robs the man to save his soul the doctor with important face by sly design mistakes the case prescribes and spins out the disease to trick the patient of his fees the soldier rough with many a scar and red with slaughter leads the war if he a nations trust betray the foe has offered double pay when vice over all mankind prevails and weighty interest turns the scales must i be better than the rest and harbor justice in my breast on one side only take the fee content with poverty and thee thou blind to sense and vile of mind the exasperated shade rejoined if virtue from the world is flown will others frauds excuse thy own for sickly souls the priest was made physicians for the bodys aid the soldier guarded liberty man woman and the lawyer me if all are faithless to their trust they leave nor thee the less unjust henceforth your pleadings i disclaim and bar the sanction of my name within your courts it shall be read that justice from the law is fled she spoke and hid in shades her face till hardwicke soothed her into grace fable ix the farmer the spaniel and the cat why knits my dear her angry brow what rude offense alarms you now i said that delia s fair t is true but did i say she equaled you cannot i anothers face commend or to her virtues be a friend but instantly your forehead lowers as if her merit lessened yours from female envy never free all must be blind because you see survey the gardens fields and bowers the buds the blossoms and the flowers then tell me where the woodbine grows that vies in sweetness with the rose or where the lilys snowy white that throws such beauties on the sight yet folly is it to declare that these are neither sweet nor fair the crystal shines with fainter rays before the diamonds brighter blaze and fops will say the diamond dies before the luster of your eyes but i who deal in truth deny that neither shine when you are by when zephirs over the blossoms stray and sweets along the air convey sha nt i the fragrant breeze inhale because you breathe a sweeter gale sweet are the flowers that deck the field sweet is the smell the blossoms yield sweet is the summer gale that blows and sweet though sweeter you the rose shall envy then torment your breast if you are lovelier than the rest for while i give to each her due by praising them i flatter you and praising most i still declare you fairest where the rest are fair as at his board a farmer sat replenished by his homely treat his favorite spaniel near him stood and with his master shared the food the crackling bones his jaws devoured his lapping tongue the trenchers scoured till sated now supine he lay and snord the rising fumes away the hungry cat in turn drew near and humbly craved a servants share her modest worth the master knew and straight the fattning morsel threw enraged the snarling cur awoke and thus with spiteful envy spoke they only claim a right to eat who earn by services their meat me zeal and industry inflame to scour the fields and spring the game or plunging in the wintry wave for man the wounded bird to save with watchful diligence i keep from prowling wolves his fleecy sheep at home his midnight hours secure and drive the robber from the door for this his breast with kindness glows for this his hand the food bestows and shall thy indolence impart a warmer friendship to his heart that thus he robs me of my due to pamper such vile things as you i own with meekness puss replied superior merit on your side nor does my breast with envy swell to find it recompensed so well yet i in what my nature can contribute to the good of man whose claws destroy the pilfring mouse who drives the vermin from the house or watchful for the laboring swain from lurking rats secures the grain from hence if he rewards bestow why should your heart with gall overflow why pine my happiness to see since there s enough for you and me thy words are just the farmer cried and spurned the snarler from his side fable x the spider and the be the nymph who walks the public streets and sets her cap at all she meets may catch the fool who turns to stare but men of sense avoid the snare as on the margin of the flood with silken line my lydia stood i smiled to see the pains you took to cover over the fraudful hook along the forest as we strayed you saw the boy his limetwigs spread

desire but from the hoops bewitching round her very shoe has power to wound the roving eye the bosom bare the forward laugh the wanton air may catch the fop for gudgeons strike at the bare hook and bait alike while salmon play regardless by till art like nature forms the fly beneath a peasants homely thatch a spider long had held her watch from morn to night with restless care she spun her web

blushing grows guarded with thorns the modest rose enamored round and round i fly or on her fragrant bosom lie reluctant she my ardour meets and bashful renders up her sweets to wiser heads attention

ape it is true i blame your lovers choice though flattered by the public voice and peevish grow and sick to hear his exclamations o how fair i listen not to wild delights and transports of expected nights what is to me your hoard of charms the whiteness of your neck and arms needs there no acquisition more to keep contention from the door yes pass a fortnight and you will find all beauty cloys but of the mind sense and good humor ever prove the surest cords to fasten love yet phillis simplest of your sex you never think but to perplex coquetting it with every ape that struts abroad in human

rules becomes a comet gazed by fools foreboding cares and storms and strife and fraught with all the plagues of life thou fool by union every creature subsists through universal nature and this to beings void of mind is wedlock of a meaner kind while wombd in space primeval clay a yet unfashiond embryo lay the source of endless good above shot down his spark of kindling love touched by the allenlivning flame then motion first exulting came each atom sought its separate class through many a fair enamored mass love cast the central charm around and with eternal nuptials bound then form and order over the sky first trained their bridal pomp on high the sun displayed his orb to sight and burnt with hymeneal light hence natures virginwomb conceived and with the genial burden heaved forth came the oak her firstborn heir and sealed the breathing steep of air then infant stems of various use imbibed her soft maternal juice the flowers in early bloom disclosed upon her fragrant breast reposed within her warm embraces grew a race of endless form and hue then poured her lesser offspring round and fondly clothed their parent ground nor here alone the virtue reigned by matters cumbring form detained but thence subliming and refined aspired and reached its kindred mind caught in the fond celestial fire the mind perceived unknown desire and now with kind effusion flowed and now with cordial ardours glowed beheld the sympathetick fair and loved its own resemblance there on all with circling radiance shone but centring fixed on one alone there clasped the heavnappointed wife and doubled every joy of life here ever blessing ever blessed resides this beauty of the breast as from his palace here the god still beams effulgent bliss abroad here gems his own eternal round the ring by which the world is bound here bids his seat of empire grow and builds his little heaven below the bridal partners thus allied and thus in sweet accordance tied one body heart and spirit live enriched by every joy they give like echo from her vocal hold returned in music twenty fold their union firm and undecayd nor time can shake nor power invade but as the stem and scion stand ingrasted by a skilful hand they check the tempests wintry rage and bloom and strengthen into age a thousand amities unknown and powers perceived by love alone endearing looks and chaste desire fan and support the mutual fire whose flame perpetual as refined is fed by an immortal mind nor yet the nuptial sanction ends like nile it opens and descends which by apparent windings led we trace to its celestial head the sire fiist springing from above becomes the source of life and love and gives his filial heir to flow in fondness down on sons below thus rolled in one continued tide to times extremest verge they glide while kindred streams on either hand branch forth in blessings over the land thee wretch no lisping babe shall name no latereturning brother claim no kinsman on thy road

graceful action wooes and sweetly bills and fondly cooes ah deck me to his eyes alone with charms attractive as his own and in my circling wings carest give all the lover to my breast then in our chaste connubial bed my bosom pillowd for his head his eyes with blissful slumbers close and watch with me my lords repose your peace around his temples twine and love him with a love like mine and

desire our bosoms warm one will direct one wish inform through life one mutual aid sustain in death one peaceful grave contain while swelling with the darling theme her accents poured an endless stream the wellknown wings a sound impart that reached her ear and touched her heart quick dropped the music of her tongue and forth with eager joy she sprung as swift her entering consort flew and plumed and kindled at the view their wings their souls embracing meet their hearts with answring measure beat half lost in sacred sweets and blessed with raptures felt but never expressed straight to her humble roof she led the partner of her spotless bed her young a fluttering pair arise their welcome sparkling in their eyes transported to their sire they bound and hang with speechless action round in pleasure wrapped the parents stand and see their little wings expand the sire his lifesustaining prize to each expecting bill applies there fondly pours the wheaten spoil with transport given though won with toil while all collected at the sight and silent through supreme delight the fair high heaven of bliss beguiles and on her lord and infants smiles the sparrow whose attention hung upon the doves enchanting tongue of all his little sleights disarmed and from himself by virtue charmed when now he saw what only seemed a fact so late a fable deemed his soul to envy he resigned his hours of folly to the wind in secret wished a turtle too and sighing to himself withdrew fable xv the female seducers it is said of widow maid and wife that honor is a womans life unhappy sex who only claim a being in the breath of fame which tainted not the quickening gales that sweep sabaeas spicy vales nor all the healing sweets restore that breathe along arabias shore the travller if he chance to stray may turn uncensurd to his way polluted streams again are pure and deepest wounds admit a cure but woman no redemption knows the wounds of honor never close though distant every hand to guide nor skilled on lifes tempestuous tide if once her feeble bark recede or deviate from the course decreed in vain she seeks the friendless shore her swifter folly flies before the circling ports against her close and shut the wanderer from repose till by conflicting waves oppressed her foundring pinnace sinks to rest are there no offerings to atone for but a single error none though woman is avowed of old no daughter of celestial mould her tempring not without allay and formed but of the finer clay we challenge from the mortal dame the strength angelick natures claim nay more for sacred stories tell that even immortal angels fell whatever fills the teeming sphere of humid earth and ambient air with varying elements endud was formed to fall and rise renewed the stars no fixed duration know wide oceans ebb again to flow the moon repletes her waining face all beauteous from her late disgrace and suns that mourn approaching night refulgent rise with newborn light in vain may death and time subdue while nature mints her race anew and holds some vital spark apart like virtue hid in every heart it is hence reviving warmth is seen to clothe a naked world in green no longer barred by winters cold again the gates of life unfold again each insect tries his wing and lifts fresh pinions on the spring again from every latent root the bladed stem and tendril shoot exhaling incense to the skies again to perish and to rise and must weak woman then disown the change to which a world is prone in one meridian brightness shine and never like evening suns decline resolved and firm alone  is this what we demand of woman  yes but should the spark of vestal fire in some unguarded hour expire or should the nightly thief invade hesperias chaste and sacred shade of all the blooming spoil possessed the dragon honor charmed to rest shall virtues flame no more return no more with virgin splendor burn no more the ravaged garden blow with springs succeeding blossom  no pity may mourn but not restore and woman falls to rise no more within this sublunary sphere a country lies  no matter where the clime may readily be found by all who tread poetic ground a stream called life across it glides and equally the land divides and here of vice the province lies and there the hills of virtue rise upon a mountains airy stand whose summit looked to either land an ancient pair their dwelling chose as well for prospect as repose for mutual faith they long were famed and temperance and religion named a numerous progeny divine confessed the honors of their line but in a little daughter fair was centred more than half their care for heaven to gratulate her birth gave signs of future joy to earth white was the robe this infant wore and chastity the name she bore as now the maid in stature grew a flower just opening to the view often through her native land she strayed and wrestling with the lambkins played her looks diffusive sweets bequeathed the breeze grew purer as she breathed the morn her radiant blush assumed the spring with earlier fragrance bloomed and nature yearly took delight like her to dress the world in white but when her rising form was seen to reach the crisis of fifteen her parents up the mountains head with anxious step their darling led by turns they snatched her to their breast and thus the fears of age expressed o joyful cause of many a care o daughter too divinely fair yon world on this important day demands thee to a dangerous way a painful journey all must go whose doubtful period none can know whose due direction who can find where reason s mute and sense is blind ah what unequal leaders these through such a wide perplexing maze then mark the warnings of the wise and learn what love and years advise far to the right thy prospect bend where yonder towering hills ascend lo there the arduous paths in view which virtue and her sons pursue with toil over lessening earth they rise and gain and gain upon the skies narrow is the way her children tread no walk for pleasure smoothly spread but rough and difficult and steep painful to climb and hard to keep fruits immature those lands dispense a food indelicate to sense of taste unpleasant yet from those pure health with cheerful vigor lows and strength unfeeling of decay throughout the long laborious way hence as they scale that heavenly road each limb is lightened of its load from earth refining still they go and leave the mortal weight below then spreads the straight the doubtful clears and smooth the rugged path appears for custom turns fatigue to ease and taught by virtue pain can please at length the toilsome journey over and near the bright celestial shore a gulf black fearful and profound appears of either world the bound through darkness leading up to light sense backward shrinks and shuns the sight for there the transitory train of time and form and care and pain and matters gross incumbring mass mans late associates cannot pass but sinking quit the immortal charge and leave the wondering soul at large lightly she wings her obvious way and mingles with eternal day thither o thither wing thy speed though pleasure charm or pain impede to such the allbounteous power has given for present earth a future heaven for trivial loss unmeasured gain and endless bliss for transient pain then fear ah fear to turn thy sight where yonder flowery fields invite wide on the left the pathway bends and with pernicious ease descends there sweet to sense and fair to show newplanted edens seem to blow trees that delicious poison bear for death is vegetable there hence is the frame of health unbracd each sinew slackning at the taste the soul to passion yields her throne and sees with organs not her own while like the slumbrer in the night pleased with the shadowy dream of light before her alienated eyes the scenes of fairyland arise the puppet worlds amusing show dipped in the gaylycolourd bow sceptres and wreaths and glittering things the toys of infants and of kings that tempt along the baneful plain the idly wise and lightly vain till verging on the gulfy shore sudden they sink and rise no more but list to what thy fates declare though thou art woman frail as fair if once thy sliding foot should stray once quit yon heavnappointed way for thee lost maid for thee alone nor prayers shall plead nor tears atone reproach scorn infamy and hate on thy returning steps shall wait thy form be loathed by every eye and every foot thy presence fly thus armed with words of potent sound like guardian angels placed around a charm by truth divinely cast forward our young adventrer past forth from her sacred eyelids sent like morn forerunning radiance went while honor handmaid late assigned upheld her lucid train behind awestruck the muchadmiring crowd before the virgin vision bowed gazed with an evernew delight and caught fresh virtues at the sight for not of earths unequal frame they deemed the heavncompounded dame if matter sure the most refined high wrought and tempered into mind some darling daughter of the day and bodyd by her native ray wherever she passes thousands bend and thousands where she moves attend her ways observant eyes confess her steps pursuing praises bless while to the elevated maid oblations as to heaven are paid twas on an everblithesome day the jovial birth of rosy may when genial warmth no more suppressed newmelts the frost in every breast the cheek with secret flusbing dies and looks kind things from chastest eyes the sun with healthier visage glows aside his clouded kerchief throws and dances up the ethereal plain where late he used to climb with pain while nature as from bonds set free springs out and gives a loose to glee and now for momentary rest the nymph her traveled step represt just turned to view the stage attained and gloried in the height she gained outstretchd before her wide survey the realms of sweet perdition lay and pity touched her soul with woe to see a world so lost below when straight the breeze began to breathe airs gently wasted from beneath that bore commissioned witchcraft thence and reached her sympathy of sense no sounds of discord that disclose a people sunk and lost in woes but as of present good possessed the very triumph of the blessed the maid in wrapped attention hung while thus approaching sirens sung hither fairest hither haste brightest beauty come and taste what the powers of bliss unfold joys too mighty to be told taste what ecstasies they give dying raptures taste and live in thy lap disdaining measure nature empties all her treasure soft desires that sweetly languish fierce delights that rise to anguish fairest do thou yet delay brightest beauty come away list not when the froward chide sons of pedantry and pride snarlers to whose feeble sense april sunshine is offense age and envy will advise even against the joy they prize come in pleasures balmy bowl slake the thirstings of thy soul till thy raptured powers are fainting with enjoyment past the painting fairest do thou yet delay brightest beauty come away so sung the sirens as of yore upon the false ausonian shore and o for that preventing chain that bound ulysses on the main that so our fair one might withstand the covert ruin now at hand the song her charmed attention drew when now the tempters stood in view curiosity with prying eyes and hands of busy bold emprise like hermes feathered were her feet and like forerunning fancy fleet by search untaught by toil untird to novelty she still aspired tasteless of every good possessed and but in expectation blessed with her associate pleasure came gay pleasure frolickloving dame her mien all swimming in delight her beauties half revealed to sight loose flowed her garments from the ground and caught the kissing winds around as erst medusas looks were known to turn beholders into stone a dire reversion here they felt and in the eye of pleasure melt her glance with sweet persuasion charmed unnervd the strong the steeled disarmed no safety even the flying find who venurous look but once behind thus was the muchadmiring maid while distant more than half betrayed with smiles and adulation bland they joined her side and seized her hand their touch envenomed sweets instilled her frame with new pulsations thrilled while half consenting half denying reluctant now and now complying amidst a war of hopes and fears of trembling wishes smiling tears still down and down the winning pair compelled the struggling yielding fair as when some stately vessel bound to blessed arabias distant ground borne from her courses happily lights where barcas flowery clime invites concealed around whose treacherous land lurk the dire rock and dangerous sand the pilot warns with sail and oar to shun the much suspected shore in vain the tide too subtly strong still bears the wrestling bark along till soundring she resigns to fate and sinks overwhelmed with all her freight so baffling every bar to sin and heavens own pilot placed within along the devious smooth descent with powers increasing as they went the dames accustomed to subdue as with a rapid current drew and over the fatal bounds conveyed the lost the longreluctant maid here stop ye fair ones and beware nor send your fond affections there yet yet your darling now deplored may turn to you and heaven restored till then with weeping honor wait the servant of her better fate with honor left upon the shore her friend and handmaid now no more nor with the guilty world upbraid the fortunes of a wretch betrayed but over her failing cast the veil remembring you yourselves are frail and now from allinquiring light fast fled the conscious shades of night the damsel from a short repose confounded at her plight arose as when with slumbrous weight oppressed some wealthy miser sinks to rest where felons eye the glittering prey and steal his hoard of joys away he borne where golden indus streams of pearl and quarryd diamond dreams like midas turns the glebe to oar and stands all wrapped amidst his store but wakens naked and despoiled of that for which his years had toiled so fared the nymph her treasure flown and turned like niobe to stone within without obscure and void she felt all ravaged all destroyed and o thou cursed insidious coast are these the blessings thou can boast these virtue these the joys they find who leave thy heavntopt hills behind shade me ye pines ye caverns hide ye mountains cover me she cried her trumpet slander raised on high and told the tidings to the sky contempt discharged a living dart a sidelong viper to her heart reproach breathed poisons over her face and soiled and blasted every grace officious shame her handmaid new still turned the mirror to her view while those in crimes the deepest died approached to whiten at her side and every lewd insulting dame upon her folly rose to fame what should she do attempt once more to gain the latedeserted shore so trusting back the mourner flew as fast the train of fiends pursue again the farther shores attained again the land of virtue gained but echo gathers in the wind and shows her instant foes behind amazed with headlong speed she tends where late she left a host of friends alas those shrinking friends decline nor longer own that form divine with fear they mark the following cry and from the lonely trembler fly or backward drive her on the coast where peace was wrecked and honor lost from earth thus hoping aid in vain to heaven not daring to complain no truce by hostile clamor given and from the face of friendship driven the nymph sunk prostrate on the ground with all her weight of woes around enthroned within a circling sky upon a mount over mountains high all radiant sat as in a shrine virtue first effluence divine far far above the scenes of woe that shut this cloudwrapt world below superior goddess essence bright beauty of uncreated light whom should mortality survey as doomed upon a certain day the breath of frailty must expire the world dissolve in living fire the gems of heaven and solar flame be quenched by her eternal beam and nature quickening in her eye to rise a newborn phoenix die hence unreveald to mortal view a veil around her form she threw which three sad sisters of the shade pain care and melancholy made through this her allinquiring eye attentive from her station high beheld abandoned to despair the ruins of her favorite fair and with a voice whose awful sound appalled the guilty world around bid the tumultuous winds be still to numbers bowed each listening hill uncurld the surging of the main and smoothed the thorny bed of pain the golden harp of heaven she strung and thus the tuneful goddess sung lovely penitent arise come and claim thy kindred skies come thy sister angels say thou have wept thy stains away let experience now decide twixt the good and evil tried in the smooth enchanted ground say unfold the treasures found structures raised by morning dreams sands that trip the flitting streams down that anchors on the air clouds that paint their changes there seas that smoothly dimpling lie while the storm impends on high showing in an obvious glass joys that in possession pass transient fickle light and gay flattering only to betray what alas can life contain life like all its circles vain will the stork intending rest on the billow build her nest will the be demand his store from the bleak and bladeless shore man alone intent to stray ever turns from wisdoms way lays up wealth in foreign land sows the sea and ploughs the sand soon this elemental mass soon the incumbring world shall pass form be wrapped in wasting fire time be spent and life expire then ye boasted works of men where is your asylum then sons of pleasure sons of care tell me mortals tell me where gone like traces on the deep like a scepter grasped in sleep dews exhaled from morning glades melting snows and gliding shades pass the world and what s behind virtue s gold by fire

no more thou have plenteous crops in store seed by genial sorrows sown more than all thy scorners own what though hostile earth despise heaven beholds with gentler eyes heaven thy friendless steps shall guide cheer thy hours and guard thy side when the fatal trump shall sound when the immortals pour around heaven shall thy return attest hailed by myriads of the blessed little native of the skies lovely penitent arise calm thy bosom clear thy brow virtue is thy sister now more delightful are my woes than the rapture pleasure knows richer far the weeds i bring than the robes that grace a king on my wars of shortest date crowns of endless triumphs wait on my cares a period blessed on my toils eternal rest come with virtue at thy side come be every bar desyd till we gain our native

rose the milkmaid carolld at her pail and shepherds whistled over the dale when love who led a rural life remote from bustle state and strife forth from his thatchdroof cottage strayed and strolld along the dewy glade a nymph who lightly trippd it by to quick attention turned his eye he marked the gesture of the fair her selfsufficient grace and air her steps that mincing meant to please her studied negligence and ease and curious to inquire what meant this thing of prettiness and paint approaching spoke and bowed observant the lady slightly sir your servant such beauty in so rude a place

white has stood for imitation high to every heart and every eye from ancient deeds of fair renown has brought her bright memorials down to time affixed perpetual youth and formed each tale of love and

a cavil what new utopia do you travel upon my word these highflown fancies show depth of learning  in romances why what unfashiond stuff you tell us of buckram dames and tiptoe fellows go child and when you re grown maturer you ll shoot your next opinion surer o such a pretty knack at painting and all for softening and for sainting guess now who can a single feature through the whole piece of female nature then mark my looser hand may fit the lines too coarse for love to hit it is said that woman prone to changing through all the rounds of folly ranging on lifes uncertain ocean riding no reason rule nor rudder guiding is like the comets wandering light eccentrick ominous and bright trackless and shifting as the wind a sea whose fathom none can find a moon still changing and revolving a riddle past all human solving a bliss a plague a heaven a hell a  something which no man can tell now learn a secret from a friend but keep your counsel and attend though in their tempers thought so distant nor with their sex nor selves consistent it is but the difference of a name and every woman is the same for as the world however varied and through unnumberd changes carried of elemental modes and forms clouds meteors colors calms and storms though in a thousand suits arrayed is of one subject matter made so sir a womans constitution the worlds enigma finds solution and let her form be what you will i am the subject essence still with the first spark of female sense the speck of being i commence within the womb make fresh advances and dictate future qualms and fancies thence in the growing form expand with childhood travel hand in hand and give a taste to all their joys in gewgaws rattles pomp and noise and now familiar and unawed i send the fluttering soul abroad praised for her shape her face her mien the little goddess and the queen takes at her infant shrine oblation and drinks sweet draughts of adulation now blooming tall erect and fair to dress becomes her darling care the realms of beauty then i bound i swell the hoops enchanted round shrink in the waists descending size heaved in the snowy bosom rise high on the floating lappit sail or curled in tresses kiss the gale then to her glass i lead the fair and show the lovely idol there where struck as by divine emotion she bows with most sincere devotion and numbring every beauty over in secret bids the world adore then all for parking and parading coquetting dancing masquerading for balls plays courts and crowds what passion and churches sometimes  if the fashion for womans sense of right and wrong is ruled by the almighty throng still turns to each meander tame and swims the straw of every stream her soul intrinsic worth rejects accomplished only in defects such excellence is her ambition folly her wisest acquisition and even from pity and disdain she ll cull some reason to be vain thus sir from every form and feature the wealth and wants of female nature and even from vice which you d admire i gather fuel to my fire and on the very base of shame erect my monument of fame let me another truth attempt of which your godship has not dreamt those shining virtues which you muster whence think you they derive their luster from native honor and devotion o yes a mighty likely notion trust me from titled dames to spinners it is i make saints whoever make sinners it is i instruct them to withdraw and hold presumptuous man in awe for female worth as i inspire in just degrees still mounts the higher and virtue so extremely nice demands long toil and mighty price like samsons pillars fixed elate i bear the fexs tottering state sap these and in a moments space down sinks the fabric to its base alike from titles and from toys i spring the fount of female joys in every widow wife and miss the sole artificer of bliss for them each tropic i explore i cleave the sand of every shore to them uniting indias sail sabaea breathes her farthest gale for them the bullion i refine dig sense and virtue from the mine and from the bowels of invention spin out the various arts you mention nor bliss alone my powers bestow they hold the sovereign balm of woe beyond the stoicks boasted art i footh the heavings of the heart to pain give splendor and relief and gild the pallid face of grief alike the palace and the plain admit the glories of my reign through every age in every nation taste talents tempers state and station whatever a woman says i say whatever a woman spends i pay alike i fill and empty bags flutter in finery and rags with light coquettes through folly range and with the prude disdain to change and now you d think twixt you and i that things were ripe for a reply  but soft and while i m in the mood kindly permit me to conclude their utmost mazes to unravel and touch the farthest step they travel when every pleasure s run aground and folly tired through many a round the nymph conceiving discontent hence may ripen to an hours repentance and vapors shed in pious moisture dismiss her to a church or cloister then on i lead her with devotion conspicuous in her dress and motion inspire the heavenly breathing air roll up the lucid eye in prayer soften the voice and in the face look melting harmony and grace thus far extends my friendly power nor quits her in her latest hour the couch of decent pain i spread in form recline her languid head her thoughts i methodise in death and part not with her parting breath then do i set in order bright a length of funeral pomp to sight the glittering tapers and attire the plumes that whiten over her bier and last presenting to her eye angelick fineries on high to scenes of painted bliss i waft her and form the heaven she hopes hereaster in truth rejoined loves gentle god you ave gone a tedious length of road and strange in all the toilsome way no house of kind refreshment lay no nymph whose virtues might have tempted to hold her from her sex exempted for one we ll never quarrel man take her and keep her if you can and pleased i yield to your petition since every fair by such permission will hold herself the one selected and so my system stands protected o deaf to virtue deaf to glory to truths divinely vouched in story the godhead in his zeal returned and kindling at her malice burned then sweetly raised his voice and told of heavenly nymphs revered of old hypsipile who saved her sire and

the wheel but who can hope to plant conviction where cavil grows on contradiction some she evades or disavows demurs to all and none allows a kind of ancient things called fables and thus the goddess turned the tables now both in argument grew high and choler flashed from either eye nor wonder each refused to yield the conquest of so fair a field when happily arrived in view a goddess whom our grandams knew of aspect grave and sober gait majestic awful and sedate as heavens autumnal eve serene when not a cloud oercasts the scene once prudence called a matron famed and in old rome cornelia named quick at a venture both agree to leave their strife to her decree and now by each the facts were stated in form and manner as related the case was short they craved opinion which held over females chief dominion when thus the goddess answring mild first shook her gracious head and smiled alas how willing to comply yet how unfit a judge am i in times of golden date it is true i shared the fickle sex with you but from their presence long precluded or held as one whose form intruded full fifty annual suns can tell prudence has bid the sex farewell in this dilemma what to do or who to think of neither knew for both still biased in opinion and arrogant of sole dominion were forced to hold the case compounded or leave the quarrel where they found it when in the nick a rural fair of inexperiencd gait and air who never had crossed the neighboring lake nor seen the world beyond a wake with cambrick coif and kerchief clean tript lightly by them over the green now now cried loves triumphant child and at approaching conquest smiled if vanity will once be guided our difference may be soon decided behold yon wench a fit occasion to try your force of gay persuasion go you while i retire aloof go put those boasted powers to proof and if your prevalence of art transcends my yet unerring dart i give the favorite contest over and never will boast my empire more at once so said and so consented and well our goddess seemed contented nor pausing made a moments stand but tript and took the girl in hand meanwhile the godhead unalarmd as one to each occasion armed forth from his quiver culled a dart that erst had wounded many a heart then bending drew it to the head the bowstring twangd the arrow fled and to her secret soul addressed transfixed the whiteness of her breast but here the dame whose guardian care had to a moment watched the fair at once her pocket mirror drew and held the wonder full in view as quickly ranged in order bright a thousand beauties rush to sight a

unvisited by ranby miscellanies the trial of selim the persian for diverse high crimes and misdemeanors the court was met the prisoner brought the council with instructions fraught and evidence prepared at large on oath to vindicate the charge but first it is meet where form denies poetic helps of fancied lies gay metaphors and figures fine and similies to deck the line it is meet as we before have said to call description to our aid begin we then as first it is fitting with the three chiefs in judgment sitting above the rest and in the chair sat faction with dissembled air her tongue was skilled in specious lies and murmurs whence dissensions rise a smiling mask her features veiled her form the patriots robe concealed with studied blandishments she bowed and drew the captivated crowd the next in place and on the right sat envy hideous to the sight her snaky locks her hollow eyes and haggard form forbad disguise pale discontent and sullen hate upon her wrinkled forehead sat her left hand clenchd her cheek sustained her right with many a murder stained a dagger clutchd in act to strike with starts of rage and aim oblique last on the left was clamor seen of stature vast and horrid mien with bloated cheeks and frantic eyes she sent her yellings to the skies prepared with trumpet in her hand to blow sedition over the land with these four more of lesser fame and humbler rank attendant came hypocrisy with smiling grace and impudence with brazen face contention bold with iron lungs and slander with her hundred tongues the walls in sculptured tale were rich and statues proud in many a nich of chiefs who fought in factions cause and perished for contempt of laws the roof in varied light and shade the seat of anarchy displayed triumphant over a falling throne by emblematick figures known confusion raged and lust obscene and riot with distempered mien and outrage bold and mischief dire and devastation clad in fire prone on the ground a martial maid expiring lay and groaned for aid her shield with many a stab was pierced her laurels torn her spear reversed and near her crouchd amidst the spoils a lion panted in the toils with look composed the prisoner stood and modest pride by turns he viewed the court the council and the crowd and with submissive reverence bowed proceed we now in humbler strains and lighter rhymes with what remains the indictment grievously set forth that selim lost to patriot worth in company with one will p  tt and many more not taken yet in fortyfive the royal palace did enter and to shame grown callous did then and there his faith forsake and did accept receive and take with mischievous intent and base value unknown a certain place he was a second time indicted for that by evil zeal excited with learning more than laymans share which parsons want and he might spare in letter to one gilbert west he the said selim did attest maintain support and make assertion of certain points from pauls conversion by means whereof the said apostle did many an unbeliever jostle starting unfashionable fancies and building truths on known romances a third charge ran that knowing well wits only eat as pamphlets sell he the said selim notwithstanding did fall to answring shaming branding three curious letters to the whigs making no reader care three figs for any facts contained therein by which uncharitable sin an author modest and deserving was destined to contempt and starving against the king his crown and peace and all the statutes in that case the pleader rose with brief full charged and on the prisners crimes enlarged  but not to damp the muses fire with rhetrick such as courts require well try to keep the reader warm and sift the matter from the form virtue and social love he said and honor from the land were fled that patriots now like other folks were made the butt of vulgar jokes while opposition dropped her crest and courted power for wealth and rest why some folks laughed and some folks railed why some submitted some assailed angry or pleased  all solved the doubt with who were in and who were out the sons of clamor grew so sickly they looked for dissolution quickly their weekly journals finely written were sunk in privies all besh  n old england and the london evening hardly a soul was found believing in and caleb once so bold and strong was stupid now and always wrong ask ye whence rose this soul disgrace why selim has received a place and thereby brought the cause to shame proving that people void of blame might serve their country and their king by making both the selfsame thing by which the credulous believed and others by strange arts deceived that ministers were sometimes right and meant not to destroy us quite that bartring thus in state affairs he next must deal in sacred wares the clergys rights divine invade and smuggle in the gospel trade and all this zeal to reinstate exploded notions out of date sending old rakes to church in shoals like children snivling for their souls and ladies gay from smut and libels to learn beliefs and read their bibles erecting conscience for a tutor to damn the present by the future as if to evils known and real twas needful to annex ideal when all of human life we know is care and bitterness and woe with short transitions of delight to set the shattered spirits right then why such mighty pains and care to make us humbler than we are forbidding shortlivd mirth and laughter by fears of what may come hereafter better in ignorance to dwell none fear but who believe a hell and if there should be one no doubt men of themselves would find it out but selims crimes he said went further and barely stopped on this side murder one yet remained to close the charge to which with leave he would speak at large and first t was needful to premise that though so long for reasons wise the press inviolate had stood productive of the public good yet still too modest to abuse it railed at vice but told not whose that great improvements of late days were made to many an authors praise who not so scrupulously nice proclaimed the person with the vice or gave where vices might be wanted the name and took the rest for granted upon this plan a champion author of the letters to the whigs rose unrighteous greatness to oppose proving the man inventus non est who trades in power and still is honest and god be praised he did it roundly flogging a certain junto soundly but chief his anger was directed where people least of all suspected and selim not so strong as tall beneath his grasp appeared to fall but innocence as people say stood by and saved him in the fray by her assisted and one truth a busy prating forward youth he rallied all his strength anew and at the foe a letter threw his weakest part the weapon found and brought him senseless to the ground hence opposition fled the field and ignorance with her sevnfold shield and well they might for things weighed fully the prisoner with his whore and bully must prove for every foe too hard who never fought with such a guard but truth and innocence he said would stand him here in little stead for they had evidence on oath that would appear too hard for both of witnesses a fearful train came next the indictments to sustain detraction hatred and distrust and party of all foes the worst malice revenge and unbelief and disappointment worn with grief dishonor foul unawed by shame and every fiend that vice can name all these in ample form deposed each fact the triple charge disclosed with taunts and gibes of bitter sort and asking vengeance from the court the prisoner said in his defense that he indeed had small pretense to soften facts so deeply sworn but would for his offenses mourn yet more he hoped than bare repentance might still be urged to ward the sentence that he had held a place some years he owned with penitence and tears but took it not from motives base the indictment there mistook the case and though he had betrayed his trust in being to his country just neglecting faction and her friends he did it not for wicked ends but that complaints and feuds might cease and jarring parties mix in peace that what he wrote to gilbert west bore hard against him he confessed yet there they wronged him for the fact is he reasoned for belief not practice and people might believe he thought though practice might be deemed a fault he either dreamed it or was told religion was revered of old that it gave breeding no offense and was no foe to wit and sense but whether this was truth or whim he would not say the doubt with him and no great harm he hoped was how the enlightened world would take it now if they admitted it twas well if not he never talked of hell nor even hoped to change mens measnres or frighten ladies from their pleasures one accusation he confessed had touched him more than all the rest three patriot letters high in same by him overthrown and brought to shame and though it was a rule in vogue if one man called another rogue the party injured might reply and on his so retort the lie yet what accrud from all his labor but foul dishonor to his neighbor and he s a most unchristian elf who others damns to save himself besides as all men knew he said those letters only railed for bread and hunger was a known excuse for prostitution and abuse a guinea properly applied had made the writer change his side he wished he had not cut and carved him and owned he should have bought not starved him the court he said knew all the rest and must proceed as they thought best only he hoped such resignation would plead some little mitigation and if his character was clear from other faults and friends were near who would when called upon attest it he did in humblest form request it to be from punishment exempt and only suffer their contempt the prisners friends their claim preferred in turn demanding to be heard integrity and honor swore benevolence and twenty more that he was always of their party and that they knew him firm and hearty religion sober dame attended and as she could his cause befriended she said t was since he came from college she knew him introduced by knowledge the man was modest and sincere nor farther could she interfere the muses begged to interpose but envy with loud hissings rose and called them women of ill fame liars and prostitutes to shame and said to all the world t was known selim had had them every one the prisoner blushed the muses frowned when silence was proclaimed around and faction rising with the rest in form the prisoner thus addressed you selim thrice have been indicted first that by wicked pride excited and bent your country to disgrace you have received and held a place next infidelity to wound you ave dared with arguments profound to drive freethinking to a stand and with religion vex the land and lastly in contempt of right with horrid and unnatral spite you have an authors fame overthrown thereby to build and fence your own these crimes successive on your trial have met with proofs beyond denial to which yourself with shame conceded and but in mitigation pleaded yet that the justice of the court may suffer not in mens report judgment a moment i suspend to reason as from friend to friend and first that you of all mankind with kings and courts should stain your mind you who were oppositions lord her nerves her sinews and her sword that you at last for servile ends should wound the bowels of her friends  is aggravation of offense that leaves for mercy no pretense yet more  for you to urge your hate and back the church to aid the state for you to publish such a letter you who have known religion better for you i say to introduce the fraud again  there s no excuse and last of all to crown your shame was it for you to load with blame the writings of a patriot youth and summon innocence and truth to prop your cause  was this for you  but justice does your crimes pursue and sentence now alone remains which thus by me the court ordains that you return from whence you came there to be stripped of all your fame by vulgar hands that once a week old england pinch you till you squeak that ribald pamphlets do pursue you and lies and murmurs to undo you with every foe that worth procures and only virtues friends be yours the trial of sarah  alias slim sal for privately stealing the prisoner was at large indicted for that by thirst of gain excited one day in july last at tea and in the house of mrs p from the left breast of e m gent with base felonious intent did then and there a heart with strings rest quiet peace and other things steal rob and plunder and all them the chattels of the said e m the prosecutor swore last may the month he knew but not the day he left his friends in town and went upon a visit down in kent that staying there a month or two he spent his time as others do in riding walking fishing swimming but being much inclined to women and young and wild and no great reasner he got acquainted with the prisoner he owned t was rumored in those parts that she d a trick of stealing hearts and from fifteen to twentytwo had made the devilandall to do but mr w the vicar and no man brews you better liquor spoke of her thefts as tricks of youth the frolicks of a girl forsooth things now were on another score he said for she was twentyfour however to make matters short and not to trespass on the court the lady was discovered soon and thus it was one afternoon the ninth of july last or near it as to the day he could not swear it in company at mrs ps where folks say any thing they please dean l and lady mary by and fanny waiting on miss y he owned he was inclined to think both were a little in their drink the prisoner asked and called him cousin how many kisses made a dozen that being as he owned in liquor the question made his blood run quicker and sense and reason in eclipse he vowed he d score them on her lips that rising up to keep his word he got as far as kiss the third and would have counted the other nine and so all present did opine but that he felt a sudden dizziness that quite undid him for the business his speech he said began to falter his eyes to stare his mouth to water his breast to thump without cessation and all within one conflagration bless me says fanny what s the matter and lady mary looked hard at her and stamped and wished the prisoner further and cried out part them or there s murder that still he held the prisoner fast and would have stood it to the last but struggling to go through the rest he felt a pain across his breast a sort of sudden twinge he said that seemed almost to strike him dead and after that such cruel smarting he thought the soul and body parting that then he let the prisoner go and staggered off a step or so and thinking that his heart was ill he begged of miss y s maid to feel that fanny stepped before the rest and laid her hand upon his breast but mercy on us what a stare the creature gave no heart was there souse went her fingers in the hole whence heart and strings and all were stole that fanny turned and told the prisoner she was a thief and so she d christen her and that it was a burning shame and brought the house an evil name and if she did not put the heart in the man would pine and die for certain the prisoner then was in her airs and bid her mind her own affairs and told his reverence and the rest of em she was as honest as the best of em that lady mary and dean l rose up and said t was mighty well but that in general terms they said it a heart was gone and some one had it words would not do for search they must and search they would and her the first that then the prisoner dropped her anger and said she hoped they would not hang her that all she did was meant in jest and there the heart was and the rest that then the dean cried out o fie and sent in haste for justice i who though he knew her friends and pitied her called her hard names and so committed her the parties present swore the same and fanny said the prisners name had frightened all the country round and glad she was the bill was found she knew a man who knew another who knew the very partys brother who lost his heart by mere surprise one morning looking at her eyes and others had been known to squeak who only chanced to hear her speak for she had words of such a sort that though she knew no reason for t would make a man of sense run mad and rifle him of all he had and that she d rob the whole community if ever she had opportunity the prisoner now first silence broke and curtsyd round her as she spoke she owned she said it much incensed her to hear such matters sworn against her but that she hoped to keep her temper and prove herself eadem semper that what the prosecutor swore was some part true and some part more she owned she had been often seen with him and laughed and chatted on the green with him the fellow seemed to have humanity and told her tales that soothed her vanity pretending that he loved her vastly and that all women else looked ghastly but then she hoped the court would think she never was inclined to drink or suffer hands like his to daub her or encourage men to kiss and slobber her she d have folks know she did not love it or if she did she was above it but this she said was sworn of course to prove her giddy and then worse as she whose conduct was thought levis might very well be reckoned thievish she hoped she said the courts discerning would pay some honor to her learning for every day from four to past six she went up stairs and read the classicks thus having cleared herself of levity the rest she said would come with brevity and first it injured not her honor to own the heart was found upon her for she could prove and did aver the paltry thing belonged to her the fact was thus this prince of knaves was once the humblest of her slaves and often had confessed the dart her eyes had lodged within his heart that she as t was her constant fashion made great diversion of his passion which set his blood in such a ferment as seemed to threaten his interment that then she was afraid of losing him and so desisted from abusing him and often came and felt his pulse and bid him write to doctor hulse the prosecutor thanked her kindly and sighed and said she looked divinely but told her that his heart was bursting and doctors he had little trust in he therefore begged her to accept it and hoped t would mend if once she kept it that having no aversion to it she said with all her soul she d do it but then she begged him to remember if he should need it in december for winter months would make folks shiver who wanted either heart or liver it never could return and added twas here is for life if once she had it the prosecutor said amen and that he wished it not again and took it from his breast and gave her and howd and thanked her for the favor but begged the thing might not be spoke of as heartless men were made a joke of that next day whispering him about it and asking how he felt without it he sighed and cried alack alack and begged and prayed to have it back or that she d give him here is instead on t but she conceived there was no need on t and said and bid him make no pother he should have neither one nor the other that then he raved and stormed like fury and said that one was his de jure and rather than he d leave pursuing her he d swear a robbery and ruin her that this was truth she did aver whatever hap betided her only that mrs p she said miss y and her deluded maid and lady mary and his reverence were folks to whom she paid some deference and that she verily believed they were not perjured but deceived then doctor d begged leave to speak and sighed as if his heart would break he said that he was madams surgeon or rather as in greek surgeon from chier manus ergon opus as scope is from the latin scopus that he he said had known the prisoner from the first sun that ever rise on her and grieved he was to see her there but took upon himself to swear there was not to be found in nature a sweeter or a better creature and if the king god bless him knew her he d leave st jamess to get to her but then as to the fact in question he knew no more on t than hephaestion it might he false and might be true and this he said was all he knew the judge proceeded to the charge and gave the evidence at large but often cast a sheeps eye at her and strove to mitigate the matter pretending facts were not so clear and mercy ought to interfere the jury then withdrew a moment as if on weighty points to comment and right or wrong resolved to save her they gave a verdict in her favor but why or wherefore things were so it matters not for us to know the culprit by escape grown bold pilfers alike from young and old the country all around her teases and robs or murders whom she pleases envy and fortune a tale to mrs garrick says envy to fortune soft soft madam flirt not so fast with your wheel you ll be down in the dirt well and how does your david indeed my dear creature you ave shown him a wonderful deal of good nature his bags are so full and such praises his due that the like was never known  and allowing to you but why will not you make him quite happy for life and to all you have done add the gift of a wife says fortune and smiled madam envy god save ye but why always sneering at me and poor davy i own that sometimes in contempt of all rules i lavish my favors on blockheads and sools but the case is quite different here i aver it for david never knew me till brought me by merit and yet to convince you  nay madam no hisses  good manners at least  such behavior as this is  for mention but merit and envy flies out with a hiss and a yell that would silence a rout but fortune went on  to convince you i say that i honor your scheme i ll about it today the man shall be married so pray now be easy and garrick for once shall do something to please ye so saying she rattled her wheel out of sight while envy walked after and grinnd with delight it seems it was a trick that she long had been brewing to marry poor david and so be his ruin for slander had told her the creature loved pelf and cared not a fig for a soul but himself from thence she was sure had the devil a daughter he would snap at the girl so it was fortune that brought her and then should her temper be sullen or haughty her flesh too be frail and incline to be naughty twould fret the poor fellow so out of his reason that barry and quin would set fashions next season but fortune who saw what the fury designed resolved to get david a wife to his mind yet afraid of herself in a matter so nice she visited prudence and begged her advice the nymph shook her head when the business she knew and said that her female acquaintance were few that excepting miss r  o yes there was one a friend of that ladys she visited none but the first was too great and the last was too good and as for the rest she might get whom she could away hurried fortune perplexed and half mad but her promise was passed and a wife must be had she traversed the town from one corner to the other now knocking at one door and then at another the girls curtsyd low as she looked in their faces and bridled and primmd with abundance of graces but this was conquettish and that was a prude one stupid and dull the other noisy and rude a third was affected quite careless a fourth with prate without meaning and pride without worth a fifth and a sixth and a seventh were such as either knew nothing or something too much  in short as they passed she to all had objections the gay wanted thought the goodhumored affections the prudent were ugly the sensible dirty and all of them flirts from fifteen up to thirty when fortune saw this she began to look silly yet still she went on till she reached piccadilly but vexed and fatigued and the night growing late she rested her wheel within burlington gate my lady rose up as she saw her come in o ho madam genius pray where have you been for her ladyship thought from so serious an air twas genius come home for it seems she lived there but fortune not minding her ladyships blunder and wiping her forehead cried well may you wonder to see me thus flurryd  then told her the case lady and sighed till her ladyship laughed in her face mighty civil indeed  come a truce says my a truce with complaints and perhaps i may aid ye i will show you a girl that  here martin go tell  but she is gone to undress by and by is as well  i ll show you a sight that you ll fancy uncommon wit beauty and goodness all met in a woman a heart to no folly or mischief inclined a body all grace and all sweetness a mind o pray let me see her says fortune and smiled do but give her to me and i ll make her my child but who my dear who  for you have not told yet  who indeed says my lady if not violette the words were scarce spoke when she entered the room a blush at the stranger still heightened her bloom so humble her looks were so mild was her air that fortune astonished sat mute in her chair my lady rose up and with countenance bland this is fortune my dear and presented her hand the goddess embraced her and called her her own and compliments over her errand made known but how the sweet girl colored fluttered and trembled how often she said no and how ill she dissembled or how little david rejoiced at the news and swore from all others it was her he would choose what methods he tried and what arts to prevail all these were they told would but burden my tale  in short all affairs were so happily carried that hardly six weeks passed away till they married but envy grew sick when the story she heard violette was the girl that of all she most feared she knew her good humor her beauty and sweetness her ease and compliance her taste and her neatness from these she was sure that her man could not roam and must rise on the stage from contentment at home so on she went hissing and inwardly cursed her and garrick next season will certainly burst her to the right hon henry pelham the humble petition of the worshipful company of poets and newswriters shows that your honors petitioners dealers in rhymes and writers of scandal for mending the times by losses in business and englands well doing are sunk in their credit and verging on ruin that these their misfortunes they humbly conceive arise not from dullness as some folks believe but from rubs in their way which your honor has laid and want of materials to carry on trade that they always had formed high conceits of their use and meant their last breath should go out in abuse but now and they speak it with sorrow and tears since your honor has sat at the helm of affairs no party will join them no faction invite to heed what they say or to read what they write sedition and tumult and discord are fled and slander scarce ventures to lift up her head  in short public

among the ruins of a noblemans seat in cornwall amidst these venerable drear remains of ancient grandeur musing sad i stray around a melancholy silence reigns that prompts me to indulge the plaintive lay here lived eugenio born of noble race aloft his mansion rose around were seen extensive gardens decked with every grace ponds walks and groves through all the seasons green ah where is now its boasted beauty fled proud turrets that once glittered in the sky and broken columns in confusion spread a rude misshapen heap of ruins lie of splendid rooms no traces here are found how are these tottering walls by time defaced shaggd with vile thorn with twining ivy bound once hung with tapestry with paintings graced in ancient times perhaps where now i tread licentious riot crowned the midnight bowl her dainties luxury poured and beauty spread her artful snares to captivate the soul or here attended by a chosen train of innocent delight true grandeur dwelt diffusing blessings over the distant plain health joy and happiness by thousands felt around now solitude unjoyous reigns no gay gilt chariot hither marks the way no more with cheerful hopes the needy swains at the once bounteous gate their visits pay where too is now the gardens beauty fled which every clime was ransacked to supply over the drear spot see desolation spread and the dismantled walls in ruins lie dead are the trees that once with nicest care arrangd from opening blossoms shed perfume and thick with fruitage stood the pendent pear the ruddy colored peach and glossy plum extinct is all the family of flowers in vain i seek the arbours cool retreat where ancient friends in converse passed the hours defended from the raging dogstars heat along the terrace walks are straggling seen the prickly bramble and the noisome weed beneath whose covert crawls the toad obscene and snakes and adders unmolested breed the groves where pleasure walked her rounds decay the mead untilled a barren aspect wears and where the sprightly fawn was wont to play oergrown with heath a dreary waste appears in yonder wideextended vale below where osiers spread a pond capacious stood from far by art the stream was taught to flow whose liquid stores supplied the unfailing flood often here the silent angler took his place intent to captivate the scaly fry  but perished now are all the numerous race dumb is the fountain and the channel dry here then ye great behold the uncertain state of earthly grandeur  beauty strength and power alike are subject to the stroke of fate and flourish but the glory of an hour virtue alone no dissolution fears still permanent though ages roll away who builds on her immortal basis rears a superstructure time can never decay songs song i i thus i said to my heart in a pet the other day i had rather be hanged than go moping this way no throbbings no wishes your moments employ but you sleep in my breast without motion or joy ii when cloe perplexed me t was sweeter by half and at thaiss wiles i could oftentimes laugh your burnings and akings i strove not to cure though one was a jilt and the other a whore iii when i walked up the mall or strolld throthe street not a petticoat brushed me but then you could beat or if bang went the hoop against corner or post in the magical round you were sure to be lost iv but now if a nymph goes as naked as eve like adam

more to engage tell me quickly the cause for it makes me quite mad in the summers gay season to see you so sad vi have a care quoth my heart how you tempt me to stray he that hunts down a woman must run a d  d way like a hare she can wind or hold out with the fox and secure in the chase her pursuers she mocks vii for cloe i burnt with an innocent flame and beat to the music that breathed out her

shadrach i lived in a furnace of fire but unlike him was scorched and compelled to retire ix recruited once more i forgot all my pain and was jilted and burnt and bedevild again not a petticoat fringed or the heel of a shoe ever passed you by daylight but at it i flew x thus jilted and wounded and burnt to a coal for rest i retreated again to be whole but your eyes ever open to lead me astray have beheld a new face and command me away xi but remember in whatever flames i may burn twill be solly to ask for or wish my return neither thais nor cloe again shall inflame but a nymph more provoking than all you can name xii this said with a bound from my bosom he flew o phillis these eyes saw him posting to you enslaved by your wit he grows fond of his chain and vows i shall never
