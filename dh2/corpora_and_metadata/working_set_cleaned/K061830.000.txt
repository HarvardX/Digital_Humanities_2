purpose of effecting an abolition of the slave trade this small tribute is most respectfully inscribed  by the editor  persons of the drama manzara prince of cassaena jerome governor of a province in america horatio martino planters pembroke a trader antonio supercargo in a vessel trading with slaves calaban commander of the vessel zangae freedman of jerome counselors of state slaves sailors and attendants jaqueena princess of zanfara who in captivity takes the name of laura teresa the governors lady amelia the governors daughter scene in america  the princess of zanfara act i the curtain drawing up discovers laura the female slave sitting by the side of a fountain in a grove adjoining to the governors palace laura ye warbling songsters of the vocal grove why waste you thus your soothing melody sweet bubbling fountains wherefore mix your voice with the soft murmurs of the sighing breeze were ye not given to charm the ear of peace the fair associate of liberty  these unpropitious regions claim you not haste to zanfara and the happy shades that crown her rivers banks and crowd her shores from whence you long too long have been estranged with your jaqueena whom alas such dark and dire mischance involves that hitherto her weak and wandering hope no period sees but in the arms of death   amelia enters  i seek my maid with anxious steps and still some solemn scene invites her melancholy stay and owns her tears shall not amelia partake your woes and with her love alleviate the griefs that rend dear lauras tender heart  laura if kind amelia was not made so fair if she was not of christian principles i might be led to trust her female heart possessed compassion but the frozen hue that nature plants upon her outward form and what prescribes the maxims of her breast make me at once to tremble and distrust and poor jaqueena lives without a friend  amelia my lauras sweet benevolence of heart and the intelligence that forms her mind should lift her far above such prejudice or fair or dusk the hue that climate gives the blood that warms the veins with streams of life in both the same with equal passion fires the soul with equal ardour in the sacred cause of honor beats and forms the heart for love  laura there is such soft delusion in your words and what we wish we readiest believe i almost am persuaded in my mind amelia holds a sister heart to mine but your stern deity still looks unmoved on massacre and blood on slavery and woe avenging not  alas i sink under the horror of his devotees  amelia the time will come my laura when you will know the wretches who commit such dreadful crimes are not of the religion you accuse  laura were they not christians that on nigers flood on board their dreadful bark received the lost jaqueena for the name of laura bears the badge of slavery and my reproach are they not christians who in all this land make the poor africans perform the task of beasts not barely to sustain the toil but to endure the torture and with stripes with nakedness and hunger to lie down stalld worse than beasts to rankle in their sores  amelia this is too much sweet laura thus with tears see me lament my countrys hapless crimes and the vile prejudice which clogs the wheel of partial justice   laura  can a slave then hope for your humanity  for though the blood is of one dye without congenial suns it ripens not nor meliorates to love yet will i not forget your bounteous gifts for africans know not ingratitude i am a slave not knowing bondage here but in detention from my native land for my kind mistress as amelia kind nor gives me chains nor stripes nor wears a frown there are some christians of a milder soul and such poor laura happily protect for if amelia calls me by that name its terrors cease though it still comprehends the tenor of my fortune   amelia  whilst your mind seems thus impressed with favorable thoughts and you confess amelias not severe trust to my ear the story of your life and make me more your friend by sorrowing more by mingling mutual griefs with lauras tears  laura a soothing melancholy still succeeds the repetition of each solemn tale misfortune has to tell  in silence grief preys most upon the soul from sympathy from soft compassion of our sorrowings a sweet alleviation gently breathes not of inferior race my father ruled a province of the realm of benin  often approbation shone upon his eye often fond affection filled my mothers looks whilst on their smiling progeny they gazed and called and kissed their daughter now your slave  amelia predicting in the fondness of their hopes propitious fortunes to their darling child  laura nor were their hopes mere shadows of the mind for with affections tenderest concern my steps were followed and my looks pursued they ruled anothers fate  with breasts of ice as barren as the snows they emulate you fair ones call such truths mere vanity the great manzaro kneeled to win my heart what wretchedness is mine  i loved the prince whom only death can to my love restore on his tremendous wing he will bear me hence and to zanfara waft this spirit safe superior to the frauds of cruel men  amelia some better jot sweet laura may betide  laura hope has departed hence and left my soul to follow after when all earthly griefs are dissipated by the hand of death it soothes the sorrows of my wretched mind to grave the rock with piteous characters points to the rock that move the fountains neverceasing tears to weep for ever over manzaras name whilst gentle spirits in the sighing winds on the sad sculptures mourn that memorize my mother and my brothers   amelia  what of them  laura within the forests skirts our tents were pitched for more commodious hunting far advanced the men were on the chase when we who held the little camp were taken prisoners a horrid tribe of robbers then in league with europeans trading to our states had stolen upon our unsuspicious guards  amelia of what complexion of what country born were those base violators of the land  laura the cruel leaders were of british birth the rest of africa but long possessed by the fell demons of europas shores they to recruit the heart for wickedness imbibe infernal furies in their drink from deepest hell by chymic magic raised that drive the brain to madness and impel the hand to deeds of darkness   amelia  what ensued  laura our men were bound in fetters neck to neck and hand to hand and we their woeful steps must needs pursue  when frantic with her grief my mother seized a javelin for revenge and by her angry arm one chieftain fell but anger and resistance were in vain she died beneath a thousand dreadful wounds whilst to her bleeding bosom grasping close in agonies of death her youngest son a cruel lance transfixed both breasts at once and as the boy hung writhing on the shaft the wretches made diversion of his pangs  amelia o britain where is thy boasted excellence thy fame that sounds on every peopled shore thy vaunted jurisprudence and thy love of liberty   laura  i then conceived no thought of what might follow what should be our fate but in immediate sorrows my sad mind was all absorbed  we were received on board a vessel crowded with a wretched race description finds no language to express the horrors of the voyage  the hand of fate released a multitude  within these arms my other brother died and i am forlorn  amelia my soul is full of grief and yet a ray of hope divine like some prophetic light by influence of guardian angel given takes hold upon my mind  but we are observed you must avoid the person that draws near retire and spare your grief the tale he brings would much increase your tears  ex laura  amelia alone  i feel my heart renounce antonio  his hateful trade imbitters every thought of intercourse habituated to subdue the force of his humanity what can remain within the breast of man that offers fruits for nuptial happiness   antonio enters  to meet you thus is most propitious to my anxious hopes my voyage performed with many healthy slaves i now return to claim your faithful vows and if the market proves of advanced price my fortunes made and you alone command my future life   amelia  i know not what it means some secret intimation moves my mind that no felicity can ever attend riches obtained by such inhuman ways  antonio are these untoward sentiments conceived from lauras guileful tears and whining tales can my amelia estrange her mind from reason and her proper judgment yield to errors which prevail alone through fraud  amelia there is more than fraud more than invention fills the story of that hapless virgins fate  antonio what inhumanity disturbs your thoughts the navigator is not culpable he takes the common traffic of the land and by his toil brings riches to the state the police of the nations there is such like other animals the herdsman sells the negro drove   amelia  i tremble at the thought they that promote the sin partake the crime  antonio inferior in creation though in form of human kind  each race of animals knows its gradations  and from perfect man the negro tribe is intermediate it links the series that straight descend into the monkey line   amelia  if you would save my mind from detestation treat not thus a subject over which my laboring soul endures acutest pangs if you would win my better sentiments this traffic leave the generous association join who labor in humanitys great cause with holy zeal to gain abolishment of your infernal merchandise   antonio my heart already yours your dictates must pursue  amelia it is well antonio and my confidence renews my lauras sorrows fill my mind i must procure the maid her liberty  antonio and when obtained what prospect will ensue where are the means of giving happiness you will only send her forth to meagre want and in a foreign land a vagabond expose her to a thousand miseries  amelia she must return to africa again her country and her friends   antonio  romantic thought the wandering tribe she left perhaps dispersed the government dissolved new tyrants reign and warfare the rough habit of their lives with checkered fortunes marks each petty prince now reigning now in chains  on africs coast to greater perils greater woes exposed there is not a slave that in this province toils but if returned would worship the dire name of slavery that makes them tremble now  amelia your arguments enlarge the dreadful bounds of that vast sin which on your traffic rests if restitution is impossible the base captivity that thus cuts off all human hope and no kind limit yields to the sad injury but in the tomb of all the crimes on earth becomes the worst my weary mind now finds no resting place  antonio even the servitude in which they sigh affords superior happiness and ease to what their birthright gave   amelia  desist desist i will hear no more  it is in the human mind the various estimates of happiness are ranged whilst free and voluntary will directs the choice  it is not luxury with all its artificial wants and woes that points out the criterion to mankind it is not circumstance prescribed and bound within the limits of necessity for that is a term mere fashion has assumed that points where happiness shall stay her foot it is habit that prepares the mind for ease and knowing no restraint contentment gives the various types that various nations hold whence to characterise the heavenly gift each calls felicity  the human soul finds liberty so innate through the world the love of it prevails  see pembroke comes humanitys fast friend   antonio  hypocrisys own son   pembroke enters  disgrace pursues disgrace america stands blighted in her fame how are the annals of her glory stained  amelia what new occasion wounds your gracious mind  pembroke still here we hold the mart of human kind new cargoes crowd our shores and on the beach the squalid multitudes are pouring forth from overloaded ships which like the curse of vile pandoras box bring forth disease with misery and pallid want crippled and maimed whose ulcerating sores cling to the cankered chains that rankle deep and seek the bone   antonio  exists there not a law which should restrain such mischiefworking tongues as hurt the merchants credit and his wares thy phrase is false the slaves are healthy young and vigorous   pembroke  then be it so  the world with anxious eye regarded every step that led the revolution to effect and made us independent  wondering states beheld our strength  our public virtue shone with a meridian luster that amazed the nations who submit to monarchy and heaven stood influenced propitious stood and looked approving on the energy that in the sacred cause of liberty in every prayer we breathed in every step maintained that brought fruition to our hopes  amelia how has our country forfeited its fame  pembroke in britain which we did calumniate with charge of tyranny and power usurped the flame humanitys most holy flame breaks forth illustrious all the people burn with sense of liberty they boasted not and the poor african the object grows of their wise councils and their sovreigns care whilst we who mocked god with impious prayer mocked the surrounding world with fallacy assumed a character we could not prove now severed  now aliend  and left alone pull off the mask and vote an impious law restraining liberty for twenty years  amelia  astonishing   antonio  firm sinews to bestow to trade  the strength of nations   pembroke  public faith alone supports a peoples strength  in fraud and treachery few momentary smiles of fortune fall but probity affords stability and honor to a state what is the idea to the laboring wretch that twenty toilsome years may terminate his grievous task  a space of sullen time that much exceeds their ordinary stage of life   antonio  the legislature wisely saw inevitable ruin must succeed if instantly we should emancipate and trust to hirelings  such excessive change in dire confusion would involve the land what mode of government could ever restrain the slaves discharged and set at liberty that mighty work must by progression move and into habit grow by slow degrees experience of clemency and laws that mutual safety yield must tame the savages ferocious habit first and fit him for subordinance   pembroke  this day the council sits  on their opinion hangs the fate of thousands  if yet adverse time his withered hand extends against the steps of liberty a stigma he implants which all his smiles for ages will not erase the issue i expect impatiently exit  antonio are you deceived amelia by such phrase whilst honesty with open countenance is rash perhaps and speaks too much of truth despising subtlety  for that mans god is avarice  he would suit the japanese and on the christians ensign trade and traffic  amelia your mind is heated and resentment prompts the character you draw   antonio  we soon may prove his public virtue when his interest is fairly recognized  for me i own the trade has much of bitterness and woe command me in your lauras interest but first provide her some establishment to bless and crown with liberty  end of the first act act ii scene a plantation and slaves at work the stage being extended sunry persons are seen performing the various labors of slaves the back scene continuing the representation calaban and horatio calaban this was a glorious voyage  the sturdy knaves are fit for any labor and we bring full fifteen hundred safely to the port  horatio what province are they of  for much depends upon the breed some of the upland slaves that border on the desert are of mind so dark and so indocile that they seem of one gradation only above brutes those of more eastern clime are indolent as bears are sluggish and not moved by stripes they will neither serve the mill nor till the ground  calaban well master mine are of the favorite breed twice ten degrees removed from the baboon their form is human and they are almost men boney and strong of countenance acute and as hyaenas savage  they are the slaves for labor as the mind is fierce and quick their bodies in proportion active are on mountains skirts and wilds of zara bred the topsmen drove the herd to nigers banks the mart of africa   horatio  five hundred males i purchase at your price but in the lot i will not receive that brute that stands aloof and looks as if he held high estimate of his own consequence a slave like him would soon create a mutiny and stir my whole plantation into plots and vile conspiracies   calaban  the creatures only mad through separation from his concubines so the fierce bull would bellow and rebound when from the pasture driven that holds his kine keep him but low in food and hard at work and all those fiery sparks his nature holds will in free perspiration dissipate  enter martino and pembroke pembroke do thou martino purchase any slaves here is the carcaseman   calaban  and thou the knave that would destroy thy country by thy wiles for if the council moved by such mens cries should pass the cursed emancipation vote the envious britons who could not subdue will triumph in the ruin treachery can soon effect by wretches such as thee pembroke to martino some caution should be held for much depends upon the cause now agitating   martino and not a little on the market too  calaban you purchase not and therefore shall not prate to hinder the fair trader in his sale  pembroke russian retire and know thy province here send forth thy factor for to him belongs this duty and for thee associate with fellows of thy proper element or to the magistrates i will make complaint  calaban thy phrase is mighty though thy figures meek  antonio enters martino the factor comes and after him a few by way of sample of the fittest slaves  antonio not so these only bring some stores on shore the rest refreshing on the beach will wait to morrows noon when they will be exposed  several slaves enter staggering under excessive burdens weak and emaciated with their voyage after them one who refuses any labor as he enters and looks upon the scene where the slaves are at work he starts moor ah horrid spectacle of misery and foul disgrace  are these thy wretched sons long suffering afric  these of thy race of mighty men whose hardy sinews draw the sounding bow and launch the javelin with mortal strength  who destitute of fear contend with hungry lions for their prey and grapple with the tiger in his rage are ye so tame   antonio  consider what is your lot and merit clemency   moor  can thou persuade the raging winds to soften to thy will and whistle in thine ear  or do thou know how to appease the deep atlantics voice when tempests howl on gambias aestuary if thou have magic in thee to do these then thou may smooth the temper of my soul  calaban bravo my gallant blade spoke like thyself  moor was this the land where that celestialdrug that cures a thousand evils of the mind was planted by the seraphs of the sun and by fair daughters of the silent moon watered with dew of heaven here i might find the godlike gift of liberty perhaps in its vicinity does justice grow of these i would mix a potion should disgorge the monsters of the deep   antonio  to merit such you must be peaceable and to the state obedient   moor  away  revile me not  compassionate my fortune not contemn my impotence  behold these shameful chains are they not peaceable are not these hands submissive  and this neck obedient this is not worthy thy more feeling heart yet to my strength what would these bonds avail if an exertion could improve my lot  pembroke thy moderation merits our esteem if ought of justice thou have here to claim our governor and council daily sit within the public hall dispensing there impartially   moor  i mark thee wondrous well and if the spirits of my ancestors have not forsaken me or lost their course over the wide desert of the dreary main perhaps the deity which we adore will not forget me in a foreign land for they retaining much of amity will whisper in his ear  the africans in chains  calaban he raves and with his fortune mad he knows not what he says   moor  too true alas mad with my injuries and scoffed at too as stubble to the lightning i could shake these links to atoms that my vengeful eyes might see thy hearts blood spout but that my views are larger and this friend to human kind has breathed into my soul a nobler hope and made me dream of justice   calaban  and thy dream will like the vision of the rolling cloud dissolve and only mock thy sickly brain return  and at the lodge where thou art stalld wait for tomorrows market   pembroke  if he craves a hearing for redress of injury i will protect the man and pledge his price  calaban do thou encourage mutiny   pembroke  no more than i do villains   antonio  this poor slave behaved with much discretion in the tedious voyage and seemed above his fortune save when sighs would sometimes heave his breast or tears would fall  moor antonio was compassionate  were i in africa i would not blush to say what my heart feels   calaban  do thou depart with me or in this newformd friendship shelter seek  moor i crave to stand before the governor and claim the benefit of those good laws that even comprehend a negros wrongs  calaban there is no law that can discharge a slave here slaves are property   pembroke  can you inform whether by purchase he obtained this man  antonio not being of my lot i am ignorant  moor such the peculiar hardship of my fate but if my property may be restored intelligence will follow   calaban  he appeals and i reserve my evidence to check his subtleties  he is been some pagan priest or one in magic ministering to hell and thence derives his sophistry and spells exit call  pembroke before the council what of evidence can thou produce   moor  the evidence of right which is the most acceptable to heaven  pembroke what witnesses   moor  even none   pembroke  how then prevail  moor by argument and influence of truth  antonio what are the objects that the slave pursues  moor many and various are my minds desires as my dire injuries are multiplied first i would move the council to restore those things which were about my person borne when i was made a captive   antonio  now retained by calaban   moor  important in my cause  antonio but you had arms   moor  should they be denied yet brought before the council those true marks which still contain my evidence they will bear and not an african from nigers source to gambias gulf but knows their signatures  antonio if that be all you seek command my voice  moor oh that antonio was an african the measures now resovd pursue the way impatience raises tumults in my breast as they pass through the scene the moor stands to gaze on the sculptures upon the rock when first i trod this shore i thought my steps were planted in the regions of the fiends those evil genii that haunt the ways of africs wretched sons with sad mishap but  ah  astonishment  antonio  what is it you read  moor pierced on this rock are characters obscure in divination cast an horoscope in which i find myself involved  who cut the mystic line and carved the prophecy remains untold   pembroke  the hieroglyphics these pointing to the rock  antonio decypher them   moor  it is more than i may do the same angelic hand that here engraved the sacred emblems hovers in the clouds and leaves me not kneels o thou mysterious light essence divine incomprehensible who out of darkness brings forth mighty deeds and did of nothing form all africa still imperceptible but in thy works let thy blessed spirit lift thy servant up from this adversity rises my souls refreshed  pembroke thy zeal has touched my spirit   antonio  oh my god what is it we do what right can we assume to bring into vile bondage men like this who serve thee though in darkness  aside  pembroke describe what moves thee thus   moor  i know the hand that engraved that character must be divine the fountain nymph invoking to her tears it gives a name a favorite female name dear to my memory so totally unknown beyond the vast atlantics bounds which fevers this your nether world from ours that nothing but some holy angels arm could reach the mighty distance one whose grasp embraces all the earth   antonio  it is wonderful  moor the rest is more obscure petitioning for pity from the spirits of the air groans are expired for some catastrophe in which a mother with her infants fell my soul sustains such dreadful agony such secret sorrows wrestle at my heart i cannot utter more  to kneel  to weep  to worship  to expire  is all that is left the wretched african   pembroke thou woundst our hearts with sorrow   antonio  anguish not to be endured why was i privy to such impious deeds aside  moor i am unmanned  i lose my pious hope my holy confidence yet he is not alone not desolate forsaken that has friends in heaven  why do i linger then behind bereft of all that life could give  oh africa what is there left thus to suspend my soul  antonio why do we not proceed  moor  griefs tempest raves within my heart and sorrows are renewed my adverse fortune did not promise this that in the land of bondage i should meet with traces mournful traces of the source of every tear i shed and all my woes but hold  i would read again  a thought succeeds that blazes with delight  perhaps the hand inscribing this was here is  oh mighty powers and who but she could tell the dreadful tale divine my fortune and divulge her own do you not know who engraved these characters  pembroke they are of much antiquity here placed as evidence of compact and good faith between the natives who resigned the soil and british voyagers   moor  you greatly err the hieroglyphics clearly african now liberty has double charms in view and if the guardian spirits leave me not perhaps this land which terrible appeared dark and unhallowed as captivity may yield me joys  most precious joys of life and prove the scene of earthly extacy  pembroke twere better to retire   moor  despise me not for these excessive contrasts of the mind i fly despair to snatch the hand of hope so ready is the human heart to seize the image of its wishes and to quit the terror of its woes  forgive me friends from the idea which i last conceived new prospects open to my fancys eye the gloom breaks off the vapor dissipates  pembroke let us avoid the curiosity of yonder females who observe our stay  moor there is bounty in their looks why should we fly as they depart the stage teresa and amelia enter teresa with them antonio   amelia  and pembroke too  teresa who is that stately moor we see attends  amelia i have not heard   teresa  as then we are alone let me unbosom to amelia my anxious thoughts   amelia  what cares can now possess my gracious mothers breast   teresa  draw near my child have thou observed in lauras conduct aught of levity and in unguarded hours does she reveal a habitude of mind which shows a vicious tendency  amelia  with me perhaps reserved she may restrain her thoughts and guard her conduct but in virtues cause few can display more excellence of mind in sentiments refined and maxims pure and such a chastity her speech does grace as would become the fairest spanish dame  teresa then all is well with thee   amelia  the questions strange  teresa i must dissemble and appear to throw my vague suspicions on her lovers side aside  amelia you muse dear mother   teresa  yet i am unresolved whether twere better not to wound your mind with mere suspicions whilst no facts are found or warn thee to beware   amelia  of what  of whom  teresa of laura   amelia  would you then depreciate her who holds my good opinion  or accuse some other   teresa  does antonio never come on frivolous pretense and fondly prate or waste in dalliance his idle hours to trifle with the slave   amelia  you make me smile leave me to manage with antonio i cannot yield my mind to jealousy it would degrade my own fair consequence and so far lessen selfopinion too that i should blush to own it  credit me the maidens virtues to such shameful fraud are as superior as light to shade ingratitude to her is yet unknown exit  teresa she does not seem to apprehend my thoughts it cannot be the governor should stoop so low in vice as to debase my bed with such intrigue  but still suspicion lurks within my mind and jealousy once known is hard to be eradicated thence still feeding like cameleons on air maintaining an existence vile   end of the second act act iii scene the groves near the governors palace enter antonio with the moor moor i marked his countenance and though there seemed a want of openness simplicity the character of truth stood in his looks his words were few but pertinent and strong and thence persuaded into confidence i trusted one chief secret to his ear  antonio if nothing more was trusted all is well  moor you entertain some doubts   antonio  hypocrisy can mask the guileful measures of the heart with fairest guise  when he assumes too much he gives distrust  no outward shows required by virtue  though the homely dress denies the power of riches avarice prevails lucre of gold and traffic is his god  moor ha   antonio  next of kin to griping avarice is fraud   moor am i betrayed  has he deceived  antonio be not alarmed perhaps i doubt too much  moor attend  are we perceived  can no one hear all is safe  in infancy my father placed his firstborn son with a most holy seer the high priest of the gods to educate in all the sacred learning of the sage who having gift of prophecy would often gaze on my face with tears and cast his signs to try if some good star might still prevail against predestined evils which he saw wrote in the book of fate from study deep and science most divine discovering a favorable planet he divulged his thoughts   antonio  i am all attention   moor  still the gods are willing to preserve thee from the woes that shall beset thy steps in time to come nor distant far the years captivity shall be thy wretched fate  a charm i hold will from the misery of that estate have power to liberate thee if applied with wisdom   antonio  strange anxiety pursues thy story   moor  straight he bound my trembling limbs fast to the sacred altar and my eyes with mystic fillet closed then on my thigh incision made and introduced the charm extorting vows that till occasion called if there should rest concealed and if such ill as was foretold might yet averted be by pious works or aid of powers above that to the grave the holy boon i would bear where he had placed it   antonio  a prescience astonishing   moor  the dire event was come and now the time and due occasion called for this important gift to make its way to light and give me liberty  i told the secret to my friend to pembroke told what gift i held and though he would deny what superstition seemed he lent his hand and with a lancet brought a jewel forth that would have ransomed all the slaves you hold  antonio it is well i know the secret of this trust perhaps he may prove faithful but if not i am thy witness to confront his fraud so great a trust for avarice to tempt will prove his virtue to its very source  moor you see what inadvertency pursued the strange event  for had i known what charm the holy priest bestowed more privacy would have prevailed  but full of pious faith i thought i merely held some mystic gift to influence the powers invisible  antonio to what intent was pembroke then to hold the gem   moor  to change it into ready gold or borrow on its value what might serve for my redemption and supply the calls of other exigence   antonio  the time draws near when it is accustomed that the council sits  moor you will be my friend  antonio  depend upon my word  moor whilst i look after pembroke should you meet use the intelligence as may seem best  antonio i will see you at the hall  exit moor  a second claim calls forth humanity  the subtle knave should he betray the injured moor in this the act would prove of greater cruelty than bondage exit  the scene changes to the governors garden laura enters alone laura how fruitless are our hopes  my troubled heart some gleams of consolation entertained to soothe this gloomy lot of adverse life in the attention and the gracious smiles teresa showed her slave but now alas without offense unconscious of the cause i meet her frown austere and angry pride sits lowering on her brow   jerome enters  still sunk in grief in all her woe there is such a dignity such unfeigned virtue shines from out her mind as testifies superior sentiment aside where haste you laura  laura  that i may my lord not interrupt your privacy   jerome  stay stay for i would speak to thee would dry those tears and cheer thy mind from its anxieties  laura permit me to retire   jerome  not with such speed  laura it is not meet i talk here with my lord  jerome i wish to ask thee if thy gentle heart has ever known the tender force of love  laura spare my confusion  jerome  ever known the pain of cold indifference from one beloved  laura my lord  jerome the pangs of deep despondency the anxious hope and the impatient wish  laura i tremble at your looks  desist my lord  jerome feverd desire and tender languishment  laura nay hold me not   jerome  but i will press thee thus and whisper in thine ear my hearts fond tale  laura spare me my lord spare your poor abject slave  jerome i would not injure thee   laura  then let me pass  jerome no i must plant upon those velvet lips ten thousand kisses   laura  am i not your slave is yet my dreadful ruin incomplete whilst i retain one gift derived of heaven my virtue   jerome  banish all thy fears sweet maid i will not rob thee   laura  that is gracious  jerome but i would take what gentle lauras love would genrously dispose   laura  alas my lord if i possessed such quality of mind as might your pity still have merited it was my hatred of vile perfidy my firm integrity my steady truth and yet unblotted fame  jerome  all these i love nor would i tempt thee into perfidy but have thee true as magnet to the pole  laura then think of your teresa sacred name of wedded love   jerome  thy fair integrity i would not stain nor virtue would seduce but try tengage them both on my behalf  laura and break them with amelia   jerome  thy truth i wish to center on our mutual love  laura forsaking vows which heaven has long since heard and on the tablet of the great supreme written in characters embossed with stars  jerome then thou have loved   laura  and mourn it in despair  jerome and do thou talk of virtue  africs maids are not so coy   laura  disgrace not your great mind with sentiments so far beneath the cast of that high erudition you have known in every clime fair virtue is the same and though the vertic sun pours forth his beams upon the eastern world and whilst the frosts with torpid fetters bind the northern climes yet virtue has her sanctity in each in each revered by heaven and prized on earth inestimable gift  if pure is light gods emanation here  if fair the moon if bright the stars  those brilliant eyes of night if heavens blue vaults unspotted and serene the great supreme on purity must look with love divine   jerome  to prate to argue thus is to abuse the moment we possess what i would win  by force i might obtain but i detest compulsion  and will woo  teresa and amelia enter at a sidebower teresa you would divert my purpose but behold are my suspicions vague   jerome  if you will yield to my warm wishes from this servitude to a far distant villa you shall move and there enjoy your liberty   laura  point out my lord my tomb and bring the poisoned bowl then giving me my choice i will bless your name  jerome you must you shall comply  my ardent love is irresistible  and thus  laura struggles  laura  stand off drawing a dagger i yet possess one guardian of my fame  amelia witness her virtue and compassionate her sufferings   teresa  shall we interfere and save her rashness  see the impious wretch how mean is vice how abject  see he kneels  jerome stay thy rash hand that threatens to destroy us both   laura  i will retire  and though i know this moment robs me of the hope of peace and mixes my sad lot with other slaves yet with exulting soul i will meet my fate resign these useless ornaments this garb to clasp within my arms the rags that cloth the meanest wretch who in the millway works and an approving mind shall smooth the task which honor has imposed  jerome  it must not be nay i will even constrain thee   laura  this weak hand not raised against its master holds enough of vigor to release me   she retires  whilst jerome stands meditating amelia  let us go twere better he should recollect himself we must not meet him now  teresa  not meet him girl yes i will rouse him from his lethargy that he may not avail himself again and my attention wickedly divert by vile insinuations to the spoil of fairer characters   amelia  it is as i thought  teresa approaches jerome whilst he stands lost in reverie teresa is this well done my lord  does this become the mighty ruler of these provinces on whose example and wise government depend a peoples welfare   jerome  youre in wrath  teresa was it for this the nobles of my house gave you my hand  and i could condescend with a plebeian race to mix the blood of the illustrious name of alicant  jerome for what teresa   teresa  the indignity my eyes my ears

wish to hire a ship to carry me again to gambias streams there is danger always in a foreign state  antonio our thoughts still correspond let us move on exeunt  enter jerome and pembroke pembroke much secrecy is not required the fact already is too public  the alarm affects the planters much conspiracy has been discovered and a double guard in some plantations now is necessary  jerome what cause to charge manzara with the crime  pembroke his name is gone abroad some slaves were brought from his dominions and he often was seen in secret converse pleading earnestly with much gesticulation   jerome  to receive such vague report and information void of proof will not induce the legislative power to interfere  there is a dignity in this muchinjurd man that proves itself such perspicuity in all his phrase as shows an erudition none but those of the first consequence could ever attain we are not left to doubt his high estate from a full sense of those base injuries he has sustained we gave him liberty and now to charge him with such heinous crimes against the state is singular   pembroke  twas i that pledged his ransom to relieve his chains twas i that moved him to his late appeal and is it possible without a cause i should accuse the man whom i espoused  jerome the circumstance appears to me so dark that i distrust what i cannot comprehend  pembroke i hate the name of slavery and aid emancipation by all powerful means but whilst humanity promotes one cause another it preserves  my countrys weal when i discovered that this bosom held so treacherous a thought as mutiny among the slaves and in its consequence subversion of the government and spoil of individuals i straightway turned attention to his plots and found him out  jerome how found him out   pembroke  i held his confidence and when he had enlarged on golden dreams and promises of africs wealth he owned revenge raged in his heart a wish to gain retaliation for his countrys woes and to let loose a bloody hand  to appease the horror which he saw impressed me deep he talked of vast rewards   jerome  in consequence of confidence like this would thou impeach on the mere strength of thy veracity this stranger prince   pembroke  if justice should require the deepest secret of my bosom yields to public good  but see horatio comes perhaps he bears yet more important truths  horatio enters jerome are your slaves peaceable   horatio  i am in fear they gather in cabals and sullen seem working reluctantly   jerome  but are there grounds to doubt conspiracy   horatio  my spies report that some strange faction has possessed their minds their priests exhort with vehemence and often they sing the warsong and they hail their prince whom they rejoice is landed on our coast  jerome this may alarm  but have you cause to charge manzara as a secret instrument or as the object of the peoples joy  horatio i have inquired my spies know not his name  martino enters we must entreat the aid of government ten thousand slaves now threaten a revolt through my plantation strange commotions reign and all my trusty servants fly to arms perhaps upon assembling of the troops this ferment may subside  horatio  if not suppressed with an immediate hand none can foresee the fatal consequence a night may bring  jerome what cause appears   martino  we have discovered none  jerome i shall convene the council  planters retire  pembroke  thus you see the intelligence is proved by circumstance were it not best to put the moor in chains  jerome it may be necessary   pembroke  if the offense on full investigation is disproved he will stand discharged and no great injury sustaining may depart  but when compared the consequences feared with his arrest the latters light as air   jerome  i stand convinced the projects right   pembroke  there is of his nation here more than your zangae now at liberty for as we loiterd in the shady grove adjacent to your palace where the rock is sculptured with mysterious characters   jerome my hearts alarmed  aside  pembroke  and whilst he stood and wept he told me in an agony of mind that there he read a history of woe  jerome he read   pembroke  the gravings of familiar mode  jerome my passions are on fire  aside  pembroke  and when his mind was all absorbed forgetting i was there he kneeled and in an extacy grief thrice called aloud in his own dialect jaqueena   jerome  ha   pembroke  as if he would invoke some demon and the fiends of africa  jerome i have let loose the eagle to destroy the firstlings of my flock  aside  pembroke  i touch his soul that was the boldest spring i had to move i must not overstrain it  aside  jerome  you advise to put the moor in durance   pembroke  true i do  jerome proceed then to enquire into the facts that justice strictly be administered exit pembroke this is a foe i never once had feared jaqueena is the maid whom he laments for whom he lost his liberty  to him or to a legion of the negro tribe i will not resign her  for my heart is here is nor spanish pride nor africs haughty sons shall from my anxious bosom wrest the maid  zangae enters my lord the plot is laid and to the hands of calaban poor lauras doomed to pass some island of the indies is agreed to be her place of bondage  i have learnt the hour of their departure   jerome  then take care to have the necessary means prepared not only of her safety but to bear her to my distant villa with all speed there wait my coming   zangae  trusty slaves attend to execute your will   jerome  my confidence is placed in thee  exit zangae

v scene the groves adjoining the governors palace enter jerome and antonio antonio you are deceived and trifled with  the prince has a sublimity of mind superior to stratagems like these   jerome  it was a charge so grounded and the facts established by proofs so strong i could not hesitate to send him into durance till we heard the slaves were peaceful and the tumult hushed  antonio there was no tumult   jerome  all martinos slaves had mutinied   antonio  there never was more peace than at the instant  not a voice was heard through the plantation   jerome  and horatios men caballd refused to labor and had sung the warsong   antonio  all a fiction  all is false a tale just calculated to reduce the price of my imported cargo by advice of pembroke to affect the planters minds with terror and prevent their bargaining in times of pressing danger   jerome  both gave proof in charge against manzara   antonio  i repeat you were abused they knew not why he brought them hither but proposed such tale to them for the base purpose i declare they knew no tittle of the charge against the prince read there  they certify the fact  gives a paper  jerome  good heaven protect us from such wiles  what could induce the villain to these practices   antonio  a hope of robbing the afflicted prisoner avoiding justice and escaping hence with such a booty as his avarice could not resist  integrity is a mere outside semblance he assumes to mask a soul replete with darkest fraud  jerome i know not what is alluded to   antonio  a fact will strike you with abhorrence  having placed much confidence in this perfidious wretch he to his care entrusted a rich gem by which he might his ransom and return obtain  in order with impunity to rob the captive stranger he procured first his imprisonment by a false charge then got on board a ship prepared to sail for spain   jerome  my soul is grieved  i have been deceived and to sad inadvertencies betrayed  antonio which soon may be retrieved   jerome  there is my doubt  antonio the prince may be restored to liberty  jerome my heart is now with much compunction smote  antonio what moves you thus   jerome  proceed  did he escape  antonio hearing of these transactions and informed of the great trust i got an officer to go on board and seize the treacherous knave just as the sails were bent and tide had served to carry him to sea   jerome  with equal speed send to the prison and release the moor  antonio your zangae comes this way  zangae enters  jerome  it is opportune haste and release the moor  if yet he lives exit zangae  antonio is there a doubt  you wound my tortured soul  is there a fear   jerome  but of the precious gem  antonio for the poor prince i am all anxiety  jerome what the event   antonio  the man suspecting not that i was privy to the trust retained the stone nor tried to hide his purposed fraud by throwing it in the sea on search we found it in his bosom  evidence sufficient to the magistrate appeared to cast him into prison  see the price of his iniquity produces the jewel my hearts distressed i tremble for the moor   jerome  to this dread charge the villain wrought upon my guilty mind with such insinuations of the love manzara entertained or had avowed for laura and his purpose to withdraw the maid from hence  that   antonio  the fair interest which laura claims in her manzaras breast might warrant all that pembroke could devise but she is ignorant  so is the moor that they are so near a wished for intercourse  jerome my conscience is disturbed  i own my crimes and wish that retribution could be had the guilty passions were inflamed with love unlawful as it was  my jealousy was basely roused  and vengence filled my mind under pretext of service to the state by my removing an obnoxious moor who would an insurrection have stirred up among the slaves  i sent my mandate forth  antonio what was its tenor  for i dread the blow  jerome that in the prison they should strangle him  antonio oh horrid cruelty  oh innocence that suffers mighty woes  a captive here dragged from his country and a diadem by calaban ensnared  and now betrayed to death  what dreadful crimes we perpetrate and yet the vengeance of offended heaven is long withheld   jerome looking out  oh zangae comes alone  antonio then he is dead   jerome  and on my guilty head the blood of innocence is fallen   antonio looking out  rejoice and be exceeding glad  he comes he comes enter manzara and zangae jerome to zangae haste to your charge  and mark me only watch their purpose and attend my further will  zangae the people i have stationd   jerome  get thee hence exit zangae  manzara so long inured to injury and chains methinks the powers of heaven have so decreed they are my lot for life  what further woes would you inflict  behold your victim stands to hear the judgment you will again pronounce i have no more than life itself to lose by men of your complexion whose cold souls are frozen up in ice i lost my realm my wife my country and my liberty now to accomplish all spare not the poor vile remnant of possession spare it not but send this soul to join my ancestors who hover for me on the mountains top where is the executioner  be quick for i am weary and would be at rest  jerome not to increase thy injuries or woes but to redress them art thou brought   manzara  i heard a voice say thou have liberty and straight the shackles of a slave were taken off no sooner i possessed the sacred bliss than i endured the manacles prepared for criminals  so momentary prove the smiles of fortune in manzaras fate  jerome with my own hands i take these fetters off and in my arms with cordial embrace insure thee of protection   antonio  it is with grief the governor perceives how multiplied were your misfortunes and his gracious heart is warmed to do you service   jerome confident i need not doubt thy faith this scymeters restored an ornament for no rude cause will urge thee to its use  manzara i bless the gods this happy change takes place perhaps once more cassaenas distant land i may behold  antonio to heighten this new prospect of your peace behold the gem

wanders thus her recollection yet she knows me not  laura if my manzara in his gracious arms shall lift me to the grave  i die content and sure his vision blessed my swimming eyes or played upon my fancy with delight gazing on him  my judgment is so shaken that i know not what or where i am   manzara  behold my queen the gracious spirits that prevail on earth transported me beyond our hemisphere

laura gazing on manzara  what sad woes has my poor heart endured  i lost my love and with these eyes beheld the tragic scene where my dear mother with her infant fell and welterd in their gore  my brother died within these trembling arms in agonies snatched from my country i am become a slave the prey of tyranny and lust  it is he i know his godlike features  i behold the great the good manzara

forget to flow i faint   manzara  assist ye spirits of the air and with refreshing breath of heaven renew her strength   laura  manzara oh much loved lord from whose dear image fancy never strayed impressed upon this heart thy character which love conceived nor day nor night removed thou were the vision of my happiest dream and in the gloom of the detested cell as over the vast atlantic we were borne and when america her slave received thou held my thoughts and all my wishes filled but hope was fled and black despair was come whilst death alone held out a saving hand rash was the deed and

faints  she dies  it is done  amelia and all our wishes disappointment blights  jerome like some blessed saint who confident in god refuses earth one groan   manzara  do i neglect the great example and stay lingering here sustaining such extremity of woe  jerome if ever more authority i show it is to wrest thee from this sad despair seizes his arm  antonio to save much rashness let thy slave receive this scymeter yet stained with mortal deeds  zangae removes the sword manzara i know not what to do  oh sweet remains adieu  a long adieu  if you retain to antonio compassion for my woes embalm the corpse that africa may yet receive its own we must depart  must tear ourselves from hence to jerome the scene of so much terror and distress zangae shall be the partner of my tears though seas may shake the helm  though adverse winds may hang upon the dilatory sail perhaps relenting fates will yet retain some pity for the moor  that he may land on native shores  and there erect on high a monument that shall command the hearts of our posterity whilst man exists to an abhorrence of the trade in slaves  finis
