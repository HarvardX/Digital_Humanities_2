elizabeth lady craven to his serene highness the margrave of brandebourg anspach and bareith  written in the year mdcclxxxvi  dublin printed for h chamberlain r moncriefff w colles g burnet w wilson l white p byrne p wogan h colbert j moore j jones and b dornin mdcclxxxix  to his serene highness the margrave of brandebourg anspach and bareith custom has long given a preface to every book that has been published  it is likewise accompanied with a dedication i have always thought the last made the first unnecessary  indeed both may be dispensed with if an author does not think his style requires an apology for offering to the public a work which his humility or justice may lead him to think fit only to put his readers to sleep  the greatest part of the public has my permission to doze over the following sheets as i expose them to the malice of my enemies without reserve merely to oblige many of my friends who knowing i had taken a long and extraordinary journey have desired me to give them some account of it the best i could give and in the most agreeable manner to myself was by transcribing part of my letters to you  in which though in a cursory manner i have given you a faithful picture of what i have seen beside curiosity my friends will in these letters see at least for some time where the real lady craven has been and where she is to be found  it having been a practice for some years past for a birmingham coin of myself to pass in most of the inns in france switzerland and england for the wife of my husband  my arms and coronet sometimes supporting in some measure this insolent deception by which probably i may have been seen to behave very improperly i think it my duty to aver upon my honor that it has frequently happened to me traveling with my sweet child to find a landlady who has shown a particular desire of serving me in the most menial offices with tears in her eyes and upon my asking the reason in the honest indignation of her heart she said she had been imposed upon at such a time by a traveller who called herself by my name if i had possessed the invaluable blessing of having you for my real brother  this curious and unheard of treason to my birth and character would long since have been punished in the person who could only countenance the deceit but let me thank heaven that i have found in you sir all the virtues which i could desire in a brother and that affection and respect which leads me to dedicate these letters to you my actions in future will prove more than this feeble tribute how deeply impressed i am with all the feelings of esteem that can fill a grateful heart your people sir your many virtues that make all that approach you happy will justify my dedicating my studious as my social hours to you   eliza craven  depiction of the grotto of antiparos grotto of antiparos   lady cravens journey to constantinople letter   paris june         the honor you do me in wishing to hear from me deserves in return a greater entertainment than my letters can afford and if it was not for the precious name of sister which you order me to take i should perhaps be a long time before i could venture to write to you but when you command me to look upon you as my brother the idea coincides so perfectly with the esteem and friendship i feel for you that i obey with pleasure   since your highness left paris i have had my brother and sister here the south of france has entirely recovered her and she is in a fair way of producing an heir  i have many nephews but none of that name yet   i shall set out tomorrow for touraine called by the french le jardin de la france and at three oclock in the morning as it is very hot  my harp is in the coach with me for though my intention is not to stay above three weeks where i am going to  i cannot be so long absent from the sound of an instrument that i prefer to every other  i have sent you some english gardenseeds which were given me by lady  i hope when you are eating your sallads this summer you will think of your adopted sister and believe that it must be very good reasons that deter her from visiting franconia in preference to all other places   i have the honor to subscribe myself your very affectionate sister faithful friend and servant  eliza craven  letter ii i slept at orleans last night  and as the weather is extremely hot i rested in the middle of the day at blois where i examined the royal chateau a house composed of different orders of architecture built at different periods of time and by various persons the most modern addition has been made by gaston duc dorleans who chose to place an italian structure in the midst of the various irregularity belonging to the ancient gothic one part of which was built by francis the first  the ornaments of this several of them were to me as incomprehensible as egyptian hieroglyphics would have been i wished my friend mr w at my elbow whose knowledge in and taste for the gothic might have explained them the porter who conducted me about seemed a good historian for a person of his condition i need not tell you how many extraordinary personages and events this chateau called to my mind if the confusion which ambition naturally creates in history should at this moment prevent your memory from placing them before you  i refer you to the nouveau voyage de la france par mr piganiol de la force who gives a cursory account of blois and this chateau  but he does not say what i can assert that so many persons have scraped the stone on which henry duc de guises blood fell that there remains but one half of it my old conductor told me those who preserved the powder as a relick were people related to the guise family and curious travelers  i was not one of them this letter would be too long if i inserted an adventure which happened to me at the post beyond blois you shall have it in my next i will only add to this that if ever you go from blois to tours do not go by night  the road is on a causeway the loire on your left and a precipice into meadows on your right without any fence to prevent an accident if your postillions were drunk or your horses frightened  the uncommon dryness of the season prevented my judging of the much boasted beauties of the loire which is now reduced to the narrowest rivulet i have seen  there are many castles on the banks which ornament the landscape  and were probably fortified in former days one in particular put me in mind of dear b castle i suppose they are left now as most habitations in france are distant from versailles for a concierge to keep his pigs and chickens in  adieu   letter iii at the post beyond blois while the horses were changing an operation not performed in one minute as in england one of my servants came up to the door and said ces maudits postillons ne veulent point laisser monter cet enfant derriere la voiture the word enfant always strikes to my heart among the many reasons i had before i have now an additional one for feeling about an enfant of any sort  i am at this moment above a hundred miles distant from the most affectionate the most engaging and the most beautiful child that ever mother had  and for the first time i have ever left him   quel enfant says i looking out on the left toward the hind wheel of my berline  i saw a boy seemingly about ten years old decently dressed in mourning  a crape round his hat and black buckles in his shoes  madame says he  and the tears in his eyes stopped his voice   eh bien mon enfant parlez   madame le maitre de post a blois ma conseille de monter derriere votre berline comme il ny avait point de malle  a present les postillons ne veulent pas my laisser   comment vous appellez vouz  cassius  cassius  voila un beau nom oui madame said the child who had never heard or read of any other cassius but himself  mon pere etait gentilhomme  and he gave me a pocketbook which contains letters one of these was from a lady of quality to the childs distant relations at la rochelle desiring them to place him on board a ship  comment says i wous voudriez servir servir in french conversation always means serve in a military capacity and not as a servant     oui madame je ne saurais etre domestique parce que mes peers etaient gentilhommes  and among a variety of questions which i asked him  and to which he answered modestly and pertinently  whenever he recollected that circumstance it was a painful idea he had a brother and sister at paris who had sent him to go from thence to la rochelle on foot with six livres and his letters of recommendation for his support and protection what unfeeling people avez vous dine aujourd hui it was then about six oclock  oui madame le maitre de post a blois ma done a diner  ce sont les postillons dici qui ne veulent pas que je monte derriere votre voiture the postillions by this time were listening to my conversation with the child and one of them with a gruff voice said  si ce petit monsieur veut payer un cinquieme cheval il montera  et si javais une grande malle comme de coutume says i montez montez mon enfant and turning to the postillion vous aurez de quoi boire a sa sante so he was pleased and the boy delighted but as in france more than in any other country in the world the value of every thing is  so much money as twill bring  my maid was surprised at my bonte dame  as i never eat but once a day in traveling and that at the end of my journey  i shall never forget my supper last night  i had got into my bed fatigued and ordered my maid to bring me a soup i had lain half an hour the room was dark and when the door opened the first thing i saw was cassius holding two waxlights preceding my maid he said mademoiselle might go to her supper and he would wait upon me and his countenance had a mixture of comfort joy and gratitude in it scarcely to be seen but in the candor of youth this morning i had settled with the mistress of the inn that she should agree with a waggoner to take cassius safe to rochelle  i had given him some money too little for charity to name  perhaps what the avaricious would think too much and a recommendation signed with my name and my seal upon it when the postillions i had ordered to take me to  came to inform me that as it was a crosscountry road they expected three times the sum usually paid  as i might just as effectually argue with a horse as with a french postillion i asked where the post house was  only two doors off  i went there the master was out but his wife was at home and while i was settling matters with her one of the old fashioned french postchaises stopped at the door with an officer in it seemingly emaciated by sickness and his head wrapped up very much  cassius was at my elbow madame madame says he ce monsieur na point de malle in fact all the luggage was before jirais bien plus vite a la rochelle si vous vouliez lui demander de me laisser monter sur sa voiture  i went up to the chaise and curtsied very low the officer bowed slightly i stepped back but cassius pulled me by the sleeve  so i once again advanced and curtsied  monsieur   madame   i brought cassius forward  voici un pauvre orphelin qui va a la rochelle  il est venu depuis blois sur ma berline si vous voulez bien lui permettre de monter derriere votre voiture ce sera moi qui vous en aurai pobligation  moi  i repeated in a higher tone of voice the officer had begun by staring at me from head to foot and before i had finished my speech he endeavored but in vain to draw off his nightcap  tout ce que vous ordonnez  tout ce quil vous plaira madame   and i had the satisfaction of seeing the little orphan comfortably seated and flying toward la rochelle certain that he would neither be robbed nor beaten on the road   i am setting out for    from whence i will write you an account of any thing i shall observe worthy of being related   letter iv  en touraine june         my approach to this place was through bad crosscountry roads i have seen nothing yet that could justify the idea of this province being le jardin de la france i saw many chateaux which from the singular towers their only ornaments my fancy might have represented heralds giants or dwarfs issuing forth to enquire what bewildered heroine came so near  mais helas  i did not see one preux chevalier nor any thing about these ancient structures that could make me imagine they belonged to gentlemen much less to noble warriors  besides i was gravely seated in a comfortable coach varnished and gilt instead of being on a white palfrey to be serious i am probably writing in a room once inhabited by one of marguerite reine de navarres ladies of honor for this chateau was built by francis the first for his sister the outside is neither regular nor beautiful and i cannot guess what order of architecture was intended to be shown in the building  one front is toward the river cher flanked by two large round towers with spiral tops and the ground floor toward the court is at least four stories high from the meadows in which the cher runs this suite of apartments was probably royal the rooms remarkably lofty and well proportioned  i am told the proprietaire had laid out four thousand pounds to repair the house and beautify the gardens  as to the first it is in the same state most countryhouses in france are  wanting painting whitewashing and repairs of every sort  the ornaments in the garden are these many canals small enough to look like troughs  and statues made in plaster all mutilated the little that remains of them made me wish they had never existed  part of the castleditch remains and under it are cellars and subterraneous passages of an enormous size and length  in this part of the country the peasants habitation is chiefly hewn in the rock the door being the only wooden part of it the laborers catch agues and fevers frequently by returning home warm and resting in these damp cells from my windows i could see the loire if at its usual height and i have the prospect of a chateau where the heiress of bretagne gave with her hand that province to france  in a few days i shall go to tours from whence i shall again write and assure you how much i am your affectionate sister   letter v tours june         i galloped all the way here on horseback along a delightful meadow and got off my horse at the bottom of the mail a very fine walk shaded by some venerable elms which by some strange prodigy have escaped the cizeau of the tondeur  and spread their majestic branches much to the comfort of the bourgeoifie of tours who here find a cool promenade but i am told they are soon to be cut down ils sont trop vieux  if mr declusel the late intendant was alive he would oppose this horrid scheme for as he had lived in england some months and had sense enough to adopt what was good with us he has given this town a clean appearance by adding trottoirs on each side of the new streets  i am lodged at the archiepiscopal palace monseigneur is not here which i regret  i am told he is a man of letters  of taste i am sure he is by a chapel he has just added to his palace  there is a large cathedral close to it the outside gothic  the stonework is worth seeing  nothing in the inside but what is very mediocre  another large church here de st martin the king is chanoine de st martin  a very singular rcumstance  in the cloister is a most beautiful frize done by the masterly hand of michael angelo  is so nearly connected with our st martins in the fields in london that the tours clergy were obliged to send to london to get some ancient charter explained  there are many english here   adieu i remain yours most affectionately p s i recollect that you may not know what i mean by the cizeau of the tondeur to explain which i must inform you that shearing the trees in a french garden is a custom as ancient and thought as necessary as shaving the beard and tondeurs are paid for it by the year as barbers are by the month i have had several reasons given to me for this gothic custom among the rest that it made a tree grow more beautiful and strong which last excuse must no longer be mentioned naturalists having discovered lately that a tree draws as much nourishment from the fluid received by the leaves as from the root itself  but nature may plead in vain her cause for centuries to come in france she will long go disguised  the gardens and the poetry exhibit melancholy proofs of this truth without my mentioning any more at present    letter vi june  0      i have been to see veret a house of the duc d aguillons where there is nothing worth looking at and richelieu where not only the palace but the town was built by the cardinal of that name  i rode to a village called lillebouchar lost my way and rambled above thirty miles over the country before i could find out the cures house i was going to dine with he is a good sort of a map sensible and learned and had assembled all the good company in the neighborhood to dine under a large tent in the garden with me  i must not forget to tell you that i passed close by the church from whence joan of are took her invincible sword placed there by divine power lillebouchar is only two leagues from richelieu where at the first gate of the avauntcour two old guards with clothes as ancient as their faces their bayonets on their shoulders precede the company to the inner court here the concierge shows first statues of the roman emperors and heroes tolerable copies the chapel is next shown where there is a picture that pleased me much and which is said to have been painted by michael angelo  i take it to be a copy  it is spoiling for want of care  and i was told most of the good pictures were sent to paris i was led through many rooms  the palace is immensely large one apartment was called the queens for the queens apartment and all the rooms according to their destinations are shown  it was the cardinals first intention to bring the whole court to richelieu  every beam of wood was shown in the cielings of those times  here they are almost all carved and gilt over  judge of the expense there is a wholelength picture of the cardinal by an italian master and a good one after being walked over the house large enough to tire a very able walker i was offered to see the jardins but from the windows i had perceived the taste of them and therefore declined that pleasure  i imagine the reason why the cardinal prevented the court from ever coming to richelieu was the same policy that he introduced and that exist even now of drawing all the rich nobles from the seats of their ancestors  involving them in all the expenses of the court at versailles that they might not feel they had a protection in their home  but look for that and support likewise from royal favor alone  a cunning idea of making the nobles support him in his measures and particularly if he acted contrary to the good of his country  the nobles of my country may thank heaven when they reflect that they are members of a great nation enjoying their ancient seats and expecting honors and emoluments from the court as they may deserve them from their country  the french noblesse at present indeed have a comfort under the weight of debts their fathers may have left them  they have a young monarch generous and just  and i really believe one of the best kings that ever existed as his power is great  if the nobles deserve  he will bestow greatly   adieu dear sir yours p s i cannot see chanteloup the due de choiseuls house the scelle is put on he is dead but lately  so i can give you no account of that place   i was obliged to assure the intendant and some more french the other day at his house that sir george elliot sir george must not be highly flattered at this for the french are so fond of monopolizing all that is worth possessing that prince eugene and our capability brown with many others are claimed by them was not a frenchman since he has immortalized his name at gibraltar i find this nation is extremely desirous of claiming him  but i took upon me to say i believed scotland might boast of being his native land and that of most of his forefathers  however if indeed they would choose to date from a much earlier period most of us old english would be found to be danes normans etc  you will be surprised to find that instead of returning to paris i am going southward  my eldest brother lord b  has written me word that it is possible he may pass the winter in italy as it is so long since he has been out of england i have given him two routes and have told him i shall proceed gently to florence there to wait for him     letter vii lions july    i am safely arrived here and to avoid going round some leagues i came a crosscountry road look on your postmap for cormery loches buxancely chateauroux ardante la chatre montmarauculan roanne  but dear sir follow me only on paper for the roads in some places were so bad and the lanes so narrow that my coach is scratched  and the drivers with difficulty persuaded to go to the places i ordered them sometimes lost their way i went through great part of the bourbonnais  and within ten miles of vichy where the kings aunts were taking the waters the auvergne mountains were fine objects to the right on my approaching lions i felt a great difference in the air  a warmer climate was easily to be perceived  the small conic winding hills round which the country girls with their strange straw hats and their distaff at their side were conducting their goats as they spun formed a landscape new to me  particularly as the flat roofs to the cottages gave a lightness to the buildings that pleased me much   a simple kind of plough likewise drawn by two oxen brought that period to my mind when the romans were conquering towns or founding colonies  the evening coming on with a stormy sky made me almost fancy that a roman legion was here and there concealed by the rocks which crown almost every one of the conic hills i have before mentioned and which might serve as small batteries nay the very clouds which i often saw resting between the hills might have served for momentary concealment  but we will step out of these clouds if you please  for i am neither a roman general nor a goddess but at this moment a very much satigued mortal in a handsome apartment hotel dauphin rue de l arsenal where i shall eat a good supper drink your health and wish you as good a nights rest as i am likely to enjoy   letter viii lions july    on the sixteenth i was too much fatigued to look at any thing but the junction of the soane and the rhone but on the   th i saw the paintings in the hotel de ville mostly by blanchet his works are spoiling under the cold hands of neglect and time  the taurobolum may be very fine and much to be admired by all lovers of antiquity but i who cannot admire what i do not think beautiful looked at it with great indifference  spon and other writers give a learned account of this and of the brassplate on which is engraved the speech made by claudius in favor of the town and which is lest within the reach of mischievous boys or idle beggars the people of lions seem to pay a greater regard to the vanity of the moderns than to the pride of the ancients i saw a beautiful sarcophagus in a lawyers courtyard that served as a cistern  and in many old walls and houses carvings or inscriptions which i wished to examine while the tradesmen within these habitations siared at the strangers who could be more anxious about ruins than the new silks or embroidery they wished to sell i cannot help thinking any antiquary might find many more things well worthy of the cabinet of the curious here than have already been discovered as to the towns being handsome which i was told it was i must assert that many parts of it are positively frightful that the houses are crowded together each story as it rises projecting over the other  and the streets as narrow and stinking as those of paris but the environs are beautiful and it is extremely amusing to go in a boat every way out of the town  i took several sketches from different points one from a little island which was formerly called insula barbara you recollect a large round tower which crowns the prison of pierreencise the proportions of it struck my ideas of symmetry very much  and after looking at it for some time i landed at the foot of the prison and walked up a hundred and twenty steps cut in the rock the guards let me in very civilly and to my utter surprise among the prisoners i found the  whom you must remember as he was very often with  he asked me a thousand questions about j  and laughed very much in talking over several parties with him and  but i laughed on my part at his taking mr  for lord b   i had been told pierreencise was a state prison but it is no such thing it serves as a temporary retreat for people of fashion who live too fast  and are placed there by lettres de cachet till it pleases the kind parents who have obtained them to release their prisoners  declares whenever he obtains his liberty he shall revisit england which i suppose at this time more than at any other seems to him a paradise as there is no such thing as a lettre de cachet there   do you recollect a most charming picture by rubens in the chapelle des penitents i examined it a long time with great delight  and did you ever observe that all the fine pictures in france are spoiling but those possessed by the church indeed knowledge and taste are chiefly confined to the clergy  all other etats in france not having leisure to form their taste of which truth i must give a most ridiculous example  every body last year that would be quite a l anglaise at paris had to wait on them what they called a jakay a little boy with straight lank unpowdered hair wearing a round hat  and this groomlike looking thing waited upon them at dinner and was frequently stuck up with three tall footmen behind a fine gilt coach  it was in vain for me to assert to some grave old french people that jockey meant ridinggroom in a runninghorse stable and that no grooms ever waited upon us nay scarcely ever came into the house and certainly nothing but servants as well dressed and powdered as the french waited upon us or went behind our carriages they answered it must then be a new fashion for it was toutafait a l anglaise  et comme on fesait a londres   i am called away to go up to the tower of fourviere to look over all the town at once  yours adieu  letter ix lions july    the fine prospect i was promised from the tower was immensely so indeed  landscapes so various and objects so vast and innumerable that the eye seeks in vain for a resting place  i do not know dear sir if you are of my opinion but i like that my sight as well as my mind should be collected to enjoy one pleasing subject at a time  vary the scene as often as you please  but i hate confusion so much that if i was obliged to choose a house situated on an eminence commanding a large city many windings of a river and an immense tract of country or one at the bottom of that eminence with a view so confined that i could see only to the end of a small garden i think i should prefer the latter  i know this may seem very stupid but i never could comprehend the pleasure of what is usually called a fine prospect where it is only with a telescope that the wanderings of the sight are to be fixed   i have hired a boat to take me down the rhone to avignon it is only a few planks nailed together that brought wood from savoy a sort of raft but looks quite strong enough to contain me and my small retinue i send my horse by the coche deau  do not suppose that my love for the ancients has totally made me overlook the modern artists here a lyonnais merchant whom i bought silks of in london has shown me all the new silks and patterns an ill taste prevails universally as to dress in france the last new designs for waistcoats particularly are frightful great sprawling butterflies  the very man who was showing them shrugged up his shoulders  que voulez vouz madame il faut toujours du nouveau   there is a curious mill to wind silk on bobbins here a horse in a garret on the fourth story turns one wheel which sets several on all the other floors in motion and those turn many thousand bobbins  every ancient building here is stuck upon a rock and i cannot help thinking they look like teeth the rocks serving as roots to them  i was assured the saone ran in a different channel from what it now does and that it was the swiss who had cut through the rocks to give the river its present course  but if it ever was turned i should think it was done by the romans whose works great and useful stamped their date  the remains that testify how much they did in the environs of this place may fairly excuse my supposition  if caligulas successor could now peep out of his grave  or nero who reestablished this town  they might have some difficulty in believing it was the same   adieu dear sir yours  letter x avignon july  0      nothing can be more delightful than my last method of traveling by water i have had high and contrary winds but the rhones famed rapidity that i had heard so much of was neither surprising nor terrifying  the shores on each side were rocks interspersed with vineyards and castles  i landed the first day at condrieux where i bought some excellent wine for    sols a bottle the growth of that place  about a league from thence is la montagne tupain belonging to mr de la condamine where the best coterotie wine is to be had that word signifies really and truly roastedcoast the grapes being almost broiled by the sun the wine is of a red and strong kind  reckoned very fine but like many other fine things i did not relish it  a little farther on the left is lhermitage a spot so called because formerly a hermit lived upon that hill the wine of which is too much known for me to say any thing about it i gave three livres a bottle for it but found the white so much better than the red that i ordered some to be sent to marseilles from whence i shall have it shipped for england  there is a small town called vienne that has a fine gothic cathedral which i went on shore to look at together with a monument belonging to the montmorin family well executed  i saw several people on the banks of the rhone sifting gravel they find among it little bits of solid gold washed down from the mountains a most horrid employment in this hot weather i should think but what will not poor mortals do for gold since the rich are often slaves to that which they ought to be masters of   montelimart is a castle from whence i am told three kingdoms are seen and seven provinces i did not stop to see this or any other of the many castles i passed by  at the pont st esprit which is a noble bridge indeed i think the passage might be dangerous if the boatmen were not very attentive  my coach is so large and has such excellent blinds that i have not suffered from the heat at all  the shores lose all their beauty near avignon which i could not see because it is surrounded by a high turreted wall   madame de brancas the duc de crillons sister was very civil to me and we talked about  i dined with lord  whose health is much impaired and i hope this climate will do him good  adieu dear sir yours   p s i am told by some one who knows the duc de crillon very well that his sister is exactly like him which i can easily conceive for she has as many projects about her gardens and houses as her brother had about the taking of gibraltar i hope they will succeed better than his have for she is very goodhumoured    letter xi marseilles august        dear sir i thought it unnecessary to give you any description of avignon because you have been there but as you did not take the same road to it as i did in coming from it i will endeavor to give you some faint idea of a natural curiosity that i have seen and which pleased me highly  the much famed fontaine de vaucluse   i set out from avignon in the middle of the day and arrived at a town called lille where i took a french post chaise and went in it by the side of the sorgues clear stream till the road was too narrow for the carriage to proceed i then walked in a narrow path winding round the immense rocky mountains to the left with the stream rapidly flying by me to the right about a mile till a cavern pretty much in the shape of those which lions come out of in an opera presented itself to my view and from that flows the river i am told it is an unfathomable abyss why it is called a fontaine i am at a loss to guess  monstrous rocks rise over and on each side of this craggy arch these seem to bend forward to meet or crush the curious  which ever way i turned my eyes i saw gigantic and fantastic shapes which nature seems to have placed there to astonish the gazer with a mixture of the melancholy terrible and cheerful for the clearness and rapidity of the river make it a lively object and where there is a flat place on the banks though not above a few feet in circumference the peasants have planted trees or sowed gardens  you lift up your eyes and see the most perfect contrasts to them  the birds which hovered toward the upper part of the rocks were scarcely perceptible in looking into the cavern it appears horrible and gloomy i could almost have fancied the river ran thus fast rejoiced to quit the mansion from whence it sprung no wonder petrarchs song was plaintive if he courted his muse with this scene perpetually before his eyes love and all his laughing train must fly the human imagination where nature displays her features in the majestic and terrible style and i was very glad to find so good an excuse as this situation for petrarchs eternal complaint  till now i was puzzled to guess how a man of his sense could pass the greatest part of his life in eternizing a ladys contempt of a faithful passion  but i now believe there was no laura  or if there existed one he found in either case his imagination particularly turned to poetry and that of the melancholy kind in this probably his summers residence i who you know  and have as playful a muse as ever smiled upon mortal sat examining the astonishing picture before me with a silent reverential sort of admiration  and should have remained there till night if i had not been informed that it grew very late and i must see the pictures of petrarch and laura in the chateau of the marquis de chamont which is a miserable house a few steps from the fontaine these pictures are very modern  probably as like you as the persons they were drawn for  i returned to lille and eat crawfish and trout the most excellent that i ever tasted which abound in the sorgue  i passed through aix to come to this place i did not stop as i expected a letter at marseilles the contents of which interested me very much for   i saw many plantations of canes which i wonder we do not cultivate in our watermeadows in england  and i bought very excellent melons out of the fields for five sols a piece  a country flowing with wine and oil and where figs and melons are to be gathered on each side of the public road may be a very fine thing but a want of verdure and fine trees gives it a most uncomfortable and ungentlemanlike appearance when i compared england and the scene before me together i could almost have fancied i had the malady du pays upon me  so much did i wish to see a green carpet under my feet and some of our beautiful foliage over my head   adieu dear sir how often i wish to be with you i leave the justice of your heart to determine i remain yours most affectionately   p s i forgot to tell you that while i was changing horses at lille i talked to captain b  a sailor who lives with his wife and two children in that neighborhood  he very civilly invited me to pass the evening at his house talked about my brother g  and informed me that the source of the sorgue was at this time remarkably low and i found by the marks the torrent had left on the rocks when at its height that it must be at least forty feet lower now than when it takes its wintercourse as i saw it it creeps humbly from the cavern under part of the rock and becomes rapid as it finds its level and forms a river whereas when it is in all its glory it tumbles over the rock a wild cascade which must add considerably to its terrific beauties   i was informed by the inhabitants of vaucluse that people who are tired of life fling themselves into the cavern where as i told you before the water is unfathomable upon this information i asked if bodies were often found there i was answered in the affirmative and that they were chiefly the bodies of priests  adieu    p s i never felt any heat like that which i experience here     letter xii marseilles aug        i have examined the rocks just out of this harbor and think some of them most fortunately situated to defend the port but what surprised me much was being assured by the boatmen who row me out twice a day to get a breath of air that at all times of the night boats are suffered to come in and out of the harbor without being examined   people of all nations that fili every day the great walk leading to the quay made me think on my arrival that some important event had drawn all the people from the houses and the ships together  but a repetition of the same scene soon convinced me of my mistake there are two very fine pictures painted by puget representing some of the horrid scenes at the time of the plague at marseilles they are only too well executed i saw several dying figures taking leave of their friends and looking their last anxious kind and wishful prayer on their sick infants that made the tears flow down my cheeks  i was told the physicians and noblemen who were assisting the sick and dying were all portraits i can easily conceive it for in some of the faces there is a look of reflection and concern which could only be drawn from the life   i have spoke to captain  who commands the kingfisher he is obliged to perform quarantine here though he had already done his duty in that way at leghorn and genoa before but the plague rages very much all along the barbary coast from whence he is come and one cannot be surprised at any precaution taken at marseilles to avoid this danger   i do not think marseilles a beautiful town and the country houses in the environs which they call here bastides are frightful  i have just got a note from on board the kingfisher that has been soaked in vinegar the direction is scarcely legible  adieu dear sir the heat is so excessive here that i am absolutely stupefied by it  believe me yours affectionately  letter xiii hyeres aug  0      i stopped in my way here at toulon and intended to look at the dockyards but was refused which surprised me very much as an english lady of my acquaintance was suffered to go into them at the time of the last war with france when her husband and all the gentlemen with her were sent out of the town  i could get no other reason assigned for the refusal but this  that since lord  had seen them nothing of english blood should ever be permitted to go into them so i walked about and all i could see was that the finest ports in the world and ships worthy of being commanded by our admirals will never make at least for a great while to come good sailors of the french  my reasons i will tell you when we meet   mr de s  who refuses to let any english person see the dockyards at toulon expressed a great dislike to our nation saying he had reason you will laugh when i tell you that his reason for hating us is that in the late war two thirds of his squadron were taken with the greatest part of his convoy destined for the east indies and had he not bravely ran away himself he would certainly have fallen a prey to those opiniatres feroces matelots as he calls our sailors   the gentleman who waited upon soulanges to ask permission and plead my cause wishing to recollect what defense mr de soulanges squadron had made asked an officer in the room the name of the french ships which the poor mr de soulanges so bitterly lamented he answered he should recollect them if he heard their names but could not exactly remember   my friend asked if it was  the ville de paris le glorieux  le centaur  lartois  le caton  largonaut  le jason  le rothee  le solitaire  le pegase  here the gentleman stared at him and said le pegase was one of them   soulanges said yes but the foudroyant that took her was one of the largest ships in our navy and commanded by that feroce matelot captain jervais who would attack the devil if he met him at sea but added he jervais could not have taken the pegase unless assisted by other ships   my friend told him the foudroyant was a two decker and carried only six more guns than the pegase and was taken in the war before the last by the english ship the monmouth commanded by captain gardener that carried but    guns  that though he had not the pleasure of being personally known to captain jervais from his public character he was sure he would do his best in time of war to burn sink or take the devil if under french colors  he had a great inclination to have told mr de soulanges what is very well known that captain jervais took the pegase after an action of little more than half an hour without any help whatsoever but his commands to a gallant crew  and that the other sail of the line under soulanges command struck to the queen captain maitland after receiving a single broadside but he thought a repetition of naval actions fairly stated might be painful to many officers who were present and who paid the tribute due to our navy in expressing the highest esteem for it and so took his leave  the pegase in question is the very ship my brother commanded last war i have often been told that she could not sail by the french  but i always assured them that she has profited so much by the trim he gave her that she goes now perfectly well   they have also talked much of the improvement made in their marine the last war but unless it is in the clothing their ships company i cannot find out in what  old english officers have told me they always found their hearts lay in the same place as heretofore  and that whenever they could sail fast enough to get along side of the enemy the business was presently settled  i think i need no better proof of this assertion than one which i hope may stand unaltered in the book of fame for centuries to come it is this  our marine is in part composed of lineofbattle ships taken from our enemies whereas there exists not a power upon the face of the globe that can boast of having in their marine one ship of the line taken from the british nation   i do not doubt but that the ministre de la marine de france and french officers are excellent naval officers in theory  but when that is to be put in practice i hope events will prove that we remember we have no other ramparts to defend our country and our liberties but the ocean and that we ever were are and must be a race of feroces opiniatres matelots  you say amen to this wish i am sure  so remain yours most affectionately  i think the drive from marseilles to toulon is beautiful  the rocks are as stupendous and nearly as fantastic as those about vaucluse and for some miles they are covered with fir trees   you may form some idea of the magnitude of the hills and rocks by my protesting that the trees and a few cottages which adorn them look the first like toothpicks and the latter like the smallest dutch toys  the road winds round most gracefully wherever there was a little valley i saw large flocks of goats  as i came nearer to toulon i began to see many orange and pomegranate trees in the gardens and the caper which is a pretty but stinking creeper grows wild wherever it is permitted to take root   from toulon to hyeres i was gradually apprised of the charming situation of the latter place by the approach to it which grew more and more lovely every step i took  the hedges on the road are composed of myrtle pomegranate and wild vine i passed by several neatlooking white houses the gardens of which are full of large orange trees  the town of hyeres is about a league from the sea placed on the side of a hill i shall wait patiently here for that letter i expected at marseilles  this happy spot is refreshed by seabreezes  and from the elegant cheerfulness which reigns here it might almost tempt one to devote many months to solitude and study  letter xiv hyeres aug         i went up last night on horseback to a chapel situated on a hill near the sea called notre dame de consolation there is a man who calls himself a hermit by name laurent and who by his medical knowledge as he assures me and the assistance of the blessed virgin cures the kings evil i talked to him some time his ignorance and simplicity amused me very much but i pity those who trust to his physical knowledge i gave him some very curious receipts all impromptu as you may guess assuring him among other things that bathing people in aqua fortis was an infallible remedy for the disorder he cured   i desire if ever chance should bring you to hyeres that you will ascend this hill and examine the scenes around toward the sea the islands of portecroix and pourquerolle are beautiful objects and a peninsula called gien which is joined to the land only by a narrow road forms a landscape worthy of a great masters pencil  on looking toward the land mountains on every side whose tops are decorated with firs and rocks alternately and toward the bottom with olive orange and fig trees form a beautiful circle seemingly intended by nature to prevent the sea from extending any farther  at a little distance inland rises the hill on the side of which is built the town of hyeres above the town are seen rocks and remains of the ancient town and wall  i could have sat and looked at all this beautiful scenery for ever but the evening closing sent me home to my harp and my books  yours affectionately   letter xv hyeres aug         i hope the following lines will amuse you for a moment i only wish they may make you laugh as much as i did when i read the french officers melancholy story in prose whosoever he may be should he take offense at my having turned his tragedy into a farce i shall bear his anger patiently when i think that the princes of the house of bourbon all the spaniards lord how and sir george elliot each of whose valor he slights will certainly laugh with me  i have marked the pages where i have literally translated his own phrases that you may not suppose i have invented the strange things he says  and i send you his pamphlet that you may compare the one with the other   verses written at hyeres on reading a pamphlet called lhistoire du siege de gibraltar par un officier de larmee francaise imprimee a cadiz lan      sweet muse

thought of gibraltars rock in vain in awful silence long had stard p   but to attack it never dared l    till a papermerchant offered the duke an immense kite at the tail of which a man in a sack was to ascend and was to pour aquafortis over the officers and soldiers at the parade  i am told that the duke had the kite sent over the rock   himself into the sack the  was lifted off the ground crillon offered gold and pensions for such unheard of newinventions as might this sturdy rock invade for this full many a scheme was laid p   the house of bourbon squadrons manned l    collected armies battries planned these preparations vast and great all europe knew were to defeat p   brave elliot in his snug retreat l   le chevalier darcon whose floating batteries deserved a different fate from what they experienced they were neither executed nor seconded according to his plan i have examined the invention with persons whose judgment i can trust to and am convinced that it is a very good one  and if justice had been done in the execution of them the batteries i do believe were incombustible and insubmersible as he asserted they were but as to their assisting toward taking of gibraltar  from the prudence of the general who defended it i rather think we have to regret and the combined armies to rejoice that they succeeded no better darcon of floating battries spoke great crillon hastened to st roque to take upon him the command of the army both by sea and land p    four hundred workmen under darcon l   whose batteries were made a farce on incessant worked by day and

troops the spaniards wonder raised  so on columbus indians gazed  an english brig of sixteen guns was taken by these stupid dons p    and this unusual thing a prize l    our hopes uplifted to the

cruising l    the english brought the ugly news in of rodneys triumph from the rock of guns our ears received the shock for elliot thought a gallant action l  0 deserved a mark of satisfaction  soon after this four english knaves l    deserted and informed us slaves l    of hope and fear  that elliots troops p    of provender had lost all hopes  l       which raised our spirits made us gay and think all fighting only play then darcon made us move so swift p    his barrels the same chevalier darcon who invented the floating batteries executed an epaulement which he planned within the space of four hours in the dark part of the night between the   th and   th of august      it was called by him the parallel battery but more properly by sir george elliot the sap volante from the rapidity of the execution it was  0 0 toises in length and ten feet in height and breadth formed of sacks and barrels brought to the spot and filled with the sand found there i have seen his own account of the distribution of employment among so great a number of men viz   000 and which proves that he had a clear head to calculate the work so as to prevent confusion and his bags to lift l     that in one night his epaulement l   was formed so thick so long so strong p    that sure if elliot and his men l     could ever be alarmed twas then  the duc de bourbon came to pore l    over darcons work on sea

confused by many a shot by elliots order made red hot  we burned our fingers then we rested in sleep our sad affronts digested our balls now fly round elliots head p  0 but he lay silent as if dead l       in vain we make our bullets dance or sing against the rock  no answer  p   heaven seemed to favor our intent l    the wind to westward firmly bent l    ships of the line full fortyeight of ours bespoke poor elliots fate  at anchor firm before his face resolved no english ship should place or beef or mutton in his dish he food for us or feed on fish gibraltar mute by us struck dumb our triumph now was soon to come  p    alas the wheel is ever turning l     our triumph soon was changed to mourning the floating battries our reliance to set the general at defiance from them by sea to end the matter with showers of balls his rock we spatter he seeing now what most we want is to eternise our new flottantes red bullets sends us by the score that caused such mischief heretofore l

they of the dire despair p    the rage calamity and crime l    that struck us jointly at that time l  0 for thirteen english gunboats came to add fresh fuel to the flame amidst this burning what could save hundreds from the untimely grave for through the fiames no frenchman chose in saving friends to scorch his nose his brethren broiling calmly views rather than singe his beard or shoes but elliot and his men of steel that act so stout can pity feel p    and curtis led the generous crew l    to save the foe with death in view three hundred french and spaniards took and nursed and fed them at the rock with anxious care a care divine l  0 such deeds brave elliot such were thine more to thy glory far it is said p  0 than with hot balls to strike us dead  l    our battries burnt  our spirits

ours from all their anchors tore some were driven near elliots guns who singed the whiskers of the dons too sure there is fire in that head p    he sent us scores of bullets red l    in him twas horrid i declare to take la fortune de la guerre when beat by rain and storms we were in the midst of all this sad confusion the english squadron made intrusion cordova spite of wind and weather p

to france and spain what indignation wonder pain it was to see two more advance and english transports to enhance the horror of our souls aggrieved for thus gibraltar was relieved it was relieved dear france but know not to brave elliot or to how is due the glory of this deed which makes our sorrowing hearts often bleed p    by copper and by coals alone l   their martial courage was made known and if an elliots sacred name with that of honor be the same  to wondering ages yet to come and we were sent like children home  the coals that made his bullets red deserve the wreaths that crown his head  and copperbottomd ships i ween that scud along so neat so clean  secure the active british foe and not the valor of their how  dear friends like me treat with disdain their glory and forget your pain hate honor from your haughty souls that is gained by copper and by coals  and now ye playful dolphins quickly bear across the seas this dismal tale with care at calpes sir george elliot was then at gibraltar foot i charge ye rest a while divert the warrior from his hourly toil  a british hero scarcely can refuse this trifling tribute from an english muse then to the western ocean speed your way nor loiter thoughtless on the biscaynbay  in britains channel once arrived remain and let my countrymen from you obtain your sacred charge  beneath the oaks deep shade my honored friends retired from toil are laid  while they on french description smiles bestow france sows fresh laurels for each english brow mean time with care a myrtlewreath i weave to grace but one sir george elliot  the bravest of the brave you see dear sir i meant to have sent it to sir george elliot i know he has the french pamphlet  but as he may not be so partial to the productions of my muse as you are i am rather content that you should see it  believe me yours most affectionately  letter xvi hyeres august         dear sir i am extremely surprised that invalids who fly to the south in winter do not choose hyeres in preference to montpellier or nice it is true that it is more solitary than either of these places but i am sure by the accounts i have had of the last its lying gossiping mischievous style of the society must be a most horrid thing for nerves shaken by illness there is an uncommon clearness in the air here the islands appear to the eye to be not above three miles distant and i am assured they are seven leagues  provisions are excellent here particularly fish among these the johndory and the red mullet are of an amazing size and excellent i thought the dory was called the dorade but it is called the poisson de st pierre and the dorade of which there is plenty is a very indifferent fish  they spoil the red mullet by constantly pulling out the livers the land is too precious here to be spared for building yet there are houses enough to lodge several families   there is very seldom any rain at hyeres and the rides of the environs are the most beautiful that your imagination can form  particularly one toward the residence of a mr glapiere de st tropes  who has near his house a beautiful large valley between the mountains which he might with little expense turn into a charming park with a river running through it  you most not suppose from the want of rain here that there is no verdure or that the orangegardens look burnt by the sun the natives of this happy spot are extremely ingenious in turning every little spring that comes from the mountains and these springs are numerous over their fields and gardens so that the constant want of rain here is the very reason why every vegetation never fails of being refreshed perpetually   put all these circumstances together with another which i think must weigh with every reasonable person out of their own country which is that provisions are very cheap and you will agree with me that hyeres is a very good place for an invalid to pass a winter in   i am setting out for antibes having received the information i waited for   i remain yours most truly e c   letter xvii antibes aug         most part of the road from hyeres to this place is very mountainous and narrow so i rode along the greatest part of it   i find here an ancient work of the romans it is an aqueduct which a colonel daquillon imagined might be restored to its former use of bringing water to the town at a small expense he met with much opposition and ingratitude from the very people to whom it could be of use but i am told he has obtained a pension and a monument is intended to be erected to his honor  i believe there is no nation but ours that waits for a persons death to show some sign of satisfaction  for the benefit derived from their superior talents   if vaubans plan had been followed for this port it would have been one of the finest in the mediterranean  as it is at present none but vessels of the lightest burden can enter   i have hired a felucca a long narrow boat with three shoulderofmuttonsails and ten oars in which i mean to go from hence to leghorn  i have talked so much lately to you about orangegardens that you may fairly suppose i passed much of my time in them but indeed i have not for they are far from being comfortable things to be in though magnificent to look at from a little distance there is one and not a very large garden at hyeres that brings the proprietor in fifteen hundred pounds sterling a year i was taken to see it upon my arrival  but the ground is so precious in these gardens that none is to be spared for walks  so that i was forced to creep among the orange trees as i could like any other earthly reptile   the spaniards and algerines having lately made a peace i am informed i run some risk of being taken by a barbary corsair as the algerines turn their spirit of piracy on all other vessels but spanish at present  however i cannot say i am the least afraid since the very fears of my italian sailors will prevent them from going farther from the shore than what is absolutely necessary for sailing   adieu dear sir i remain yours   letter xviii genoa sept        i got no farther than monaco last night where i looked over the old castle which stands perpendicularly upon a rock from the sea  the prince was absent he is adding a salle de compagnie to his chateau which it wants very much  the building being ancient and irregular he has taken most of the fine pictures to paris as his people told me and i was shown a modern cornish in stucco one of adams designs executing as a great curiosity though it was none to me as we have such in most of our parlours in england  there are the remains of some fine painting eu fresque in the court  the room the poor duke of york died in is one of the most melancholy i ever saw the very bed had a gloomy look but indeed all the apartments are dark and dismal  the prince has three houses for his own residence at a small distance from each other on this coast  monaco moncobron and menton  his possessions do not seem very fertile from whence probably arises an italian distich my boatmen repeated so often in going up to monaco that i could not avoid retaining it in english it is  monaco upon a rock neither sows nor reaps but lives on others property  they added that part of his revenue consisted in a tribute which all small vessels pay in going from france to italy that is all but the french who are exempt from this tax which by the bye i saw no other method of exacting but a miserable little vessel of his i saw in the port which they told me went after the others who might refuse to pay it   there were arms and ammunition for forty thousand men sent in there by small quantities at a time for fifteen months past  from france   monacos prince from his connection with french families and his frequenting versailles is become i suppose though a sovereign prince only a tool of that court  these private military preparations are conveniently placed for italy monaco being within fourandtwenty hours sail of any italian port north of leghorn here i found the great use of my new traveling bed  the feet which are of iron are placed in tin cups full of water and a zinzaliere or gauze curtain with no opening to it that lets down over me prevented my being devoured by gnats and every other sort of biting stinging vermin   i can conceive nothing pleasanter than having a clean comfortable english yatcht with four or five sensible people to go with into italy coasting as i do  the scenery is beautiful  nice which i passed by is a fine object the sky too is so clear every thing seems to conspire in making this voyage delightful  but alas in a felucca it is too true what the late lord d  said that you never come out of one without feeling all alive as soon as the heat of the sun goes off with the approach of the evening these italian sailors make a horrid noise too they sing it is true not unharmoniously but for two hours nay more the same bymn to the virgin  now and then interspersed with a lively ballad  so that the still part of the evening which at sea particularly invites to contemplation or conversation is ruffled by the gaiety of these poor fellows  i am at present in a very good inn the golden stag  and every thing i see here is so unlike any thing i ever saw before that i am at the window gaping like a countrymiss that is in london for the first time in her life   when i have gaped to some purpose you shall profit by it   i now wish you and  a good night   yours affectionately   letter xix genoa sept         this town is oddly situated  it is so much confined between the sea and high mountains the churches convents and their gardens take up so much room that mercantile people can scarcely find habitations the palaces are extremely fine but so lofty and the streets so narrow that to see the outside of the houses i think one should lie down in the middle of a street  i never saw any thing more truly magnificent than some of the palaces the pillars and staircases of which are all marble  you may judge of the solidity of these buildings some of them are seven and eight hundred years old  i saw one staircase the altering of which cost twenty thousand pounds it is well worth any persons while to come here who loves fine pictures  in most of the palaces there are some  a few of the palaces have large collections and in these printed catalogues of them  i have had the greatest pleasure in looking at some  there are two vandykes in one of the brignoli palaces that i think invaluable the man is on a gray horse the lady his wife is a whole length  there is as much grace and beauty in her face and figure as his pencil could express   all the magnificence of the genoese is confined to their palaces by their laws they cannot have gold either on their clothes carriages or liveries the chief amusement of ladies here is walking the streets in the evening with their sedanchair and several servants behind them accompanied by one or more gentlemen  it is very much the fashion likewise for every person who can afford it to have one or several countryhouses  as they call them but the situations of them perched about the steep rocks gives me but little idea of the country the people in general do not look healthy  all the women wear what is called a mezzaro viz about two yards or more of black silk or chintz wrapped about their heads and shoulders instead of a cloak it is extremely graceful if well put on every woman has an opportunity of hiding a defect or showing a beauty as they may conceal one eye the throat the forehead the chin or in short suffer those they meet to see only what they choose to display the mezzaro too has a great convenience which is that a woman can so hide herself in it that she may walk all over the town unknown this mezzaro is particularly advantageous to a person with fine shoulders and eyes there are but two streets in the town where carriages can go so that sedan chairs or walking are the principal methods of going from one place to another   the females among the lower class disgusted me much by their headdress  their hair is strained up to a point on the top of their head and fastened to a pin  judge what a figure an old greyheaded or bald woman must make   i cannot help thinking this once flourishing republic notwithstanding the opulence of some of its noble families is becoming very fast a dependent on or a creature of the court of france some of their nobles marry into french families  and soon lose their fortune and their patriotic ideas in the extravagance and servility of that court  corsica is a melancholy proof of this opinion   of the two noble genoese to whom i had letters the lady is dead and the gentleman is not here so that i have announced myself no where as i would not be detained here longer than just to see the churches and pictures and though i should have been pleased to have seen the manner of living of the genoese nobles i would not upon any account get into a train of ministers dinners and visits   i have been much surprised to see a black virgin and child in one of the churches here unless it be to tempt negroes to turn christians i cannot conceive why they suffer it to remain   i have been on board the galeres  and if the variety of very fine pictures have delighted me the sight of heavy chains and so many human beings enduring slavery for years has shocked me beyond description yet they do not look unhappy and i think servitude a more rational punishment for some crimes than death but slavery to an english mind i suppose must be very horrible by what i feel   yesterday two algerine slaves came to my apartment to sell slippers the oldest of the two was one of the handsomest brown men with the best countenance i ever saw he has been a slave fiveandtwenty years and is suffered to go about without the usual attendant which is a man with a stout stick in his hand who follows the slaves who walk about the town chained together always in pairs   when i thought upon the fate of this old man guilty of no crime a prisoner of war his looks so noble and so honest i wept and wished i might have had interest enough with the doge and senate of genoa to have sent him home to algiers   these sort of pictures in real life are of a dark hue i must therefore again turn to those i have seen in the palaces i confess i should not dislike to pass three winter months here to examine them at leisure and copy a few there is a bust of vitellius in one of the palaces for which i am assured the duke of marlborough offered to give its weight in gold the sum must necessarily have been very large for the bust is so massy that it probably weighs above half any other marble statue but it does much honor to the dukes taste as the work is perfect and much likewise to the possessor to prize so highly what deserves so well to be esteemed i have been offered any price i choose to ask for a chestnut suffolkhorse here the stable it is in is crowded every day and it grieves some of the genoese very much that i will not part with him but i think a good womans horse is so difficult to be had that i never can understand how any person can part with one   adieu my dear sir  believe me   letter xx pisabaths sept         i set out again in a felucca intending to land at leghorn but contrary winds or calms became so tiresome to me that i landed at an italian port called via regia had my coach taken out and set out by land for this place i have passed through a forest of oaks belonging to the grand duke  some of these oaks are the largest and finest looking timber trees i ever saw i am assured here the wood is not hard and good like our english oak if so i suppose it is affected by the climate   i could not help reflecting in one of the finest palaces at genoa on the want of unity and order the two principles on which good taste is founded that is ever discovered in the dress and ornaments of all kinds which foreigners have   i had passed through an immense suite of rooms each more magnificent than the other when coming into the bedchamber of the mistress of the house her dress which she had pulled off the night before even her bracelets and rings lay upon a table and i can with truth assert no villagegirl could have adorned herself with more mean ordinary paltry finery than was exhibited the heir to this noble house a child of about two years old that had taken a fancy to my looks and accompanied me through the apartments was dressed likewise in a coarse colored linen   these circumstances were such contrasts to the house that it brought to my mind a hundred examples of the like in france where often to get at the most elegant salle de compagnie you are obliged to pass through a dirty antichamber where you are forced to hold up your petticoats that you may not sweep in to the inner rooms a load of filth in the streets you meet a magnificent carriage attended by servants in costly liveries drawn by a pair of doghorses the harness of which a hackneycoachman would not use with us and frequently at paris the finest hotels have their architecture disgraced by the black funnel of a temporary chimney running out at a window or through a cornice   these incongruities cannot be imagined nor believed but by those that have seen them with us cleanliness constitutes our first elegance and fitness of things is next considered and i believe it is the combination of these two circumstances which enchants foreigners of sense and parts so much in england   the grand duke and duchess are here so that the apartments usually let out to company are taken up by them and their suite   i have hired a comfortable house here by the week these baths first built by the roman emperors are kept in excellent repair and well they may for the bathing is excessively dear   there is a public room at the palace where the company assemble about nine in the evening the heat in the day is excessive all the italians lie down and sleep after dinner and get up to dress about six walk afterward and meet in the great room i met the grand duchess last night with another lady i had not the least idea who she was being followed by a single footman in gray she looked at me with the greatest attention and curtsied very civilly i curtsied and stared at her from her extreme likeness to my cousin of witty memory the late lady t   i was pestered to death with questions about my harp at night i find a harp with pedals is a very rare thing in italy and an english person meets with homage little short of adoration the very shopkeepers and peasants look in my face and say  cara  cara inglese   these baths are very good for palsies paralytic disorders gout rheumatism and scrophulous complaints pisa and lucca are near pisa i find the grand duke prefers to florence i should think an invalid might pass a comfortable winter here   hoping that you may never come here as one i finish this letter   yours affectionately   letter xxi pisabaths sept         i have rode over to pisa where i have been much entertained the cathedral the baptistery and the campo santo are well worthy a voyage from england   the leaning tower which you may probably have seen or at least read and heard many accounts of is a proof among many others that in all ages fancy is too often mistaken for taste  it has the appearance of patchwork from the variety of orders of architecture displayed in the pillars which stand in rows one above the other from the base to the top  as to the learned in building pretending to say the tower was built leaning only to show the excellence of the workmanship they certainly delude themselves or desire to impose upon credulous persons  there are many proofs of the ground having sunk one infallible according to my judgment and that is the first row of pillars being above half buried in the earth  this tower stands by itself  some paces from it i entered the cathedral through brass doors brought from jerusalem representing in relievo the history of christ  but i would prefer the possession of one panel of the folding doors on the opposite side of the cathedral to the whole of these for the modern relievo executed by john of bologna is full of grace and nature while the ancient seems chiseled out by an awkward carpenter  there is a beautiful urn placed on a pillar on the outside of the church which was shown formerly as the cup which measured the tribute paid to caesar  but that mistake is now rectified and the true ancient use restored to it  it contained the ashes of some illustrious personage  a fine sarcophagus is likewise placed at the door of the cathedral as a monument to the comtesse matilda  who was sovereign of this country  and is said piously to have added much to the magnificence of these buildings  but the croisades have afforded their most curious relics   i refer you to books for a precise and minute account of all that is to be seen in this vast and magnificent cathedral i have only time to give you a few observations   the chief altar is composed mostly of lapis lazuli and all that is rare and costly  some of the pictures are fine but the cathedral is too dark to permit them to be seen to advantage  at the lower end is a handsome sarcophagus to the memory of the emperor henry vii who was poisoned by a priest at the holy table with a consccrated wafer   i quitted the cathedral to go into the baptistery a building standing like the tower at a small distance from the cathedral it is shaped like a handsome bell  the first and second row of pillars on the outside of this one above the other are in a good style but the man dying without leaving a drawing or plan of his intentions toward the finishing the upper part is finished in the gothic style and ill done   there are granite pillars at the entrance very fine indeed   the front is very remarkable it is immensely large of white marble beautiful mosaic sculpture in different pannels which surround the outside  and the design of every one differs from the others so that there are not two alike   the sculpture too of the pulpit is very fine it represents a groupe of personages  i was told they were all portraits  many of the faces are ridiculous caricaturas  but some barbarous travelers have plucked off several of the heads a thing easily done by a strong hand as they are not so large as my fist when doubled if you have never seen that you may guess at the size from what i say   the campo santo is earth brought from jerusalem which had the singular property of destroying the dead bodies put into it fourandtwenty hours after they had lain there it was the buryingplace of the noble pisans when pisa was a flourishing republic at present no use is made of it it is an oblong square built round with a cloister the length is three hundred and fifty feet in the center is deposed the holy earth round which reign gothic arches forming doors and windows these arches are so light and simple that they seem to hold together by magic power and if any thing could reconcile me to the gothic these arches would against the wall on the opposite side from the cloister there are the remains of a painting en fresque upon the plaster which is very fine  this plaster or stucco is broken off in several places and discovers that the outlines of the painting were done upon the wall besore the stucco was laid on this appears perfectly incomprehensible as the stucco is thick and can never have been transparent  but i am affured that the red lines underneath which appear to me to be common chalk pencil were done with a composition which pierced through the stucco when wet in a faint line the only way of accounting for this singular circumstance  i confess the drawing on the wall is done with so much more freedom and boldness than the painting expresses that i wished all the stucco fallen off that i might see all the spirit of the design at once  as i walked back through the town i was shown an ugly strangeshaped tower where ugolino and his innocent family were starved to death  as i looked at it i thought that if every man in these days who did not exert his utmost abilities to save his country was starved to death there might be formed a large regiment of good cooks wanting employment   the grass grows in every street in the town a melancholy proof of the sad reverse this city exhibits to that picture it once gave the admiring world   there are many remarkable mouments placed in the cloisters of the campo santo the king of prussia has erected one in memory of algarotti  i cannot possibly give you a list of them  i only mean to be your finger post just to point out to you what is worth seeing if chance or choice should lead you this way   i was shown several curious statues and pillars in the streets till night only as usual sent me home   adieu dear sir believe me most affectionately   letter xxii pisabaths sept  0      since i wrote last i have been to see lucca  a virgin republic for it has never lost its liberty the motto over the gates or wherever it can be placed is libertas the territories belonging to it are only fortysix miles long from st pellegrins to the pisan mountains and nineteen from via regia to porquetto the half of which town belongs to the tuscan dominion   lucca is extremely well fortified crowds of people in the street and a look of opulence among the bourgeoisie prove the good effect of their motto the oil is remarkably good here i was shown the cathedral which has nothing very remarkable in it but a circular chapel the shape of which is pleasing and it has four statues of the apostles good i was told this chapel dedicated to the virgin was transported in one night entire from another church at some distance the figure of the virgin i could not see it was covered up she wears constantly golden slippers and there is a skull of one of the senators of lucca who was hung for stealing one of them though he declared that she flung it at him as he was praying at her feet for more wealth   i met in the inn  whom i certainly should not have recollected again his countenance is so altered i believe the muses should not marry and he certainly is one   there is something romantic and pittoresque in the manner of training the vines here in the low grounds they twine round the trees which surround the little enclosures and hang in festoons from one tree to another the oxen too are of a particular kind very large and of no other color but a light gray in a small field i have seen these yoked to a plough preparing one corner of it for corn while the rest was filled with melons olive and fig trees i am told the sun is powerful enough to bring the fruits of the earth to perfection through the branches of the trees if so they are extremely careless in making their wine there is little or none to be bought good   i do not know what people mean by saying italy is a beautiful country a want of fine trees and turf makes it in general very ugly if travelers would content themselves with saying that in italy a person who is passionately fond of the fine arts might find constant amusement i believe the praise would be just but when led by their enthusiasm for them they say italy is the finest country in the world they prepare many people as easy in their faith as i am to be as much disappointed as i have been   a lady on a sidesaddle is an object of great wonder here the peasants who pass me on the right hand when i am on horseback the women particularly say poverina  jesu maria  povera  una gambia   they actually fancy i have one leg only their stare of concern always makes me laugh and then they add cara to their lamentations in a day or two i shall set out for florence from whence i shall write to you i confess i long to see the venus de medicis and the niobe family i do not envy the grand duke his sovereignty but his collection of perfections i confess i should like to share with him   adieu  yours affectionately   letter xxiii florence sept         i hope you do not expect a very rational letter from me as i have been three days successively to see the statues and pictures and am so much delighted with them that i am at a loss how to give you an account of my feelings otherwise than by telling you that while i am in the tribune the vulgar idle tale of real life never once comes into my mind and i feel quite happy and if till now i have been sorry often when i have felt conscious of having nice feelings or what is commonly called taste at this moment i am extremely glad of it i think and dream of nothing but the statues from the time i leave them till i see them again so till a few days repetition of the same sights has familiarized my head to them i shall content myself with telling you two little adventures i have had which may prove to you i have neither lost my eyesight nor my pleasantry upon occasions which fret and anger others   i set out from the pisa baths on the   d in the afternoon i sent on my coach and some of my servants two posts and went on horseback myself when i got about half way i passed by a gentleman in an english phaeton whose curiosity i suppose was awakened by an english horse and sidesaddle from an uncommon slow trot he flew after me full gallop i was warned of this frightful operation by my servant and had just time to turn my horse into a gateway he could not stop his horses immediately but being determined to see me as soon as he could he pulled up and went as slow as it was possible i thought this so impertinent that i determined on my part that he should not see me so i desired the person who accompanied me to follow me and i passed by the left side of the phaeton as fast as my horse could go with my hat and head so low that the foolish man could not see me my horse is a most excellent and fleet one and i kept him on till my pursuer gave up the chase and i then when out of his sight turned into a farmyard and hid myself till i saw the phaeton pass again so i positively got to my carriage without being seen by this curious gentleman   the man at the post house upon my asking for something to drink brought me a bottle of white wine which he told me he had made himself and which he would have given to no one but me it was the very best white i ever tasted since i drank vin darbois with which henry quatre used to drink to his fair gabrielle but i mixed it with water parcequil faut que les dames mettent un peu deau dans leur vin   the man was quite offended at my offering to pay for it   so i thanked him with one of my best smiles and got into my coach where i had not been above two hours before i was fast asleep and waked only to see the walls of florence which do not seem calculated to defend it from any enemies but those which smuggling might create to the tuscan sovereigns purse   i went to meggits inn and got into bed about four oclock in the morning i have the same apartment my mother and lady louisa h  occupied  when there  the next day the first thing i did was to go and see the venus de medicis i was shown a youthful figure opposite as an apollo and after i had examined it some time i asked why it was called an apollo does not eccelenza see says the guide his attribute the lyre i do returned i but that is modern to the statue i made my observation the man laughed you are perfectly right said he and i do not know any other reason for its being an apollo than because probably that god was thought a proper companion for the venus but how did you know those pieces were resstored said he i told him from some observations i had made upon other fine works of that sort   however this statue is very pleasing but i do not think it has the commanding look of the god of day i looked at the face with delight for about the nose and upper lip it put me in mind of my dear son william who probably is now nearly as tall   it is lucky for my friends that i have that son and some others for in the humor i am in i could almost be tempted to remain a prisoner for life upon condition my cacbot was the tribune and i would ask for no other company than the heavenly inanimate figures in it their silence is so much more eloquent than language their forms so harmonious i think you begin not to understand me and as i am not at all certain if your ear and your eye agree together as mine do i will not attempt to explain what may be felt but not described so i beg you would recollect i did not promise this letter should be perfectly rational and i believe i am in my sober senses when i have courage to end my rhapsody   i remain yours affectionately  p s apropos on looking over my letter i find that i have forgot to tell you the only object i took notice of from my coach going to florence was the moon it put me in mind of what mr de caraccioli says que la lune de naples valait bien le soleil d angleterre however our english sun has but one fault notwithstanding the marquiss witty remark and that is the same that an english mind has  peeping through a cloud too often the venus suited the ideas i had formed of her but the niobe family surpassed them there is a horse belonging to that which is not placed in the room with them and which certainly was held by the bridle by one of the sons every thing else seems to be in perfect order     letter xxiv florence october         this city is very clean and cheerful the streets are paved with large flat pieces of rock unlike any other pavement i have seen and much smoother fine statues and relievos in marble stand in the squares and angles of streets without having any thing to protect them but the respect the very lowest people have for them  sir horace mann lord cowper the prince corsini the lucca minister comte santini and the comte dalbany give great dinners here to all foreigners of distinction but the florentine noblesse never invite any one to dine or sup at their houses  when they give an entertainment it is an assembly where every creature that can call itself a gentleman or gentlewoman can easily go  i was at one the other night given on account of a wedding and though it was but a few paces from our english ministers house all his carriages horses and servants paraded with flambeaux to the house  i went in one of his coaches with him  the mistress of the house and bride stood at the door to receive every body and curtsey to them as they passed  the number of rooms opened and illuminated upon such an occasion is incredible  i was told in this house there were eleven rooms which were not seen because they were not finished  i could not help observing that all the handsome florentines are very like the english an effect perhaps of the great partiality the italian ladies have for my country people what i mean is that as they have constantly so many english people here their looking at them constantly may very naturally occasion the likeness   the italian ladies are very goodhumored which is more than i can say for their neighbors the french and they have likewise more natural civility to strangers for they do not stare at them and whisper to one another so as to leave no doubt to the anglaise that her dress is criticized but they speak to her and if they remark any thing new to them they do not tell her ce nest pas alamode  but they suppose it is the fashion of the country she is come from   the sovereign might make florence a paradise but he keeps no court  there is nothing about his manner of living that betrays either the gaiety or magnificence that naturally belong to royalty  any person whose rank suits presentation might be presented to the grand duke or duchess but i shall certainly not be so for sovereigns like the sun should cheer with their rays the people who look up to them and when they choose to hide those rays in a corner strangers must be very foolish to go and seek them out disturb their privacy and gain neither pleasure nor amusement by it florence swarms with english  the operas here are very indifferent   in the palaces here there are generally several indifferent pictures mixed with a few good ones  there are two apostles out of four painted by carlo dolci in the palazzo riccardi which i think invaluable there is a muse by the same in the palazzo corsini   the grand duke has just purchased from the dini family a picture done by guercino da cento and placed it in the tribune it is an endymion sleeping the sweetness and beauty of the countenance are enchanting but guercino was so taken up with the mortal that he has represented the goddess in one corner of the sky like the paring of of a nail however this new purchase is well worthy a place in the tribune it cost the grand duke not quite an hundred guineas   i have been obliged again to assure the french at the french ministers table the other day that sir george elliot was not born of french parents   sternes adventure about yorick i have now good reason to believe was a fact for i was asked too by a frenchman if sir joshua reynolds did not build st pauls i think frenchmen should never quit paris for they do not choose to be acquainted with the chronology or genealogies of any other nation but their own the only thing which seems to delight the french minister here is that the bridge over the arno which is just before his windows puts him in mind of the pontneuf at paris the only observation i have ever heard him make upon the beauties of this town   judge of my surprise the other morning meggit came running in haste to my apartments to assure me that lord b  would be here in two or three days he was at venice he said and produced a letter to prove his assertion but as i thought i was more likely to have intelligence than he was and as the name was not spelt right i contented myself with telling him to reserve as long as he could an apartment adjoining to mine then empty and promised him i should endeavor to make him lodge there though my brother wrote me word he should have une maison montee if he should pass the winter in italy but i think it will be less trouble for him and me to be here if florence is the place he fixes in   there is a charming ride here about a mile from the town in a wood of the grand dukes called the cashins where the ladies walk or go in phaetons called here birhes  but its chiefbeauty the most enormous firs i ever beheld are now felling  there is also a dairy where cream milk and butter are sold at a royal price indeed there is an excellent invention in it to keep the milk sweet in this hot climate the pans are placed in a trough or frame full constantly of fresh water which runs in at one end and out at the other  talking of inventions too i wonder why in all great cities they do not copy one from the clock in the piazza di gran duca here the figures showing the hour are transparencies with a light behind them so that in the darkest night the sober citizen can see what hour of the night it is   lucca giordanos painting en fresque here i admire though he was called fa presto because he ended in three weeks what most painters would have been two years about but the genius that could produce such effect by drawing in so short a time has that freedom and grace which the precision attendant on study seldom can give   miss davies is here and i am very sorry she does not sing at the opera for her voice and manner please me more than any thing i have heard here   yours affectionately  p s the titian venus and the child by titian in the strozzi palace are both much impaired by time very soon the copies will be invaluable because necessarily all the beauties of the originals must vanish     letter xxv bologna nov         i received about a week since a letter from lord b  informing me that he could not pass this winter in italy so i immediately determined my course and it is north now i am on the wing i will see courts and people that few women have seen as i may never have an opportunity of traveling again and i will make the best use of my time few as the months are i can allow myself to run about in i will employ them i hope to my satisfaction and your amusement   i stopped my coach to look at the flame which issues constantly from the ground about four miles from fillegara mr dutens mentions it in his itinerary from florence to fillegara the road winds round one brown mountain to another but today the landscape improved much on my approaching loianc some spots were not unworthy the pencil of salvator rosa  there is a beautiful descent of a mile and a half to pianoro i there got upon my horse and rode to this place and i can never believe it is ten miles from pianoro here which i am assured it is i lodge at the locando reale a large inn the mistress of which assured me the princess czartoriska was in bologna but it proves to be the princess lubomirska her sisterinlaw whom i do not know i have only time to tell you if you should ever pass through this city that you must ask to see the palazzo zampieri the church of st giovanni in monte and a few others this is a clean looking town but i do not comprehend the dialect i had accustomed myself to the tuscan manner of substituting the h for the c but here i do not conceive what letters they put in the place of those which they ought to pronounce   i can tell you no more at present i mean to get to venice as soon as possible from thence to vienna and i afterward intend to proceed to warsaw and petersburgh i take the advantage of the winter in hopes i may go on a sledge the greatest part of my road for i hate the jumbling of a coach though mine is as easy as possible pray do not make yourself unhappy concerning the delicacy of my constitution and the dread of pulmonary affections for i assure you i have neither had a pain in my breast nor spit blood since i quitted the environs of paris which makes me suppose the air of that part of france did not agree with me and i hope the frequent change of air i am taking will strengthen my constitution so that i shall never have any returns of those ugly complaints it is now four months since i was last troubled with them adieu dear sir believe that the greater the distance is between me and the objects of my affection the more i am anxious to hear from them so write often to your affectionate sister   letter xxvi venice nov         i stopped for a moment at cento to see the picture which is called guercinos chef doeuvre he was born there and is buried in the cathedral from thence i proceeded to ferrara my road to which i advise none to go by night the country all about is so low and flat that the road to be passable is raised upon a causeway with nothing to prevent your horses from rolling down on one side or the other it is extremely narrow likewise ariosto who was born and died at ferrara did not gallop his pegasus or invoke his muse in the clay and among the dismal poplars to be seen in the small fields thereabouts i went about three miles an hour i slept at ferrara and among twenty things served up to my table at supper i could eat nothing but celery in italy cinnamon is an ingredient they put into every dish which i have a mortal aversion to woodcocks stewed in sugar and chickens roasted till they are as hard and as dry as wood  voila la cuisine   i embarked with my coach in a very good boat at a place called francolino and was rowed down the po i had a fine clear sky and did not feel that i was in the month of november from the po i came into a canal and from thence into the brenta a pretty but narrow river except the sorgue it was the only clear stream i had looked into since i had left my native thames i heard much of the beautiful villas on the borders of the brenta but i saw none that gave me the idea of elegance or beauty on the outside   a mile before i arrived at fusino a village where i was obliged to leave my coach and saddlehorses i passed a lock which separates the salt water from the fresh and there quitted the land going five miles across the sea intermixed with flat sands to get into the great canal at venice i had just read the abbe coyer who says rome est batie par les hommes mais venise par les dieux and i had formed some idea of it from the pictures i had seen and expected to see a gay clean looking town with quays on each side of the canals but was extremely disappointed the houses are in the water and look dirty and uncomfortable on the outside the fine palaces have most of them above half their windows shut up by dirty shutters not painted  the innumerable quantity of gondolas too that look like swimming coffins added to the dismal scene and i confess venice on my arrival struck me rather with horror than with pleasure but now that i am accustomed to a gondola have seen the inside of the casini and have trusted to my own eyes about several things i cannot say i dislike venice in the least the whole scene is unlike any thing i could have imagined i walk all the morning and that is the best way of seeing the town and people there are narrow passages that you arrive at from one to another by bridges which cross the small canals the famed rialto is built across the large canal the arch of which is very noble and light but there are three distinct passages over it formed by rows of shops the tops of which are so heavy that they disfigure this fine bridge very much you may walk quite from one end of venice to the other the extraordinary figures i saw in the piazza san marco would tempt one to believe it is a bal masque en plein air we are not now in the time of the carnaval but i meet as many men in black dominos and masks as without them these are the noble venetians who constantly watched by the statespies dare not go about unmasked for if an ambassadors servant or a minister or consul of any other nation was seen speaking to a noble venetian he might be imprisoned the laws are so excessively strict upon this subject that the corpse diplomatique are confined extremely in their society and i am amazed any gentleman can accept of an embassy to a place where the natives must avoid them as if they were infected with the plague  strangers pass their time well here for nothing can be more sociable civil and magnificent than the ministers are to one another and strangers presented to them   the casini are very small houses hired by one person or a set of people to meet in of an evening where cards conversation tea coffee lemonade etc and a well selected society conspire to give pleasure these casini are fitted up with an elegance of which you can form no idea i have dined in one which has so fine a view from it that from the neatness and taste of the inside and of the magnificence of the objects on the without i could almost have fancied a little fairys palace venice seems to me to be a new world retired and different from any other i have seen the venetian ladies are some of them very handsome and a few of them are most remarkably determined in their resolutions it is not an uncommon thing here for a lady married in the morning to declare to her parents before night that she has taken an aversion to her husband who upon such an occasion is forced with the parents to apply to the great master of the church the pope who is always good enough to admit of the reasons given him as sufficient to grant a divorce the lady once out of her convent bears the name of her own family in the world and the gentleman looks out for another wife   nothing is more frequent here than to see a venetian lady quit her palace for months together to live in a casino of which the husband perhaps does not even know the situation i could divert you extremely with some venetian anecdotes but i have no leisure to make this letter much longer for between my venetian acquaintance and the ambassadors i have scarcely time to breathe the comte justiniani was delighted to see me again he has promised to accompany me to the arsenal which is extremely large and where the man who showed it to me was pleased to say the state was building frigates of a hundred guns each and twenty such lies the ancient families of venice are the most pure noblesse in italy and that idea together with their natural spirit and extraordinary situation will produce many brave and gallant soldiers among them whenever a good cause calls them into the field   adieu dear sir i have three gondolas waiting at my door for me so i quit my pen   letter xxvii venice nov         i have been to see the doges palace and the church in the piazza san marco both gothic and what is very shocking to the eye the fine bronze horses brought from constantinople are perched over the door of the church books will inform you more minutely than i can of the pictures to be seen in venice the council chamber is a very fine room but all the paintings in it are dirty i went likewise into the court of justice because every body was running to hear lavocato stephano and i thought from the grimaces and gesticulations italians make use of in common conversation some entertainment might be expected from one upon an occasion where art would naturally produce action nor was i deceived nothing can be more comic than what i saw  his pleading was scolding  and his two thumbs which he had stuck upright and moved very quickly from and near his breast was perhaps the most ridiculous action that ever was imagined nor can i conceive how any persons much less the judges could keep their countenances  it is impossible for you to imagine any thing more entertaining than the piazza san marco people of every nation and in dresses i never saw and indeed never can see but at venice are lounging in the shops and coffeehouses and it is a great amusement to me as i walk there every morning but i never stay long for they read english in my looks and their love for any thing of that nation is so great that they will come from the other end of the piazza to look at an english woman   there are two fine lions at the door of the arsenal in marble brought from the entrance of the piraean port it is a pity i cannot make them speak they might tell me many things i want to know about athens   the house i lodge in is miserably cold it is upon the grand canal  and as the glaziers here seldom put putty to the panes of glass the winds come in this damp seaair agrees perfectly well with me  provisions are very good here every lady seems determined to be amused and cheerful and i think i could pass a very merry winter here there are several theaters and i have been to an opera  very good the russian ministers wife is madame de  s daughter a very young and very amiable modest woman the ministers wife from vienna is likewise extremely sensible and polite and her husband the best man in the world and i must not forget for the honor of our country madame de  who from her charming disposition and talents i absolutely love so much that it will be a grief to me to part with her the russian ministers wife often talks to me of stowe in raptures though she was quite a child when she passed some days there   mr emos floating batteries are much spoken of here i understand they were five hours and a half before the forts of golleta so i have desired a receipt to make them and i have it as exactly to be copied as any receipt to make a good pie i shall give it to g b  who being a professor in the art of war may present to our enemies a dish of the same sort of his making whenever occasion requires he should treat them according to their deserts   i must tell you a most ridiculous thing that has happened to two english travelers that are here now and advise every gentleman who cannot speak german not to travel in germany without a companion or servant that knows the language these gentlemen not having either were in great haste to arrive at venice from vienna they left a large town they had slept at over night one morning and after traveling post for two days found themselves drove into the very town they had quitted eightandforty hours before if they hate the motion of a carriage as i do i can easily guess how angry they must have been   i am advised to take a new road to vienna as the best i shall write from thence i hope soon as i do not mean to proceed in a retrograde motion  so with all kind wishes to your fireside   i remain  yours affectionately  letter xxviii vienna dec         i came as i told you i was advised by a new road but i should imagine from the difficulties i met with it was the worst it is true some of them were owing to rivers which swelled by the late rains are become torrents which have carried whole villages and many miles of the road before them   i set out from venice on the  0th of last month going by water to mestre where my coach and horses met me i meant that night to have slept at mr  at cornegliano but the weather was so bad that i was obliged to stay at a village called trevisa where there is an excellent and clean inn the next day i endeavored to cross the river but the boatmen would not venture over though i had my coach embarked and would have gone myself knowing i was expected by mr  so i was obliged to return to the good inn  where i was surprised to see what i thought a fine large chicken served up to my table which upon cutting i found to have brown flesh i asked what it was and was answered  una colombina  it was a pigeon i begged to see one alive or at least with the feathers on for it must have been a most extraordinary sight but the people seemed more astonished at my admiration of this bird than i was at the size of it for it is the common pigeon there   the next day the rain and wind being somewhat abated i got to cornegliano and you may imagine the real pleasure i was received with by a countryman who had not seen me for many years and that in my own house in the country i never was more delighted in my life than by the music i heard there his eldest daughter a child about seven years old plays on the harpsichord with a taste and feeling at which few people more advanced in age and music ever arrive her sister too an infant of five years of age played and sung her part afterward wonderfully for her years   in the evening many of the venetian noblesse came to partake of the concert and see the donna inglese among mr  s country neighbors there were several who were as fat fair and heavy as many of our english country squires and like them had never stirred from their family mansion and i fancy the english lady and her horses will be the subject of their fireside conversation for some time   the next day i passed the taillamanta a river which had torn and washed away the road for nine miles before i came to it so i traveled in a bed of gravel every now and then jumping into and out of a little ditch formed by the different torrents the river was frightful to pass i got to san daniello from which place this new road is called the san daniello road from thence to pontiebba the road is good but winds round rocks according to the turns of a river which was sometimes on the right sometimes on the left in a most beautiful manner it is so narrow that i think it the most dangerous i ever went nothing between the precipice and the carriage to prevent an accident it would be well worth any persons while who is as fond of the beauties of nature as i am to ride along this road the views are romantic and majestic beyond description   trevisa which is the place i next slept at i arrived at with much difficulty my coach drawn with ten horses and four oxen and you can form to yourself no idea of the obstinacy and provoking phlegm of a german postillion or postmaster at one place tired of the snaillike pace i went i hired a traineau of a peasant and went on before my carriage it seems there is an order at every frontier town in germany not to suffer strangers who travel without posthorses to leave the town without staying in it two hours this the german postmaster did not choose to tell me nor did he refuse me another traineau and horses but sat with two other fat germans playing at cards without deigning to give me any other answer than  patienza to any thing i could say to him when i recollect the scene of these three fat men playing at cards their figures and all i said in italian to persuade the man and his patienza i could die with laughing however in about an hour an officer came in who looking at me some time said parles vous francais  mon dieu oui monsieur says i and i found the postmasters deafness proceeded from his not being able to talk italian very well french not at all so he took me for an impatient boy and sent me to coventry when the gentleman called me miladi these three fat germans deigned to look at me for i must tell you that in this country the respect paid to our sex is such that it is enough for a woman to speak she is obeyed immediately and i had a traineau and six horses for my coach ready in an instant one night i slept at klagenfurt a large town where one of the emperors unmarried sisters lives i am arrived here at last through a very beautiful country but must observe that whoever wrote l m  s letters for she never wrote a line of them misrepresents things most terribly i do really believe in most things they wished to impose upon the credulity of their readers and laugh at them the stoves of this country which she praises so much are the most horrid invention you can conceive the country people in germany seem to fear the cold very much the casements of their windows are double and there being no chimney in the rooms there is no vent for fumes of any sort so that the breath of the inhabitants of them rests in drops of steam on all the tables etc and the stink and suffocating heat that assails the travellers senses when he enters any room particularly where people are cannot be conceived i do not believe the german women of the lower order are very gentle tempers for several of them flew into the most violent passions when i opened a door or window and shut them again immediately my only resource upon these occasions was to go out into the yard   as to the stoves being ornamental i think they are frightful from the composition of them the ground work of which must be iron to resist the fire within the glazing painting and varnish soon moulder off and i leave you to judge from this inevitable circumstance together with another which is the size of them how it is possible they can represent either china jars or any other thing that may be elegant or pretty as a stove fills up one corner of the room   in this town several of the first houses have fine comfortable chimnies and stoves are where they should be  in the antichamber the difference of the cheerfulness which a good fire gives to a room to that which reigns in one where there is only a stove is very visible i think things must be very much altered since that lady or gentleman wrote about vienna the german ladies are handsome accomplished and civil to a degree you have no idea of several of them besides possessing many other languages read write and speak english well and i was surprised to find my connections and other circumstances flattering to my pride better known here than they are by half my acquaintances in london   most of the germans are naturally musicians and i am sure a young englishman with good manners may every evening here pass his hours in a circle of handsome and accomplished women of the first rank i have seen no place yet i should so much wish my son to come to as vienna sir robert keith assures me he has presented above four hundred noblemen and gentlemen young countrymen of mine and has never had reason to complain of them while we hear and see constantly the follies of the anglais at paris where they go to ruin themselves equally with the duchess or the fille dopera and only to be laughed at   the ladies are tall and fair  more handsome than pretty there is a great supper at prince galitzins every sunday night and at prince pars every monday the first is the russian minister who does great honor to his court by his sense and politeness here the presentation at court is very different from ours but i have not time to say more at present than that i remain  yours affectionately  p s i cannot help adding that the questions asked travelers by the guards at the frontier towns are most ridiculous  are you married or not do you travel for your pleasure or upon business your name and quality it put me in mind of a story told me by the russian minister at venice of a traveller who being asked his name answered boo hoo hoo hoo hoo  pray sir says the guard how do you write that that sir replied the traveller is your business i have told you my name it is impossible i think to answer gravely to questions so perfectly absurd    letter xxix vienna dec         i went with madame granieri the sardinian ministers wife to court nothing is more striking i think than the variety of the officers dresses in the emperors antichamber the hungarian and polish i think beautiful and i now am strengthened in the opinion i always had though probably i have never told it even to you that every nation ought to preserve the fashion of their country and that there is no necessity for mankind to ape one another in dress   the emperor gives a private audience for ladies that are presented to him there was only myself and the lady who accompanied me that went into his room together we met a princess esterhazi coming out the emperor was close to the door and after bowing very civilly he made us sit upon a sofa and stood the whole time himself i staid three quarters of an hour there is no occasion to fear staying too long for when he cannot spare any more for the audience or for any other reason chooses to end it he very civilly says he will detain you no longer you then get up and go to the door which he opens himself and thus ends the presentation i think much more agreeably than to answer any questions a sovereign chooses to make before a hundred people that are within hearing in the circle of a drawing room who generally repeat what they hear according to the folly or malice they possess and i should think it totally impossible for a monarch to converse with any satisfaction surrounded by so many ears which have often no brains belonging to them the emperor is like the queen of france and the only thing that gened me at was his not being seated he converses politely and agreeably   the first minister here prince kaunitz  is a very extraordinary personage he is reckoned an able minister and a good patriot i see in him all that sincerity and frankness which are the constant attendants on a mind truly great  and i believe the we fare of the people at large is his delight for he asked me what i thought of vienna i told him that i had not time to make many observations but that there was an air of plenty and comfort among the lower sort of people very striking meme les vendeuses de pommes out lair aise mon prince on my saying this there was a smile upon his countenance which i am sure came from his heart and he condescendingly told me several particulars relative to the markets and provisions one of which i cannot help thinking very necessary in all large cities which is that there is an inspector for the gardenstuff  another for meat  and so on for all provisions exposed to sale and if they are not found perfectly good they are fiung away and now we are upon the subject of provisions i must say that i never saw such a profusion of things and those so excellent in their kind as are served up at the tables here green peace artichokes and asparagus i eat every day the crawfish are as large as the chichester lobsters and the pheasants from bohemia have a flavor you can form no idea of yet i do not think the people are gourmands but they pique themselves on having the greatest abundance and the best sort of eatables of every kind the forests and rivers of this country do not in a small degree contribute to the possibility of these things for with us our cooks cannot produce wild boar and venison gelinottes and coqs de bruyeres or crawfish as big as lobsters   there is one thing here that shocks me and that is that every lower class of women paint white and even girls of ten years old going of errands in the street are painted what their reason for so doing is i cannot guess for the germans are generally fair i dine very often with prince kaunitz and as i am naturally as sincere as he is our conversations do not grow languid there is nothing that ever did really flatter me so much as when people of his age and experience forget for half an hour the distance which time and knowledge must naturally put between us and as i have often been rallied by  upon my taste for old beaus i think i am justified in his eyes when i place him at the head of them and say i am proud they should lose their time with me while i confess i hate the conversation of boys  there are great assemblies here as in london and i repeat it there are women here with whom i could pass my life they have not the cold silent reserve of english women nor the impertinent interet for me of the french ladies   the public works such as sweeping the streets etc etc are done by malefactors who chained two and two perform their task attended by a guard   the emperor has given up a park called the prater to the public where the bourgeoise and noblesse ride drive and walk and have little cottages where refreshments are sold it has many fine trees in it and the danube is one of its fences it is very like an english park   i have been to see the pictures in the house that was formerly prince eugenes now the emperors and many things of which i have neither time nor inclination to give you a description  and there are so many englishmen here that when i am at sir robert keiths i am half tempted to fancy myself in england   adieu for the present  yours affectionately  p s you cannot buy a drug at the apothecaries here without an order from a physician a very prudent caution against the madness of those who choose to finish their existence with a dose of laudanum or their neighbors with one of arsenic     letter xxx warsaw january        i got away as fast as i possibly could from vienna for if i had staid a week longer i am convinced i should have staid the whole winter the country between vienna and cracow is very fine chiefly open here and there the plain beautifully varied with hills of gentle ascent and small woods the sportsman and the painter would be pleased with it as it affords a variety of landscapes and game equally favorable to both the firs and deciduous trees do not seem to flourish in the same spot i frequently saw a wood of the one to my right and of the other to my left i observed that cattle of all sorts are suffered to eat the green corn during the hard weather   the herdsman with his cows and the shepherd with his sheep gave living beauties to the fine features of nature whose graces i have studied with much satisfaction to myself when very young pointed out by mr brown who certainly never learnt their value in the gardens of my ancestors   i slept the first night at nicolsbourg a small town six posts or sixty miles from the capital the next at brun a neat fortified town commanded by a fort and steep hill west of the city that is watered by a branch of the river thaja which stream a few miles lower mixes with the river mash at a short distance west of presburgh and by uniting afterward with the danube adds considerably to the rapidity of that river  most of the villages are situated under the shelter of hills the houses are chiefly built of logs of the firtrees laid horizontally upon one another the interstices filled up with moss or clay the road from brun to olmutz is bordered with large old cherrytrees after quitting olmutz i passed a large convent on the plain to the left this and the chartreuse reformee to the right make two fine objects for travelers  adieu   letter xxxi warsaw       the entrance into the town of cracow exhibits a melancholy proof that confusion ever ends in ruin the system of government in poland is of all others the surest source of confusion that ever yet was imagined by mankind an elected king from the noble families most of which think they have a right to royalty and several really are entitled to it   i think sir had i been born a polish nobleman rather than have seen my extensive country divided between ambitious neighbors i would have called my countrymen together proposed to have relinquished for us and for our heirs for ever that unfortunate privilege have invited some spirited prince from germa in whom hereditary courage and all the virtues belonging to a good soldier were blended and made him and his descendants the lawful sovereigns of this kingdom   dirty suburbs filled with jews and the emperors eagle are the only objects that precede the gates of cracow these gates are pierced by many a ball and probably if each bore the name of his sender the gateway might be divided into as many pieces for those who have claims to it as poland herself is divided into parties i had letters for several polish ladies at cracow but i staid only to rest myself and get a traineau made for i was told i might go thus but a couple of miles from the town i was obliged to take my coach off the sledge and here i must observe sir that the prince galitzin at vienna was very much mistaken when he told me he should advise me to have just such a coach as mine made if i were not already mistress of such a one   i hung more than once upon firtrees the track of the road being too narrow for my wide carriage and when travelers come into germany i think they ought to part with their french and english carriages as the carriages of our northern countries are liable to inconveniences and accidents   i staid two hours one night so fastened with the hindwheel upon a fir tree that six men could not stir it and peasants were called to cut down the tree before i could proceed   i shall refer you to mr coxes book for the accommodations i met with on the road and confine my descriptions to agreeable circumstances   when i arrived at warsaw i found my apartments had been warmed and ready two days before my arrival the comte de stackelberg having bespoke them by the desire of prince galitzin and the russian minister c  de s  waited on me the king received us in his study i was accompanied by the grand marechals wife who is one of the kings nieces  you sir do not speak better french and english than that amiable sovereign he told me he had been in england thirty years past and asked me if mr w  was still living not only living i replied sir but in good spirits for i have a charming letter in my pocket from him  he said if there was nothing imprudent in his request he would ask to see it he imagined mr ws style must be uncommon i gave him the letter he put it into his pocket after reading it and told me as his sister the princess of cracovia did not understand english he should translate it into french for her and if i would dine with him two days after he would read me his translation which indeed surprised me he must be a very elegant writer in every language he chooses to profess i wish i had dared to have asked him for a copy well sir he is the second person i have seen whom i wished were not sovereigns for it is impossible that the many disagreeable persons and circumstances that surround them should not deprive them of the society of people who sacrificing only to the muses are better company than those who only sacrifice to ambition when they give their time to sovereigns we were only fourteen people at the kings dinner and we conversed as cheerfully and as rationally as if we had not been at court   the king in his face is very like the duke of marlborough and there is an elegance in his language with a softness in the tone of his voice that pleases the ear to the highest degree my old acquaintance the princess c  will be the occasion of my shortening my stay here for it is many years since i saw her and as she does not come here on account  i shall give her the meeting in the country and afterward set out for petersburgh i told the king i should see her as he spoke to me of her i hate party affairs  and   i make visits in a new style here in the comte de stackelbergs coach and six and a couple of equerries at the two coach windows on horseback the polish ladies seem to have much taste magnificence spirit and gaiety they are polite and lively excessively accomplished partial to the english there is a princess de radzivil who if i were a man i should certainly be devoted to  i could be very happy here sir if my heart could forget maternal duties or those of friendship   i have seen several dwarfs here who with equerries stand in drawingrooms of the great houses and hear all the conversation that passes an uncomfortable custom i think and which in any other country would be dangerous but here servants and dependants are the absolute property of the master  and their fidelity in general is equal to their subjection to the credit of the polish nobles i believe there are few servants that having proved for eight or ten years their attachment are not dismissed with a pension for life i found the french maid the princess c  had from me in this situation nine years service had obtained a hundred pounds a year and a farm of sixty acres of land for the rest of her life she seems the happiest creature in the world the king has a manner of saying things obliging or flattering peculiar to himself he tells me he thinks men animals trees every thing in short that takes its birth or is produced by england is more perfect than the produce of other countries the climate the soil probably he says may occasion this his partiality to the english together with yours sir would make me prejudiced in favor of my own country if i could love it better than i do but the word comfort which is understood there only has long stamped the value of it in my mind   i am going to see the princess tomorrow and am sorry to quit this place so soon not that there is any thing in this flat country that would tempt me to see the beauties of it in the spring but the kings acquaintance with that of some of the ladies and monsieur de stackelbergs conversation i am sorry to quit   adieu sir  letter xxxii petersburgh feb        the road between warsaw and this place is one insipid flat except just in and about the town of nerva where i took a sledge and flew hither when i wrote last dear sir i think i was upon the point of going to see the princess c  i passed two days with her at a country house of the princess lubomirskas her sisterinlaw i was most sincerely glad to see her and we parted with regret i received a very civil message from the king and m de stackelberg sent me six bottles of bishop which i can assure you was very serviceable to me i did not stop at warsaw on my return from the p  and the messenger caught me just one post on this side of warsaw i can conceive nothing so enuyant as traveling in such a country as this one flat plain the view terminated by a forest which you drive through only to arrive at the same scene you have quitted the frost was not hard enough to make the road good till i came to nerva i am something like a country miss gaping at the window all day here every creature that goes about the streets seem as if they were in a violent hurry they drize full gallop traineaus with one horse ply at the corners of the streets as do your hackneycoaches and chairs mr s  informed me it belonged to my dignity to have six horses to my coach in order to pay my visits and i beg you will imagine my surprise when i found i had a coachman on the box with three postillions one to each pair of horses and these sitting on the right hand i go thus full gallop running races with every other attelage that falls in my way the streets are luckily wide and custom makes the danger less than one should imagine   i am interrupted and therefore wish you a good night   letter xxxiii petersburgh friday feb         i was to have been presented to the empress next sunday but she graciously sent me word to come to the hermitage on thursday where she keeps her court in the evening every week and has alternately a french play or an italian opera  marchesini and madame todi are the first singers it is but justice to say that nothing can be more magnificent than the appearance the empress makes when she comes into the drawing room she has a lively and goodhumoured look and her politeness to me was very great but i could plainly see that some one had told her i was not an english woman for she asked me if i was not of a scotch family i cannot conceive why this building which she has added to the palace is called the hermitage it is a long suite of rooms full of fine pictures you are not ignorant dear sir of the many collections the empress has purchased among the rest lord orfords all these fine works want at present a person to arrange them according to their shades and size and i doubt not but the empress will find one   petersburgh is a cheerful and fine looking town the streets are extremely wide and long the houses stuccod to imitate white stone none above three stories high which certainly adds to the lively and airy appearance of them i think sir if a young woman may permit herself to judge of things otherwise than en detail  that not only the town but the manner of living is upon too large a a scale the nobles seem to vie with one another in extravagancies of every sort particularly in foreign luxuries and fashion the fashion of the day is most ridiculous and improper for this climate french gauzes and flowers were not intended for russian beauties and they are sold at a price here which must ruin the buyers  there are buildings erected for the reception of arts and sciences of every kind for artists or amateurs though but the surplus of italy france and england would find handsome encouragement and houseroom from the empress whose respect for talents and generosity to those who possess them have induced some and would many more to fix in the present capital of this vast empire but alas sir eight months of winter and the horrid cold i feel must congeal the warmest imagination poets and painters require verdant lawns and the flowers of fancy must fade and die where spring is not to be found   the empress and the princess dashkow are the only ladies who wear the russian dress it is i think a very handsome one and i am more surprised every day that nations do not each preserve their own fashions and not copy one country that is at present only the ape of every other  from cherson the new town on the turkish frontiers which is one thousand six hundred miles from hence are brought many provisions from archangel likewise this town is provided and from astracan on the caspian sea near two thousand miles all the dainties such as grapes pease beans artichokes are brought it is natural to suppose that the necessaries of life are dear from these circumstances but some of them are extremely cheap and i believe russia is one of the cheapest countries in the world to live in if french wines and fashions and english comforts can be dispensed with to these last i never felt so much attachment as at this moment  dans le ligne anglais a quarter of this town where the english merchants live i find english grates english coals and english hospitality to make me welcome and the fireside cheerful i have never yet been fortunate enough to make any acquaintance in the world of commerce but if all english merchants and their families are as well informed and civil as those i find here i should be very glad to be admitted into the city of london as a visitor to enjoy a little rational conversation which at the courtend is seldom to be found how should it be otherwise a little latin and greek in the schools of westminister and eton and a great deal of vulgar rioting make our young men a strange mixture of pedantism and vice which can only produce impudence and folly thus tutored at sixteen they are turned upon the hands of some unhappy man who is to present them at foreign courts with no other improvement or alteration in the boys heads than that of their hair being powdered and tied behind   the careful citizen conscious that fair dealing and knowledge only can promote the wellbeing of his family brings up his son to business and that only as you know well makes the idle moments of life happy peter the first thought commerce an essential pillar to his empire and the english trader was encouraged our little island is a proof of the consequence which trade alone can give any country and the new acquired possessions of the largest empires may only become additional trouble to their masters unless the advantages of trade give them new life   the french ambassador and the comte serge de romanzow named to berlin are men of wit mr ellis is with mr fitzherbert and conversation does not languish or grow insipid in their company we are in the last part of the carnival and balls those given by the ambassadors are very superb mr de segur and the duc de serra capriola the neapolitan minister have each given one in a very magnificent style   i was presented to the grand duchess the same night that i waited upon the empress she has since been brought to bed there are some young russian ladies very pretty and much accomplished many of them sigh after a different climate from their own and  told me he had no idea of happiness in the world like that of returning to england as a private man and purchasing a farm he speaks very good english indeed sir the elegance which is produced by the cleanliness and order seen with us is found no where out of england here the houses are decorated with the most sumptuous furniture from every country but you come into a drawing room where the floor is of the finest inlaid woods through a staircase made of the coarsest wood in the rudest manner and stinking dirt  the postillions wear sheepskins and at a ball when a nobleman has proposed his hand to a fair lady he often kisses her before the whole company  a propos to this custom  i must tell you an anecdote of   thus you perceive he was nearly in the same predicament as the chevalier dans la fee urgele and might have said pour un baiser fautil perdre la vie  adieu sir  i will give you some account in my next of what i have seen at the museum   you may have heard much of prince potemkin i see him every where but he is reserved and converses very little with ladies i was invited by him to dine in an immense palace he is building in the suburbs the only room finished is too particular not to be described it is three hundred feet in length and on the side opposite the windows there are two rows of stone pillars whose height and breadth are proportioned to the immense size of the room which is an oblong square in the center of which on the side where the windows are it is formed into a semicircle or what we call a bow  which bow forms another large space independent of though in the room this space was laid out by his english gardener into a shrubbery with borders of flowers hyacinths and narcissuses  myrtles orange trees etc etc were in plenty we were seven or eight ladies and as many men  immense stoves concealed by the pillars were heated in order to make such a hall in such a climate supportable  but i came home quite ill with cold it was there i heard that extraordinary music performed by men and boys each blowing a straight horn adapted to their size  sixtyfive of these musicians produce a very harmonious melody something like an immense organ the music the room the cold all was gigantic i sat by prince potemkin at dinner but except asking me to eat and drink i cannot say i heard the sound of his voice so am unable to tell you what species of esprit has raised him to the fortunes and dignities he possesses or what occasions mr s  and others to call him a sensible man   i have seen likewise the cabinet of medals and the museum here a complete set of harness made of white leather stitched with colored silks for six dogs with a sledge for one person brought from kamskatka was the lightest neatest and most curious piece of workmanship i ever saw  the last when finished will be a very beautiful suite of rooms peter the great likewise sitting in a chair with a coat of his amiable catharines embroidery i cannot help thinking and often here that notwithstanding he transferred his capital to this place and that the empress prince potemkin and others may build palaces of the finest orders of architecture to contain the produce of learning and commerce that a time will come when the heads of an empire which extends from the south to the north will prefer basking in the rays of the sun which cheer the mind and the body together  to eternal frost  and these stately buildings will be turned into storehouses    justice obliges me to say the empress does all she can to invite politeness science and comsorts from other countries to cheer these regions of ice  but until she can alter the climate i believe it is a fruitless trial i am informed the spring or rather the time of the year we call spring is more melancholy than winter here so i shall hasten my departure but a conversation i had with the swedish minister a few days past will make me give up entirely the thoughts of returning into germany through sweden and denmark i shall in my next have the honor of repeating it to you i remain with the highest respect and regard  your most affectionate sister e c  i promised to give you an account of the conversation with the minister here it is  m s  lon ma dit que miladi voulait me fair lhonneur de prendre des renseignemens sur le voyage quelle compte fair   m  oui monsieur on pretend quil y a beaucoup de risque a passer ces mers de glaces et je voudrais scavoir comment cela se fait parceque de quel cote que je turn mes pas je veux fair le plus grande party de mon voyage en traineau detestant le cahotage dune voiture ordinaire et aimant beaucoup le traineau    m s  miladi sait elle que pour aller dici chez nous on attele un troisieme cheval devant les deux autres mais a une distance tres confiderable dans les endroits suspects    m  qu appellez vous endroits suspects    m s  ou il serait dangereux que la glace se rompit  et cest avec des cords treslongues quon attele ce cheval quon appelle l enfant perdu  parce que si la glace vient a se casser vite on coupe les cords le cheval disparait pour jamais et les voyageurs retournent sur leurs pas    m  comme je nai jamais commence un voyage pour retourner sur mes pas et quil me semble que je course risque detre enfant perdu moimeme si jentreprens ce voyage je remettrai ma visit a votre pays pour une autre occasion monsieur lambassadeur and so we talked of other things      i shall now prepare every thing to visit the crimea or rather the tauride i have been told it is a very beautiful country and i confess i am not sorry this enfant perdu gives me a good excuse for turning my steps toward constantinople   there are ladies here whom i shall be sorry to quit who in youth are possessed of many talents and with whom i could form an agreeable society italian music the pedal harp and our english poets are perfectly understood by them i think often i can trace grecian features among the females of this country and the subtle wit of the greek in the men that pliability of genius which causes them to speak so many different languages well and adopt all the inventions and arts of other countries that are good   i am speaking without any partiality dear sir but i do not see here the prejudices of the english the conceit of the french nor the stiff german pride which national foibles make often good people of each nation extremely disagreeable i am assured the russians are deceitful  it may be so but as i do not desire to have intimacies i am much better pleased to find new acquaintances pleasant and civil than morose or pert   mine at present is a geographical intercourse with the world and i like to find the road i travel smooth wit and talents will always be objects of importance to me i have found them here and shall be sorry to quit them prince repnin and his nephew prince kourakin whom i often saw in england are both here and i look upon them as old acquaintances as it is thirteen years since that period the latter is grown fat  i forgot to tell you sir that the grand duchess was brought to bed five days after my arrival so i have only seen her the night i was presented to her which was the same on which i was presented to the empress her affability is great to strangers for mr s  had not announced me to her but seeing me move from one seat to another at the opera by the empresss desire and probably being informed who i was she sent for me to come to her after the spectacle  which i did a most ridiculous thing happened to me for though i had no less than three carriages as i thought waiting for me i was above an hour getting at one owing to the great distance of the grand duchesss apartments from the hermitage where the theater is  and mr s  s telling me he waited for me at the hermitage i went three times through the whole palace and while i was at one door two of the carriages were at the other prince kourakin who had offered to conduct me back to the hermitage from the grand duchess and who was engaged to sup with the grand duke was not a little embarrassed for the doors opened to let in company were shut and i had no other resource but to sit in the guardroom of the duchess till prince kourakins servant should find one of the carriages belonging either to me or my party the prince went in to sup but the grand duchess hearing this circumstance sent me a very fine pelisse which i told the prince i really did not want but he informed me i must put it on so i did and in a few minutes i had a carriage but the most ridiculous circumstance was that the saxon ministers wife whom i had come to court with thought i was gone home in my own carriage  the company in that thought i was gone home with her and gave me up after having paraded on the outside of the palace from door to door as i had on the inside my servants at home i thought i had been invited to sup at the palace   the grand duchess is fair and tall the duchess of wirtemberg who is the duchess of brunswicks daughter is pretty and very like our royal family  she was very civil to me  i have not seen the grand duchesss children  i am told they are fine and healthy   adieu sir for the present i remain yours with great respect and truth    p s i am not a little surprised to hear people say i shall inherit so many hundred peasants or such a one lost a village  it is the number of men and not of acres that make a fortune great here so that a plague or any distemper that would prove mortal to the peasants would be death to the nobles pockets likewise   i have taken leave of the empress and you may judge if i do not leave petersburgh with a good impression of her politeness she told me before the opera that she knew my intention but as we defer disagreeable things as long as possible you shall not take leave till after the spectacle these words she said with the most gracious smile and asked me if i was satisfied with the amusements and civilities i met with i told her i must be both stupid and ungrateful not to regret infinitely that i could not stay any longer to show how sensible i was of the hospitality and magnificence with which i was treated the vicechancellor comte dofterman is obliged to have a table for sixty foreigners every wednesday and a widow princess de galitzin a supper once a week  at mons dostermans too a ball every sunday night the empress is at the expense of these dinners and suppers and i confess i think it an excellent and royal idea to be certain of having houses open for the entertainment of foreign ministers and strangers of distinction for you know my dear sir that private houses are seldom open to strangers now in most countries for various reasons here i am told there are many princes who keep a public day as we do in england for the convenience of our country neighbors and expect people whom they leave a card with to dine with them upon such a day but if i was to stay here ten years i should never be prevailed upon to go to those houses to dine without invitation nor can i believe it possible the masters of them can expect a foreigner to grace their table without being desired even by word of mouth i am assured i shall affront  and  but as i meet them every where i cannot think they should be so totally ignorant of the manners of other countries to expect me to dine at their house without asking me there is a custom here which i think very abominable noblemen who are engaged to marry young ladies make no ceremony but embrace them in the midst of a large company at a ball   i have mentioned to a few people my intention of seeing the crimea and i am told that the air is unwholesome the waters poisonous and that i shall certainly die if i go there but as in the great world a new acquired country like a new beauty finds detractors i am not in the least alarmed for a person not a russian who has been there on speculation has given me so charming a description of it that i should not be sorry to purchase a tartarian estate  adieu my much honored and beloved brother  i remain yours     letter xxxiv moscow feb         i left my coach at petersburgh and hired for myself and my small suite the carriages of the country called kibitkas they are exactly like cradles the head having windows to the front which let down i can sit or lie down and feel in one like a great child very comfortably defended from the cold by pillows and blankets these carriages are upon sledges and where the road is good this conveyance is comfortable and not fatiguing but from the incredible quantity of sledges that go constantly upon the track of snow it is worn in tracks like a road and from the shaking and violent thumps the carriage receives i am convinced the hardest head might be broken i was overturned twice the postillions i fancy are used to such accidents for they get quietly off their horse set the carriage up again and never ask if the traveller is hurt their method of driving is singular they sit behind three horses that are harnessed abreast  a shrill whistling noise or a savage kind of shriek is the signal for the horses to set off which they do full gallop and when their pace slackens the driver waves his right hand shrieks or whistles and the horses obey i am told the whip is unmercifully used in the stables i observed a postillion never strikes a horse in driving which caused my astonishment at their being so tractable to the raising of a hand only i would never advise a traveller to set out from petersburgh as i have just at the end of the carnival he might with some reason suppose it is a religious duty for the russian peasant to be drunk in most villages i saw a sledge loaded with young men and women in such a manner that four horses would have been more proper to draw it than one which wretched beast was obliged to fly with this noisy company up and down the village which is generally composed of houses in straight rows on each side of the public road the girls are dressed in their holidayclothes and some are beautiful and do not look less so from various colored handkerchiefs tied over their forehead in a becoming and pittoresque manner there is one particular piece of roguery practiced after this diversion upon travelers which ought to be put an end to the horse employed upon these festive occasions is generally upon the point of death and the first posthorse that is wanted that horse is harnessed to a kibitka in his place because a traveller is obliged to pay the value of any horse that dies in his service i had one that died thus though i remonstrated upon his being put to the collar seeing that he was dying  but unless i could have armed six servants with good cudgels my arguments were as fruitless as those employed at the next post to prove how unreasonable it was that i should pay a great deal of money for a dead horse that was dying when he was put to the carriage   the russian peasant is a fine stout straight welllooking man some of the women as i said before are uncommonly pretty but the general whiteness of their teeth is something that cannot be conceived it frequently happened that all the men of the village were in a circle round my carriages  and rows of the most beautiful oriental pearl cannot be more regular and white than their teeth it is a matter of great astonishment to me how the infants outlive the treatment they receive till they are able to crawl into the air there is a kind of space or entresol over every stove in which the husband wife and children lie the greatest part of the day and where they sleep at night  the heat appeared to me so great that i have no conception how they bear it but they were as much surprised at me for seeking a door or window in every house i was obliged to go into as i could possibly be at their living in a manner without air the children look all pale and sickly till they are five or six years old the houses and dresses of the peasants are by no means uncomfortable the first is generally composed of wood the latter of sheepskins but trees laid horizontally one upon another makes a very strong wall and the climate requires a warm skin for clothing it might appear to english minds that a people who are in a manner the property of their lord suffer many of the afflictions that attend slavery but the very circumstance of their persons being the property insures them the indulgence of their master for the preservation of their lives and that master stands between them and the power of a despotic government or a brutal soldiery beside my dear sir the invaluable advantage which these peasants have as in paying annually a very small sum each and cultivating as many acres of land as he thinks fit his fortune depends entirely upon his own industry each man only pays about the value of halfaguinea a year if his lord would raise this tax too high or make their vassals suffer misery and desertion would ruin his fortune not theirs it is true that a lord is obliged to give one man as a recruit yearly out of such a number but it is one out of three or four hundred so that notwithstanding this great empire is said not to be populated in proportion to the extent of it when you reflect what a number of troops the empress has and these kept up by this method the russian people must be more numerous than strangers may imagine in traveling through this country it is very amusing to me to reflect without prejudices of any kind upon the ridiculous ideas of liberty and property that our english common people have for   and now my most honored and dear brother that i have given you so pretty a picture of english liberty  i shall wish you a good night and remain  yours affectionately  e c   letter xxxv moscow march        i believe i have not told you that i am possessed of all the instructions to proceed upon this new journey in a very pleasant manner the commanders at krementchouck and at cherson are informed of my intention to proceed to perekop where i shall enter into that peninsula called the tauride which from the climate and situation i look upon to be a delicious country and an acquisition to russia which she should never relinquish i must take off your attention for some time from your own people and my journey and in as few words as possible show by remote and past ages that the tauride must naturally become a treasure to posterity long before homer the first inhabitants of it that can be traced were the cimmerians a numerous and warlike people descendants of the thracians in their incursions into asia minor they were robbed by the scythians of their possessions but preserved the crimea longer than the rest of them the scythians drove them from the flat country     years before christ but they remained concealed in the mountains calling themselves taourians  and from thence the peninsula took the name of taourica  taourinia  or tauris the greeks began to establish themselves in the sixth century before christ the milesians built a town called panticapoeum or bosporus now called kierche and theodosia which at present is mostly called kaffa the empress has ordered this town to be restored to the original greek name theodosia it is at present a town of no inconsiderable commerce before i proceed to follow the variations which the changes and i may say mixtures of nations that have governed this country and have produced the present annexion of it to russia i must observe that according to my usual mode of tracing extraordinary appearances to their primitive causes  i yet think i am perfectly right in perceiving a lineal descent in many russians from the greeks the darkness in which we are lost when we turn back to nations conquered by savage unlettered people puts a stop to all certainty as to genealogy but when the greeks by terror and oppression were driven from theodosia and other towns on the sea  coast  is it not very natural to suppose that they wandered or were driven farther up into the country and that by degrees their descendants peopled a country which nothing but necessity forced them to inhabit many marks of superior genius have pierced through all the difficulties that ignorance and the climate have occasioned and shown themselves in the russian peasant nor should i wonder to find if their genius was traced it descended from a thales or an alcibiades let us return to history    0 years before the birth of christ the people from mitylene sounded a monarchy in the crimea which was governed fortytwo years afterward by spartacus this king and his successors we are told favored the greeks particularly the athenians and drove away the scythians in a great measure but they were entirely exterminated by the sarmatians at this period the taourians from the mountains molested the new monarchy till mithridrates king of pontus about     years before the birth of christ subdued them and made himself master of the whole peninsula about the birth of christ the alains made the kings possessors of bosphorus his tributaries and drove away the taourians these new masters held their power about a century and a half in the second century the goths succeeded to the alains and it was under their dominion that christianity was first introduced into the crimea during the lives of diocletian and constantine the great bishoprics were created but the goths were obliged to submit to the huns and like all other possessors of the crimea when driven from the plains they in their turn took refuge in the mountains where they had their own sovereigns who were christians at that time there remained some of the alains in the mountains likewise and a few were dispersed over the plains about the fourth century what was called the kingdom of bosphorus ceased to exist as a kingdom the hungarians entered the crimea in     they having with the bulgarians all the country between the don and the dneister  the goths and alains went to taman where they settled habitations the descendants of the hungarians took the name of aoultziagrians and led a wandering life in the crimea but were obliged to submit to the khatyares who made likewise the goths in the mountains and the grecian towns on the coast their tributaries about the eighth century the goths attempted a revolt but were subdued yet were governed among themselves by their own kings in the year   0 the emperor theophilus erected a government at cherson to which he subjected all the other towns of the crimea and kouban for though these countries were tributary to the khatyares they acknowledged the sovereignty of the byzantian court notwithstanding this from the time the khatyares had first conquered the crimea that peninsula had taken the name of khat or gatyaria except the mountainous part which was called gothia from the goths and tsikia from the remaining alains  jews were then numerous in the crimea   the petchenegues or kanglis in     drove the hungarians from the crimea but beyond the isthmus of or remained two detached branches of bulgarians and hungarians known in the annals of russia by the name of berendec or black bulgarians from this period the khatyares preserved no power but in asia where it was likewise annihilated in  0   yet even then the crimea preserved the name of khatyaria   about the eleventh century the petchenegues were obliged to give up that peninsula and most of their possessions to the komanes otherwise called butyes or polouzes who likewise subdued the goths and greeks that were left in it at this period of time the town of sougdaia now called soudak became so considerable from the commerce and trade carried on there that all the land possessed by the greeks in the crimea was called after it soudak   till the year   0  they acknowledged the sovereignty of the byzantian empire but then they made themselves independent or submitted to the power of different princes so that when the ottomans conquered that country there existed two principalities one called theodor now inkerman and the other gothia now called mangoute in      the polouzes were subdued in the crimea by the mongouls or tartars who were governed in clans by their princes by the titles of ouloug beigh in the plains till menguelcighierai converted the crimea into a kind of state the goths and greeks paid a tribute to the mongouls as they had before to the polouzes in the first part of the tartarian reign a number of tcher kafes or circassians established themselves in the crimea in      that part called kierche was governed by a prince of that nation and as the tartars carried on a great trade in the town of krim the peninsula took the name of krim by which only it is known to the orientals at this hour while the latins were masters of constantinople they carried on a considerable trade at krim tamane and tana the most considerable traders were the venetians but when the genoese by a treaty with the emperor michael paleologus had obtained an exemption of all duties in the grecian states and a free navigation in the black sea they began to monopolife all the trade of the crimea bloody wars ensued in which they were almost constantly victorious they rebuilt with the consent of the mongoul khan the town of kaffa made it the chief repository or capital of their commerce and at last of such consequence that kaffa for a time was the name by which the peninsula was called by degrees they conquered soudak and cembals now called balouklava it is true they paid a tribute to the mongouls while these preserved their power but when their own intestine divisions had weakened it the genoese shook off their yoke and the mongoulian or tartarian princes were elected or deposed as the genoese thought fit it was at this period that the trade from india to the crimea was divided into two branches by the amou the caspian sea and astrakan  one ended at tana the other proceeded by bagdad and tauris to trapesond and savastopolis tana belonged to the genoese and venetians under the supremacy of the mongouls the genoese had their consuls at traposond and savastopolis  in      the genoese lost their power in the crimea by the turks having conquered kaffa soudak and balouklava and tana upon the don these new conquerors put an end to the principalities of the goths and of theodori established garrisons in all the principal towns upon the coast and by that measure checked the power of the khans of the crimea these however till the year      were rather the allies than the subjects of the port till it attained the power of naming them or confirming their nomination when they ventured to be chosen without having previously obtained the sanction of the ottoman council   the turkish cabinet began by establishing at kaffa a sandjak and then a behjlerbeghjilik which governed all the domains belonging to the port either in the crimea on the borders of the don or upon the sea of asoph and left a very strong garrison in that town to intimidate the khans but from the wretched policy of the turks they at the same time shut up the entrance of the black sea to other european nations so that trade and commerce were almost ruined in the crimea and the exports from that time to this were confined to the productions of the country and slaves   the great market for the circassians of which we have heard so much and know so little was at kaffa where they came and sold their children to greeks genoese jews or armenians who sold them in their turn at constantinople but that was before the turks had extended their power over the crimea   when the sovereignty of the peninsula passed to mengheligherai there were but few tartarian inhabitants but the wars he was engaged in against them on the borders of the volga gave him an opportunity to bring back into the crimea with him many thousand nogais which he obliged to fix there in this method of peopling the country he was followed by his successors who furnished the kouban and the country between the don and the dneister with their prisoners   the crimea was for a long time a formidable power to the russians and poles till these nations became improved in military science until the peace of karlowitz both these nations were obliged to pay the khan to the amount of  00000 rixdollars to insure their countries from the incursions of the tartars russia has gained ground by degrees and by arms and policy is become master of the peninsula the last khan has a pension from the empress and is retired to live as a private gentleman long before he resigned his sovereignty the turkish cabinet on one side the crafty policy of the russians on the other left him no peace even some hordes of tartars insulted his tottering power thus my dear sir i have summed up as well as i am able a sketch of the past and present revolutions that happened in the country i am proceeding to in which there are at present about thirty thousand of the empresss troops including five thousand cossacks in her pay which i am very curious to see the khans palaces noble tartar houses and others are prepared for her reception in which i am assured i shall be received and treated perfectly well notwithstanding all that has been said to deter me from continuing my tour i shall certainly go on and if i am not poisoned by the waters in tartary or drowned in my passage by the black sea to constantinople i shall i hope afford you some amusement in the geographical descriptions i shall give you and variety of military figures who though not versed in tactics like your prussian troops may always entertain any person who like you are a good soldier by inheritance example and practice i am going to dine at my bankers who insists on showing me his very fine hothouses and having the honor of giving me a good dinner  i remain unalterably your affectionate sister e c   letter xxxvi cherson march         i was obliged to put my kibitkas on wheels at a vile little town called soumi before i arrived at pultawa notwithstanding there might have been many things worth stopping to look at in the immense town of moscow i was so impatient to meet the spring that i would not send my name to any person whose civilities would have obliged me to stay i cannot say that moscow gives me any other idea than of a large village or many villages joined as the houses stand at such a distance and it is such a terrible way to go to visit things or people that i should have made as many long journeys in a week as there are days in one had i staid what is particularly gaudy and ugly at moscow are the steeples square lumps of different colored bricks and gilt spires or ovals they make a very gothic appearance but it is thought a public beauty there a widow lady was just dead who having outlived all the people that she loved she left an immense sum of money to gild with the purest gold the top of one of the steeples   at pultawa i was shown the ground on which the armies moved a memorable check to the wild spirit of charles the twelfth a private person one paul budenkof has at his own expense erected a monument in remembrance of that event it is a plate of brass on which is represented the battle in a good engraving the plate is fixed into a pillar at soumi i conversed with a brother of prince kourakins and a mr lanskoy both officers quartered there and to whom i was indebted for a lodging they obliged a jew to give me up a new little house he was upon the point of inhabiting the thaw had come on so quickly that i was obliged to stay two days while my carriages were taken off the sledges   mr lanskoy has a little of the beauty and sweetness of countenance of his cousin who died the favorite of the empress and who if his pictures and the medal do not flatter him was perfectly beautiful both prince kourakin and lanskoy are very impatient to quit such dismal quarters and seem to desire some event in which they may display a military ardour very natural to soldiers and increased in them by having no polished people to converse with as i found upon my asking what society they had their account of the country nobles thereabout was truly laughable   there is no gentlemans house at pultawa i slept at my bankers and walked all about the skirts of the town   at chrementchouk the general who commands has a very pretty wellbred wife who did the honors of her house and the place perfectly well prince potemkin has a large house just out of the town which i went to see at the governors i assisted at a dinner where there was such a number of people and so much company after dinner that i was heartily tired there i began to find the manner in which i was recommended by the prince the greatest attentions and respect were paid me an english woman married to a russian who was there came to my lodging and looking earnestly at me said are you an english lady i smiled and said quite so she flung her arms round my neck and almost smothered me with kisses forgive me said she i too was born in england and have never had the happiness of seeing a countrywoman since i left it i am married have children here and probably shall never see england again i was entreated to stay by all the ladies at least some days but i cannot defer too long letting  know what is become of me i concealed from  and  my intended journey and only wrote word from petersburgh that i was going to make a little tour to a warmer part of that country and i mean not to let either of them know where i am till i get safe to constantinople  i am going to see the dockyard here and the fortifications which are to be new done by a colonel korsakof a very civil spirited young man here who seems to have the welfare of this place and the honor of his nation very much at heart i shall give you an account of what i have seen tomorrow  i remain with respect your affectionate sister e c   depiction of a turkish burial ground a turkish burial ground   letter xxxvii cherson march        this place is situated upon the dneiper called by the ancients the boristhenes which falls into the black sea the only inconvenience of the docks here is that the ships when built are obliged to be taken with camels into that part of the channel deep enough to receive them the town is not at present very large though there are many new houses and a church built after pretty models good architecture of white stone there are no trees near this place korsakof is trying to make large plantations the town is entirely furnished with fuel by reeds of which there is an inexhaustible forest in the shallows of the boristhenes just facing cherson rails and even temporary houses are made of them these reeds are strong and tall and are a harbor for birds of various kind particularly aquatics of which there are such a number and of such beautiful kinds that i can conceive nothing so entertaining as shooting parties in boats here korsakof and a captain mordwinof who both have been educated in england will i have no doubt make a distinguished figure in the military annals of russia mordwinof is a seaofficer and superintends the shipbuilding here there are some very pretty frigates on the stocks repninskai is the governors name and he has a young wife who is very civil my loding is a large house built for a greek archbishop but being empty was appropriated to my use i have remonstrated here but in vain against having sentinels and the guard turning out as i pass through the gates i hate all kind of ceremony and honors particularly such as i am not accustomed to but i am told here i must content myself with not refusing the orders that are given the emperors consul has a wife who wears a greek dress here i think it by no means becoming  cherson may in time become a very beautiful town and furnish the borders of the boristhenes with examples of commerce that inestimable and only real source of greatness to an empire i am not soldier enough to know what fault there was in the fortifications so that they are entirely to be done anew  but by the active and studious spirit of korsakof i have no doubt that they will be executed in a masterly manner   i can conceive nothing so pleasant to a young soldier as to be employed in places where his talents must create the defense and stability of newly acquired possessions i leave this place in two days dear sir and will do myself the honor of writing from the first town where i can sit down again for a few days   i have nothing but maps and plans of various sorts in my head at present having looked over all such as my curiosity could induce me to ask for the fortifications and plantations are executed here by malefactors whose chains and fierce looks struck horror into my heart as i walked over them particularly when i was informed there are between three and four thousand yet i must confess i think this method of treating criminals much more rational than that of shutting them up and rendering them useless members of the society by which they must be maintained   mordwinof informs me the frigate which is to convey me to constantinople is prepared and is to wait my pleasure at one of the seaports in the crimea and that the comte de wynowitch who commands at sevastopole has directions to accommodate me in the best manner mordwinof and korsakof both are much more like englishmen than any foreigners i ever met with except one whom you are assured is the person upon earth i honor and esteem the most and to whom i subscribe myself with all respect  his most affectionate sister e c   letter xxxviii karasbayer april        i went in a barge for about two hours down the boristhenes and landed on the shore opposite to that on which cherson stands a carriage and horses belonging to a major who commands a post about two hours drive from the place where i landed were waiting and these conveyed me to his house where i found a great dinner prepared and he gave me some excellent freshbutter made of buffalos milk this poor man has just lost a wife he loved and who was the only delight he could possess in a most disagreeable spot marshy low and where he can have no other amusement but the troops from thence i crossed the plains of perekop on which nothing but a large coarse grass grows which is burnt at certain periods of the year all this country like that between cherson and chrementchruh is called steps i should call it desert except where the posthorses are found not a tree not a habitation is to be seen but one thing which delighted me much for several miles after i had quitted cherson was the immense flocks of birds bustards which i took at a certain distance for herds of calves and millions of a small bird about the size of a pigeon cinnamon color and white droves of a kind of wild small goose cinnamon color brown and white as i went farther on these multitudes decreased not choosing i suppose to go too far from their shelter the reeds   perekop is situated upon an eminence the ditch of it seems rather calculated for the lodgment of an enemy than a defense the governor did every thing he could to detain me a few hours but as there was nothing to see i went on just without the fortress of perekop i was obliged to send one of my servants to a tartar village to get a pass the servant whom i sent whose ridiculous fears through the whole journey have not a little amused me came back as pale as death he told me the chiefs were sitting in a circle smoking that they were very ill blacklooking people i looked at the pass it was in turkish or tartarian characters i saw there two camels drawing a cart this village gave me no great opinion of tartarian cleanliness a more dirty miserable looking place i never saw the land at perekop is but six miles across from the sea of asoph or rather an arm of it called the suash to the black sea the crimea might with great ease be made an island after leaving perekop the country is exactly like what we call downs in england and the turf is like the finest green velvet the horses flew along and though there was not a horse in the stables of the posthouses i did not wait long to have them harnessed the cossacks have the furnishing of the horses and versts or milestones are put up the horses were all grasing on the plain at some distance but the instant they see their cossack come out with a little corn the whole herd surrounds him and he takes those he pleases the posts were sometimes in a deserted tartarian village and sometimes the only habitation for the stablekeeper was a hut made under ground a common habitation in this country where the sun is extremely hot and there is no shade of any sort to the left of perekop i saw several lakes about the third post it was a most beautiful sight about sunset i arrived at a tartarian village of houses or rather huts straggling in a circle without fence of any kind at different spots upon the downs large herds of horses cows and sheep were approaching with a slow pace the village making at once a simple and majestic landscape full of that peace and plenty which possessions in the primitive state of the world might have enjoyed   i stopped there and made tea that i might go on as far as i could that night you must not suppose my dear sir though i have left my coach and harp at petersburgh that i have not all my little necessaries even in a kibitka  a tinkettle in a basket holds my tea equipage and i have my english sidesaddle tied behind my carriage what i have chiefly lived upon is new milk in which i melt a little chocolate at every place i have stopped at i asked to taste the water from curiosity i have always found it perfectly good   i can easily suppose people jealous of prince potemkins merit his having the government of the tauride or commanding the troops in it may have caused the invention of a thousand illnatured lies about this new country in order to lessen the share of praise which is his due in the attainment or preservation of it but i see nothing at present which can justify the idea of the countrys being unwholesome tomorrow i shall have the honor of giving you an account of my arrival and reception here and what sort of a place it is  i remain  yours affectionately e c   letter xxxix karasbayer april        about half an hour after ten last night i ordered my servants not to have the horses put to as i intended to sleep for the only thing in which i am a bad traveller is that i cannot go to sleep while the carriage is in motion i had not an idea of getting out of it as our post was a vile tartar village in a few minutes the servants called me and said the generals nephew and son were arrived to meet me and very sorry to find i had quitted perekop as they had orders to escort me from thence i opened my carriage and saw two very pretty looking young men i told them i should certainly not think of detaining them and we set off nor did i suspect that there were any persons with me but them at  oclock i let down the forepart of my carriage to see the sun rise when to my great surprise i saw a guard of between twenty and thirty cossacks with an officer who was close to the forewheel of the carriage upon seeing me he smiled and pulled off his cap  his companions gave a most violent shriek and horses carriages and all increased their pace so that the horses in the carriage behind mine took fright ran away and running against my carriage very nearly overturned it and when i asked what occasioned this event i found my cossack escort seeing my carriage shut thought i was dead as a cossack has no idea that a person in health can travel in a carriage that is not open and the shout i had heard the smile i had seen was the surprise they had felt that the young english princess as they called me was alive as they believed it was only my corpse that was conveying to karasbazar to be buried they always ride with long pikes holding the points upwards the tartars ride with pikes but they hold the ends of theirs to the ground about six i passed the tartar town of karasbazar lying to the left  and arrived at the generals house a very good one newly built for the reception of the empress the general kokotchki his brother the governor and almost all the general officers were up and dressed upon the steps of the house i found myself in my nightcap a most tired and forlorn figure in the midst of wellpowdered men and as many stars and ribbons around me as if i had been at a birthday at st jamess i retired but rose again at one dressed and dined and looked about me this house is situated near the river karasou or blackwater which bathes the lawn before the house and runs in many windings toward the town it is narrow rapid and very clear this is a most rural and lovely spot very well calculated to give the empress a good opinion of her new kingdom for so it may be called i had a cossack chief presented to me a soldierlike fine whitehaired figure he wore a ribband and order the empress had given him set round with brillants the general told me he was sorry he was not thirty years younger as the empress had not a braver officer in her service in the evening in an amazing large hall several different bands of music played and i heard the national songs of the russian peasants which are so singular that i cannot forbear endeavoring to give you some idea of them one man stands in the midst of three or four who make a circle round him seven or eight more make a second round those a third is composed of a greater number the man in the middle of this groupe begins and when he has sung one verse the first circle accompany him and then the second till they become so animated and the noise so great that it was with difficulty the officers could stop them what is very singular they sing in parts and though the music is not much varied nor the tune fine yet as some take thirds and fifths as their ear direct in perfect harmony it is by no means unpleasing if you ask one of them why he does not sing the same note as the man before him he does not know what you mean the subjects of these ballads are hunting war or counterfeiting the gradations between soberness into intoxication and very diverting as these singers were only young russian peasants they began with great timidity but by little and little ended in a kind of wild jollity which made us all laugh very heartily the governors residence is not here but at a place called atchmechet he is only come here to meet and conduct me through the crimea he is a grave sensible mild man i am told he has conciliated the tartars to their change of sovereign very much by his gentleness and firmness to their honor i find none would stay who could not bear the idea of taking the oaths of allegiance but are gone toward mount caucasus they have repented since but it was too late all the country here is downs except the borders of valleys where rice is cultivated and what the tartars call gardens which i call orchards i cannot tell you sir with what respect and attention i am treated here and how goodnaturedly all the questions i ask are answered   there is an albanian chief here though his post is at bilaklava a seaport he is distinguished by the empress likewise for his bravery his dress differs much from the cossack it is something like the ancient romans  he is an elderly man too in a day or two i shall give you an account of the source of the karasou and take my leave of this place for batcheferai the principal town and formerly the chief residence of the khans  adieu  e c   letter xl april      yesterday i went to see the source of the river it lies in the recess of a rock which is placed between many others that line the steep sides of a valley a major ribas a very lively handsome officer of the chasseurs has drawn it for me i rode a white horse of the generals a very quiet creature but awakward not being used to a sidesaddle   i never saw a scene so lively as this visit there were near forty people on horseback the variety of dresses and colors upon the green carpet was gay and picturesque we continued going up hill to the source till we perceived the rocks but the sides of them were so steep that we were obliged to dismount and scramble down as we could this spring does not present itself like the vaucluse majestic and terrible but pretty and romantic and might be copied in a park where huge fragments of stone could be had as we returned i got off and walked beside the soldiers houses and went into some they are placed in a line on the declivity of the down as they descend to the generals house all things were very neat and orderly the old cossack chief had looked with the greatest astonishment at my riding and when i jumped down from my horse on returning home he kissed the edge of my petticoat and said something in his language which i did not comprehend but the general told me he had paid me the highest compliment imaginable viz i was worthy of being a cossack   in the evening i went in a carriage with the governor and general to karasbazar and on the road saw a mock battle between the cossacks as i was not apprised beforehand i confess the beginning of it astonished me very much i saw the cossack guard on each side the carriage spring from their stirrups with their feet on the saddle and gallop away thus with a loud shriek the general smiled at my astonished looks and told me the cossack chief had ordered an entertainment for me and desired me to get out and stand on the rising part of the down facing that where a troop of cossacks was posted which i saw advancing with a slow pace a detached cossack of the adverse party approached the troop and turning round sought his scattered companions who were in search like him of the little army they approached but not in a squadron some on the left some on the right some before some behind the troop  a shriek  a pistol fired were the signals of battle  the troop was obliged to divide in order to face an enemy that attacked it on all sides the greatest scene of hurry and agility ensued one had seized his enemy pulled him off his horse and was upon the point of stripping him a cossack if he can avoid it never kills his enemy before he has stripped him because the spoils are his property and he fears the blood should spoil the dress   when one of the prisoners party came up laid him to the ground remounted his companion and rode off with the horse of the first victor some flung themselves off their horses to tear their foe to the ground alternately they pursued or were pursuing their pikes their pistols their hangers all were made use of and when the parties were completely engaged together it was difficult to see all the adroit maneuvers that passed   i was much entertained and pleased and desired the cossack chief might have my best thanks i arrived at the town and was led to the kadis house where his wife received me and no male creature was suffered to come into the room except the interpreter and a young russian nobleman only twelve years of age this woman had a kind of turban on with some indifferent diamonds and pearls upon it her nails were dyed scarlet her face painted white and red the veins blue she appeared to me to be a little shrivelled woman of near sixty but i was told she was not above fifty she had a kind of robe and vest on and her girdle was a handkerchief embroidered with gold and a variety of colors she made me a sign to sit down and my gloves seeming to excite much uneasiness in her i took them off upon which she drew near smiled took one of my hands between here is and winked and nodded as a sign of approbation but she felt my arm up beyond the elbow half way up my shoulder winking and nodding i began to wonder where this extraordinary examination would end which it did there coffee was brought and after that roseleaves made into sweetmeats both of which the interpreter obliged me to taste the sweetmeats are introduced last and among the orientals they are a signal that the visit must end our conversation by the interpreter was not very entertaining she asked if i had a child and told me what i have been told so often before though i confess not by women tartarian and turkish women deriving the only pleasures of society from women have none of that envy which prevails in european female breasts  and among the tartarian and turkish women the extravagant encomiums which fall from the lips of a man desperately in love with a pretty woman are to be heard and are in frequent use  that would be unnecessary to repeat it a tartar house is a very slight building of one story only no chair table or piece of furniture in wood to be seen large cushions are ranged round the room on which we sat or reclined but what is extremely convenient i observed more than double the space of the room behind the wainscot which drew back in most places so that in a small room where it appears there is nothing but the cushions every necessary is to be found as the visit was at an end i curtsied and she bowed in the courtyard there was a dancer a woman accompanied in her gestures by a boy but it was impossible to see them either with pleasure or propriety she never lifted her feet off the ground but once in four minutes and then only one foot at a time and every part of her person danced except her feet i went to a mosque where several pious mussulmen were going round in a circle in the midst of the building groaning and slinging their heads almost to the ground and then up again a constant motion which with the moving round one way soon puts them into a kind of torture under which they fall to the ground and then are dragged into recesses in the mosque made on purpose to receive these boly men who sacrifice so many hours and their persons to idle pain in order to prove their devotion to mahomet they frequently pronounced allah   in one of the recesses i saw a man lying that i was told had been there without eating or drinking forty hours which abstinence is another pious act and if their courage is excessive and allah can inspire them with strength enough they endeavor in getting out of the dark and damp hole where they lay for many hours to join in the circle and begin to move but in this attempt they generally fall senseless to the ground and are carried home to recover their strength this kind of mummery inspires the people with a great reverence and esteem for those who practice it i returned home as much disgusted with this nonsense as i was displeased with the dirt of the town the mosque was shabby on the outside and gloomy within notwithstanding many lamps in it the minaret which we should call a steeple and all the other minarets i saw in the town are uncommonly light being very high and narrow a man stands at the top and calls to prayers instead of tolling bells as we do at particular hours and makes a noise to the full as agreeable   the chief traffic of this town is the leather which we call morocco of various colors yellow red green and blue it is to be had very cheap and is like satin the innumerable sheep with which these plains are covered furnish much leather which is a cheap commodity as well as the most beautiful and costly pelisses the sheep are all spotted the lambskins are beautiful and they kill the ewes to have the lambskins before the birth these have small spots and are smooth like the lightest and finest sattins as many of these little animals must be skinned to make the lining of one coat it is no wonder this is one of the most sumptuous presents the empress can make to an ambassador i wish i was rich enough to send you a pelisse made of these skins   i remain dear sir your most affectionate sister e c   letter xli batcheserai april        in my way hither i dined at the cossack chiefs post and my entertainment was truly cossack a long table for thirty people at one end a halfgrown pig roasted whole at the other a halfgrown sheep whole likewise in the middle of the table an immense tureen of curdled milk there were several sidedishes made for me and the russians as well as the cook could imagine to our taste the old warrior would fain have made me taste above thirty sorts of wine from his country the borders of the don but i contented myself with three or four and some were very good after dinner from the windows i saw a fine mock battle between the cossacks and i saw three calmoucks the ugliest fiercest looking men imaginable with their eyes set in their head inclining down to their nose and uncommonly square jawbones these calmoucks are so dexterous with bows and arrows that one killed a goose at a hundred paces and the other broke an egg at fifty the young cossack officers tried their skill with them but they were perfectly novices in comparison to them they sung and danced but their steps and their tones were equally insipid void of grace and harmony  when a cossack is sick he drinks sour milk for a few days and that is the only remedy the cossacks have for fevers   at night i lodged at a house that had belonged to a noble tartar where there is a russian post with about twelve hundred of the finest men i ever saw and uncommonly tall a tartarian house has always another building at a little distance from it for the convenience of travelers or strangers whom the noble tartar always treats with the greatest hospitality here the general parted from us i proceeded in the governors carriage with him thus far the rest of our company went to see kaffa or theodosia i go to meet them tomorrow at a place called mangouss we had only two cossacks with us as the general to please the tartars never is escorted by a military party batchescrai is situated in so steep a valley that some of the hanging pieces of rock seem ready to fall and crush the houses about a mile from the town on the left i saw a troop of welldressed tartars there were above a hundred on horseback the kaimakan that word means the khans first minister  a person called him cream of tartar  which i fearing he should be told of turned into the cream of the tartars  which he said was no wonder as he was so  was at the head of this company who were come out to meet and escort us but i who did not know this asked the governor if there was a russian post here which there is above the town of a thousand men there are five thousand tartar inhabitants here i do not believe there was a man left in his house the streets being lined with tartarian men on each side their countenances were very singular most of them kept their eyes fixed on the ground as we passed but some just looked up and as if they were afraid of seeing a womans face uncovered hastily cast their eyes downward again some diverted at the novelty looked and laughed very much  there is a great trade here of blades for swords hangers and knives  i am assured many made here are not to be distinguished from those of damascus   the khans palace is an irregular building the greatest part of it is one floor raised upon pillars of wood painted and gilt in a fanciful and lively manner the arch or last doorway has fine proportions a large inscription in gilt letters is the chief ornament  i am told it was perfectly in ruins but the governor has had it repaired new gilt and painted for the empresss reception court within court and garden within garden make a variety of apartments where the khan walked from his own residence to the harem harem means that apartment where the women reside which is always a separate building from that which the master inhabits  and sisters mothers wives or mistresses all inhabit the harem   which is spacious and higher than the other buildings what i thought pretty enough was that several of the square places under his apartment were paved with marble and have in the center fountains which play constantly my room is a square of more than forty feet having two rows of windows one above the other on three sides and it was with difficulty i found a place to have my bed put up in   i never saw such a variety of colors  different colored gold and silver mixed together the kaimakan and two other principal tartars supped with us and i find nothing can exceed the ignorance and simplicity of these people the kaimakan is the khans first minister he is totally ignorant of the geography of his own country and says that england and petersburgh are the same thing i am to dine with his sister tomorrow she is married to a rich tartar who has given a certain yearly sum to possess solely the profits of the soap mines for among the excellent productions of this peninsula there is a mine of earth exactly like soap and reckoned very good for the skin the turkish women consume a great quantity of it at constantinople and i am told this tartar makes an immense income from it i saw from the windows a kind of dome which raised my curiosity and i am told it is a monument built to the memory of a christian wife which the khan loved so tenderly that he was inconsolable for her loss and that he had placed it there that he might have the satisfaction of looking at the building which contained her remains many buildings such as baths summerhouses etc are in ruins near batcheserai i went into one bath it was circular having white marble on the inside with niches for the bathers to sit in which we have no idea of cold bathing is unknown in turkey and tartary   this tartar khan must have had a soul worthy of being loved by a christian wife i think   adieu for the present dear sir e c  p s wild asparagus grows in great plenty all over the peninsula and a wild kind of horseradish of an enormous size and the strongest and best flavoured i ever tasted the root is as long and as big as the stoutest leg you ever saw     letter xlii sevastopole april         the last time i wrote i was at batcheserai since which i have been at another russian post at the place where the ancient town of krim stood of which there is not a vestige left a general schlikt commands a fine regiment of russian cavalry there and lodges in an outer building belonging to a good house prepared for the empress this general fought very valiantly in the polish confederacy against the russians and his bravery induced the empress to take him into her service he showed me among his horses a fine chestnut or rather goldcoloured arabian so beautiful an animal i never before saw i must not forget to tell you that i went as i told you i should to dine with the kaimakans sister whose harem with her husbands house is situated in a very romantic manner at the foot of some very extraordinary rocks from which issue many clear springs that supply the houses and her bath with perpetual fresh water there is a strange appearance on the summit of those rocks places where immense cables have certainly passed and been tied the tartarians insist upon it that the sea once lay at the foot of them and ships were fastened to them we dined in the husbands apartment a very dirty shabby place for so rich a gentleman  tartarian cookery consists in much grease and honey after dinner the kaimakan walked across a yard and i was bid to follow i did so into another court where four women and some young girls met us and last of all his sister her dress was magnificent particularly her girdle in the front of which were two circles like bracelet lockets the centers of them contained two fine emeralds she offered me a large goblet which held two quarts of sherbet an indifferent kind of lemonade after that coffee and last of all sweetmeats we conversed very well by signs she was neither old nor ugly but how is it possible to judge of a countenance hid under bad painting and eyebrows which join into one straight line drawn across the nose my gloves gave her the same uneasy appearance i had seen in the other tartarian woman so i pulled them off but she was not so curious as the other and it seemed to be a high entertainment to her brother to see us converse by signs i wore a chemise with two rows of very fie lace at the bosom which i thought would surprise her but lace and every magnificence which is not gold silver pearls or diamonds i am told passes unnoticed  linen is not much in use their shifts and the shirts of the men are generally made of very thin silk or silk mixed with cotton which is seldom changed but the very srequent use of baths makes this custom less loathsome than it would otherwise be when she had quitted the harem her brother staid behind a little and afterward came up to me kissed the bottom of my gown and presented me a very beautiful handkerchief of his sisters embroidery which the governor told me i must accept i desired the kaimakan to thank her and tell her i would keep it for her sake it is of muslin the borders embroidered with different colored silks and gold and what i cannot comprehend both sides are the same   i have been at soudak where the foundations yet remain of a very large town which was rebuilt by the genoese on the descent of steep rocks when you get to the summit of these you look down to the sea and there are the remains of a chapel where a granite pillar is so placed that the first shake it receives it must fall perpendicularly into it this town must have been inaccessible to a fleet and from the position of the fortifications and outposts of which there are remains must have been extremely well defended from the inhabitants of the interior part of the country   to the left of the town there is a fine harbor it is upon this southern part of the peninsula that vines are cultivated and grow wild in great abundance at present only a few private people there have vineyards of their own there is little good wine made and the empress has indeed a frenchman who seems to care only about the strength of the wine being sufficient to make brandy which he distills in great quantities he is settled at soudak at present and probably will make a great fortune but not teach the culture of vines to the russians from soudak i went to atchmetchet the residence of the governor it is prettily situated on a rising ground not far from the valley which borders the river salguir and the soil on the borders of this river is exactly like the black mould of our kitchen gardens and extremely fertile the governors house is comfortable and the barracks with the other buildings erected by the russians make a good appearance i saw some people coursing with tartarian greyhounds which are remarkably tall and reckoned very good the governor showed me likewise a pretty collection of stuffed birds and other preservations with stones minerals the produce of the crimea but the fine turf the excellent soil the orchards the climate are sufficient inducements to be partial to this country one very particular thing i took notice of was a small pink flower that spread like network over the turf  and asking what it was found they were peachtrees which when very young being nipped by the sheep grow into little bushes  i was really sorry to quit the governor grave steady and cold in his manner there was a dignity in it which made his extreme attention and respect for me the more acceptable nor can i say that he forgot any thing that could make me take a true impression of the country or a favorable one of the russian officers who have given me several maps and every information i dould desire  i wish it may ever be in my power to show him in my country any marks of the sense i have of his goodness  i have promised to take a barrel of wine belonging to mr de bullakos the russian minister at the port  and a root of horseradish from him   i find a thirtysix gun frigate under the disguise of a merchantship had been fitted out for me and had been ready above a fortnight the governor accompanied me to this place which the description of would be too long for this letter so i shall take my leave of you for the present only observing that i have a whole house to myself where the architecture and furniture are english it belonged to an admiral mackenzie who is just dead  i crossed an arm of the sea in the comte de wynowitchs barge to arrive here  and upon landing at the bottom of a flight of several steps i was surprised by two or three voices who said we are your countrymen my lady  and in fact there are several of my countrymen as captains or lieutenants in this navy the admirals house is just above this landingplace and makes a fine appearance   adieu dear sir i remain your affectionate e c   letter lxiii dear sir i should be very glad you could see this place  from the singularity of the coast the harbor is unlike any other i ever saw it is a long creek that is formed by the black sea between two ridges of land so high that the glory of catherine one of the largest ships in the russian navy which is at anchor here cannot be seen as the shore is above the pendant  the water is so deep that this ship touches the land  all the fleets in europe would be safe from storms or enemies in these creeks or harbors for there are many batteries at the entrance of them on one side would be sufficient effectually to destroy any ships that would venture in and placed toward the sea must even prevent the entrance of a fleet the comte de wynowitch commands here and has a little farm at inkerman which must have once been a very considerable and extraordinary town at present the only remains of it are rooms hewn out of the rock here is a large chapel the pillars and altars of which are extremely curious the stone is whitish and not unlike marble i climbed up a staircase and crept into and out of very extraordinary spaces large and commodious i entered at the bottom of these singular habitations and like a chimneysweeper came out at the top and though it cost me not a little trouble in turning and climbing up so high i had no idea i had mounted so much till on looking about me i turned quite giddy in seeing the bay of inkerman and all the black sea at least two hundred and fifty feet beneath the place where i stood though i have not been absolutely all over this peninsula i think i am perfectly acquainted with it and though it is a new acquaintance to me i sincerely wish it to be peopled by the industrious who may restore to it that commerce and opulence which the natural productions of it demand from the hand of man can any rational being dear sir see nature without the least assistance from art in all her grace and beauty stretching out her liberal hand to industry and not wish to do her justice yes i confess i wish to see a colony of honest english families here establishing manufactures such as england produces and returning the produce of this country to ours establishing a fair and free trade from hence and teaching industry and honesty to the insidious but oppressed greeks in their islands  waking the indolent turk from his gilded slumbers and carrying fair liberty in her swelling sails as she passes through the archipelago and the mediterranean to our dangerous happily for us our dangerous coast  this is no visionary or poetical figure  it is the honest wish of one who considers all mankind as one family and looking upon them as such wishes them to be united for the common good excluding from nations all selfish and monopolizing views  i am in possession of several maps of this country drawn and colored very well which i shall have the honor of showing you when i see you i take my leave at present and remain  your most obliged and affectionate e c   letter xliv we set out the day before yesterday to see a most beautiful valley called baydar but when we had gone a considerable way across the mountains in carriages the comte de wynowitch told me that we were fiveandtwenty miles from the place we were going to and that we must take the cossack horses of which we had five with us and ride them as i was not apprised of this i had not brought my sidesaddle with me i told him it was impossible for me to ride astride and the cossack saddles i could not sit upon so we returned back to sevastopole we set out again yesterday for the valley of baydar and at the same place where we had left the carriages the day before i had my sidesaddle put upon the tallest of the cossack horses and after going about twelve miles among the most beautiful mountains imaginable a small valley appeared a little to the right of us infinitely pretty we crossed that and went through a thick wood which led to the valley of baydar a most enchanting and magnificent spot intended by nature for some industrious and happy nation to enjoy in peace a few tartar villages lessen the wildness of the scene but in such a place the meadow part should be covered with herds and the mountainous with sheep when we were come into this valley we found the mountains to the left less high and less rocky than those to the right which run in a line with those to soudak and form the coast when we were in the valley we could not have imagined that we were so near the sea as the rocks which are above it are covered with wood of every sort wild vine pomegranate and many sweet shrubs i rode up to an elevation which is for as much as i can guess the center of the valley and sat there with my companions contemplating the beautiful scene the valley is above twenty miles long wide enough to form it into a graceful oval  two or three small rivers run through it and there are fine clear springs in every village the albanian colonel who had been presented to me at karasbasar met us with his son and i shall never forget their appearance when they heard us coming they got off their horses i saw the son first a tall lad about thirteen years old in a kind of roman warriors dress with rows of gold like armor all down the fore part of the vest  he had a helmet on  as i was not apprised of this i had no idea what the vision was that presented itself till i saw the father they were both leading their horses and came to me to insist on my dining at balaklava on my way home which i did and if i had not been obliged to quit this country in a ship i should certainly have bribed my cossack to have sold his horse to me the animal was so excellent a galloper that i was obliged several times to stop till the rest of the company came up   the cossacks sir are extremely proud of their horses as they say since your immortal uncle the king of prussia first rode one he never has in time of war made use of any other than a horse from the borders of the don i do not know who was most pleased the cossack that lent me his horse or i who rode him we turned to the left to go to the colonels house and winding round some beautiful rocks the descent of which was gentle we saw before us the harbor of balaklava the albanian chief had ranged his regiment in one straight line at the foot of the rocks to the left facing the sea on the edge of which his house stood i can conceive nothing so singular to a regular corpse as the sight of an albanian troop they had firelocks of every country each man is at liberty to dress and arm himself as he pleases oriental and italian poniards with the oddest pistols in the world were stuck in their girdles some had hats others caps and helmets upon their heads gregorio chapone the colonel desired i might be told they were alert spirited and brave his post indeed was of infinite consequence and he was placed there on that account opinions were unanimous concerning his military reputation the albanians wear short jackets with two three or four rows of fillagree buttons an ornament they like much and i thought them pretty the colonels wife and several other women received me at the door and we conversed by interpreters there were several turkish boats in the harbor but there was a line on the shore marked with fires which they were not permitted to pass the turks came to sell oranges and every precaution is taken to prevent their communicating the plague so that although they may come on shore they are obliged to heap their oranges within the space allotted to them and bargain at a distance we were above thirty people at table and i returned with my company to sevastopole in carriages i called just now the turkish vessels boats but i am told they are ships a most dangerous sort of conveyance for men or merchandise in my opinion long narrow and topheavy the frigate prepared for me seems a good ship the three seaofficers who go with me have never been at constantinople we go as merchants for by a treaty between the forte and russia trading vessels may come from the black sea into the canal of constantinople but not men of war we have a greek pilot on board who is to steer us safe please heaven i am told we are not to be much more than two days in our passage but i have told my company i expect to be seven why i have chosen the number seven i cannot guess but i can give no other reason to you than that i have long resolved in my mind to expect a triple dose of any bitter draught i am obliged to swallow and i assure you sir in this method of calculating events i shall not be so often disappointed as i have been in life when the natural cheerfulness of my mind made me always foresee prosperous gales i shall write to you next from the canal whence i hope to afford you some entertainment there and every where else sir i am with all gratitude respect and esteem  your most affectionate and ever attached sister e c  p s you may think me very odd in saying a voyage is a bitter draught to me you will be much more surprised when i tell you i hate traveling but you know why i travel   and as i do i am determined to see that place where the capital of the world ought to be placed when i am sick at sea i shall think of that and that according to a vulgar english saying the longest way about is the nearest way home     letter xlv palais de france pera april  0      i am safely arrived dear sir and hasten to inform you how i made my voyage i set out the   th at five in the morning mr de wynowitch took me out of the harbor in a small frigate and after seeing me safe in my cabin took leave i gave him many thanks for the attentions he had paid me and wished him an opportunity of signalizing his courage at sea which seemed to be the thing he had most at heart he gave me a royal salute and as his guns fired we set sail with a fair wind we had not been two days at sea before we were becalmed and we lay three days and three nights wishing for wind which came on at last very fresh with rain it was a sidewind the rain prevented us from seeing the turkish shore sometimes and sometimes we could see it very distinctly but we ran thus fourandtwenty hours to the left without seeing the objects that precede the entrance of the canal on the seventh day the greek pilot the only person on board who had ever been at constantinople was dead drunk and incapable of speaking much less of steering the ship the officers were greatly alarmed and there was a long consultation between them and the rest of the company i luckily had a small map of the black sea and the entrance of the canal which alone was our guide as to me i had dressed myself in a riding habit and had a small box in one hand an umbrella in the other and had told the captain i was determined to get into the boat and land on the turkish shore rather than lose sight of the canal or sail into it without being quite sure that we were right there is a large rock on the european shore which is so far distant from it that unless a map or pilot directs the mariner he must infallibly take it for the entrance of the bosphorus and several hundreds of turkish boats are wrecked upon it yearly  the gentlemen and officers stood all the morning upon deck watching the shore we had ran then above ninety leagues to the left always seeing land which was owing to the currents which had taken our ship during the three days calm so much more to the right as to me i stood between decks till the captain told me to come and look at a village church or something it was a turkish minaret and a few moments afterward we saw that rock i dreaded so much upon which there are about a thousand turkish vessels that perish constantly every year as the turks forget as they leave it to the left in coming out they must leave it to the right in going in perhaps they are like an irish acquaintance of mine who going up a very steep hill in a carriage to pay a visit could never be made to understand that he was to go down the hill in returning the only argument he made use of was that as the road was the same he must necessarily go up the hill having done so in going over that same road   to return to my voyage sir you may judge how infinitely comfortable i felt in being at anchor about six in the evening escaped from all the dangers i had been threatened with upon the black sea and the ugly circumstance that attended us when we were about to take our leave of it i had so many birds among which was a most beautiful milkwhite small heron that had taken refuge in the ship that my cabin looked like a birdshop we supped on board very comfortably and i took some hours rest and the next morning we put ourselves in the longboat and were rowed to mr de bukalows house at bouyukdere but he was at pera so we were rowed by a turkish boat down to pera the bosphorus takes a sudden turn at bouyukdere  i refer you to mr gibbon sir for his account of the singular situation of constantinople my pen will repeat feebly what he has described in language majestic as the subject deserves but i am certain no landscape can amuse or please in comparison with the varied view which the borders of this famed straight compose rocks verdure ancient castles built on the summit of the hills by the genoese  modern kiosks kiosk means a summer house with blinds all round  minarets and large platanetrees rising promiscuous in the valleys  large meadows  multitudes of people and boats swarming on the shore and on the water and what was particular nothing to be seen like a formal french garden the turks have so great a respect for natural beauties that if they must build a house where a tree stands they leave a large hole for the tree to pass through and increase in size they think the branches of it the prettiest ornament for the top of the house in truth sir contrast a chimney to a beautiful foliage and judge if they are right or wrong the coast is so safe that a large fleet of turkish vessels is to be seen in every creek masts of which are intermingled with the trees and a graceful confusion and variety make this living picture the most poignant scene i ever beheld  judge of mr de bukalows surprise when he had opened his letters and read my name he had scarcely time to offer me his services when mr de choiseuls people came and claimed me from their master who had been prepared for three weeks before my arrival by mr de segur at petersburgh and i confess from the character i had heard of him i was not at all sorry that he claimed my society as his droit  and now i have heard him speak i am extremely glad that i am to profit by his conversation and company both of which are as much to be desired as talents and politeness can make them adieu for today i am sunburned tired but likewise pleased beyond measure  yes sir pleased to be here and to call myself by the honored name of  your affectionate sister e c   letter xlvi april         i have a double satisfaction in being au palais de france mr de choiseul has been sick these six months and never been out but his spirits are better and upon my account he has opened his house and goes out a little which cannot fail to do him good he has some artists with him whose pencils he has employed to collect all the finest drawings colored of the finest ruins that exist either in europe or asia where an artist could venture monsieur casas one of them has been plundered by arabs several times but his beautiful and accurate drawings will gain him immortal honor the comte de choiseuls collection is perhaps the only thing in the world of the kind and he means when he returns to paris to have all the ruins and temples executed in plaster of paris or some materials which will copy the marble in some models to be placed in a gallery upon tables   the ambassador assures me the most ancient and finest amphitheatre in the world is at pola in istria three days fail southeast of venice it stands near the port and in good preservation the temple of augustus and triumphal arch both of the corinthian order belonging to the same town are fine monuments of antiquity  mr casas has taken drawings of them at night when we have no visitors and all the ambassadors business is done he comes into my room followed by mr casas and a few more people with large portefeuilles full of these most beautiful drawings and we pass three or four hours looking over them and conversing upon topics which are my savourites it is a singular instance of good taste in a frenchman to have given himself up ten years ago to the finding and collecting all that is really best worthy of record as to the ancient architecture mr de choiseuls voyage pittoresque de la greece and when he was but twoandtwenty taking the most perilous journeys to find out new antiquities if i may so call them must endear him to all lovers of the fine arts  but now that his judgment is formed and that he sits down to collect all his materials together i doubt not the work he is about to publish which is an addition to the first will be the most perfect thing of the kind existing you will wonder that i do not begin this letter by giving you a magnificent account of the view from my windows but my eyes and ears both are so much better pleased within than without doors that i must first give you an account of what passes there mr de choiseul beside being a very fine scholar is a very lively and polite man and has none of that kind of most odious attention which young frenchmen display thinking it necessary to say fine things to or admire ladies upon the slightest acquaintance he has the dignity of the vieille cour with the ease of modern manners and if i was the empress of russia he could not treat me with more respect no if i was his sister with more regard his house is like a very fine french hotel at paris built with good stone and wood rare materials here where every house is in the construction like a stage and composed of as slight materials from some of the windows i look across that harbor called the golden horn by the ancients and from others can see the sea of marmora the islands therein and part of the seraglio  from mine i saw yesterday the sultan sitting on a silver sofa while his boats and many of the people who were to accompany him were lining the banks of the garden a magnificent sight as they are of a light shape gilt and painted very beautifully we had a large telescope and saw the ottoman solendour very distinctly the sultan dies his beard black to give himself a young look  and he is known at a considerable distance by that which contrasts singularly with his face that is extremely livid and pale the kiosk which contained him and his silver sofa was not very large and like a hundred others to be seen on the canal it is strange sir how words gain in other countries a signification different from the meaning they possess in their own serail or seraglio is generally understood as the habitation or rather the confinement of women here it is the sultans residence it cannot be called his palace for the kiosks gardens courts walls stables are so mixed that it is many houses in many gardens  the streets both of pera and constantinople are so narrow that few of them admit of a carriage  the windows of every story project over those under them so that at the upper people may shake hands sometimes across the street no turk of any consequence makes a visit if it is only four doors from his own but on horseback and on my arrival here i saw one who landed in a boat and had a fine gray horse led by four men that went a long way round which he mounted gravely to get off in a few moments  as to women as many if not more than men are to be seen in the streets  but they look like walking mummies a large loose robe of dark green cloth covers them from the neck to the ground over that a large piece of muslin which wraps the shoulders and the arms another which goes over the head and eyes judge sir if all these coverings do not confound all shape or air so much that men or women princesses and slaves may be concealed under them i think i never saw a country where women may enjoy so much liberty and free from all reproach as in turkey a turkish husband that sees a pair of slippers at the door of his harem must not enter his respect for the sex prevents him from intruding when a stranger is there upon a visit how easy then is it for men to visit and pass for women if i was to walk about the streets here i would certainly wear the same dress for the turkish women call others names when they meet them with their faces uncovered when i go out i have the ambassadors sedanchair which is like mine in london only gilt and varnished like a french coach and six turks carry it as they fancy it impossible that two or four men can carry one two janissaries walk before with high fur caps on the ambassadors here have all janissaries as guards allowed them by the port thank heaven i have but a little way to go in this pomp and fearing every moment the turks should fling me down they are so awkward for the platform where people land and embark from and to pera is not far from this house   there the ambassadors boat waits for us and we row out boats here are to be hired as hackneycoaches are in london and all very beautifully carved most of them with some gilding the shape of these boats is light and beautiful and the turks row very well which is a thing quite incompatible with the idleness visible in all ranks of people i saw a turk the other day lying on cushions striking slowly an iron which he was shaping into an horseshoe his pipe in his mouth all the time  nay among the higher order of turks there is an invention which saves them the trouble of holding the pipe two small wheels are fixed on each side the bowl of the pipe and thus the smoaker has only to puff away or let the pipe rest upon his under lip while he moves his head as he pleases perhaps sir it is lucky for europe that the turks are idle and ignorant the immense power this empire might have were it peopled by the industrious and ambitious would make it the mistress of the world at present it only serves as a dead wall to intercept the commerce and battles which other powers might create one another   the quiet stupid turk will sit a whole day by the side of the canal looking at flying kites or childrens boats  and i saw one who was enjoying the shade of an immense platanetree  his eyes fixed on a kind of bottle diverted by the noise and motion of it while the stream kept it in constant motion how the business of the nation goes on at all i cannot guess for the cabinet is composed generally of ignorant mercenaries the visir was a watercarrier to hassan bey the capitan pacha or highadmiral hassan himself was only a servant at algiers places are obtained at the port by intrigue each placeman each sultaness has her creatures and plots for placing them and versailles has not more intricate intrigue than the port a rebellious bashaw raises troops and lives in open defiance of the sovereign who invested him with his authority there is one at this moment at the head of forty thousand men in albany who might with the greatest ease make himself king of a large country  his name is masmoud not above thirty years of age  and he succeeded his father in the government which he now holds in defiance of the port is it to be wondered at if the turk is a predestinarian in most things since it is neither birth or abilities that can give him place or power  nor is there generally any visible just reason why heads are struck off there is a recent example here proving that the confidence of the sultan is not the surest way to escape a sudden and unexpected death one petraki a greek a kind of banker to the court by his frequent access to achmet raised the jealousy of the ministry who upon various pretenses one day in council desired petrakis head might fall   the sultan whose private reasons for keeping it on were infinitely better than those petrakis enemies had alleged was extremely averse to such a thing but the capitan pacha and his friends were bold enough to declare they would not stir out of the council till achmet had signed the order which he did with the tears streaming down his cheeks upon such occasions there is a person whose place it is to go to the house of the unfortunate dead man and examine the papers of any person who in his lifetime had dealings with the cabinet   the man found some which he sealed up with four large seals and desired they might be delivered into the sultans own hands very much alarmed at having seen them for petraki was the private agent of the sultan who received the money which petraki seemed only to receive for places which his interest procured and petrakis accounts were so regularly kept that the money he delivered with the dates and the places were registered   the vile low intrigues of the ministers here are not to be imagined the sultan has the highest opinion of the sense and courage of the capitan pacha when he quits constantinople the sovereign thinks his capital in danger but i find all ranks of people agree in his having introduced a better police for the town than hitherto existed at a fire some janissaries not doing their duty properly he had four of them flung into it pour encourager les autres as voltaire has observed upon another occasion he is always accompanied by a lion who follows him like a dog the other day he suffered him to accompany him to the divau but the ministers were so terrified that some jumped out of the windows one was near breaking his neck in flying down stairs and the high admiral and his lion were left to settle the councils of the day together   i think it a lucky thing for the ambassadors that the turks neither pay nor receive visits  could any thing be so terrible as the society of the most ignorant and uninformed men upon earth  you know i suppose that they were always persuaded it was impossible for a russian fleet to come to constantinople by any other sea than the black sea and though the french endeavored to prove to them by maps the passage of their enemies to the archipelago till the turkish fleet was engaged with the russian in the bay of tchesme no turk would believe the possibility of the thing   i am told here that a mr bouverie who desired to see constantinople came and looked at it from the frigate he was in  but never landed  i really do not think he was to blame constantinople and the entrance of the bosphorus by the sea of marmora is the most majestic magnificent graceful and lively scene the most luxuriant imagination can desire to behold  it was no wonder constantine chose it for the seat of empire nature has composed of earth and water such a landscape that taste unassisted by ambitious reflections would naturally desire to give the picture living graces but i who am apt to suppose whatever is in possibility to exist often place along the shore petersburgh paris london moscow amsterdam and all the great towns i have seen separate from each other and there is full room enough here i will end my suppositions and think it better that man has done so little where nature has done so much  et que tout est comme il doit etre who ought with more justice to think so i who have you for my friend and brother but lest you should not be of the same opinion as to the length of this letter i will now take my leave and assure you i remain at all times and places  your affectionate e c   letter xlvii the harbor called the golden horn which separates pera and constantinople has a singularity i wish much to have explained to me all the filth and rubbish of both towns are constantly flung into it customhouses barracks storehouses the dockyard all these are placed on the borders of it whole dunghills are swept into it no measures for keeping it clean are taken no quays are formed by men yet by the strength or variety of currents or some other natural cause this port is always clean and deep enough to admit of the entrance of the largest merchantmen which like as in all the other harbors in the canal may be hooked on close to the shore  this harbor grows narrower as it meets the fresh water and ends at last in a small rivulet but where it is just wide enough to have the appearance of a small river the french some time past have dammed the fresh water up making of it square pieces of water to imitate those of marly here kiosks and trees have been placed in great regularity and it is here that on a friday turks in groupes are to be seen dining taking coffee or smoking upon carpets spread under the shade of the immense and lofty platane i can give you no other idea of the size of some of these beautiful trees but by telling you it corresponds to the gigantic landscape of which they make the finest ornament yes my dear sir the largest oaks you can have seen would look set down by these as little broomsticks women in groupes likewise apart from the men meet here but when they come to these places of which there are a great number near constantinople they hire what they imagine to be coaches called arabats  a vile machine like a covered cart with rows of benches in the inside there are no springs to them and one day in a valley called l echelle du grand seigneur i got into one but chose rather to get out and walk six miles than be jolted unmercifully all the ambassadors since my arrival here have given balls and dinners madame dherbert the imperial ministers wife is lively and i see her often the dutch ambassadors wife is a very good woman and i am very comfortable thinking people extremely good to me to answer the million of questions i ask there is but one person here to whom i never apply about any thing for i observe a shifted smile upon every persons countenance when he opens his lips his long residence here has given the other   so if his details to the  cabinet are as true as those in society  the business of the nation will go on admirably   by the by sir i forgot to tell you i found sir richard worsley here who has traveled much with a person to take views for him he showed me a colored drawing of the castle of otranto which said he i intend to present to mr w  and pray sir says i are you an acquaintance of his no upon which i hesitated not to ask him for it that i as a friend of w  s may have the pleasure of giving it to him he entreated me to accept of some egyptian pebbles as knife handles  and i obtained for him a permission to go in the frigate that brought me hither to the crimea   i am told there is an english merchant here extremely offended at my loding au palais de france and says if sir r ainsties house was not good enough for me he had a new house which he would have emptied and let me have had it all to myself  it is an affront to the nation he says  a peeress of england to lodge at the french ambassadors  the english merchants are very good to me i believe they guess the respect and esteem i have for them   mr de bukalow sent me a few days past one of merlins finest pianofortes to remain here as long as i stay and mr de choiseul found out a pedalharp somewhere and had it set in my room  i believe people think it so singular a thing for a lady to come here without being obliged as a ministers wife that they endeavor to keep me as long as they can mr dherbert told me   i repeat this to you sir that you may know at least that   think me not quite unworthy of your esteem and friendship  and you will find i prize both beyond those of every other person being  your affectionate e c   letter xlviii dear sir it would seem that every thing in nature which has remarkable advantages has likewise some misfortunes attending it that counterbalance the good so as to reduce the portion of happiness to a level for mankind this beautiful enchanting country the climate the objects the situation of it make it an earthly paradise but the plague  but earthquakes  what terrifying subjects to make the thinking part fly it for ever if things and persons may be compared it is not a beautiful woman who is handsomer than most of her sex with accomplishments equal to her beauty but whom the world her very inmates envy those advantages  and might not the base passions that surround her frighten her greatest admirers from trusting to her bewitching charms   i was led to this comparison by talking about the grecian islands which i mean to visit  they are all i am told volcanos some of them have disappeared and those who have furnished greece with their men of greatest genius only like them are to be found in books and by an adventure which happened to us yesterday as we embarked at tophana there are small platforms of wood fixed on to the edge of the water where people leave or take boats as we arrived a boat full of turks landed with a corpse seemingly in great haste and as they passed touched mons de choiseul and me he started and i asked him what was the matter  he told me he was sure it was a man dead of the plague and in truth it was so judge how disagreeable to one who had not been out for six months   i have been to see the mosque of st sophia with two others the dome of st sophia is extremely large and well worth seeing but some of the finest pillars are set topsyturvy or have capitals of turkish architecture in these holy temples neither the beautiful statues belonging to pagan times nor the costly ornaments of modern rome are to be seen some shabby lamps hung irregularly are the only expense the mahometans permit themselves as a proof of their respect for the deity or his prophet i went and sat some time up stairs to look down into the body of the temple  i saw several turks and women kneeling and seemingly praying with great devotion mosques are constantly open and i could not help reflecting that their mode of worship is extremely convenient for the carrying on a plot of any sort a figure wrapped up like a mummy can easily kneel down by another without being suspected and mutter in a whisper any sort of thing the longer the conversation lasts the more edified a silent observer may be no particular hour for divine service or person to officiate is appointed it is true that at certain hours of the day men are seen on the minarets or steeples bawling and hallooing to all good mussulmen that it is the hour appointed for prayer but they follow their own convenience or devout humor and say their prayers not only when but where they choose  for i have seen several turks in the most public and noisy places about constantinople kneeling and praying without being the least deranged or disturbed by the variety of objects or noises that surrounded or passed by them in order to procure me a sight of the mosques the ambassador was obliged to apply for a permission the port graciously gave one in which i had leave to see seventyfive the burial places for the dead are very numerous and in a manner surround constantinople and pera forming very shady romantic walks as the trees and gravestones are huddled together in a confused manner both presenting great variety to those who ramble among them each gravestone is crowned with a turban the form of which shows the employment or quality of the corpse when living  i shall send you a drawing that will give you some idea of them   i can give you no just idea of the beauty of the trees which particularly in these burial places are never touched therefore spread and grow in the most luxuriant and graceful disorder there are no bounds set or fences to restrain or design the form of these burial places some extend a mile or two and if it was not for one disagreeable reflection would be as pleasant to a foreigner as to a turk but when we consider that it is pestiferated earth we tread on that every new made grave may contain a body rotting with the plague and the slight manner in which it is covered with earth from the hurry with which it is thrown in we cannot with reason stay therein turks are predestinarians and therefore imagine it is fate and not the care which is taken in christian houses that prevents them from dying of this horrid disorder therefore walk unconcerned under the dangerous shade of the trees that hang over their deceased neighbors   constantinople is almost surrounded by a very high wall turreted and flanked by large square towers built by the greek emperors  the style of architecture exactly like that of warwick and berkeley castle but many of the square towers which serve as gateways are mouldering away under the negligence of the turks most of whom believe in an ancient prophecy which announces that the time is near when the empress of russia is to make her public and triumphal entry through one of these towers as empress of greece into constantinople many have made up their minds and taken their measures to transport themselves across the bosphorus into asia nay some go so far as to point to the very identical gateway through which she is to proceed to some nations it would be very agreeable that the turkish empire was to be driven from a situation which seems by nature formed as an universal passage for trading nations which the inactivity of the turks has too long obstructed and it is to be wished by all those who bear any respect to the best monuments of sculpture that athens and all it yet contains might not by mohammedan ignorance be entirely destroyed at present ruins that would adorn a virtuosos cabinet are daily burnt into lime by the turks and pieces of exquisite workmanship stuck into a wall or fountain there remains but a very little of that pillar that once probably was a fine ornament to the atmeidan or market for horses  i have seen likewise the sultan go in ceremony to prayers  from the gate of the seraglio to the door of the mosque  it was but a few paces he was preceded by a double row of janissaries to the amount of about an hundred and fifty with other attendants he was mounted on a gray horse led by two persons and followed by his son a sickly looking child sitting on a milkwhite horse over his head was held a green umbrella the ribs of which were set with diamonds you must know diamonds are the things which the turks are most fond of while the port delays erecting batteries upon the most important posts under the pretense of wanting money to pay for the pieces and work necessary for the defense of the empire the jewellers cannot find diamonds enough to supply the demands of the harem for which they are paid ready money it is the quantity and not the quality of this stone which they prize scarcely any other than rose diamonds are to be seen here   i have been with a large party to see the captain pachas wife but as this letter will not contain an account of this curious visit i must defer my account of it to the next believe me sir with the truest esteem and affection  your faithful friend and sister e c   letter xlix palais de france pera may        dear sir monsieur de choiseul proposed to the ambassadors wives and me to go and see the capitan pachas country seat accordingly we set out with several carriages and about a league from constantinople toward romelia we arrived there the house and plantations about it are new and irregular the ambassadors and the rest of the male party were suffered to walk in the garden but the ministers wives and myself were shown into a separate building from the house where the ground floor was made to contain a great quantity of water and looked like a large clean cistern we then were led up stairs and upon the landingplace which was circular the doors of several rooms were open in some there was nothing to be seen in others two or three women sitting close together in one a pretty young woman with a great quantity of jewels on her turban was sitting almost in the lap of a frightful negro woman we were told she was the capitan pachas sisterinlaw she looked at us with much surprise and at last with great fear threw herself into the arms of the black woman as if to hide herself we were called away into a larger room than any we had seen where the capitan pachas wife a middleaged woman dressed with great magnificence received us with much politeness many women were with her and she had by her a little girl dressed as magnificently as herself her adopted child she made an excuse for not receiving us at the door as she was dining with her husband when we arrived coffee sherbet and sweetmeats were offered and we hastened to take our leave as our cavaliers were cooling their heels in the garden  you can conceive nothing so neat and clean to all appearance as the interior of this harem the floors and passages are covered with matting of a close and strong kind the color of the straw or reeds with which they are made is a pale straw the rooms had no other furniture than the cushions which lined the whole room and those with the curtains were of white linen as the turks never come into the room either men or women with the slippers they walk abroad with there is not a speck of sand or dirt within doors i am femmelette enough to have taken particular notice of the dress which if female envy did not spoil every thing in the world of women would be graceful it consists of a petticoat and vest over which is worn a robe with short sleeves the one belonging to the lady of the house was of satin embroidered richly with the finest colors gold and diamonds  a girdle under that with two circles of jewels in front and from this girdle hangs an embroidered handkerchief  a turban with a profusion of diamonds and pearls seemed to weigh this ladys head down but what spoiled the whole was a piece of ermine that probably was originally only a cape but each woman increasing the size of it in order to be more magnificent than her neighbor they now have it like a great square plaster that comes down to the hips and these simple ignorant beings do not see that it disfigures the tout ensemble of a beautiful dress the hair is separated in many small braids hanging down the back or tied up to the point of the turban on the outside i have no doubt but that nature intended some of these women to be very handsome but white and red ill applied their eyebrows hid under one or two black lines  teeth black by smoking and an universal stoop in the shoulders made them appear rather disgusting than handsome the last defect is caused by the posture they sit in which is that of a tailor from their infancy   the black powder with which they line their eyelids gives their eyes likewise a harsh expression their questions are as simple as their dress is studied  are you married have you children have you no disorder do you like constantinople the turkish women pass most of their time in the bath or upon their dress strange pastimes the first spoils their persons the last disfigures them the frequent use of hotbaths destroys the solids and these women at nineteen look older than i am at this moment they endeavor to repair by art the mischief their constant soaking does to their charms but till some one more wise than the rest finds out the cause of the premature decay of that invaluable gift beauty and sets an example to the rising generation of a different mode of life they will always fade as fast as the roses they are so justly fond of   our gentlemen were very curious to hear an account of the harem and when we were driving out of the courtyard a messenger from the harem came running after us to desire the carriages might be driven round the court two or three times for the amusement of the capitan pachas wife and the harem that were looking through the blinds this ridiculous message was not complied with as you may imagine and we got home laughing at our adventures  you must not suppose that carriages may proceed in the streets of pera or constantinople as fast as in those of london or paris a race of dogs belonging to no one in particular but to every turk indifferently swarm in the streets and so accustomed are they to have the turks on horseback turn out of the middle of the street where they lie basking in the sun that our servants were obliged to stop the carriages and lift the dogs out of the way several times before we reached the palais de france nothing is more horrible than the species of this animal here all of the same race an ugly currish breed nothing more absurd than the general protection afforded them on every dunghill you may see a hundred fighting and scrambling for the filth they can scratch out of it for the illunderstood charity publicly given them is by no means sufficient to feed them and many hundreds die with hunger no man has a dog belonging to him but all dogs are suffered to lie and breed about the streets turtledoves are likewise an object of respect with the turks and they are seen disputing the crumbs with the hungry curs in the streets   adieu my dear brother my best wishes and respects attend you   yours affectionately e c   letter l my dear sir i have seen a very horrible sight though not a new one to those who inhabit constantinople or pera yesterday i went upon the canal to see the departure of the capitan pacha commanding the turkish fleet which set sail for egypt and at night a most dreadful fire broke out in constantinople probably kindled by the partisans of the commander in order to persuade the sultan that in the absence of this favorite he is not in the same security as when he is at present   you may be surprised at this supposition but nothing is more frequent than tricks of this kind i went up with the ambassador and many more persons into the observatory and staid till three in the morning to make my remarks the houses are like tinder and burn as fast as matches from their slight construction and the material which is wood the scene of horror and confusion was great and though the fire began at the edge of the water and the janissaries were very diligent above seventy houses were burnt presently   the sultan when he wants to make the common people believe he has no fears goes out incognito in a hired boat with only two or three attendants i had seen him come out thus of a backdoor of his garden just after the fleet had sailed the fire at night was calculated to renew his fears if he had lost them but here it is known when he sallies forth without guards and ceremony it is like children that sing in the dark to make their nurses believe they are not afraid   upon new buildings or children the turks imagine the looks of christians bring ill luck  and so to attract what they call the evil fight upon arches or houses they suspend a ball or some fantastic thing to fix the attention of those who pass in order that the eyes may not be fixed too long on the building as to children particularly the sultans the guards hide them when christian men or women would look at them   all this is very childish indeed but there are a thousand superstitious ideas the turks have relative to the franks which is the name by which they distinguish every one who wears an european dress among others they imagine them to have an intuitive knowledge in physic  and ask christians oftener to give them a cure for disorders than any other question  the red leather pocketbooks embroidered with gold so neatly and which you may have seen are to be had cheap here halfaguinea or fifteen shillings is the highest price for them i shall send you one or two and beg you will keep my letters to you in them i know dear sir the magnificent outside of them will not please you half so well as the simple scrawl within   among many absurdities the turks are guilty of there is one for which i see no reason the sultans formerly built different palaces on the borders of the canal which are now forsaken there is one on the asiatic side in the midst of a fine garden falling to ruin very fast in it there are yet costly lookingglasses and furniture these are not removed but suffered to fall and perish as it may please the winds and ruin to direct as no one is to touch or remove any thing the port and public are equally losers the garden large enough to make a beautiful park is quite wild and as no one goes into it one of the finest spots on that coast just facing the seraglio is lost to every one i find this is the case with every royal residence which when abandoned by the caprice of the sovereign is not demolished or unfurnished but left in the same manner   if there are many simple and absurd customs and opinions among the turks there exists likewise much generosity and magnificence in their conduct when in an opulent situation no minister of the port has an interview with a foreign ambassador or stranger of any rank without making presents which these return according to their opulence or inclination to be noble mr de choiseul will not avail himself of this opportunity of becoming rich for i am told he never receives any thing without giving in return a present of double the value and i am sure more from the noble disposition of his own mind than for the honor of his king and country  though both in him would weigh greatly toward this conduct it is not so with  and   you see nothing is more easy here than for a minister to make money of interviews and turn political conversations into solid gold   the turks in their conduct toward our sex are an example to all other nations a turk has his head cut off  his papers are examined  every thing in his house seized  but the wife is provided for her jewels are left her   the harem is sacred even to that rapacious power which has seized the masters life only because he was rich it may be said that in turkey likewise women are perfectly safe from an idle curious impertinent public and what is called the world can never disturb the ease and quiet of a turkish wife her talents her beauty her happiness or misery are equally concealed from malicious observers of misery unless a turkish woman is beyond conception unreasonable i cannot imagine that her portion can be great for the wife whose wretched husband earns subsistence by carrying water or burdens sits at home bedecked with jewels or goes out as her fancy directs and the fruits of his labor are appropriated to her use in great houses the wives of the turks who compose the train of a turkish husband are destined to be subservient to the state of the first wife and she treats them as she pleases in her harem according to what i hear a turkish husband does not care for his wife as the object of his passion except for a very short space of time but as wife she enjoys all the luxury of his fortune and i repeat it sir i think no women have so much liberty safe from apprehension as the turkish  and i think them in their manner of living capable of being the happiest creatures breathing  i have been to see two greek brides in constantinople their custom is to receive every body who has any curiosity to see their wedding clothes these were very magnificent and the women pretty and looked prettier from a singular contrast in the turn of their features one had a true greek face her head small her nose straight large blue eyes with dark or rather black eyelids and hair and her eyebrows straight her neck long and round her person rather inclining to lean than fat a soft and sad countenance the other was fattish had black lively eyes with a cheerful laughing countenance her blood seemed to ebb and flow with more vivacity than her sistersinlaw her mouth rather large showed a fine set of teeth while the one with a smaller mouth and prettier teeth seemed as unwilling to show them or light up her fine features with smiles as the blackeyed bride was ready to laugh upon every or no occasion they had both very little red on and the pallid skin of the delicate greek was perfectly suited to the form of the one  the other blushed often they might have served for good models of the tragic and comic muse i would sir joshua had been at my elbow his compositions are fine enough to satisfy a youthful poets imagination but here his pencil might not have disdained to copy two such charming originals it is a very rare thing in this country to find fair or auburn hair i am told if a slave can be bought with such  many more purses are given for them than for any other a large sum of money here is reckoned by purses adieu for the present dear sir  may you receive have the satisfaction in reading my letters that i feel in devoting my solitary moments to you  and believe me for ever  your attached and faithful sister e c   letter li palais de france pera may        you must not suppose my dear sir that i am so delighted with the scene before me that i mean not to avail myself of being so near the grecian islands i had consulted mr de choiseul upon the best method of hiring a vessel but the difficulties were so great that with his usual goodness and politeness he has sound a method of obliterating them all by lending me a little frigate called the tarleton of fourteen guns commanded by a very pleasant civil little man and his friend mr de truguet this little frigate is english built and was taken in america mons de choiseul whose health requires the hotbaths of bursa is to accompany us to the port of moudagna and when he is landed safely i shall sail for the places which he as the best director i can have will order i shall take two of his artists with me and in all things be guided by him you see sir my happy star is then to permit me to see places in an agreeable manner with less difficulty and more comfort than generally falls to the lot of one person some old wise observer says a single misfortune never comes alone i may say so of pleasant circumstances   i should imagine the different style of life here to that in europe must influence mr de choiseuls spirits and of course his health i cannot call this a social place the ambassadors are totally confined for conversation or society to themselves and you know very well it is not being incorporated into the corpse diplomatique that gives a person the qualities necessary to make them good company the different interests of their different courts must inevitably make them disagree in public matters and that disagreement may produce reserve in private life i shall give you a sketch of all the ministers at present here   and now sir we will turn to the greeks which are as numerous as the turks here the remains or rather renovation of greek beauty is often to be seen among them but their patriotic spirit seems all centered in this age in a violent attachment to the borders of the canal it is always among them that a prince is named by the port to reign in moldavia and wallachia they stay generally three years and retire with great fortunes which they lay out in houses and gardens in the neighborhood of constantinople where they are pretty sure they shall not be suffered to die in peace but are generally beheaded repeated examples do not deter them from staying and leading a life of continual fear they conceal as much as possible their riches but the seraglio has good spies and these wretched greeks are absolutely through a just fear prisoners in their own houses it seems possible that the sight of the bosphorus makes up to them for the loss of every other pleasure a strange infatuation when there is another empire whose religion is theirs where they would meet with protection and into which they might retire with their fortunes   i saw the other day the public departure of a new named prince for wallachia the procession was very fine his own court and guards with many escorts from the port preceded and followed him two by two a great number of horses janissaries and cooks  the horses coverings were of cloth of gold or rich embroideries two white horses tails on sticks and a kind of cap like a helmet the emblem of his dignity were carried before him he was an elderly man and knowing the ambassador he looked up at the windows where we were sitting and nodded this cortege lasted a long time and was really as fine a procession as ever i saw this prince calls himself nicolai morezzind he is originally of the island of naxia  and he has taken a name that is not his own because it is a better one with the port   the lyre of the ancients is often to be seen in the hands of the greeks but i suppose in ancient days as in these whatever harmony possessed their souls it affected only their eyes from the lyre or from any miserable fiddle or guittar they touch they only draw the most abominable discordant sounds that accompany a kind of bawling which they fancy is singing indeed music is a thing of which turks and greeks have not the least idea   i am sure you wish me prosperous gales and i will write from the first place i can find any conveyance for a letter to reach you   adieu my dear sir with all respect and affection i remain yours sincerely e c   letter lii pera may         twelve at night i intended not to have written before i reached the trojan coast at least but as some account of the sultan will not be uninteresting i shall tell you what i have heard he is extremely fearful timid and ignorant totally unable to quell the interested little intrigues of his ministers and direct the interior policy of his cabinet or empire his excessive ignorance makes it impossible for him to imagine it necessary he should be acquainted with any thing out of constantinople he has an implicit faith in hassan the admiral or capitan pacha  that mans personal bravery being a kind of refuge for the sultans fears the body of janissaries sometimes make a revolt  several governors of provinces or pachas have revolted at one time  fires are so frequent in constantinople  and at present the russian cabinet is so exigeant that the moment is not far off when the turks must be trampled upon or break out with an honest indignation there is a large party now murmuring loudly against the patience of the port amidst this confusion is it to be wondered at that a man who has never been out of the seraglio of course less resolute than half the women in it should tremble on his throne  selim his nephew who is to succeed him is about sixandtwenty and i am told has an understanding that breaks through the effeminate education he has received among other proofs of his being of a resolute disposition as soon as he knew the horrid custom of strangling every infant which is born in the seraglio not the child of the reigning sultan he declared he would never be the cause of a human creatures death and has constantly avoided any opportunities of becoming a father  to night all the people who have been presented to me came to wish me a safe and pleasant voyage  come in looking as like the cousin hogresten as possible and assured me the islands of naxos and smyrna were ravaged by the plague at this moment and that the rocks and storms in the archipelago were the most dangerous in the world that he wished me a safe return but my intended voyage was very perilous a stifled smile upon some peoples faces and the settled reputation he has for invention made me perfectly easy and if his intention was to render me otherwise it has failed thoroughly nor could we refrain from laughing when this hogresten took his leave   the venetian ambassador here is a very sensible man but he dislikes his post his passion is rome where he might sollow his taste for the fine arts he is very conversible and i dare say feels as mons de choiseul must like the prince in the arabian nights who landed in a country where all the inhabitants were turned into stone for indeed a nation with which one does not associate is a nation of statues to strangers who are forced to remain in it except that the people walk ride and go in boats   mr de choiseul has some excellent musicians and we have had concerts there are ladies that sing but according to my usual shyness about music i shall let no one here know i can  for  and so remaining  i wish you a good night   e c   letter liii athens may  0      i set out on the   th at half past six in the evening on board the tarleton which contained mr de choiseul and great part of his household myself my fellowtraveller and the officers how this little frigate contained us all i do not know but so it was and all our servants it was the finest weather in the world and we passed those islands called the princes to the left which are seven miles and a half from constantinople from those to cape bourbouron which is the promontory of land that forms part of the port of moudagna it is fourandtwenty miles and a half from cape bourbouron to the port of moudagna thirteen as we had but little wind we did not make these fourandforty miles and a half in less than seventeen hours and after having landed our sick but amiable ambassador we set sail again and when fairly out at sea we had a most violent storm and with difficulty saved ourselves from the island of marmora a most tremendous naked rock which seems only placed in the midst of that sea to receive a wreck from a thunderstorm i was heartily sick and tired for the shaking of so small a vessel shocks my slight person most horridly when we were just over against the trojan shore i would fain have landed but as there is nothing to see on the surface of the ground and we had not time to stay and dig for the ashes of the heroes buried there we contented ourselves with supposing what we might have found we deplored leanders fate as we passed the straits and found there the capitanpacha and his fleet our little frigate saluted him he returned our salutation we passed the western points of the islands of mittelina and ipsera leaving to the left the island of scio to the right that of miconia and the little one of dragonissa and landed at the island of naxia or naxos i saw but little remains of the temple dedicated to bacchus which stands on the point of a rock which probably was part of the island when the temple was built at present one must scramble in a boat to reach that point where it stands a fine proportion gives room to suppose it might have been very majestic i was shown the fountain beside which it is said the forsaken ariadne wept her lovers flight and where bacchus found her it is of white marble too much destroyed by time to admit of description and contains a spring of clear water  the town of naxos is a poor place we waited near four hours to see a naxiote maiden dressed in her holiday clothes which are neither decent nor pretty a short shift reaching to her knees served as a petticoat her vest was fantastic beyond conception pearls feathers beads sowed on in various forms and two wings like those of a butterfly stuck between her shoulders added to the strange appearance her head and neck were adorned with gold chains pearls stones ribbands in my life i never saw so bizarre a figure we took our leave of her making many excuses for the trouble we had given her and sailed for the small island of antiparos which is to the right of paros where i could plainly discover the mouths of several quarries of that famous marble of which had i possessed a fairys wand i would have conveyed large blocks to england and laid them at the feet of my friend mrs damer whose talent for sculpture makes her as distinguished in that art as in every other which she has chosen to profess  though her modesty has concealed many from the world   mr de choiseuls artists were to take astronomical and geometrical observations of the famous grotto and i had promised to descend into it with them an ass led by two greeks was waiting on the shore for me as the heat was excessive and my companions were afraid i should be too much fatigued if i had walked indeed it was a league distant from the shore and we ascended constantly turning suddenly to the left we descended a little and a scene truly romantic offered itself a vaulted semicircle formed by craggy rocks some bearing the appearance of pillars which seemed to support the pendant roof and caverns which afforded a refreshing shade to different flocks of goats which the greek shepherds had driven in and were resting by was an object worthy the pencil of my companions   here we rested and a small hole on the ground was pointed to me as the entrance of the grotto i was obliged to crawl in a strong cord was fastened to the outside and several sailors and greeks preceded us with flambeaux it required a good deal of courage and dexterity to proceed sometimes i sat and slid down small points of rock which were the only support for hands or seet in two places the descent was perpendicular there rope ladders were fastened and in one or two places through holes on the left we could look down perpendicularly into the grotto where i arrived safely refusing constantly to be assisted for i thought myself in greater safety in trusting to my own hands and feet than to the assistance of others who had enough to do in preventing themselves from slipping   tournefort says the grotto is three hundred fathoms perpendicular from the entrance it is three hundred feet only but as there are several windings in the passage in times when mathematical calculations were in less perfection than at present the mistake was an easy one the feeble description my pen may trace of this famous grotto i must defer at present i yet remember with pleasure its gloomy freshness and the sweet spring of soft water we found in one corner of it that made us relish our cold collation with much pleasure my patient contemplation of objects which the silent and cold hand of time only can produce was very favorable to the artist who was taking a drawing of the interior of the grotto intended for mr de choiseuls second volume of his publication du voyage pittoresque de la greece where i am to be seated at the foot of what they call le grand autel would my dear and honored friend you had been sitting by my side for fear no pen or pencil can do justice to the immensity of objects i saw nor the beauty of them when i recollect the coolness of my seat i feel the more fatigued with the almost insupportable heat of this place so i quit my pen   adieu dear brother with what pleasure i write to you i give you leave to guess  yours faithfully e c   letter live athens may         the water which distills drop by drop constantly from the top of the grotto hardens and by degrees the first drop acquires a consistency like a brittle and thin shell the the next extends round the first so that upon breaking off and examining the pendent point at the end of which there was constantly a drop of clear water it resembles many glass quills that are made to go within each other the last forming a more considerable circle than that hardened to precede it these are of a beautiful color like alabaster the altars and pillars which rise from the ground upwards some of them being taller than the tallest men are of a different color to those which descend a greyish brown and seemingly more hard than the hardest stone but evidently caused by the dropping of the water likewise and it must be a curious speculation for naturalists to explain why the same matter in the same atmosphere should in their congelation produce such different petrifactions the cause seems perfectly natural to me for the first is suspended and as it were congeals in the air while the other rests upon the rock and settles gradually into stone like sand in the bowels of the earth  when the russian fleet was here some of the officers broke off some glorious pillars which by a slow process and probably by the distillations going in the same perpendicular line downwards for ages had reached from the top to the bottom of the grande salle  i saw them in a very imperfect state at petersburgh and in the grotto the tops and bottoms of them for the material being so brittle they could not be broken off in their length if the empress could know how little satisfaction the curious must receive by seeing them in an imperfect and mutilated state in her museum  and what beautiful things they must have been in the grotto  she would grieve with me that ever a desire of obliging could induce her officers to commit what i think a sacrilege against antiquity nothing can be more beautiful than the shapes the chrystalisations have taken in some parts of the ceiling if i may so call it of this place  wherever by any accident the congealing drop has been removed from its direction it takes another course  as there are millions constantly oozing out and congealing some of which are removed accidentally the petrifactions represent the folds of drapery curtains hanging festoons etc as to the altars as the french call them which mount spirally toward the cieling their ends have been deranged likewise and wherever the congelation has ceased at the point it is like a cauliflower head and most of them look like pyramids composed of cauliflowers supposing them to be brown the contrast of this form as well as the color of the superior part is a great addition to the beauty of the place after the drawings were taken the measures ascertained and the artists had perfectly finished what mons de choiseul had commanded them to do we searched in every corner of the grotto and found another chamber lower than that we were in with several recesses unsuspected by us names were engraven on the most conspicuous parts of the grande salle and we left ours engraved in the rock and burnt into a board for any bold adventurer to read after us  and reascended but with much more difficulty than we had entered for one of the ropeladders was so contrived that i could not reach from one step while my foot was on the other how i scrambled up at last i cannot very well tell  but i was not sorry to see the light of the sun again  i was now much surprised to find myself surrounded by greek peasant women one pointing to her head another to her stomach a third to her arm all bewailing their ill state of health and touching my clothes with devotion  i found at last that hearing a woman had descended they took her to be a supernatural being and was perfectly convinced i could cure all disorders nor could i tirer myself daffaire otherwise than by distributing some thieves vinegar which i had in my pocket   one of the most singular scenes i ever saw was the descending of about fiveandtwenty people after i was at the bottom of the grotto most of them with torches as there was but one rope to hold by when we were obliged to have recourse to it i insisted that only five people should go down with me  and the rest set out when we were safely landed lest the rope should break as the passage to the grande salle is winding and as there are many gaps in it we caught and lost sight of these people alternately and of the torches  the brilliancy of the petrifactions the jagged shapes of the rocks through which we saw the men the darkness of part of the grotto and the illuminations which reflected light in new places every moment displayed the strangest and most beautiful scencry that can be imagined doubtless my dear sir there are many observations easy to make which my ignorance prevents me from attaining to but you will be amply satisfied when mr de choiseuls account of this grotto shall appear   he has promised me two copies of his works and there his pencil will give you a better idea of this remarkable curiosity than my pen possibly can and now i confess to you that had it not been that my pride rose superior to my fears i never should have gone down mr de c  when we were laying out the plan of my grecian tour said jamais femme na descendue dans la grotte d antiparos peu dhommes veulent y descendre mais vous miladi vous il faut absolument que vous y entriez when i had got about two or three yards into the narrow entrance of the cavern the smoke of the torches which could only find issue there almost took my breath away and i was forced to set myself down or rather lie upon the rock  as i fell almost suffocated  and i was upon the point of going out again but i should have been ashamed to have seen the spirited ambassador who had ran so many risques in searching after the truths of antiquity if i had returned without seeing the grotte d antiparos and i took courage and descended   we supped very agreeably on board the tarleton and looked over the pieces we had brought out of the grotto but they were so brittle they almost mouldered away at the touch i put some into a box with cotton as we sailed for this place we passed the islands of siphanto milos argentiera st george of arbora  and arrived happily in the piraean port in which remain the two pedestals of the lions which are now at the door of the arsenal at venice   there is nothing left in these islands worth the stopping to look at and they all appear like naked rocks from the sea of a volcanic nature  several have disappeared and others have been so shaken by earthquakes that they are uninhabited  i made a little drawing of one which will give you a perfect idea of them all   from the piraean port to athens the ground rises gradually  and the only fine things which are seen are to the left near the sea a large grove or wood of olive trees and just below the town standing unincumbered with other objects the superb the beautiful temple of theseus the architecture simple and grand proportioned with majesty and grace it has stood to this day an eternal monument of the good taste of the ancients but i now finish this letter for upon paper as upon land there is no such thing as tearing me away from this charming building so i shall defer some account of it with other things to another sheet   adicu dear brother yours affectionately e c   letter lv the temple of minerva in the citadel of athens was used by the turks as a magazine for powder which blowing up has flung down such a quantity of beautiful sculpture that i should be very happy to have permission to pick up the broken pieces on the ground  but alas sir i cannot even have a little finger or a toe for the ambassador who had been a whole year negociating for permission to convey to constantinople a fragment he had pitched upon and thought himself sure of will be sadly disappointed the sailors were prepared with cranes and every thing necessary to convey this beautiful relick on board the tarleton when after the governor of the citadel a turk had received us with great politeness he took mr de truguet aside and told him unless he chose to endanger his life he must give up the thoughts of touching any thing  that there was an intrigue in the seraglio to displace him and that if any thing was removed that plea would be sufficient for his enemies to get his head struck off  chagrined and disappointed as mr de truguet was he could not with any humanity press the performance of the promise and we returned to the consuls very much concerned at the excessive injustice and ignorance of the turks who have really not the smallest idea of the value of the treasures they possess and destroy them wantonly on every occasion for from one of the pillars of the temple of theseus they have sliced a piece of marble to burn into lime for the construction of a turkish fountain and such is the fate of many a chef doeuvre of the best grecian sculptors   the citadel is in an extremely elevated situation and if wisdom was the virtue the athenians prized most the temple could not be better placed for the goddess to direct and overlook their actions  the governors daughters received me and the consuls wife and a relation of theirs was brought in who was a melancholy prey to some inward disease that was wasting a fine form and features to decay i was applied to and pressed to give a receipt to cure her and when our visit was ended the governor and his sons were as importunate as the women had been so i advised cream of tartar whey being sure it could not hurt her i am sure you laugh if you think there is any thing in my countenance that may lead people to take me for a physician  but the fact is that the turks ask every stranger for preseriptions  i will give you no account of our interview with the turkish women  dress manners reception is the same every where the clothes and jewels more or less magnificent according to the quality of the husband   in many authors you will find an account of the temple of minerva of a sweet little temple called the lanthorn of diogenes which is in good preservation and of the temple of the winds likewise the interior of which is not at all damaged but the outside is half sunken in the ruins of athens which has often been ruined and many things bearing the stamp of the artist are like the artist buried in the earth  from my bedchamber window i look down upon the ruins of a beautiful gateway the half of whose pillars are only to be seen on the superior part much damaged and three large storks nests with the old and young  their filth and habitation finishing the melancholy shade which the rust of time and the abominable ignorance of the turks have cast over them   the few remaining pillars of the temple of jupiter olympus or rather supposed to be that which contained the statues of all the gods give one a very good idea of the incredible size of that temple a hermit not thinking the earth mortifying enough had perched himself upon the top of one of these pillars and never descended for above twenty years he is long since dead but his habitation was quite large enough for one man nothing can exceed the magnitude of these enormous columns all fluted of the corinthian order i think there were two very natural reasons why our astonishment at these stupendous works should cease  the first is in ancient days slaves or helotes were by hundreds or thousands to be fed the masters of them it is reasonable to suppose would keep them employed the second is the climate and soil were unfit for gardens marble of the purest and whitest kind was not only found at paros but close to athens  may we not imagine that this was dug out and worked up under the direction of the athenian architects and sculptors by these slaves the ornamental part and perhaps only the finishing strokes of that was only done by the hand of a master in either sculpture or architecture we produce effects for the pencil by the trees we plant in our parks or gardens the athenians could neither form landscape or shade by these  but they brought to perfection an art which gave them seats and walks secured from the scorching rays of the sun by their marble edifices which were both useful and ornamental  a little orangegarden not twenty feet square is shown at athens as a more delicious thing in these days than a new temple a pillar consecrated or a prize gained in the olympic games we make a lawn or plant a clump  they raised an edifice the variety of these and the number of pillars destined only to commemorate the most trifling events prove that it was the natural produce of the soil and the impossibility of their ingenuity being employed in any thing but that which caused architecture and sculpture to be brought to that exquisite perfection in which we find it to this hour   a book written by guilletere which you probably have gives a very good account of the port but the lion and many things he saw do not exist at present  and the ilyssus that river on whose banks so many philosophers and heroes have walked in times of peace when the one encouraged and the other protected the arts and sciences is now no more  it has been drained to water the gardens of athens by many cuts which with the bed of the river are scarcely now to be traced   it was pericles that built the temple of minerva in the citadel on the principal entrance the bassorelievos are executed in the most masterly manner there is a female figure holding the reins to drive two fiery steeds which seem to snort and prance in marble   as to the bassorelievos of the temple of theseus the few that remain are mutilated and represent the combats between theseus and the amazons  part of the theater remains  and every object that i saw made me grieve most truly that i could not restore things to their primitive state of perfection  as to the many recesses and arches over one another that seem to belong to the theater it is impossible to ascertain the use that was made of them nor do i think it a search worthy of our times but it would be worthy the emperors situation to take advantage of the desire the port has to oblige him in order to collect the fragments of the sculpture of the temple of minerva to preserve them as examples to this or rising generations and as models for the ingenious workman to study from  i am called away to see the baths   yours affectionately e c   letter lvi the baths here are very well contrived to stew the rheumatism out of a persons constitution  but how the women can support the heat of them is perfectly inconceivable  the consuls wife madame gaspari and i went into a room which precedes the bath which room is the place where the women dress and undress sitting like tailors upon boards  there were above fifty some having their hair washed others dyed or plaited some were at the last part of their toilet putting with a fine gold pin the black dye into their eyelids in short i saw here turkish and greek nature through every degree of concealment in her primitive state  for the women sitting in the inner room were absolutely so many eves  and as they came out their flesh looked boiled  these baths are the great amusement of the women they stay generally five hours in them that is in the water and at their toilet together  but i think i never saw so many fat women at once together nor fat ones so fat as these there is much art and coquetry in the arrangement of their dress  the shift particularly which closes by hooks behind between the shoulders after it is fastened round the waist there is a species of stay or corset that i had no idea of but which to whom melted down as these were was perfectly necessary we had very pressing solicitations to undress and bathe but such a disgusting sight as this would have put me in an ill humor with my sex in a bath for ages few of these women had fair skins or fine forms  hardly any  and madame gaspari tells me that the encomiums and flattery a fine young woman would meet with in these baths would be astonishing  i stood some time in the doorway between the dressing room and the bath which last was circular with niches in it for the bathers to sit in it was a very fine room with a stone dome  and the light came through small windows at the top   in the evening the athenian girls were invited to perform before me the ancient dance called ariadnes dance a more stupid performance as a dance i never saw but i can conceive that the pantomime of it represents the despair of ariadne when she saw herself forsaken a woman that is to say she who is the most esteemed dancer gets up and with a handkerchief in one hand waves it about in a languid manner with the other she holds the hand of a second who leads a third and so on they move in a string ten twelve six eight the number is indifferent and this female line moves in a circle or according to the direction it shall please the girl with the handkerchief to give her eyes are fixed on the ground and her step is a sort of swim or sink the music is as dull and uniform as her steps which like her eyes never lose the ground   a sweet little greek a girl of five years old the adopted child of madame rogne the french consuls sister joined in this dance and then came and sat in my lap and went to sleep in my arms she was something like my keppel and her little caresses gave me more pleasure than all the languid figures of the dancers before my eyes tomorrow i set out again upon these seas where at this hour turkish ignorance presents different scenes to those that existed when the athenians gave encouragement to heroes and sages  these seas where science in her spring appeared in which the infancy of arts was reared when poetry was in the bloom of youth and fiction beautified each vulgar truth here ariadne wept and there was seen how theseus conquered the amazonian queen here phrynes charms in parian marble shone there gods and goddesses could be undone here aristotle lived whose genius swayed the athenian youth who listened and obeyed those precepts with unerring wisdom fraught with which he charmed the pupils that he taught to men he proved that eloquence was fame and the lyceum lives but in his name here fates stern mandates were by homer given to deities of his imagined heaven from isle to isle the muses point his way and all the heathen gods his lyre obey   apropos to homer every island claims the honor of receiving his last breath and none will give up the idea of having possessed living or dying so remarkable a person  if his ghost will appear to me and settle this matter clearly i will then inform you better at present i must finish this letter with assuring you that the only thing of which i am positively certain is that i am with much truth and regard  your affectionate sister e c   letter lvii smyrna may         this place seems much more alive than any i have been at yet a great number of commercial people and many good houses with a constant variety of vessels arriving and departing make the lazy turk pass unnoticed the french consul has a young wife very lively and civil there is lying at anchor here the minerva a beautiful french ship of seventyfive guns commanded by the chevalier de lygondes a knight of malta an elderly and polite man who happens to be a near relation of lord huntingdon and we were not a little pleased to talk of him and claim a relationship with a person which any one might be honored to call friend or parent he had fiveandtwenty young french officers with him when i saw him first  and a most ridiculous circumstance happened i was sitting by mr de lygondes and talking to him the other frenchmen were laughing with the consuls wife when a little man came into the room and addressed himself to me but so low that i could not distinguish what he said and took him to be some interpreter of which i believe i had seen a dozen in the morning who complimented me upon my arrival but he seeing that i mistook the purport of his speech raised his voice and in good english said my lady hearing that you were here i would not depart without offering you any services in my power i answered i was much obliged to him he made his bow and went out again upon which the giddy part of the company laughed very much none of them knowing either the person or the language i sent after him and found out that it was the worthy mr howard who has sacrificed so much of his time to the most humane purpose i begged he might be informed i returned to constantinople and from thence to vienna and if i could be of the least use to him in his return i begged he would command me but he sent me word his route lay to venice meaning to visit all the lazarettos and prisons on the coasts  there are no remains of antiquity here but a spring called homers fountain a broken pillar on the ground by a clear rill seems to indicate that a temple may have been dedicated to this source which probably bore the name of a deity   i spare you an account of my voyage hither from athens a violent squall of wind forced us to lie two days in the port gabrio where i amused myself with going on shore and up to a convent of greek monks the isle of andros and this port is well marked in the grecian annals by the extraordinary summons alcibiades gave the inhabitants and the very ingenious excuse they made in order to obviate complying with his demands  the only pretty shrub to be found on the islands is the roselaurel which is now covered with the flower but the greeks imagine it diffuses a noxious vapor and avoid touching or going near it i found out one thing which may be of use to soldiers or sailors we had endeavored in vain to get fruit or gardenstuff a prodigious quantity of large thistles was the only thing that presented itself i desired the largest heads might be picked and had them boiled which without being partial i can assure you were infinitely better than artichokes but they must be dressed immediately for if they are kept till the next day they become so hard that twelve hours boiling will not make them tender  the chevalier de lygondes gave me a very fine dinner on board the minerva i shall set out again the day after tomorrow to take up mr de choiseul at bursa and hope i shall meet with no more storms for i am sick and tired when violently tossed about   the little tarleton is an excellent sailer with a fair wind but like all delicate lttle frames is too much shaken when she meets with rough treatment   i remain my dear brother your affectionate e c   letter lviii terrapia june        i arrived at bursa just three weeks after i left the port of moudagna and found the ambassador rather better than i left him the situation of bursa is very beautiful in a valley between two hills and is now a very considerable town the waters are boiling hot almost every house has a circular bath under it that adds to the heat of the climate i found it intolerable and mons de choiseul set out a day or two sooner than he intended because the inconveniences of the house were too great he laughed very much at my saying bon dieu nous sommes tous ici au bain to my great surprise i found there  who intends to travel by land into egypt  he set out at twelve oclock at night  a few hours after my arrival   i had a very pleasant passage from smyrna to moudagna just as the tarleton arrived at the entrance of the straits the wind dropped entirely and we found ourselves in the midst of a large fleet composed of vessels of every size and nation that waited for a south wind to pass the dardanels  luckily we did not lie a considerable time at anchor a southerly breeze sprung up and our swift tarleton left all the other sails lost soon to our sight far behind us nothing could be more pretty and lively than the scene and i told mr de choiseul no frigate in the english or french service could be a better messenger than this which i shall ever be obliged to him for having sent with me you may think it somewhat strange that the mount olympus which rises above the town of bursa is constantly covered with snow but so it is this is not the famed olympus of the heathen gods but named after it probably by a colony which settled there originally from the other olympus it is very common to find several places called by one name in all this part of the world and to this hour you know my dear sir the names of france scotland and england are given by settlers in newly acquired countries   we did not stop at pera but came to the ambassadors house upon the canal in his boat leaving the tarleton at anchor where she is constantly placed this is the only cool house i believe in the environs of constantinople the sea beats against the foundation constantly and from my windows i see the entrance of the canal by the black sea in which between ten and eleven a north wind constantly rises blowing pretty fresh till the evening and it is a very strange thing to aver but just over against the house vessels are sailing some with a south and others with a north wind a circumstance only to be accounted for by the shores which form a kind of horizontal funnel drawing in a large body of air from the black sea which loses its force after it has gone a certain length and ceases entirely just opposite this house it is quite diverting to see the turkish fishing boats sailing very fast and endeavoring to weather this spot when the wind is southerly but in vain they are obliged to lower their canvass and tug at the oar or anchor in some valley till the wind or their strength permit them to proceed   if any thing could excuse the infatuation of the greeks to remain here at the risque of their lives this situation would plead for them but still their manner of life must be a torment even in paradise itself there is one who fearing the port should think him opulent yet too proud to appear in public without his attendants rides round his courtyard every morning with twenty horsemen at his heels   another sent me word he begged i would not walk in his garden for as i generally was accompanied by some of the foreign ministers the port might imagine he was carrying on some treason against the empire if strangers were seen within his enclosures this message was told me by a person who added that all the time i was in his kitchen garden with my company this wretched greek had retired into the most remote closet in his house fearing our curiosity should prompt us to look at the building   this greek prince had hired a french gardener and we seeing an european garden close to the ambassadors it induced us to walk into it as the door was open when the turks or greeks have one they walk into it and eat their sallads there fruit and vegetables are luxuries unknown in general to them   adieu for this time my much loved and honored brother  i remain yours e c   letter lix dear sir i have been to see the forest of belgrade where the oaks are extremely venerable and from a superstitious idea not one of them is ever felled so that the greatest part of them are spoiling the dutch ambassador has a house there and the english minister both of whom i have promised to dine with at the latter end of the summer these countryhouses are deserted for there is a lake in the forest that produces such unwholesome exhalations that if people stay in the neighborhood of it they generally have dreadful fevers there is a kiosk of the sultans at the end of the lake which would be pretty enough with a little alteration   we are now at the beginning of what is called the ramazan  the fast of the turks which they observe with great strictness from sunrise to sunset no turk tastes any thing not even a drop of water but at night all the shops for eatables and the places where coffee is sold are illuminated with many little lamps and it is a pretty sight to go in a boat at sunset along the canal terrapia buyekdere and all the places where several people live look like so many vauxhalls and if the boat draws near enough to the shore one is apt to imagine all the world is supping together the smell of fried fish and mutton and other turkish eatables is so strong the ambassadors first oar is an old venerable turk with a long white beard who has rowed au palais de france forty years and it is with great difficulty mr de choiseuls strictest orders can keep him from his duty  though it is horrible to think that if he were permitted to attend the boat he would row several hours in the day in the heat of the sun without taking a drop of water to refresh himself for whether a turk be obliged to the hardest labor or whether he do nothing the law of the ramazan is equally observed by him  this fast lasts six weeks   with respect to coffee which you may imagine is good in turkey i assure you prepared by the turks it is the nastiest potion ever invented  they make it weak and muddy and drink it without sugar as to the moka coffee not enough of that comes into constantinople to supply the seraglio and all the rest is furnished by france from her westindian possessions no inconsiderable branch of commerce as you may easily believe when i tell you that every fifty yards upon a public road under the shade of a tree or a tent coffee is sold and at most of these places the turkish traveller or visitor stops and takes a cup  it is true these cups are not much bigger than egg cups  but fourandtwenty in a day to each person traveling visiting or staying at home must consume an immense quantity   mr de bukalow has given me a very fine ball at his house at buyekdere  and i assure you his garden is large enough to be a small park there i saw a tree the leaves of which are of the same shape and quality with the sensitive plant  they shrink and close when touched mr dherbert has a pretty house and garden at buyekdere likewise   have you never heard at paris of one isaac bey a turk that was much there mr de choiseul brought him to me the other morning he entered my room followed by this isaac a lively and rather welllooking man who after being seated a few minutes prostrated himself at my feet kissed the hem of my garment and laid a fine embroidered muslin handkerchief there for my acceptance he has been at petersburgh and in london which he dislikes of all places in the world because the common people would not let him walk along the streets without calling him french dog of a turk he says he will never go there again but paris paradis  paradis paris  there he will return you may imagine sir he was enchanted by the sirens of the opera upon and off the stage he diverted me very much he staid and dined and conversed very freely as well as he was able   adieu for the present dear sir believe me truly e c   letter lx terrapia june         i shall certainly not return by the way of semlin and belgrade for i am informed that four hundred robbers infest that country and what escort could i have which would secure me from so many ruffians i have consulted maps and the best informed travelers here and am assured i can go through bulgaria wallachia and transylvania to vienna with great ease and dispatch with a firman or order from the port this subject was in agitation two days ago in presence of the same tall gloomy figure that promised me the plague in greece who gravely told me i should run much greater risques in taking this new route for that i should find heads stuck up on poles at every mile those countries being much more infested with robbers and murderers than the other i would not for the world have given him the mortification to see that i did not believe a word he said and i hope he thinks i was extremely terrified   nothing is more diverting than to see the greeks in pleasureboats here stopping to hear the ambassadors musicians play which they do every evening i must first tell you that they are germans sent to mr de choiseul from vienna and the best performers i have heard playing always the finest italian or german music the greeks in their parties upon the water have generally a lyre a fiddle and a guittar or two in the boats with these instruments they make a horrid noise each performer playing in a different key and if they sing all in discordant tones the sound of the clarinets stops them before the windows but after listening a little time they shake their heads and with one accord begin their abominable noises again and row away from sounds which they think much inferior to those they produce the servants often ask them if their masters music is not fine but they are all of opinion it is very disagreeable this puzzles all my ideas concerning harmony because nature has fixed the rules of it so well that any person possessing a good ear for music will compose in all the perfection of harmony without knowing the rules of composition or even a note of music why then do not these greeks find out they make nothing but discordant sounds when they sing or play  i confess it seems to me a very strange thing  i wish the turkish salute was in fashion instead of the ridiculous bow and curtesey we have which indicates nothing and is seldom executed gracefully a turk puts his right hand upon his heart and bends forward a little  and i assure you if this kind of salutation is accompanied with a smile or a respectful look it conveys to me more greeting than all our bonjours and how do you does which would be often excused with pleasure by me from half my acquaintance  i am not sorry to think the time is not far off when i shall draw nearer to franconia where i hope to see you where i shall tell you many particulars which i do not choose to trust to the post but i confess i shall be very sorry to leave mr de choiseul without being certain when i can have an opportunity of showing him the least return for the civilities and kindnesses he has bestowed upon me he is a very extraordinary and superior man as to his talents  and his amiability is not contrasted by that conceit which we have too often seen in all frenchmen that are not almost superannuated   i only wish he was honored by your acquaintance as you would like him for his good qualities as much as you will esteem him without knowing him for his brotherly and respectful care of me can i give you a greater proof that i believe in the sincerity of your friendship to me than by wishing you to be a friend to one that has behaved like one to me  i remain always the same   yours affectionately e c   letter lxi mr de choiseul and the imperial minister assured me very seriously that they would not let me set out without being accompanied by a visirs tchouadar that is to say a kind of upper servant or rather creature of the visir they applied for one but as these are never employed to accompany travelers and have only upon occasion been sent with the french officers of artillery when there was a battery or fort to be erected  the sublime port was exceedingly surprised at this request  and was five days in looking over papers to find any example of a tchouadar being sent to escort a traveller none being found my two friends were told that in the annals of the empire the thing was unprecedented but they answered they cared little for that but requested that i might have a tchouadar the visir was so much surprised at this that when he had named one he sent him to terrapia to judge if i was worth all the trouble given him upon my account   you think my dear sir that it was my birth or consequence of any sort that was to be enquired into  not at all  he was to look at me and see if i was pretty i was sent for by mr de choiseul into the drawing room yesterday before dinner and when i came in i saw a yellow looking turk sitting on the sofa mr de choiseul told me that was the tchouadar named to accompany me i curtsied to him and after he had looked at me as much as he pleased he took his leave mr dherbert has since told me laughing he made so favorable a report of me that the visir said according to accounts he could not do enough for me i have hired two greek boats with greek sailors that are to row when the wind is contrary and i am to land at a turkish town called varna which is upon the shore of the black sea called romelia i am there to take horses and go across bulgaria to a town called silistria where i shall find all the accommodations i want from the prince of wallachia whose territories reach that town  it is said varna was the place where ovid was sent into banishment it might be so but the chief of his exile was passed in moldavia the borders of a lake where he often walked have become famous the gentleness of his manners and the sweet tone of his voice have been recorded from father to son down to the present inhabitants of that part of moldavia   i have bought a german carriage and the ambassadors tapissier has very cleverly fitted up a little bed in it for me mr de choiseul and his friends are very obliging in imagining every thing that can conduce to the safety or convenience of my journey i have a beautiful colored map of constantinople and the canal executed in a masterly manner by his steward and engineer one khauffer mr de choiseul has given me likewise a bottle of essence of roses  and a mr de brintanneau has presented me with a beautiful turkish fan painted and made at constantinople for me i hope soon sir to give you a good account of myself you may depend upon it i shall write wherever i can find an opportunity of sending a letter to you   i have an interpreter with me and am to have a guard of janissaries upon the road wherever it will be thought necessary  adieu for the last time from this beautiful and sublime situation which must make all landscapes appear trifling to me for the future  adieu dear sir till an occasion offers for me to repeat my sincere esteem and grateful affection for you   e c   letter lxii varna july        dear sir i take the opportunity of my greek sailors return to write to my good friends at constantinople and to you on monday last which was the third of july i set out about six oclock in the evening in mr de choiseuls boat accompanied by him and mr le hocq a very amiable and sensible man who is secretaire dambassade and the good little truguet i took leave of them at the mouth of the canal and stepped into the largest of the two greek boats i had hired the wind blowing constantly north makes the navigation of the romelian coast extremely tedious the idleness and fears of my greek sailors increased the inconvenience for instead of turning the point of karaburon they layto all night and on the fourth i made but thirty turkish leagues karaburon is a rock standing over the bay of that name where the turks are now erecting a fort nothing can be more safe or pleasant than coasting in this manner the shores of romelia abound with many delicious bays and fine harbors where upon the appearance of danger from the black sea vessels may run in and lie at anchor the bay of agatopoly of miolick of vasilico i rested in likewise and the last day i came seventyfive miles in six hours but not without having many quarrels with my greek sailors who would have delayed me more than they really did if i had permitted them  i am convinced a traveller might easily reach varna from constantinople in two days particularly if he has not the honor of being accompanied by a tchouadar who seems to promise me much more delay and inconvenience than his presence can make repay as the greeks and turks know his consequence it is his wants that are attended to and not mine i positively was extremely diverted at my first occasion of finding this out  the day after we had left constantinople we were at anchor in a little bay to breakfast when upon asking my valet de chamber where the boiling water was to make my chocolate he could not find it and began to make a great riot for the loss of his kettle when the interpreter pointed to a flat rock where my tchouadar was sitting on a carpet smoking his pipe and drinking his coffee very quietly made with the water my servants had prepared for me  you must not suppose he ever asks if i want any thing if any travelers were to meet us they would certainly take him for some grand seigneur and that i am of his suite by the care taken of him and the perfect indifference all but my two companions and my servants show for my ease and convenience as to me i now and then have asked him some questions about the places i saw to which i get the most laconic answers however i thought it right to point to two most excellent little english pistols i wear at my girdle and assure him they would be well employed against any offense i met with and when the interpreter had done i could not help calling him a stupid disagreeable turk in english which he took for a compliment and bowed his head a little  when i arrived here he took me to a shabby greek house where a landingplace on the top of a staircase was the only lodging he said he could find for six people  but i told him i should send to the governor upon which i was taken to another house where a long gallery looking toward the harbor with rooms adjoining to it composed a very good apartment here i found my tchouadar had established his carpet his pipe his coffee and his traveling bags and pistols i thanked him in good english as i should for his civility and then ordered the interpreter to tell him he might lodge upon the staircase he had destined for me the governor sent to know if i chose to have a guard of janissaries for the house but i thought myself quite secure being shut in by two courtyards  however in the evening i was not a little surprised to hear a great noise the old greek who lodged me my interpreter and servants came running with great horror in their looks saying that the turks had broke the gates of the court open and were looking for me  i was at that moment sitting with mademoiselle by me on a trunk just facing the door i had scarcely time to understand what was said to me when i saw above fifty turkish heads at the door with eager eyes looking about for something  que veulent ils done said mademoiselle  car nest pas nous  i believe i told you she had a most beautiful little milkwhite rough dog  it was this animal that some turk had seen carrying along the streets which had awakened the curiosity of the turks and two or three parties as i found afterward had endeavored to come into the house to see him this last bolder than the rest had forced the doors open the little dog as great a coward in his nature as my servants and that is saying all i can to prove his poltronnerie upon the first noise had taken refuge under the skirts of mademoiselles petticoats  but one of them taking her by the arm made her get up the dog appeared when the turks with a savage shout of joy all pointed to him and i had no doubt but he was the object they had in view  however when i thought they had stared enough at him i grew out of patience and made a sign for the turks to leave the door which they did immediately and i think a turkish rabble very civil as not one of the party passed the threshold of the door   people imagine this coast to be inhabited by savage turks who live by rapine and plunder uncontrolled by the port but it is no such thing greeks and armenians very inoffensive live in habitations thinly scattered  wine and corn are cultivated but in no great abundance there is a place called shiumla eghteen leagues west of varna remarkable for the retreat which eighty thousand turks made in the last war when twelve thousand russians under romanzof crossed the danube to attack them   my greek sailors lived upon nothing but dried fish during the voyage and it is very excellent provision and better than any preserved fish i ever tasted i had often seen great poles stuck up in the canal with strings tied across under these the fishermen catch the fish which they clean and stick up on these strings to dry by the heat of the sun nothing can look more dry and unlike food than these fish but i assure you they are extremely good having much more flavor than any salted fish i ever eat   i shall set out tomorrow morning at three oclock  i hire arabats for my servants and baggage  the governor is to furnish me with janissaries and horses and i hope my good star will lead me safely through these countries where i confess i feel like the comte de  s servant who entreated his master to let him kill only one or two turks at the last post on leaving the ottoman empire  by the by sir that servant lived with you and when i saw him you had given him so english a tournure that i insisted on his being an englishman but he told me he was your subject you must not suppose that i mean to murder any one but i think of all the twolegged animals i have seen i should regret killing a turk the least most women would be frightened with the journey i am taking but i must get out of this country of mahomets now i am in it and so i shall proceed cheerfully and merrily  if my tchouadar could but know the pretty things i say to him in english and how i mean to watch him he would not have given such a picture of me to his master  adieu e c   letter lxiii silistria july         i am arrived here very safely and merrily notwithstanding my intriguing tchouadar who probably had his orders to frighten me that i might complain of the governor of varna figure to yourself dear sir how much surprised i was at six oclock the day before yesterday in the evening in the wildest country imaginable after traveling all day well escorted by janissaries to see them ride away when the approach of evening made me think them most necessary  i asked my tchouadar what was the meaning of their sudden departure he shrugged up his shoulders and said he supposed it was the governors orders however i rested near a hedge where a caravan of merchants halted likewise that evening without seeing any thing that could alarm me when i left varna in the morning my lazy tchouadar had a whole arabat to himself where he would not suffer my servants to put the smallest parcel  i ordered the interpreter to tell him if i had known his intention i should have hired saddlehorses for myself and servants and guarded his arabat yesterday in the middle of a plain where the coachmen had halted which they do every ten minutes i heard a most violent quarrel between them and my interpreter upon asking what it was occasioned the dispute i found one coachman chose to return with three horses to varna my vile tchouadar sat upon his carpet smoking his pipe without attempting to use his authority and when i asked him to interfere he muttered out a few ish allas ish alla is an expression by which turks constantly avoid giving a direct answer to a plain question  it amounts to it may be so  or please god   and he supposed the governor of varna had given such orders to the coachmen  upon which i saw very plainly my journey was to be a pretext for finding fault with this governor i determined immediately upon putting a stop to such a base maneuver i told my turk that i perceived his intention but that if he did not immediately order the coachman to put the horses to and go as far as silistria i should write an account of the whole trick to the imperial minister and the french ambassador and have him not the governor of varna punished for the delays of my journey the very instant he understood i was not to be imposed upon he spoke to the drivers the horses were put to and we proceeded  bulgaria is but little cultivated and where i saw a turk at work in the fields he was armed with a gun pistols and hangers sometimes a janissary or two guarded the peasant at his work such a sight and a wood i passed through so little worn by travelers that the trees and bushes tore off the door of my carriage were circumstances that might have made any fine lady tremble but you know sir that my spirits and courage increase with difficulties and my female companion is by much the best traveller i ever saw she expressed no fears if she had any and the strange manner in which we traveled with our manner of resting at night made us laugh instead of alarming us every ten minutes as i told you our horses were taken from the carriage and with the coachmen rested under trees if they were at hand the heat was beyond any i ever felt at night we halted with the caravans and then my servants picked up sticks to make the fire for my supper and after i had stretched my legs a little i drew my carriage close and had a very comfortable bed my companions and servants lay on the ground with their heads under the body of my carriage and in the morning before daybreak we set off again but when daylight permitted us to look at one another it was impossible not to laugh the dew was so excessive that we all looked as if we had been drawn through a river when we arrived near this town i ordered my tchouadar to get out and go into the town to find me a lodging  and here i saw that if his presence had been of any use to me his courage would not have served me greatly for instead of getting upon the horse prepared for him he gravely turned about and seated himself in the arabat again i asked why he did so he answered he might be robbed and murdered before he reached the town which we were so near to that a whole string of arabats and caravans were halting there for the night at last we reached the gateway and then my troublesome turk condescended to go and look me out a lodging  a tolerable good one here i had a new contest with him he intended to escort me from hence to buccorest but i was determined to send him from this place back to constantinople i enquired for the prince of wallachias agent this morning he came but i found i could get no intelligence from him before my turk  so i ordered him into another room and there found he had received orders from the prince to furnish me with boats horses or any kind of thing i should ask for my abominable tchouadar had constantly denied that any such orders were given in order to persuade me i could not proceed in my journey without him however i was heartily glad i had guessed the truth and so returning with my interpreter to him i gave him the twenty guineas i had promised him for the favor of his agreeable company and told him to wait till i had written to the ministers at constantinople which i did and now write to you dear sir this town stands in a valley upon a hill which we descended to come here there is a fine view of the danube with islands silistria is beautifully situated upon this river  and i am going six miles down in a boat to karalash the frontier town of wallachia  and from buccorest i shall again have the honor of assuring you i am in all places  your most affectionate sister and obliged friend e c  p s the firman i received from the port to the governors or cadis of the turkish towns runs in this style  o you glory of your equals torch of justice  you light the mines of virtue and science  true believers judges governors of towns or villages this is to inform you etc etc    letter lxiv buccorest when i landed in wallachia i found horses provisions and guards provided for me and i rather flew than drove along from karalash for a considerable way the route lay on the borders of the danube where cattle of all sorts were feeding upon the finest sorts of clover intermixed with various flowers there is no road made and i saw no carriage track but a fine soil without stones or ruts made the journey very pleasant as i came near to buccorest i quitted the meadows and saw a most beautiful country where small woods of fine timber and turkish corn standing above six feet high formed a rich and varied picture several boyards came to meet me and my arnauts or guards were extremely alert and clever though their usual mode of supplying my carriages with horses often gave me great displeasure for it frequently happened that a peasant mounted on a goodlooking horse with his sack of flour behind him was dismounted in an instant a tired horse left him and his fresh horse harnessed to my carriage i wanted at least to have some money given the man and an explanation of the affair but it seems the prince of wallachia had ordered that i should have no trouble or delay  and not be suffered to pay for any thing so that the little money i gave away was privately and not without much management could i contrive it just as i was about to enter buccorest i found a party of janissaries with a tent pitched about a mile from the town who quarrelled with all my attendants and made the postillions drive back to enter the town another way as i was told that road having been shut by order of the prince my surprise increased when i found myself drove under a large gateway belonging to a greek convent the inner court of which was very fine and spacious surrounded by cloisters with gothic arches  my carriage was presently surrounded by people of various nations talking all languages to me  at last i addressed myself to one in a french dress pray sir said i where am i a german servant of mine spoke to him in german and i found i was driven in there to perform quarantine for five days at least the superior of the convent by this time had come up to the door of the carriage fancying by my looks i suppose that i had not the plague he desired me to make use of his rooms till i had chosen my lodging for the night the old venerable man sat by me and mademoiselle while we dined and i had then sent down to the town to inform the prince of my situation  but i asked my respectable host where i should lodge if i staid  he pointed to a small miserable room across the court with only bare walls and the windows of it were all broken this room was to contain all my suite with me for every company i found that arrived was kept apart from the rest close to the door of this room i saw a wretched creature alone with death in his countenance and pray says i what is that miserable figure  a man suspected to have the plague who was put away as far from the others as possible with a little clean straw to lie upon i confess i was heartily glad when the imperial agent came from the town to inform me the prince was very sorry for the mistake  that it never was his intention i should be sent to the convent i thanked my old father for his civilities and hastened to the town where i had been but a few moments before a gold coach made i believe in the year one came to the door with a set of brownbay stonehorses that seemed to spurn the earth there was a turkish groom that held the bridle of each horse a kind of chamberlain with a gold robe on and a long white stick in his hand and the princes private secretary came to fetch me the whole town i believe by this time was got round the equipage and we proceeded very slowly to the first court of the palace in which i went through a double row of guards some of them janissaries and the others arnauts and albanians in the second court was another double row of guards and these extended up a large flight of steps that conducted us to the great audiencechamber in the corner of which a space was divided off with cushions upon which sat the prince dressed and attended a la turque over his head were ranged the horses tails the great helmet and feather the magnificent sabre and other arms which i had seen parade before him in the streets of constantinople he asked me by the interpreter how mons de choiseul did  and if i would not make some stay in wallachia coffee and sweetmeats were served and when i rose to take my leave one of his chamberlains told me in a whisper to sit down again when my ears were assailed by the most diabolical noise i ever heard upon which with a very grave loud voice the secretary said cest pour vous madame  cest la music du prince and the prince desired me to look out into the court  there i saw trumpets of all kinds brass plates striking together and drums of all sizes some of which not larger than breakfastcups were ranged on the ground and the strikers of them squatted on the ground to beat them each musician was endeavoring to drown the noise of his neighbor by making a louder if possible and i do not know that my nerves ever were so tried before for my companion who saw the difficulty i had to refrain from laughing was saying for gods sake do not laugh   mr de choiseuls excellent german musicians came into my head too at that moment and the contrast of his music to the noise i heard added to the absurdity of the thing so that i suffered extremely however this scene did not last long i was called to have an audience of the princess   but here i must leave you for the present before i set out i will finish my account of this reception  adieu e c   letter lxv the princess was sitting a la turque with three of her daughters by her they were about nine ten and eleven years old the princess might be about thirty a very handsome face something like the duchess of gordon only her features and countenance had more softness and her skin and hair were fairer her person was rather fat and she was above six months advanced in her eighth pregnancy she took my hand and seated me by her  the prince to show me an extraordinary degree of respect had suffered mr v  to come into the harem and he sat down by him there were near twenty women in the room one of whom instead of a turban had a high cap of sable put behind her hair that was combed up straight over a kind of roll  this headdress was far from being ugly or unbecoming  the princess told me it was a lady of wallachia and that the cap was the dress of the country after the princess had asked me all the simple questions generally asked by the eastern females  she asked me if i was dressed in the french fashion and told me she should be happy to know any thing she could do to detain me in wallachia a whole year  the prince seemed to desire it as much as she did  but i assured them i should not stay fourandtwenty hours in buccorest they then desired me to sup with them which i consented to but desired i might return to my lodgings to write to constantinople as i had promised immediately upon my arrival to this place i was conducted back to my coach and through the courts with the same ceremony as i came and being seated the secretary told me he was ordered to show me a fine english garden belonging to an old boyard which we went to a country curates kitchengarden in england and that were the same  but the master of it was a venerable figure with a beard as white as snow dressed in a long muslin robe supported by his servants as he walked with difficulty he presently ordered all the fruit in his garden to be presented to me and when i was going out of the garden i met the very lady with her fur cap i had seen in the palace she showed such transports of joy upon finding me at her fathers house that it was with difficulty i could get from her she had taken me in her arms and almost smothered me with kisses   the respectable fathers name is bano dedescolo and one of the principal noblemen in wallachia however i got to my lodgings at last and scarcely had finished a letter to mr de choiseul when two of the princes people with the secretary came in followed by many more of his household the secretary desired me to go and look over a gallery that surrounded the back court of the house i did so and i saw a beautiful arabian horse in the midst of a great mob two turks held his bridle the secretary told me the prince hearing that i was fond of horses desired me to accept that which a pacha of three tails had given him a few days before and he hoped i should accept of it with the regard with which it was presented i gave him as civil an answer as i could imagine and very handsome presents in money to the grooms that brought him and to the whole set of stable people the supper was served in a more european manner than i should have imagined a table upon legs and chairs to sit on were things i did not expect the prince sat at the end of the table his wife on one side and i on the other mr v  was likewise invited and sat at my left several women sat down to supper with us the princess had nine females behind her chair to wait upon her several silver things evidently the produce of england were set upon the table such as saltsellers cruets etc etc but there were four candlesticks that seemed to be made of alabaster set with flowers composed of small rubies and emeralds that were very beautiful detestable turkish music was played during the whole supper but relieved now and then by bohemians whose tunes were quite delightful and might have made the heaviest clod of earth desire to dance the prince saw the impression this music made upon me and desired they might play oftener than the turks it seems these bohemians are born slaves the property of the reigning prince of wallachia while his power lasts there are as he told me five thousand of them left formerly there were fiveandtwenty thousand after the supper was over we sat some time in the large room the princess first received me in but the prince and mr v  sat on one side and the princess myself and the other women on the other the princess i believe thought i gave myself the liberties of a traveller when i told her the ladies with us learned to dance and write  with some other things which she doubted of likewise   her husband smoaked his pipe and i was sorry she did not too for i saw that it was her civility to a stranger that prevented her  the prince asked me if i knew the emperor and prince kaunitz and upon my answering in the affirmative he asked me  should i see them  probably  why then said he do you tell the prince i am devoted to his commands  and tell the emperor i hope now we are so near one another we shall be good friends  the odness of these messages was very near making me laugh but i gravely assured him i should deliver them faithfully if i had an opportunity  about half past eleven i rose to take my leave and received from the princess some very beautiful embroidered handkerchiefs and was obliged again to excuse myself from staying only a twelvemonth with her which she said would be a great amusement to her as my presence was full of graces i retired with all the attendants i had before only with the addition of i believe a hundred flambeaux and all the turkish and bohemian music playing by the side of the large gold coach the horrid disorder and comical procession got the better of all my gravity and though the secretary was there i laughed all the way to the french consuls house where i now write the civil man and wife insisting upon giving me a bed mr v  s ideas of goodbreeding were so discompesed by my laughing that he assured the secretary the perfection of my ear for music was such that the least discord in it made me laugh and he repeated this in all the ways he could turn it i said oh out cest bien vrai but between whiles i said in english what would you have me do i feel like punch parading through the streets with all these trumpets and this mob about me however the secretary and mr v  at last caught the infection and we arrived laughing all three at the house where the consuls wife had prepared me a comfortable bed and i got rid of my music by giving them a handful of money  it is so hot that i cannot sleep and i am writing to you dear sir this is no inconsiderable town the situation of it is very beautiful indeed in this country it would be difficult to find an ugly site wallachia pays to the port a tribute of four hundred purses a purse is  00 sequins yearly exclusive of grain wool and many thousand sheep shepherds pay an annual tribute besides of eighty thousand skins of the cattle with butter cheese and tallow   if the grain fails from egypt this country is obliged to supply the deficiency at constantinople still i affirm that upon earth sir all things superior in their nature either animate or inanimate are taxed cruelly this beautiful country the soil and climate of which makes every produce luxuriant is by the hand of fate under a power which extorts unmercifully from the natives through the necessities of the port if not by the rapine of the princes and presses plenty from her source driving often the wretched wallaques to fly into the mountains where at least for a time they avoid the cruelties they find from a tyrannical government which punishes them for the deficiencies the extortions of that very government have occasioned  i set out early tomorrow and shall write from hermanstadt the first imperial town i shall reach i have a very clever addition to my suite here a kind of trader and interpreter who speaks the wallachian language perfectly and is going to hermanstadt   adieu dear sir e c   letter lxvi hermanstadt july         the first post from buccorest is a place called floresty situated eight leagues west of buccorest i passed two small rivers that unite and increase the current of the river argis which river runs many leagues along the bottom of the wallachian and transylvanian mountains i was overtaken by the most terrible storm of thunder and rain that i think i ever saw and instead of reaching a boyards house prepared for me the first night i was obliged to halt and wait patiently till the elements chose to abate their fury i was less incommoded than my fellowtravellers whose carriages were quite open and the wind rain thunder and lightning delayed us the greatest part of the night when we could proceed we went on and rested under the hospitable roof of a boyard whose house was beautifully situated on the river argis at the foot of the mountains here ended the flat part of the country which extends from the danube and we began gradually to ascend i rested at another boyards house and saw to the right as i passed a large greek monastery situated on the declivity of a mountain surrounded by some well cultivated lands i shall not attempt to describe the majestic beauties of the mountains timber and shrubs of all kinds gave them a variety of greens when we got to the bottom we followed the course of the river which ran with rapidity and its serpentine meanders were as graceful and sublime as the mountains that poured forth the stream here and there indeed the sides of the mountains were perpendicular and accidents or tempests had thrown down huge trees that lay across the river and damming up the water made it fall in cascades nothing more wild or romantic can be conceived than many places of this sort by which i passed but such scenery could scarcely compensate for the dreadful road you may conceive my dear sir what a slow progress i made in the mountains about twenty peasants on foot held up my carriage the wheels of which were lifted over stones as big as the carriage the night before last just upon a little plain when my guides thought they might venture to let the carriage go i was overturned and as it was for the first time in my life upon the ground i was so much astonished though not hurt that i never thought of getting out till mademoiselle d  repeatedly crying out je suis morte raised me out of my stupid surprise she had received a blow in the middle of her stomach but it was only an outward bruise and in two hours she felt no inconvenience this road between transylvania and wallachia is torn up and destroyed it was an article in the last peace concluded between the emperor and the port i suppose to make the conveyance of heavy artillery impossible however convenient this may be to either power the inconvenience to travelers must be dreadful one of the carriages that followed mine was broken into a thousand pieces and my new interpreter with one servant came upon horses having put the baggage upon others just in time to see my carriage set up again as to theirs it remains in fragments in the place where it broke to pieces if any german of your acquaintance for business or curiosity comes into these countries let him make his journey on horseback i assure you sir these beautiful mountains are well worth seeing from the foot to the crown of them they bear the richest foliage and in wallachia where the wood has been cut and agriculture has been employed the finest turf the finest crops of grain prove the soil to be what it is when you can see it freshly flung up a rich black mould this country may be called indeed a jewel ill set what would it be under the hands of taste and industry   the timber at present is but little employed the trouble of conveying it away from the mountains being excessive the river is too shallow and too much obstructed to admit of rafts i slept the night before last after my overturn at a place where there were only two miserable huts one had a kitchen just big enough to hold one mattress which mademoiselle and i divided the morning waked me and i saw my arabian grasing close to my window upon a little green plain the two arnauts that conducted him were fast asleep under his feet he was tethered by a rope and seemed to be much accustomed to have attendants waiting upon him a few hours brought me to a customhouse of the emperors that is upon the frontiers still at the edge of the river that i had followed and at the bottom of those enchanting mountains destined certainly for other purposes than harboring oppressed subjects or fugitive murderers i cannot tell you sir how glad i was to see the eagle upon a post and feel myself under the imperial protection though i never traveled so well attended and so courteously treated as in wallachia the illadministered government of the port can never secure travelers perfectly from the outrages of rebellious provinces   from the customhouse i reached a fortress where an old greyheaded major received me with the greatest respect and attention and i walked up above eighty steep stone steps to come to his apartments there he gave me a supper and had some clean comfortable beds prepared for me and all my suite  this old gentleman told me he had commanded there threeandtwenty years and i was the first lady he had seen or heard of passing that frontier  if some of my friends could have seen the outside of this fortress and been told i was there without knowing why  they would have thought me shut up for life   five leagues more brought me to this place where i am lodged at a baron de buccows son of the late governors but who lives now in partnership with a swiss family who are worthy good people and who seem to me to be as glad to have me rest three days as i am to feel myself among christian like people   there is a camp of cavalry here and the emperor arrived the day before i did to review the regiments  he sent me a message the instant he knew i was come to know if i was lodged well and to ask how i did and if i was not accommodated properly he should give orders that i might find aments to my liking  i sent him back word i could not be better situated and he is to do me the honor of calling upon me tomorrow morning he has only general brown with him and he lodges like a private gentleman at an inn in the town one of the wheels of my carriage broke and they were all in so bad a condition that i am obliged to stay here four days to have a new set i shall write the day after tomorrow when i quit my hospitable hosts  i remain dear sir yours ever e c   letter lxvii hermanstadt july         dear sir i have been extremely well entertained here by the governor who is a sensible old man and the only governor remaining in the imperial service as i am told that was so named by the late empress  he is a protestant  he has a well arranged cabinet of specimens from all the mines of transylvania the gold is very fine the gold mines are rich i am told they pay annually two hundred and fifty thousand ducats to the emperor this is a tax upon the proprietors of the mines which is about the rate of a third of the solid weight of ore extracted  viz three florins out of nine  a much more sensible plan than making all the gold or silver mines in a country the property of the sovereign if once discovered the natural consequence of which law is that the possessors of the land which contain those precious mines take great care they should never be found   he is very fond of pictures and has a collection among which a charles the first and his wife are extremely fine  and a st jerome by guido with a lion is invaluable  indeed he said he had been offered four thousand pounds for the last  a noble hungarian a comte de vitzay and his wife who was an esterhazy with some more nobility dined with me at the governors and the comte de vitzay has taken the charge of my arabian to vienna i believe i told you in my last that the emperor had sent me word he should wait upon me which he did he came on foot attended only by general brown and sat two hours and a half looking over the maps and presents i have received the maps seemed to please him very much and when i delivered to him the prince of wallachias message he laughed as i was a very faithful ambassador yesterday morning i was at the review but the day was wet stormy and uncomfortable the emperor quitted hermanstadt after the review was over he sent general brown to tell me he had been so good to order him to write to the comte de soro that commanded at temeswar and to the comte de colloredo at peterwaradin that posthorses might be ready for me if i chose to go round by peterwaradin to see the croat troops which i suppose you know form a kind of militia that guarding the frontiers in time of peace cultivate the land and in time of war are the troops most to be depended upon the emperor had given me an account of these troops and seemed to wish i should go round to see them but i confess i long much to reach vienna having letters i am sure which interest me very much waiting for me   i shall write when i reach vienna  and remain with great respect and affection  yours e c   letter lxviii vienna august  0      i am arrived very safely and pleasantly here and was only delayed upon the road by the comte de soro who insisted upon my dining with him i think hungary a noble country and only wants navigations made across from the adriatic to the danube to be one of the richest and best peopled countries upon earth turkish idleness which probably ever will remain the same gives a fine opportunity for the inhabitants of hungary to become the richest and happiest people in the world  if fate had made me mistress of that particular spot i should form a strict alliance with the port asking nothing but a free trade upon the black sea  can you conceive sir any thing so comfortable as to have an immense wall or barrier such turkish supineness creates between my kingdom and an ambitious neighbor  how i would encourage asiatic splendor superstition and laziness and never do any thing that could weaken such a barrier  ambition which often leads men into many wrong paths in politics may suggest to the imperial courts that the turks should be confined to their asiatic shore and all european turkey should belong to the christians  but i am not of that opinion and after the sea i would not wish to surround my country with any other defense than that which mohammedan idleness could form  the turks are faithful to their treaties and do not seek war under false pretenses  their revolted pachas give them too much trouble constantly not to make them desire eternal peace with their foreign neighbors  a gentleman with a foolish troublesome wife to make his fireside uncomfortable does not go out of his house to seek new discontents  such is the situation of the port  the perpetual disquietude of the empire makes the thinking turk find a comfort in the dull moments of rest he finds upon his carpet spread under the lofty plantane  and we must not wonder to see so many of them seemingly to enjoy moments which to us would be deathlike stupidity but as i am not the sovereign of any country i will not take up more of your time with my reflections but tell you that i found prince kaunitz here very glad to see me he saluted me with a  ah vous voila ma noble dame  i have a great satisfaction here in seeing the young countess of c  and her sister whom i was acquainted with before but lady g  i never had an opportunity of seeing since her new connection with me  she is gentle modest and amiable and i find both her and her sister please very much here  i shall stay only till i receive letters from  and  and then set out for anspach where i shall have the honor and most sincere pleasure of paying my respects to you and assuring you in person how much i am dear brother  your affectionate sister and devoted friend e c   finis
