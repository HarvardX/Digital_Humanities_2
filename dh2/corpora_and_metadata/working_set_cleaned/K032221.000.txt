a treatise on the hooping cough  observations on the tussis convulsiva or hooping cough as read at the lyceum medicum londinense  wherein the nature cause and cure of this disease are endeavored to be demonstrated and the practice of exhibiting emetics shown to be pernicious and useless  by john gale jones  stat sua cuique dies breve et irrepabile tempus omnibus est vitae sed famam extendere factis hoc virtutis opus   aeneid x     london printed for allen and west no    paternosterrow  price one shilling  to the president and members of the lyceum medicum londinense gentlemen permit me to dedicate to you and to present for your acceptance the following little treatise on the hooping cough i regret that both in its composition and its intrinsic merit it is so little worthy of your attention and so little capable of affording either amusement or information you will readily perceive that it is the work of a young and perhaps of an inexperienced man but you will also acknowledge that the interesting nature of the subject and its being a first performance entitle it to a candid and liberal allowance as a member of the lyceum medicum londinense i feel myself interested in its welfare and prosperity and as a medical practitioner i am anxious to contribute my feeble efforts toward the advancement and promotion of so valuable a science i have to lament that my present embarrassments and the surrounding situation of affairs have for a while diverted my attention toward those subjects which though not less useful are generally considered as improper to be pursued by those who are educated in the medical profession how far the observation may be just or the censure merited can be decided only by an investigation of present circumstances and an impartial enquiry into the probability of future events i can only add that should the present little trifle be so fortunate as to experience a favorable reception i trust it will be received but as an earnest of future exertions and that i shall be readily believed when i assert that my most sincere and anxious desire is to pursue those labors and those studies which are found from experience to be the most useful and beneficial to all mankind  i remain gentlemen your obedient and humble servant john gale jones  introductory preface the following little essay was first written somewhat more than a twelvemonth ago and read as a paper at the lyceum medicum londinense it professes to be rather a few practical observations than a complete and regular treatise its having occupied the attention of the society for twelve successive weeks during which it underwent a long and critical examination although it afford no demonstrative proof of its possessing any share of merit will furnish at least an apology for its publication  the author is neither unwilling nor ashamed to confess that he has established his mode of reasoning upon the fundamental principles of the brunonian system nor to take this opportunity to declare that he entertains the most profound veneration and esteem for its celebrated author and that it is his intention should his future leisure and avocations permit and no material obstacles intervene to present before an impartial and discerning public a commentary and defense of this truly valuable though much persecuted doctrine  a treatise on the tussis convulsiva being called upon by this society rather sooner than i expected to furnish a paper for their discussion and anxious to comply with their requisition although not sufficiently prepared i have endeavored to bring forward to their notice a treatise on the tussis convulsiva or as it is more frequently denominated the hooping cough and this not with a view presumptuously to advance any positive or decided opinion but from a sincere desire to excite the attention and provoke the discussion of those whose abilities and experience while they entitle them to superior respect afford them also the means of superior information  the tussis convulsiva is a disease which although well known has been seldom described few authors having given us any regular description of it or till lately recommended any peculiar plan of treatment nor do they seem to have discriminated it from any other cough excepting only by that distinguishing symptom which has given it the name of hooping cough specifics indeed have been proposed and cicuta by some practitioners has been highly extolled opium also has been esteemed of superior efficacy and emetics have been almost universally employed  as the express purpose of my introducing this subject to the society was to combat some prevailing opinions and to endeavor to controvert some peculiar prejudices which i conceive to have been adopted it will unavoidably happen that i may seem to deliver my sentiments too freely and to be guilty of great temerity in venturing to oppose the solitary testimony of the youthful practitioner to the respectable authority of the experienced physician  but it will i hope be remembered that although a just deference should certainly be paid to the researches of antiquity and to the observations of experience yet it is surely a very dangerous experiment to desist from enquiry and grow weary of investigation the discovery of truth has seldom or never been completely effected by the labors of one but by the collective and united industry of many what therefore has escaped the wisdom of the former may happily have been granted to the perseverance of the latter and of the republic of letters at least it may be said that the only road to improvement is through the path of innovation  if however in what i have to offer i should seem essentially to differ in opinion and practice from the majority of this society i entreat them to acquit me of any imputation of obstinate presumption or affected singularity and i solemnly assure them that it is from a full conviction of the truth of what i shall assert and from a sense of the duty i owe to this society in particular as a member and to the public in general as a medical practitioner that i bring forward to their notice the consideration of a disease frequent in occurrence always hazardous and often fatal in the progress of which conscious of the inaccuracies and sensible of the defects but too visible in this composition i feel it necessary while i solicit their attention to claim also their usual indulgence  i was insensibly led to this digression because upon mature deliberation i cannot but entertain very different notions of the nature and properties of the cause and cure of this disease and have been induced consequently to adopt a very different treatment i shall endeavor to give the society as far as i am enabled my opinion of the disease itself show what are its usual causes and effects and by relating to them some remarkable cases demonstratively prove what plan of treatment i have found to be successful  the tussis convulsiva is that disease which together with the symptoms usually attendant upon pulmonary affections is accompanied with a contagion of a peculiar and malignant nature hence it has also obtained the name of tussis ferina i shall not hesitate here to define it to be a disease of clear and evident debility and one which never takes place but in those who have either been previously weakened by some other disease or who from some unknown or unforeseen cause are predisposed to this state  the persons most liable to it are those who possess a weak lax fiber who use little exercise and in fine those who from whatever cause have a deficient perspiration hence children from   months to    years are in a remarkable manner affected by it and indeed i have seen but one instance of its taking place in any one of riper years and this was in a young lady of a very delicate habit who might be about nineteen years of age  its primary cause is contagion which whether it be sui generis or of the same nature with that whereby all infectious diseases are produced and which differing only in modification or degree occasions sometimes small pox or measles sometimes typhus or hooping cough is at present suggested i confess as conjecture only yet perhaps not unreasonably since in a family where the measles have prevailed the hooping cough has frequently followed and in the same child i have experienced both diseases to be at one and the same time present causing however no essential difference in the treatment  the proximate causes will be found to be all such as tend to induce debility hence at a moist season and in a damp situation it is found to rage with the utmost violence frequently indeed no other cause than this can be traced as i lately experienced in attending three children whose parents had just removed to a new and damp habitation together with this a relaxed habit where the pores being more patulous are most liable to the impression of contagion pulmonary affections in general and in fine any cause capable of inducing a languid state of the system  its immediate seat is in the exhalant and mucous arteries the secreted fluids of which being inspissated by stagnation in the bronchia form the matter of expectoration in this as in any other cough it is the serous and mucous fluids that chiefly flow to the bronchia which continue to bear their pressure for a while till distended by the load they can bear it no longer the unpleasant sensation of the stimulus excites a commotion in the vitality of the laboring part and rouzes the whole excitement a cough arises and throws off its cause the collected humors el med   at this time and during a fit of coughing the air is violently expelled and as an animal cannot exist for any considerable interval without the admission of air as soon as possible it instinctively makes an effort of inspiration when the air suddenly rushing as it were into a vacuum causes that remarkable found which from its supposed resemblance to the articulation of the word hoop has given it the name of hooping cough  hence it is easy to account for the effects produced by this disease they are indeed of a very formidable nature and are frequently of a most alarming and fatal tendency sometimes after a violent fit of coughing the patient is seized with convulsions and instantly expires this may happen from two causes first from the continued action of the lungs urged by the irritation of the cough preventing inspiration and thus inducing strangulation or secondly from the lungs being unable to recover their tone yielding to the impulse of the external atmosphere and being overwhelmed by its sudden intromission an instance of which i knew in a beautiful child of about three years of age whose mother had not the least apprehension of her childs being in any danger sometimes on account of the continued obstruction of the circulation the lungs being violently distended yield to the impetus of the shock a blood vessel bursts and the patient is cut off if however the patient have the good fortune to escape these dangers the disease by gaining ground and the cough returning more frequently continue to weary and exhaust till he gradually sink under its pressure  in tracing the rise and progress of this disease it will not i hope be deemed foreign to the subject to say a few words respecting contagion more espicially as i think it will tend to illustrate what i have hitherto constantly kept in view viz the being guided in the treatment of a disease more by the general state of the patient than by any particular symptom or set of symptoms  contagion is a certain subtle imperceptible matter of an unknown nature resembling most natural phenomena which are only in any measure open to our enquiry by their evident effects taken from the body of one affected with it or from gross substance such as clothes or furniture where it happens to have been lurking and received into a healthy body it ferments without any change of the solids or fluids fills all the vessels and is gradually ejected by the pores passing out more copiously or scantily in proportion as the perspiration is more free or impeded el med   as the issue of the matter is here promoted by inducing a free perspiration so whatever part of it be obstructed and detained below the cuticle acquires by this delay a certain acrimony producing little inflammations and conducting them when produced to suppuration upon this principle are the small pox measles and other exanthematous diseases to be accounted for  as contagion however requires a certain time for its transmission it follows that the most favorable state for this purpose will be that where the different secretions are most perfectly performed and where consequently the system comes the nearest to the healthy state for it is very evident from daily experience that in weakened or vitiated habits where the functions are ill performed and where perspiration is deficient it is capable by its detention of infecting peculiar fluids and converting them into a matter similar to itself  yet as contagion by its subtle and peculiar nature is found to be imbibed by all habits perfect health perhaps alone excepted i am unwilling to allow that it possesses any share in producing general diathesis but that it kindles up only a symptomatic pyrexia strictly entitled to the appellation of local disease and by its entrance into a healthy or unhealthy constitution produces those different effects which are seen to proceed from it  and this imperceptibly leads me to the consideration of specifics a medicine is denominated specific when it is applied for the cure of any peculiar disease and is supposed to be the only medicine possessed of the power of removing or eradicating that disease  as poisons applied or admitted into the system were found to produce certain mechanical effects and seemed in some degree to act in an uniform manner the restless spirit of curiosity and active ingenuity of mankind prompted them to researches after some antidote which might be peculiarly adapted to it and prove efficacious in its dispersion hence mercury by proving successful in the cure of lues venerea has been denominated its specific and some practitioners have not hesitated to declare cicuta to be a certain specific for the hooping cough yet i conceive it will readily be granted that for a medicine to be fairly entitled to the denomination of a specific it is necessary that it should be uniform in its operation and certain in its success now beside the great difficulty of actually proving the existence of a specific in nature several cases are upon record of lues venerea resisting the most vigorous applications of mercury in all its forms and varieties and yielding to medicines of a very different nature with respect to cicuta dr w  b  will i trust excuse me for this observation he has long since pronounced me a confirmed heretic he cannot therefore be surprised at my want of faith so warmly praised by some and recommended by others i must frankly confess that it becomes me to speak of it with doubt and hesitation having partly through fear and partly through incredulity seldom or never employed it  this disease then originating from contagion will be found like all others of that class to produce in its incipient state no material change or alteration a cough is the first symptom which differs very little from any common cough or cold the appetite is not in general impaired the countenance remains in its usual state nor is it sometimes known that this disease is present except by a knowledge of its having prevailed at any place whence it might be supposed to be imbibed as it proceeds however it becomes more clearly marked the excretory vessels of the lungs being crammed with a colluvies of fluids create a sense of tightness in the sternum and great difficulty of breathing the stomach begins to reject its contents and together with these great quantities of viscid phlegm are either vomited or coughed up the countenance grows pale alternate heats and chills with other hectic symptoms take place and the sound resembling the word hoop is now distinctly observed  in the last stage the symptoms become more urgent and distressing putrid symptoms the usual consequence of contagion manifestly appear foul breath crude dark colored feces or violent diarrhoea spasmodic twitches of the tendons but particularly a convulsive motion of the nostrils great anxiety with high and laborious respiration all but too clearly foretell the approach of death and every days experience brings with it some sad monument of the tyranny of this dreadful disease  to apply a suitable remedy in the treatment of a disease nothing more seems to be necessary than to possess a competent knowledge of its cause since if the cause be exactly ascertained the effects resulting from it will be better understood and as identity of known cause always produces identity of known effect if the cause be uniform the effect will be uniform also  unfortunately however in treating the diseases incident to humanity we are too apt to lose sight of this general and fundamental principle and depart from the guidance of reason confiding in hidden powers which have no existence and relying on miracles which cannot take place we sometimes expect from a random and contradictory treatment the most complete and unequivocal success  hence while hooping cough has been generally admitted to be a disease of debility the practice of vomiting has been warmly recommended and followed and the evacuation of an already exhausted system has been by some esteemed the most infallible method of restoring health and vigor  an emetic if it act according to its intention operates by a discharge of the contents of the stomach and of some of the mucous fluids and this it does either by some mechanical power which it possesses of acting on the nervous sensibility of its inner surface or by that relaxant property of rendering the stomach unable to retain its contents  yet as the immediate seat of this disease is in the mucous vessels of the lungs and as the stomach is already in a relaxed and weakened state a particular medicine applied solely to that organ and one whose professed object is to evacuate must surely be pernicious and useless for although by its local effect and by the exertion of straining expectoration may be promoted and a temporary relief be obtained yet the cause being increased which gave rise to this collection and a rude shock being given to an already weakened system the exhibition of an emetic however it may seem at first to relieve must eventually tend to exasperate the disease  the cause of the collection which takes place in the vessels of the lungs is as we have already stated a deficient perspiration wherein the system is unable to throw off its redundant fluids by stagnation they inspissate and form mucus and by occupying more space than is natural create a difficulty of breathing now if deficient perspiration be the effect of debility debility will be the original cause and any medicine capable of producing that effect will be capable also of increasing the cause  an emetic by depriving the stomach of its contents deprives it of that which might enable it to resist the disease it exhausts and weakens an organ which requires support and nourishment and increases that debility which was already too prevalent mucus or phlegm as it is termed it is true is during the action of vomiting discharged but in trifling proportion and with considerable disadvantage the thinner parts alone being rejected and the denser retained  but if any one should take occasion to say we admit the truth of what you have asserted that this is a disease of debility and that emetics though they afford a temporary relief ultimately debilitate yet as these fluids are already collected and as the patient is in a state of fuffocation by their retention what remedy can be found to supply the place of an emetic and succeed so well in discharging them from the system to this i immediately answer strengthen the system and the fluids will be dispersed increase the perspiration and they will be resolved prescribe cordials and they will be expelled  this disease then being admitted to be a disease of debility any medicine capable of invigorating the whole system will be found to be beneficial and it is upon this principle and no other that bark opium cicuta and other remedies have proved successful that they frequently fail arises perhaps from this cause that they are depended upon singly and considered as specifics but as i have already endeavored to show the nonexistence of a specific in nature if my position be granted it will be easy to prove that where the principle is false the success must be uncertain  it has been observed by the late dr johnson that nothing has ever been well done by a receipt and i must confess that i have attended patients with the hooping cough where neither bark opium nor cicuta have been employed and where notwithstanding the recovery was complete  it is not from any one particular form or system that diseases are to be eradicated and health established yet as example is at all times more efficacious than precept a few authentic cases while they demonstrate a plan of treatment may serve to explain the principles upon which that treatment was founded  and as i have ever deemed it to be the indispensible duty of a practitioner to give a faithful relation of facts though they may include events of an unpleasant nature so have i always thought that the relation of unsuccessful cases is more than ever requisite when any consideration of importance or means of improvement are to be deduced from them  case i on the   th of august      i was desired to send an emetic to a child of about four years of age who was troubled with the hooping cough as i never before had an opportunity of seeing a complete case of this disease and as i had some doubts respecting the propriety of emetics i considered this as a favorable opportunity of watching the progress and event and as i attended in the family profited by the occasion the child possessing a tolerable share of health and with the exception of the cough having no other particular symptom of disease had rendered any previous attendance unnecessary upon calling the next day i was informed that the emetic had been given and as usual had brought up a considerable quantity of phlegm the cough however was more troublesome and the patient very restless the following medicine was immediately

evident together with these formidable symptoms a violent diarrhoea came on and it seemed to be the general opinion that the patient could not survive the following medicines were immediately

small doses of p rhab the patient completely recovered and has been well ever since  i have particularized this case not because i think that there was any thing very remarkable in it but because it was confidently asserted that the child could not recover the mother and nurse had at one time given it up as hopeless and but for my persuasion would have left it to its fate and because no emetic had been given from the commencement to the conclusion of the disease  on the  d of october i was called to a family where four children had the hooping cough but as i think it would be needless to enter into a particular detail of the medicines which were given it will be sufficient to say that with the assistance of temperate cordials light and nourishing diet gentle exercise and clear air they all completely recovered  i have since attended several children who by the same treatment and with the exclusion of emetics have all recovered but i must pass them over to come to a case which proved unsuccessful  on the  st of december i visited a child about four years old with this disease he was very restless and rather costive  xii  conf arom gr xv p rhab gr v sir croc sp n m a j aq men pip iss coch med  it is horis capiend  nd the cough being troublesome i was solicited for an emetic but gave an evasive answer expressing my doubt of its efficacy the medicine was continued but on the   d as the patient seemed to be very much oppressed in his breathing and choked with phlegm i yielded to solicitation and an emetic was sent from that time the patient gradually drooped and notwithstanding the utmost vigilance and attention and the most vigorous application of medicines of the most powerful kind on the  th in the evening died  i am so well convinced in this case of the emetics proving pernicious that i shall never consent to hazard the experiment a second time and if any one should assert that he has given an emetic for a cough and experienced its efficacy i shall answer it is possible you may have cured a cough by emetics but i do not believe that cough was the hooping cough  the last case which i shall offer is that of an infant of something more than three months old who from being in a very imminent state of danger was happily recovered in less than a fortnights time  the medicines were of the cordial kind clysters were given nutritive broths with a moderate quantity of wine and i can here with truth and confidence assert that excepting the one i have mentioned i have never had a case of hooping cough which did not yield to this plan of treatment  as i have rather exceeded the limits of a paper i must hasten to a conclusion to those who may think that i have been presumptuous in my opinions and confident in my assertions i shall beg leave to oppose the authority of a celebrated physician in hooping cough says he change of climate is an idle tale and the practice of vomiting death  i have said that this disease is rapid in its progress and fatal in its effects and i cannot bring a better instance than that of a child who going to a bakers in whose family it prevailed to purchase a roll caught it returned home and being seized with a fit of coughing burst a bloodvessel and instantly expired and that of a mother who was bereft of two children both of whom were cut off in somewhat less than eight and forty hours without having received any treatment and no other medicine than that abominable custom which cannot be too strongly reprobated and which is so prevalent among the poor especially viz of giving their children repeated doses of vin antim or tart emet without either knowledge to assist or judgment to direct them so bigoted indeed are they to these medicines that they think them universal nostrums and i am acquainted with a family where vin antim is regularly administered to the children once or twice a week by way as it is termed of clearing the bile from their stomachs good god are there not already sufficient calamities for suffering humanity that we should so studiously endeavor to create diseases where none previously existed and thus dig pitfalls for our own destruction  it is not with medicine as with other arts and sciences where a mistake may be rectified and an amendment adopted alas dearbought experience frequently comes too late and the nature and cause of a complaint may be discovered when the occasion for it is past  i call therefore upon this society in their individual as well as in their collective capacity to discountenance and check the imprudent exhibitions of emtics i have brought forward proofs of their inacy and ill effects i have shown the success of a different plan of treatment and i conjure them by all that is valuable and sacred to let not these testimonies be brought in vain
