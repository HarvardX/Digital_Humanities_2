appearance is against them in a series of letters in three volumes by the author of emily herbert or perfidy punished  vol i  london printed for thomas jones at his circulating library bridgestreet westminster  m dcc lxxxvi  just published emily herbert or perfidy punished  three vols price s  d  appearance is against them letter the first miss rochley to miss lenox warwick why all this distress my kind harriot why so much anxiety on your isabellas account i hoped my last would have convinced you i am by no means so unhappy as your fears would persuade you no doubt we have suffered severely suffered the unexpected change in our situation is certainly a very mortifying circumstance but remember my dear we are not the first would to heaven we might be the last who have been ruined by that destructive vice twas my poor fathers only foible do not then let us be too severe on his memory nor are we harriot left quite destitute as you suppose far from it my orlandos commission is alone sufficient to maintain him as a gentleman had he no more but he has more  after paying all my fathers debts and sorry sorry am i to say they were mostly what is falsely called debts of honor we find a reversion of near two thousand pounds what is this you will perhaps ask when compared to the noble estate he has lost at the gaming table  nothing  yet harriot how many no less worthy than ourselves are there at this moment who would look upon even our present situation as enviable it is by reflections of this nature i endeavor to reconcile myself to my fate and thank heaven i am reconciled to it  o spare then my dear harriot yours on the memory of my unfortunate father i know they are the effects of your tender affection to me but they hurt my feelings i can pity i can lament his situation this i can allow you to do but indeed you must spare your censures on a conduct which though faulty a daughter ought not to condemn alas he suffered most severely  his agony  his remorse in his last moments would have pierced the most flinty heart  orlandos behavior  but no words can do it justice  twas great  twas noble  not a murmur  not even a sigh escaped him for his own fate all his feelings were for the sufferings of a father whose failings he pitied and wished to forget  he harriot has indeed a degree of manly fortitude to which your poor isabella has no pretensions my resignation proceeds rather from an indifference for the superfluities of life from a happy flow of spirits which has ever led me to look on the bright side of the picture and let me add which should indeed have been first mentioned a firm persuasion that the almighty never wholly forsakes the virtuous nor lays heavier burdens on any of his creatures than they are able to bear what have i then to fear  poverty  be it so far be it from me to believe all who are destitute of riches are miserable  nor can i be deemed absolutely poor having such a brother as my orlando  he may  nay he must rise in his profession if merit can entitle him to it and though that does not always follow yet a very superior degree of it is seldom wholly overlooked and such is his  have i not a kind affectionate friend too in my harriot who i am positively certain will love me more truly now if possible than in my days of prosperity  adversity is justly said to be the test of friendship i am under no apprehensions for the loss of yours  those who may now look cool upon me i have pride enough to despise and thus we are quits  it will show me their real value and that let me tell you is gaining no inconsiderable knowledge  are you convinced my dear harriot that i am not so much to be pitied as you have hitherto kindly feared believe me happiness is an imaginary blessing at least it is in the mind we must seek for it not in those outward trappings which wealth bestows and can only bestow i am very much persuaded i shall find myself as thoroughly satisfied and content nay as vain of my charms too in a neat linen or muslin gown as ever i was when adorned with more costly attire indeed i have somewhere read that beauty when unadorned is adorned the most  it is a doctrine i am now determined to adopt and who knows what may yet happen if that maxim may be depended on my days of conquest are yet to begin that is to say i am to be more capable of it than ever  i feared you see you should fancy i had lived to nearly my nineteenth year without having done any execution and humbled as i am felt my pride alarmed at such an idea  thank heaven however i am setting out in my new plan of life with my heart perfectly at ease  no small consolation that let me tell you  not so my darling orlando and that pains it indeed more than any other wound it could have received  he has now i fear a hopeless passion to struggle with beside all his other misfortunes  you are no stranger to his atachment to the lovely caroline nor her wretch of a brothers rooted aversion to mine  an aversion founded on his superiority they were fellow collegians  he there conceived that envy for his superior talents and the universal esteem he met with from every creature himself excepted and by some other trifling circumstances which has since occurred of which you have seen many proofs it has from that period been his constant endeavor to do him every injury in his power though till now he has met with few or no opportunities  and there is nothing more certain i firmly believe than that  forgiveness to the injured does belong they never pardon who have done the wrong now i say he has it amply in his power to mortify the amiable object of his aversion since caroline is till of age wholly in his power then indeed she may choose for herself and i have every reason to believe her choice is already made but till then she cannot marry without the wretchs consent this however is not the worst time would of course remove this obstacle but the scene is changed  my orlandos sentiments are of a nature so delicate that i am fully persuaded he will or rather has from the moment he knew he had no longer a fortune to offer worthy her accceptance given up every hope of possessing the mistress of his tenderest affections sir john will therefore be again disappointed in his hopes of mortifying him for never will he put it in any womans power to suspect interest could have any influence over him the lovely caroline i well know would rejoice in thus having it in her power to restore the man of her heart to that affluence from which he has so unhappily fallen indeed i can hardly form an idea of a greater gratification than that must be to a noble mind except being able like orlando thus to sacrifice all his prospects of felicity to his ideas of honor  it is the pangs which i am sensible at this moment wrings his generous heart that pains mine most in this our fallen state  all other ills i can look forward to with tolerable fortitude but where my brothers peace of mind is concerned i feel most severely it is only while reflections on this subject occur that my heroism forsakes me it is then i mourn our loss and the little probability there is of his ever being so happy as he justly deserves to be or as my affectionate heart could wish  for alas we may truly be styled orphans since i know not one relation we have in the world on whom we have any possible claim my poor father had no brothers  my amiable and ever to be lamented mother had but one and he died when orlando and i were infants at least we have every reason to believe so as we have never heard of him since  on providence harriot we must place our trust  but had we hundreds of relations are there any on whom we could or ought with so much confidence to rely surely there are not for they though possessed of millions might behold our wants with an eye of indifference all our hopes of sharing their wealth might possibly be disappointed for it is not those who possess most who are always readiest to bestow  but in putting our trust in providence we not only do our duty but cannot fail in being rewarded either in this world or a better  yet alas my dear harriot this i fear is in general a last resource  certain it is your poor isabella has no other i fear if i had you might not have found me capable of making so many pious reflections  i dare not too minutely enter into the scrutiny conscious that it is much easier to preach than practice  of this however i am absolutely certain that the sentiments i have expressed are such as i ought most firmly to believe and though my faith may be weak i trust it will never wholly fail  do not be shocked my dear harriot when i inform you where to address your next letter forget as i endeavor to do the elegant mansion in which i formerly enjoyed the pleasure of your correspondence reflect only that your pleasing epistles will now be doubly dear to me robbed as i am of so many other sources of satisfaction  do not suffer a tear to drop on it in remembrance of the past it is fruitless a thousand things may yet happen to cheer my present prospects i do not despair and why my good girl should you let me find in your next your usual vivacity that will help to restore mine indeed for my orlandos sake i will do my utmost not only to appear but really to be cheerful not for worlds would i give him one moments uneasiness nay in this and only this case would i deceive him and if possible persuade him i am more resigned than it is in nature to be  you have not i am sure forgot our worthy teacher at mrs masons she was ever extremely partial both to you and your isabella our governess was of a more haughty more forbidding cast of course mrs bellmour was our favorite  to what can all this possibly tend cries my harriot what has mrs bellmour to do with the address you was talking of  a great deal my dear  she has lately left our school and has now a house in london where she has half a dozen young women constantly employed in embroidery and other elegant works she has a very numerous acquaintance amongst people of fashion and i hear has great business in that line her house is an excecding good one in an airy situation  no shop  pray let that console you  with her i have determined to reside for a time  my pride forbad my continuing in the country i dreaded the pity of my former acquaintance and trust i shall never require it as it is one of the least pleasing of all consolations and for that reason i fear given so freely  in town i can live as retired as i please and what is still better enjoy my orlandos society daily  he is now my only protector could i then do better than take up my residence near him  mrs belmour is a woman of family of a fine understanding well bred and accomplished our situations are in some degree similar  true there is this difference she though as i said of a good family never had hopes of a fortune her father was a younger brother  married against the consent of his friends was never pardoned and died when she was an infant she was of course brought up without higher views than she has attained to perhaps her fathers misfortunes might deter her from entering into the state of matrimony be that as it will she never did though she has certainly been a fine woman in her day  with her i doubt not i shall find myself very commodiously situated my faithful fanny begged to continue with me indeed i had no thoughts of parting from her but when she saw all the other servants dismissed she feared it was to be her fate also she is a good creature and i believe sincerely attached to me indeed having lived in our family from a girl i can hardly doubt it  nor is this desire a small proof of it  my dear orlando wished me much also to retain my own man  but this i at once declared i would not consent to  could i possibly think of putting him to an expense for a gratification i could so easily dispense with  no harriot  far far rather would i make shift with the bare necessaries of life than encroach on his generosity  it is for his dear sake too i choose to live retired in london i am an absolute stranger i mean to continue so  reading music drawing and needle work with sometimes his loved company will abundantly amuse me thank heaven my mind is not such a blank as that i should like too many others of my sex be compelled to kill time instead of using it to rational purposes lord help those insignificant souls who find every moment of it heavy when not engaged in dissipation  much indeed are they to be pitied and many many such there are in this small town  it is now i think full time to bid you adieu when i am settled in my new habitation you shall hear from me again  in the mean time be under no apprehensions for me i have made up my mind all will do mighty well continue to love me and believe me  ever your affectionate isabella rochley  letter the second same to the same london here i am my dearest harriot and i assure you very comfortably settled  comfortably you cry shocked at the homely phrase  but why shocked  you have been so long accustomed to think of your isabella as enjoying every elegance every luxury of life that the idea of being reduced to the mere comfortable it appears i suppose a mighty uncomfortable expression  now i on the contrary by casting my eyes around me and viewing the thousands who every moment pass my windows visibly destitute of even that blessing think it is no small mercy considering that another unlucky cast of the dice might have put me on a level with the most wretched  it is by reflecting in this manner my dear harriot one finds consolation in fact i have lost nothing essentially necessary to happiness were it not a truth how very very few in this world have any pretensions to it  few i mean in comparison of those who are even in a far worse situation than i am at this moment have i not a kind affectionate brother a friend no less tenderly attached to me  in short i am determined to bid defiance to adversity i will bear it not only with resignation but if possible cheerfully which i am positively certain will strip it of half its horrors no more condolence then no more fruitless repining let us remember this misfortune was brought upon us by a father a kind an indulgent though an imprudent one be his faults and failings forgot and may i ever reflect with gratitude on the thousand benefits we have received from him  a good education well informed understanding sentiments we need not blush to acknowledge these harriot we owe to his paternal care but for those instructions i might not have been able as thank heaven i now can to look back without a sigh to those ample possessions once ours  now in the possession of others perhaps less deserving  why wonder at the fall of a private family  it is a fate from which even the greatest empires are not exempt  but let me farther convince my kind harriot i am not an object of pity by giving her a more minute account of my situation i found mrs bellmours house infinitely more elegant yes elegant than i had any idea of i have three apartments which we will call my drawing room dressing room and bed chamber more than that number i did not aspire to in my fathers house it is true my second is not quite so spacious as my former one there but for that very reason is now preferable as it is more suitable to my circumstances  the furniture is all chintz  my dear orlando has supplied me with a few well chosen books i have my harpsichord my materials for drawing and as for all sorts of elegant works have only to step down to mrs bellmour and there i may at all times see and copy the greatest variety  she is delighted with the honor i have done her in making choice of her house and pays me as much respect as if she were a stranger to my misfortunes she has no other lodgers though she has another set of apartments as good as mine which she can spare but has made a point of taking no person who is not particulaly recommended nor is she very anxious about it as she is in a fair way to make a fortune in a few years by her business  now tell me honestly have i not great reason to bless heaven that i still enjoy so many comforts  surely i have  you will perhaps tell me i am excluded from all society or at least from such as i have hitherto been accustomed to  it is very true and society is undoubtedly the first satisfaction in life  but though i had a numerous acquaintance it by no means follows that in their company i found what i call society  it is in my opinion a thing no longer understood it is still like friendship much talked of but where do we find it  not at public places not at card parties society according to my ideas consists in rational conversation with sensible well informed people  where are they to be met with that there are many such i make no doubt but what avails it  a man or woman of superior understanding makes no better figure  nay i am apt to think a worse figure at a public place or card assembly than one who can only talk of the weather  the fashions the opera or the last new play  and where does one meet any soul but at places of this nature not in london so my loss you see is not great in that article  do you harriot in your conscience think they understand the matter much better in the country  i do not  during the few months people of fashion spend there do they not to the utmost of their power live exactly as they do in town  where then is society to be found  i say it is wholly abolished and in its stead we have only an eternal round of insipid dissipation in which as i said above the fool makes just as good a figure as the man of sense  i never passed a winter in town except one  and upon my honor i never was so tired of any six months since i was born yet i was then in the first company nay admired too as a beauty that circumstance one would think might have kept one awake but i declare to you i have found on many occasions more use for my fan to conceal a yawn than for any other purpose how often have i been one of a large circle of belles and beaux for hours together without hearing a single sentence uttered worth attending to yet all affect amazing vivacity and a laugh is frequently heard when not a soul amongst them if asked what gave rise to it could possibly tell  it is as somebody very justly observed when talking on this very subject  all laugh and no joke  this is society  and this i am likely to be debarred of if i have not it in my power to mix as formerly with the beau monde  am i to be pitied  not one bit  besides my new situation has the charm of novelty to reccommend it and that let me tell you is no small matter  did ever mortal you cry hear any one so eloquent in praise of adversity  perhaps not  but it is my way harriot to make the best i can of a bad bargain  and after all should i be one jot the happier had i given myself up a prey to despair  had i instead of thus endeavoring to forget the past tormented both you and myself with unavailing lamentation  i doubt the fact my dear  my orlando too who makes it my study to keep up my spirits  shall i not do all in my power to assist him in his kind purpose i should little merit his affectionate attention if i did not  here comes the dear creature i hear his voice below  farewell  let me hear from you soon and believe me  ever your isabella rochley  letter the third same to the same london what an angel is caroline my dear harriot  oh she has proved herself the most generous the most exalted of women  you may remember that i broke off abruptly hearing my orlandos voice enquiring for me  read that my isabella cried he giving me a letter and confess that the charming caroline is as i ever believed her a noble minded creature  i have his permission to send you the following copy of it that you may yourself judge whether she does not justly merit the encomiums i have given her  to colonel rochley were i not thoroughly acquainted with the sentiments of the amiable colonel rochley i might perhaps have scrupled to give him this proof of my partiality nor am i ignorant that there are many of my own sex and perhaps of yours who would condemn me for it but i have examined my heart it acquits me and i am in this instance determined to rest satisfied with its decision  to the change in your situation i give not a thought on my own account yourself not your fortune was ever the object of my attachment  i know your worth and i think orlando i know also that you have a tolerable opinion of mine but i also know the delicacy of your sentiments  these if i do not mistake your character will lead you to fancy it incumbnet on you to give up all thoughts of the poor caroline because truly it is no longer in your power to produce a rent roll equal to hers  this may for ought i know be deemed mighty noble mighty generous and all that  but it does not my good friend accord with my ideas nor do i mean to let you so easily off you have  at least you told me so a thousand times  i say you have freely and voluntarily given me your heart i have long looked upon it as my property  with your heart i made not a doubt that i should in due time be able to prevail on you to give me also your hand nay so certain was i of it that i had privately made a vow never to bestow mine on any other of your sex a pretty scrape then i am likely to be brought into should you make a point of playing the hero and for the before mentioned ridiculous reasons give me up  i know my very amiable and affectionate wretch of a brother would see us both perish rather than consent to our union  but if you will condescend to wait  let me see how long  o just four months and three weeks i shall then be my own mistress and as i am very unwilling to break my vow and still more unwilling to seek out for a new lover i am when that happy period arrives determined to sue you for damages should you presume to break yours  and i promise you i shall claim a pretty considerable sum nor will it i think be denied me the loss of my heart let me tell you is no joke  i accuse you of the theft deny it if you can  prepare then either your defense  or what will give me infinitely more satisfaction agree to compromise the affair by keeping it and permitting me to retain yours in return on this condition i here make a second vow that on the day i shall become of age i will offer you my lilly hand in holy matrimony think of what has been said and dont play the simpleton  you must have a very short memory if it is necessary for me to inform you that  i am most truly and affectionately your caroline westbury   p s do not fancy i have formed the above resolution without mature reflection  no  i am too wise too prudent for that believe me  i have weighed the matter as thus  in one scale i put myself and my twenty thousand pounds  in the other your worship your colonels commission with all your accomplishments of mind and person  when behold my ladyships scale instantly kicked the beam nay so very unequal were they that i am positively certain could i have thrown fifty thousand more into it there it would have stuck  the duce is in it then if i shall not have the best bargain  adieu   you have now i presume read the delightful girls letter  what do you think of her my dear harriot  is she not a spirited charming creature  there are those she says who might possibly condemn her  you i trust are not of the stupid number for my part i adore her for her ingenuous candor  she knows orlandos whole happiness centers in her  she knows his worth  who then but the most ridiculously prudish shall presume to say she has not acted like an angel  yes an angel i repeat for alas i fear it is not like the generality of our sex  well my dear orlando cried i when i had read her epistle  what says your heart to this proof of your carolines folly  folly isabella  certainly replied i  must she not be a very weak creature thus to persist in loving you merely for those good qualities which no reverse of fortune can rob you of  what are those compared to an estate of two thousand a year  nothing indeed i believe said he in the estimation of too many of your sex isabella but my engaging caroline has a mind  to play the fool cried i interrupting him thats all  but seriously continued i do not now my dear brother carry your sentiments of honor or generosity too far  there are obstacles enough to your felicity already let it be your business to remove not by a false delicacy to add to them remember the lively affectionate carolines happiness is at stake as well as yours  has she not freely confessed it  she has cried he in raptures and i am the happiest of mortals yes isabella i will look forward with hope  hope replied i nay with certainty  only beware of that wretch her brother i know no villainy of which he is not capable suffer him to believe you have now given up all thoughts of his sister be cautious how you conduct yourself beware that none of your letters fall into his hands i have no fears on your account my dear orlando it is for your carolines safety i tremble wholly in his power as she is at present who can say what his hatred to to you and his sordid avarice may prompt him to  go my beloved brother go and answer the charming girls letter as it deserves but as i said before take care that it is safely conveyed to her  he left me the happiest of beings  yet a thousand delicate scruples damped his joy but i think conscious as he is that her felicity as i told him depends upon him he will conquer them  thus my dear friend all my sorrows are at an end  my orlando will yet be happy  can i then fail to be completely so  impossible  no more repining no more reflections then on the past who can say what a day can bring forth this has been a happy one to morrow may be no less so    i trust it will and am ever yours isabella rochley  letter the fourth miss lenox to miss rochley northampton you are persuaded you say in one of your letters i shall love you with more sincerity now in your adversity than ever i did in your days of prosperity  why really my dear isabella the thing is mighty easily accounted for though it is not exactly according to the modern ideas of friendship have i not by this change in your situation had an opportunity to discover a thousand good qualities in you which but for that neither you nor i might ever have suspected you possessed  how could it ever have entered my head that isabella rochly born and bred in affluence accustomed from her infancy to all the luxuries all the gratifications wealth could bestow should when unexpectedly robbed of them all continue the same lively cheerful creature she ever was  who i say could have believed it  well may you say you bid defiance to poverty  with a mind as yours evidently is formed what as you say have you to fear  all this is great  is noble my dear isabella yet though convinced your sentiments are right rational and all that  i cannot help feeling  aye and fearing too  but you will tell me i am a jobs comforter  it is very true  the fact is had you as every other mortal in your case would have done filled your letters with sighs and tears with ahs  and ohs as long as my arm  i should have taken he other side of the question and have endeavored to console you by every means in my power  but your astonishing resignation  your truly christian philosophy leaves me nothing to say  i can only wonder and admire  and love you most affectionately  having therefore nothing more to do let us chat as usual  on a late event merely a on an unpleasant dream  and first for the charming caroline  no no believe me i am not one of the stupid number who condemn her if any such there be which i very much doubt  at least if they are acquainted with orlando rochley i pronounce the thing impossible  one there is  him i had forgot but he is a wretch not worth naming her brother i mean  but though not worth naming  he is an object to be feared  do you know isabella i am assured he is at this moment in treaty with one of his gambling companions who has taken it into his head to fancy himself capable of being desperately in love th the dear girl sir john has lost a very considerable sum of money to him  i believe at the last newmarket races this sum he has promised to give up on condition he receives the hnd of caroline in its stead and also to accept fifteen thousand instead of the twenty to which she is entitled on the day she is of age  this i am informed and from pretty good authority is the bargain these two worthy baronets have struck judge you whether they will leave any stone unturned to accomplish their vile plot sir john it is well known is over head and ears in debt  sir james henderson rich as a jew and though incapable of a real attachment spares no expense to gratify his passions  or the whim of the moment  i tell you this my dear isabella not that i have any apprehensions farther than the trouble they may occasion  thank heaven we live in a land of liberty a woman cannot be forced into matrimony against her will  and of all women caroline westbury is least likely she has more sense more spirit than half the fellows in england consequently they will make but a bungling hand of the business but as i said above they may torment and give her a great deal of trouble  you may do as you please in regard to informing your dear brother of what i now tell you i think it may not be amiss knowing ones enemies one may the better guard against their machinations indeed being master of her generous heart i think he has nothing to fear he has only to have patience and as you say all will do mighty well  but why my dear isabella this very retired plan of yours  i see no reason for it why not enjoy a little society i was going to say  forgetting you had proved to me it is a thing no longer existing  perhaps not according to your antiquated notions but you in your turn forget that all one has to do in this world of ours is to take things as we find them while thus indulging your simple plan the only simple one by the way you ever formed  the world will take it for granted you are weeping and wailing your misfortunes unable to bear this reverse with proper resignation take my word for it they will never be kind enough to impute your conduct to the real motive they will be glad to find a defect in a character hitherto deemed perfect disappoint them my dear isabella convince them your happiness depended not on so fickle a being as madam fortune nor could her ill favored daughter miss rob you of your felicity  give them not such a triumph my dear girl but let them see you are still the lively cheerful companion you ever were i know you have but few acquaintance in town but if amongst those there are any whose company can afford you an hours amusement why not enjoy it  i am not without hopes of spending a few months in london this winter if i do emerge you must for that i shall spoil your philosophical plan is most certain so you may as well drop it at once my love to orlando  let me hear from you soon and tell me whether you have obeyed my commands remember me also to our old friend mrs bellmour and doubt not the affection of your unalterable  harriot lenox  letter the fifth same to the same northampton i write this in haste be not too much alarmed my dear isabella  i wish i could spare you the anxiety these lines i well know must occasion but i cannot answer it to my heart were i to conceal what so nearly concerns your peace  sir john i am informed by one who is acquainted with all his motions has by some base means or other seen your brothers letter to miss westbury i suspect he also knew of hers to him  be that as it will he is outrageous and swears he will shoot the colonel through the head rather than she shall give herself and fortune to a beggar that was his elegant phrase  but above all to the man he detests  it is said but this i cannot affirm he set off for london yesterday  accompanied by that wretch henderson  did they possess one spark of honor between them i should be less apprehensive but they do not  they dare not  i am certain  they have not sufficient spirit to demand satisfaction as it is called like gentlemen  they are too conscious of his superiority openly to avow their designs his courage is too well known for that  they are mere bullies  and cowards of course  all i mean by telling you this is that you may caution your brother  charge him to be on his guard  i really hardly know what it is i fear  but such is my affection for you both that even the shadow of danger makes me tremble should sir john really be gone to town they may chance to meet and who can say what may be the consequence  warn orlando then to avoid him  i have time for no more lest my well meant intelligence should come too late  heaven bless you both prays your affectionate  harriot lenox  letter the sixth miss westbury to lady bell sydney westburyhall your ladyship is impatient you say to hear how i have settled matters with my gallant colonel  why my dear lady bell had the affair been left to my management it would have been happily settled long ago for i think i could in spite of his heroics have prevailed on the dear creature to have taken me for better for worse  yet such are his obsolete notions of honor  generosity and other equally absurd ideas that i should i believe in my conscience have had enough to do  but i told you nay i sent you a copy of the epistle i wrote him on hearing the situation his imprudent father left him in  the loss of his fortune never gave me one hours concern on my own account persuaded mine is abundantly sufficient to satisfy any two reasonable people and reasonable i have ever found him except in this instance  here truly his pride steps in can he think of giving a beggar to the woman he adores  that is the burden of his melancholy song  however as i was saying i believe my eloquence might have prevailed had i been at liberty to argue the case with him as i wished but behold my good for nothing brother has found means to stop all farther proceedings at present  and by such means as none but a being like himself actuated by the basest of all motives could have stooped too  he naturally suspected the change in colonel rochleys situation could make none in my sentiments my attachment he knew was built on a more permanent foundation  he therefore made several attemps to discover my thoughts on the subject but to no purpose well did i know his and therefore chose to disappoint him  however he was too artful for me  he bribed my maid  she knew i had received a letter from him though i never make people in that line my confidents as too many misses do  but having a better opinion of her than i find she deserved made no secret of it  she knew our attachment she knew his hand writing  and in short when questioned on the subject at the same time eyeing a purse of gold  she answered as he wished and promised i presume to get him a sight of the letter  how she contrived this i know not unless by a false key to my cabinet as i think i could not be so careless as to leave it open  be that as it will  a few days ago while at breakfast with my tyrant he with rage malice and a thousand other amiable passions strongly depicted on his expressive countenance produced the said epistle at the same time abusing us both in a language which would have done credit to an inhabitant of billingsgate  i bore the storm with most provoking philosophic calmness  this he poor soul could not bear  we females my dear lady bell have a thousand times more command of our tempers than these lords of the creation as they style themselves  so you have really been mean spirited enough cried he half choked with passion to offer yourself to this fellow  even so replied i and pray brother what can you possibly have to say to it  it cannot surely interfere with your happiness you fond as you ever were of me cannot marry me yourself what in the name of common sense then is it to you who does provided he is a gentleman a man of worth of character  he is neither cried he he is a d  nd  stop my good friend said i interrupting him  no naughty words i beseech you  you know  yes well do you know colonel rochley is all i have described but i also know not only that you have long entertained sentiments for him which do no great credit to your understanding but i know also the cause  his evident superiority not his inferiority sir john is the crime you cannot pardon he has made you look rather simple on more occasions than one it is no secret my good brother you know it is not  i might not now or ever have reproached you with it had you not thus compelled me to it in order to justify my partiality by proving to you he has no other fault even in your eyes  surely he is not answerable for the misconduct of his father more than i am for that of my brother his family  his  d  n  his family cried he  well if you insist upon it replied i with a provoking smile i fear i cannot help it but pray spare the colonel  my dear lady bell i actually thought he would have beat me  and perhaps i did deserve a box on the ear  to cut this matter short continued i and to save all farther altercation on the subject i now declare to you freely and heartily i am fully determined to give my hand to this beggar the very day i can also present him with it my fortune  till then i have no such intention nor shall you then be such a cursed fool cried he if i can help it and i think i shall find ways for that  so saying away he bounced  i soon followed in order to lecture my abigail fully persuaded she had betrayed me if i may call it so though as i never trusted her i believe it is not exactly the case  on questioning her she denied the whole but in such a manner that i was fully convinced in her guilt and accordingly dismissed her without farther ceremony  thus have i given those particulars you wish to be acquainted with my present situation is none of the pleasantest but thank heaven i am not very apt to give way to despair the time is at no great distance when i shall be at full liberty to act as i think proper teazed in the mean time i expect to be but have made up my mind to bear it i might no doubt quit our family mansion and take up my residence with some of my friends but it would answer no good purpose for the fact is they one and all pronounce me imprudent at least thus to throw myself and fortune away as they call it on a man who cannot now make such settlements as i am entitled to  i on the contrary tell them he has made all i ever had an ambition for  he has settled his heart upon me  i hear his charming sister chose to live in london rather than continue in the country where the misfortunes of her family will of course be a subject of conversation for ages  i think she judged perfectly right  there too she is more immediately under the protection of her generous noble minded brother oh how much contrast to mine i am told she resembles him both in mind and person  happy my dear lady bell should i have been had it been in my power to offer the lovely girl an asylum with me  such a companion would have been the most desirable thing in life but my brothers rooted aversion to her whole family puts that out of the question at present  when the happy day arrives that he is no longer my master i shall make it my first request to my dear rochley  till then imust deny myself that pleasure  in spite of the pretty trick that has been played me i shall contrive some means to continue a correspondence with him but there is no hurry we know each others sentiments that is the most material point  and so the matter rests adieu my dearest friend  you see i am in a fair way to be one of the poor persecuted damsels  this comes of falling in love  take care how you my dear get into this unfortunate scrape  and believe me most truly  your affectionate caroline westbury  letter the seventh miss rochley to miss lenox london a thousand thanks my dearest harriot for your friendly intelligence i instantly made my brother acquainted with it who had the civility to laugh at our feminine apprehensions  how can you my dear orlando said i make a joke of what to us appears a very serious cause of alarm why my sweet isabella replied he because fighting is my profession would you then have me like you tremble at the thoughts of a sword or pistol  no certainly cried i heaven forbid had you a man of honor to deal with but who can say what a wretch like sir john may be capable of  i vow i should not wonder if he had you assassinated  no no isabella when you form plans of that nature you must lay the scene in spain or portugal there we hear of adventures of that nature though i will be sworn where one story of the kind is true fifty are false depend upon it you have nothing of that kind to apprehend  certain it is i should be sorry on my carolines account to have a fracas with him nay for her sake and for yours too my dear isabella i will not seek an occasion of meeting him as far as i can with honor i will even avoid it  but if by chance we do meet  and he should presume to insult me by look or word why my dear i shall endeavor to teach him better manners  but take my word for it he has too much regard for his person to put it needlessly in danger  i know him of old  he has adopted hudibrass maxim great are the perils that inviron the man who meddles with cold iron but should it come to that be assured he will be wise enough to consider that  he who fights and runs away may live to fight another day but he who is in battle slain will never rise to fight again was it possible harriot to forbear laughing in spite of my fears at the idea this gave me of his antagonist  i confess his agreeable vivacity put them almost to flight i begin to think the creature will not have courage to face him for according to shakespeare conscience makes cowards of us all and i am sure his must accuse him of envy malice and a thousand other diabolical passions  i again begged my brother for my sake to be on his guard he smiled saying he was on the point of obeying me as he was just going to be on guard at the tower  you choose to be witty my dear orlando said i but though this duty will prevent me seeing you for some time i rejoice to hear you are obliged to be there as i think the wretch will not have courage to follow you to a place so capable of making a vigorous defense  he now kindly kissed my cheek bid me fear nothing be cheerful amuse myself the best way i could till he saw me again and left me much more at ease than when he entered certain of his carolines attachment master of her invaluable heart he is as happy as this world can make him  you do not my dear harriot altogether approve my retired plan of life  i have made no vows to seclude myself from the world should i ever meet with a temptation to enter into its amusements  far from it i am of too sociable a disposition for that but i think decency propriety not to mention my own feelings forbid it at present  you forget harriot it is not many months since my dear fathers death and however we may have suffered by his imprudent conduct  i lament it most unfeignedly  another reason i have too which you have also forgot  shall i  can i do you think take advantage of my orlandos generosity and run into any unnecessary expenses forbit it heaven  no no harriot  i will content myself for a while with such amusements as i can enjoy without robbing him of the little he is now master of  a time may come when he can better spare it and i am not so old as to fear a decay in my charms before i have an opportunity to display them to the world  in the mean time assure yourself i am not merely comfortable but as happy as a queen  i am upon my honor and as a proof of it i am just going to sing and play seaton cliff  a new song my orlando brought me this morning he tells me i shall like it  adieu  ever yours isabella rochley  letter the eighth miss westbury to lady bell sidney westburyhall i have since you last heard from me my dear lady bell met with a trifle which gave and very foolishly half an hours uneasiness  not more for a moments cool reflection convinced me twas an artifice of my brothers and his friend sir james henderson  but take the particulars  a few days ago we had dined tete a tete  he was in better temper than usual not a word of the colonel was said  it is a subject i never start though of all others the most pleasing to me he chose to be very eloquent in praise of sir james was astonished i did not see him in the same favorable light so fine a fortune  such great connections etc and then so distractedly in love with me so constant in spite of the cold reception his addresses met with  i owned it was very astonishing as i was reckoned a girl of taste but there was no help for it some people were blind to their own interest and i supposed i was one of the unlucky number  he did not i believe greatly relish my manner of expressing myself but said no more  on his quitting the room i observed a letter lying by the chair he had sat on  it was open  i cannot say i felt any sort of curiosity to view the contents nor should i had i not by mere chance seen the name of rochley i am now persuaded he had dropped it in that open manner that i might see it sensible nothing less would tempt me to peruse it and in this instance he really did discover some share of sagacity  here follows a copy of the delectable scrawl i own as i said before i was weak enough to be fluttered for about half an hour   dear jack you may make yourself perfectly easy would i could hope the news i now send you were likely to make me so  who knows but it may your charming sister may possibly when convinced as she soon will be that her favored colonel is unworthy the honor she does him treat me with less severity  he is at this very time paying his addresses to a merchants daughter in the city she has fifty thousand pounds in her own power and they say her heart fell a sacrifice to his red coat and cockade some time ago at almacks  she freely told him so  and made him an offer of that convenient sum on condition he would take her into the bargain to this he very wisely agreed and they are to be married without farther ceremony next week  what i tell you you may depend upon as a fact for i had it from the girls brother father she has none and he curses her for a fool  so you may make yourself easy no fear of his being grafted into your family now  one thing i make a point of not a word of this to your sister i wish not to be the first who shall inform her of it she may perhaps fancy i am mean enough to triumph on the occasion  i do not  i own i cannot help being highly pleased because i flatter myself were he once fairly out of her reach she may chance to cast a favorable eye upon your humble servant  one thing is certain if she does not  curse me if i care a straw if all the rest of her sex were blind  once more mind what i say  no tatling  i know you will be bursting to tell her  but if you do  or at least if you give me as the author of the intelligence i will blow your brains out the next time we meet my officiousness as she will call it can only give her a worse impression of me than she has already and that is needless  so be dumb i charge you she will hear it soon enough from others  yours james henderson   how do you like it lady bell  artful and really better manufactered than i believed either of them capable of  i hope you will own it was enough to stagger one at the first reading  i confess it did me  for after all men are but men however i am fully determined not to believe one word of the matter  and as i love to do things openly and honestly i have treated my colonel with a copy of it enclosed in a few lines from myself civilly desiring he will himself tell me whether there is any truth in it as i would sooner take his word than that of any other person  at the same time adding my opinion which as i have already told you is that it is an abominable falsehood  i did not think it quite convenient to tell him who was the eloquent author of this epistle that might have led to disagreeable consequences  but what you will grant is still a better joke i have taken no notice of having found it though that it was dropped on purpose for me to pick up is as clear as noon day  i could expire with laughing at the thoughts of my having thus disappointed the dear creatures by pretending to know nothing of the matter  when we met at tea  i found my brother was brimfull of expectation  i affected to be more gay more lively than usual  yet took care not to over act my part i was humming a favorite air when he came in and continued it he was visibly in the fidgets  tried first one chair then another  but all in vain  i made the tea with all imaginable composure  and at last finding i would not break the ice and of course fearing the matter would come to an untimely end if he did not lend a helping hand to restore it  caroline said he looking very like a fool pray did you find a letter i have dropped one some where and cannot for my soul find it  you see my dear lady bell i had nothing for it but to tell an absolute lie mincing the matter would have spoiled the joke  no replied i i really saw none  no cried he shocked to death at the very idea that his plot should have miscarried  surely you must for i am pretty certain i had it in my pocket at dinner  are you equally certain said i you have not lost it out of doors o quite so replied he it must have fallen in the dining room while taking out my handkerchief it is very likely said i i will ring and order a servant to look for it it may be there still perhaps or some of them may have picked it up  i hope it is of no great importance in case it is not to be sound  this was an awkward sort of a question was it not my dear lady bell he felt it to be so and looked more foolish if possible than before and waved giving an answer  i rung the bell  john step into the dining room and see if you can find a letter there your master has dropped one and fancies it was in that room  away went john  i need hardly tell you the poor epistle was not to be found  make farther enquiries said i amongst the servants some of them may have got it  lost it cannot be in the house and unless there were bank bills in it i can hardly suppose any of them can have motives for not restoring it  i hope it contained none brother  such was the command i had of my countenance my dear friend that i saw plainly i had fairly taken him in  no you never saw mortal in so ridiculous a situation  it is impossible to conceive it  what was now to be done here was a fine well concerted plot blown to air he had sense enough to see that telling me the contents would never do  twas too late  i should immediately suspect he had dropped it on purpose or why not have told me the mighty news at dinner if he could do it now  this argument might have no weight had the business been of an honest nature i am sensible  but here the case was different he felt i should not believe one word of the story if told simply without all the coroberating circumstances contained in the unfortunate epistle  it was to do it justice wrote most plausibly  sir james begging he would not inform me of it for instance  how now tell it without disobeying that injunction and of course robbing his poor friend of the merit he hoped to acquire by that very injunction this was a dilema not to be got over  what then could the silly soul do better than let the matter drop and this he very prudently did  whether this disaster will cure them of ploting heaven only knows  you see not a doubt remains with me that it was a plot  though i have not yet had it cleared up by my dear rochley  this i hope to have in a few days as i have taken effectual care neither my letter nor his answer shall again fall into my brothers hands  and he i fancy fearing his answer to his confederate might by some unlucky chance fall into mine has thought proper to set off full speed for london to tell the story in person  i would give something to hear their dialogue on the subject poor sir john can make but a very so so figure on the occasion his friend will set him down as a mere marplot though i think i have the best title to that appellation  for twas certainly i that marred it  i flatter myself the story will divert your ladyship and so i leave you that you may laugh without interruption  yours ever caroline westbury  letter the ninth miss rochley to miss lenox london alas my dear harriot your fears your kind apprehensions were but too well founded  i may now say i am as wretched a being as ever existed  completely wretched  it is possible the dreadful news may ever this have reached you but the particulars cannot and well i know the melancholy story will be told by my loved brothers enemies with every possible aggravation for it is known only to them  the particulars i mean alas the event can be no secret  i am almost blind with weeping and can scarce see what i write yet what other consolation is now left me  little did your poor isabella think when she last wrote to you in such good spirits that she was in a few days to be reduced to such deplorable distress you have seen me bear the loss of fortune without a sigh still blessed with the tender affection of a beloved brother i found nothing wanting to my happiness  he was all the world to me  but i have perhaps seen him for the last time  oh my harriot do i live to write it i cannot proceed  my heart is torn with anguish it bleeds for the misfortunes of my amiable orlando  yes my dear harriot it is still for him i mourn  all his prospects of felicity are now for ever blasted  fate has done its worst he has mortally wounded the brother of his caroline  judge then the condition i am in at this distracting moment  sitting some days ago at my harpsichord in order to practice another new song the dear creature had sent me that i might sing it to him when next he called  the following letter was brought me  it pains me more than i can express to give my tender my affectionate isabella one moments uneasiness  think then my beloved sister what i now suffer while thus obliged to tell her i fear it may be long ever i see her again  oh that i could find words to soften the sad story for gladly would i at the instant i am under the cruel necessity of wounding your feeling heart also pour into it the balm of consolation but my wishes are vain  know then my isabella your brother has wounded  and alas it is seared mortally  the brother of the woman he adores  need i add more to convince you i am wretched  before you receive this i shall be on my way to the continent i fly my beloved isabella more for your dear sake than my own  the idea of leaving you friendless i could not stand i fly in order to preserve a life which for your sake and for yours only i think worth my care had there been any witness to the transaction on whose honor i could have depended i should have had little or nothing to apprehend but there unfortunately was not  sir john and his friend henderson were alone privy to it  a few persons however gathered round us when the deed was done and the former then in dying accents had the baseness to declare to them i was the aggressor and his murderer  this horrid this false accusation sir james endeavored to confirm  what then had i to hope they might have considered that as there were two to one the story appeared improbable but in the confusion a scene of this nature naturally occasions this reflection did not occur or father was not attended to for i offered it in my justification  happily for me the night was exceedingly dark and while they were employed in conveying him to the nearest surgeon i made my escape and instantly getting into the first carriage i met with drove home put up a few things and accompanied by my faithful frederick jumped into a post chaise and set off for dover this i write at the first stage my beloved isabella  you shall hear from me again when safely landed on the other side of the water  keep up your spirits my dear sister exert that fortitude you have on a former melancholy crisis given such evident proofs you are possessed of  remember it will be the greatest consolation i can now enjoy to hear you do not sink under this affliction  god bless and preserve you my isabella and grant we may yet meet again in happier days prays your ever tenderly attached and truly  affectionate brother orlando rochley   happily for me the worthy mrs bellmour came with it herself  i had no sooner cast my eyes over the distracting contents then i fell lifeless on the sopha where i sat  but my grief you will naturally conceive so need not attempt to describe what i felt at that terrible moment or what i still feel  i am unable to write any more at present  alas why should i what can i say that will not distress you as well as myself  i am dying with impatience to hear again from my poor orlando  mrs bellmour informs me this moment the vile sir john is still alive though there are no hopes of his recovery  wretched as he has made me i yet for my beloved brothers sake earnestly pray that he may survive it oh harriot pity me and join your prayers to those of your  ever affectionate but truly unhappy isabella rochley  letter the tenth miss westbury to lady bell sidney london i would sooner have acknowledged the favor of your kind your affectionate letter my dear lady bell had it been in my power  but what with the dreadful shock i have met with and the hurry of my journey it was impossible  i know you will forgive the seeming want of attention at a time like this  i arrived in town sooner by some hours than i believed it could have been done indeed i never quitted the carriage but drove night and day such was my impatience to see my poor brother alas i no longer remember his unkindness his present situation alone engrosses all my care  he still lives my dear friend and the surgeons tell me he may linger for some time but they give me no farther hopes  he appeared sensible of my attention in thus hurrying to town but shocked me beyond expression by the ungenerous manner in which he mentioned colonel rochley  ungenerous i must call it since no power on earth will ever be able to persuade me he could act in a dishonorable manner  this my dear lady bell is a point from which i never will recede in whatever light the rest of the world may look upon the unfortunate affair  he is my brother it is true  but this circumstance alone shall not tempt me to do injustice to the most amiable the most worthy of men though alas that man can now be nothing to me my hopes of happiness are for ever destroyed whether he is innocent or guilty but still i will be just  oh no  it was not in his nature to take undue advantage of even his greatest enemy  never shall they persuade me of it  who but the prejudiced can give credit to so cruel an aspersion nay were not appearances strongly against must i say my unfortunate brother surely they were  he was accompanied by his friend  colonel rochley was alone when they met  this even they themselves cannot deny  but they add he was the agressor he sought the quarrel by first insulting sir john  never will i believe it  no his regard for me i am well assured would have prevented that i know it perfectly nay i am no less certain he would on my account have put up with more from him than from any man breathing i know it well  great must have been the provocation that could tempt him to an action which he could not but be sensible must put an end to all his hopes of obtaining the hand of your caroline  so that whatever happens  whether my brother lives or dies he is as far as the nature of the shocking case will admit justified in my opinion  oh how my heart bleeds for his amiable sister my dear lady bell what must her distress be at this cruel moment did i but know where to find her i would fly to offer every consolation in my power  indeed i would let the illjudging world say what they pleased my own feelings would acquit me my heart tells me it would be an act of humanity and i would trust to its dictates  but i have not the smallest clue to guide me to the lovely mourner she may by this time possibly have left london  my brother asks for me i hear i must bid your lordship adieu  ever yours caroline westbury  letter the eleventh colonel rochley to isabella calais durst i but flatter mysel this would find my dearest sister tolerably recovered from the shock i am but too sensible my last letter would give her half my distress would be at an end  after a few hours sailing i arrived safely here and safely i may remain here till my unfortunate affair can be happily adjusted let this console you my beloved isabella during my absence long it will not be i hope happen what will i have friends and powerful ones too who will do all they possibly can to serve me i am therefore under no apprehensions for the consequences your orlandos honor has never yet thank heaven been called in question nor will it now  i have sent over the real state of the case to my worthy general i have received many proofs of his friendship and regard and am certain he will not now withdraw them  the ungenerous account sir john wished to propagate be assured my isabella will not gain credit my character is too well known so is his  i say not this by way of reflection on him i scorn the thought  i mention it merely as a matter from which you my sister may draw some consolation  he still lives i find by a letter i received yesterday from a friend  who can say but he may yet recover  independent of my own safety it would give me unspeakable satisfaction  believe me i am not one of those who can however honorably be the death of a fellow creature without remorse i my dear isablla though conscious the fatal deed was done in selfdefence feel it a very serious matter and trust that circumstance will acquit me in the sight of heaven in the opinion of the world i cannot doubt but it will  let me hear from you immediately i will give you my address before i seal my letter let me have the happiness of hearing you have exerted yourself on this occasion that you bear the trial as becomes one of your excellent understanding tell me also whether mrs bellmour is as attentive as anxious to render your situation agreeable and convenient as she was when i left you  and tell me truly  i will not knowingly suffer my isabella to be treated with disrespect  i think she is incapable of it  i have been thinking i know not how justly that it might perhaps save you some trouble were you to change your name till my return what i mean is the friends of sir john may possibly be indelicate enough should they by chance find out your place of residence to make some impertinent inquiries about me  this may not  indeed it is not very probable it should happen but i would to the utmost of my power guard my beloved sister from even the shadow of an insult and i should look upon any enquiry they might think proper to trouble you with in regard to the affair in that light at any rate it can have no bad effects the idea occured to me i therefore mention it though i believe on reflection it is quite unnecessary so do as you please my dear  you may possibly wonder how i have been able to write so long a letter without once naming miss westbury  no longer you see dare i indulge myself in calling her my caroline  that is a felicity i must now resign  yet she is dear infinitely dear to me and must ever be so while i have life  but though all my fond my flattering hopes are thus cruelly blasted i would not willingly forfeit her esteem i have therefore presumed unhappily circumstanced as i am to write to her that i might as far as is consistent with truth and honor justify myself i have the vanity to believe she will not readily give credit to any report she may hear if any such there are that will throw a stain on my character i think she will do me more justice  even the word of a dying brother should he dare to persist in his first ungenerous ungentleman like assertion will not i am confident induce her to believe i could act dishonourably  i have frequently regretted my dear isabella that with minds so congenial as yours and my beloved carolines you should be strangers to each other  yet alas what would it now have availed  you would only have been more sensible of her worth and of course have felt your orlandos disappointment the more severely  adieu my sister my friend let me soon receive such a letter from you as you think will give pleasure to the heart of your tenderly attached  and affectionate brother orlando rochley  letter the twelfth isabella to colonel rochley london yes  i will endeavor to write such a letter as i think will give pleasure to the heart of the most amiable of brothers is there any effort in my power i would not exert to the utmost for this dear purpose oh no  i have recovered the sad shock your former letter gave me indeed i have  i am quite well again  even you my orlando who give me credit for so large a share of fortitude would be amazed to see how well i bear it  are you not pleased with your poor isabella for this but i am sure you are  through mrs bellmours means i hear daily of sir john and have at length the inexpressible happiness of informing you he is not only still alive but the doctors begin to have hopes  faint hopes they are i believe but this is something i shall with the probability of that wished event his recovery i mean be able to bear your absence without repining  for not for worlds would i have you return till you can do it with perfect safety and this cannot be till he is pronounced out of danger which is yet very far from being the case  at present he has not only his wounds to contend with but a violent fever occasioned by them they say  alas what will they not say to aggravate the melancholy event indeed mrs bellmour tells me should he thus linger for a twelvemonth and dye at the end of it the surgeons may pronounce them the cause of his death  is this possible  yet it may to be sure bring on a bad state of health which may  but let me not think of it  i will believe better things  i rejoice to hear you have wrote to miss westbury  or shall i say your caroline yes i will indulge the dear hope that she may yet be yours  should her brother live who can prevent it  and is there not now a probability what would i not have given for this a few days ago  i mistake the charming girls character exceedingly my dear orlando if she can so far mistake yours as to harbor a thought injurious to your honor  she knows you too well  and i must say she knows her brother too well also to take his word for  an impossibility  and now let me do justice to my good friend mrs bellmour by answering your sweetly kind enquiries  believe me she is more attentive more obliging if possible every day i really can never be sufficiently grateful for her tender care of me when i first heard of the sad affair which has robbed me of your dear society  i will now i have pretty well got over the shock confess i thought it would have killed me so did my truly kind friend i believe and but for such a friend i cannot say what might happened  but i am now as i before assured you quite well and you see in better spirits than my orlando expected  apropos  i had almost forgot to answer one part of your dear letter i mean in regard to changing my name for a while  i cannot see any necessity for it that is certain  yet two circumstances have determined me to do it  the first because the idea took its rise from my ever kind and considerate brothers care of his grateful isabella none but a mind delicate and anxious as yours could have formed one of that nature  had i no other motive that alone would have induced me to adopt the plan the second is as follows  the day before yesterday a person quite a stranger to mrs bellmour stopped her as she was going out at the door and she says in an awkward kind of a manner asked the young ladys name who lodged with her  pray let me first ask you replied she what is your reason for desiring to know  the man not being prepared sor this very prudent question i presume hesitated and was at a loss how to answer it  but again begged she would tell him  you must excuse me sir said she i do not think myself authorized to do it without her permission  you are a stranger to me and of course to the lady since you do not even know her name  i have several young people in my house and consequently cannot be certain which of them you mean if your business is of a nature necessary for any one of them to be acquainted with you must contrive to inform her of it in a proper manner  but i am persuaded you are mistaken  indeed i am not replied he  she left him but instead of going out as she intended very prudently returned into the house in order to warn her family to be on their guard in case he should make any farther enquiries or knock at the door  she came up to me to tell me thinking it might afford me a moments amusement  now though i have very little reason to fancy he really did mean me  yet it is possible he might these are my two reasons  which though both trifling when taken seperately yet when joined they amount to something and so my dearest brother address your letters for the future to  to  any miss you please  not so neither  it is necessary to fix on one though no matter what  miss beverly then let it be  i shall tell mrs bellmour and give the latter circumstance only as my reason for the change  she i well know will approve whatever has prudence for its motive and as i am situated one cannot be too cautious a stranger as i am and now deprived of my dear protector  adieu my beloved brother may heaven preserve and soon restore you to your  ever affectionate friend and sister isabella rochley  letter the thirteenth miss rochley to miss lenox london rejoice with me my dear harriot i have had a second letter from my orlando he is well is safe and writes in as good spirits as a feeling mind in his unfortunate situation can be supposed to do  what a brother am i blessed with how kind how affectionately attentive to every thing that concerns his poor isabella i might name ten thousand instances but one shall suffice at present nor need i indeed have mentioned this since you my harriot know him well  but it is in some degree necessary to clear up what is to follow or what in fact may as well go before  know then that for a while th at is to say till his anxiously wished return you are to address your letters to me by the name of beverly  you are i presume amazed but i am going to explain the matter he tells me that while reflecting on my present unprotected state it occured to him that it was possible sir johns family should they discover where i was to be found might be indelicate enough to trouble me with enquiries about him and as he kindly wishes to guard me against every possibility of being insulted he proposed my taking another name during his absence  now though i think there is no probability of this happening yet as it was an idea that occured to my orlando whose sentiments are more delicate more refined in regard to what concerns our sex than any mortal i know  i could not refuse to gratify him not that he makes a point of it  by no means on the contrary he afterward says he is persuaded it is unnecessary adding do as you please  i will certainly do it as it can have no disagreeable consequences and may save me the trouble he so kindly apprehends  miss beverly then my dear harriot must for some time be your friend and correspondent  i have the satisfaction to tell you i hear sir john it is thought may yet get over it  but he is still exceedingly ill if he does recover it must be a work of time he had lived a very irregular life his constitution by no means a good one and rendered still worse by every kind of intemperance yet should he unfortunately die within the twelve month i am told it may be imputed to that miserable ren contre  how dreadful is this my dear harriot  how very hard upon my darling brother  but as i perpetually say let us hope the best  and now for want of a more important subject to fill the rest of my paper let me tell you i have lately had a peep at some of the beau monde whose society you so much wish me to enjoy  a peep i say for it was no more  mrs bellmour is busily employed at present in embroidering a trimming for the birthday  it is for a lady beningfield a young and handsome widow  i never beheld any thing more truly elegant i often sit by her while she is at work at it by way of spending an hour agreeably when tired of my book or music  a day or two ago i was thus engaged when the fair widows carriage drove to the door  i would have retired but unluckily they were in the passage before i could reach it the street door being open a servant having that instant came in of course i must have met them there  i returned to my seat very easy about the matter  in she swam most affectedly  followed by another lady and a beau  a belle without a beau you know my harriot would be as awkward as  as  i leave you my dear to find a simile  the beauty  elegance and expressive countenance of her fair friend struck me exceedingly never did i behold so much sweetness yet a great deal of vivacity in any mortal before no affectation no airs  the other made up of both to her very finger ends  now for the beau cries my harriot  why i must do him the justice to say he appears if i may judge from so slight a knowledge of him as if he deserved a more manly appelation  except my dear orlando i never beheld so fine a figure nor a man so perfectly graceful  mighty fine cries harriot upon my word isabella you have a pretty knack at description   must i add harriot your poor friend seemed to attract some degree of their notice in spite of the enchanting the divine trimming as her ladyship every moment called it the young lady gazed upon me in so particular a manner yet with so much respect and sweetness in her manner that i really fancied she was endeavoring to recollect me believing she had seen me before  how true this is i know not but in that light her glances struck me  as for his lordship  for he was a lord i soon found  he of course could not overlook a female who has been reckoned something more than tolerable i caught him peeping  so alas did lady beningfield and many a gentle tap on the shoulder she gave him for not paying quite enough attention to the dear trimming twenty times did she call him an insensible wretch and other such phrases peculiar to the bon ton  she too once or twice deigned to cast an eye upon me but soon changed them to a more pleasing object by turning to a large mirror which was placed most commodiously before her  all matters settled  a thousand orders given they at length took their leave her ladyship crying come creature why dont you lead me to my carriage for the beau was unfortunately stretching his neck over mrs bellmours shoulder to get a last look at your isabella  no small share of vanity you will cry  i only relate facts my dear and as i am not overwhelmed with the variety of my amusements chose to make the most of this subject and so farewell  i am going to write to my beloved orlando and must now bid you adieu not however till i have told you i am ever most truly yours  isabella rochley  letter the fourteenth miss westbury to lady bell sidney london thank heaven my dear lady bell my brother is rather better the fever is abated but he is still in a miserable way the doctors however say he may possibly live i am willing to believe the best though alas i fear this is not their real sentiments  i must tell your ladyship an incident which happened a few days ago  it is ridiculous i grant but has nevertheless made such an impression on me that i am tempted to doubt my senses  lady beningfield called on me the other morning and insisted on my going with her to an embroiderers to see a trimming she has ordered for the birthday she is no favorite of mine you know however as i had been so long confined to a sick room i thought a drive for an hour might raise my spirits  lord templeton as usual was with her and is absolutely if possible more irresistible than ever  you see i can be just though i have given my heart to another perhaps had her ladyship not known of my attachment she might not have asked my company since she fears every woman who presumes to cast an eye upon him has a design upon his heart which she is determined to conquer or die in the attempt  enter nous i am fully convinced he does not care three straws sor her but let her ladyship make this flattering discovery it is no affair of mine   all this is nothing to my story however and my story is a very absurd one when you get at it  to the embroiderers we went my dear lady bell  and there had my rochleys name been beverly i should not hesitate to swear i saw his beautiful sister the resemblance struck me so forcibly i could not keep my eyes off the elegant creature in my life i never beheld two beings so strikingly alike  the same expressive dark eyes the same lovely mouth the very dimples that so enchantingly play about it the teeth  in short i am very ridiculous  her name as i said above i found on somebody speaking to her is beverly and so ends my story  not so hers or i am much deceived for be she who or what she will i will lay my life his lordship is fairly caught  it is no wonder that is certain  he had no sooner cast his eyes upon her than farewell common sense not a rational answer could either her ladyship or i get from him though many an inrational question did she torment him with  he looked and sighed and sighed and looked again  so did her ladyship i believe but with very different sensations  she smiled she ogled she chid but could make nothing of him he was indeed as she perpetually calls him a stupid wretch which being interpreted means neither more nor less in the mouth of a very fine lady than  you are a divine fellow  on this unfortunate occasion however i fear she meant it literally and to mend the matter we were no sooner seated in the carriage than he cried what a lovely creature was that we have just seen  where for heavens sake asked lady b affecting to look out of the window by way of making us believe she fancied he spoke of somebody in the street  where answered his lordship  how my dear lady beningfield can you ask that question surely you must have observed her at mrs bellmours  not i truly returned she i observed nothing lovely there i give you my word except my trimming that is a fib thought i and so thought somebody else i will be sworn did you too overlook the charming girl miss westbury said he turning to me surely you could not as you had no trimming to engage your attention indeed i did not my lord nor can i believe her ladyship could do it either replied i she is joking depend upon it not i truly cried she brideling i see no joke in it except that some people are very apt to discover beauties where others can find none  the truth is i suppose you are both joking for i can hardly imagine such a prodigy as you describe could be there and i not see her there was now i recollect it a tall starched looking thing stuck up there who gave herself all the airs of a beauty  aye and all the graces too lady beningfield cried his lordship  at this instant the wheel of the carriage by some unlucky  indeed i should rather say lucky means or other got entangled in that of a coach passing by us she took this favorable opportunity to be amazingly alarmed screamed flung herself into his lordships arms and there fainted as it were  he could do no less you know my dear lady bell than be alarmed also the matters were soon adjusted between the honest folks without but not so within in vain i held my eau de luce to her nose in vain my lord said and did all that lord could do  i cannot say i was under any violent apprehensions nor he neither i believe however as one must get the better of a fright sooner or later she at length thought proper to open her languid eyes faintly exclaiming where am i  i had very near replied as scrub does in the beaux stratagem to the same question on a similar occasion  here my lady since this was certainly the stratagem of a belle  my lord in pity to her weakness forbear to renew the subject we were on before conscious i believe that had more to answer for than the poor wheel  they soon after sat me down and what then passed between them i know not but i fear his lordships thoughts would be too much engrossed by the charming miss beverley to permit him to play the lover with a good grace  indeed i never believed he wished to be looked upon in that light by lady b yet the world says it is to be a match  that she wishes it is abundantly clear but i cannot bring myself to fancy he has any such intention the lady is handsome no doubt and rich too  so is he  fortune can be no object to him  but these widows my dear lady bell are a dangerous set of beings  there is nothing impossible she may draw him in perhaps  it is certain there has long been a violent flirtation between them she is artful and doats upon him to distraction  how it will end heaven knows if miss beverly has as i verily think she has made a serious impression on him he cannot do a wiser thing than to make the most of the fracas above mentioned it is a fine foundation for a quarrel he has only to persist in doing justice to that lovely girl and the business is done  i would give the world to know who she is and how she came there for she appeared to be at home yet it is utterly impossible she can belong to mrs bellmour  impossible  her air her manner in short her whole appearance forbids an idea of that nature  adieu it is ridiculous to think any more about it  yours ever c westbury  letter the fifteenth miss rochley to miss lenox london would you believe it harriot  yet after all why not did i not formerly tell you my days of conquest were yet to come  lord templeton has actually been to call upon mrs bellmour by way of ordering a waistcoat etc etc  but in fact as she tells the story to make a thousand enquiries about your friend isabella  and pray said i a good deal startled you may well believe fearing he had looked upon me in a light it hurts my pride  my delicacy to think of  what answer did you my dear mrs bellmour make to his impertinent questions  had his lordship replied she made any that merited that term be assured my dear miss rochley you should never have been shocked by the knowledge of them from me  i beg your pardon my good friend said i i ought indeed to have done you more justice than to believe you would have mentioned a subject you thought could give me offense but those sort of gay men are but too apt to take liberties with our sex especially if friendless and unprotected as i am it is too true replied she but his lordship i believe though young and a man of fashion as it is called has fewer of the fashionable vices than most of his sex  i know his character well it is a most amiable one i never indeed saw him till the morning he first came here with lady beningfield but much i have heard in his praise i do assure you  i own i was a good deal surprised at the manner in which he spoke of you as i have heard he is paying his addresses to lady b this circumstance made me more reserved in my answers than perhaps i should otherwise have been  ah you could not be too much so my dear madam cried i piqued at what she mentioned  for however polite however specious his behavior all the enquiries he could make that being the case must be looked upon as very impertinent  i am hurt  exceeedingly hurt by them i confess and must entreat you to answer no more of them  hear me patiently said my worthy friend pray do not condemn either his lordship or me till you have heard all that passed  again i begged her pardon and promised to be attentive  he spoke in raptures continued she yet with the highest respect begged i would tell him who you were of what family and a thousand things of that nature  to this i replied your name was beverly  that you was a young lady of fashion and family  particular business had brought you to town and as i had had the charge of your education you had done me the honor to prefer my house to any other being a stranger in london   and now my lord continued i permit me in my turn to ask your reasons for wishing to know those circumstances miss beverly is at present under my care she is extremely dear to me and i am of course deeply interested in all that concerns her  i honor you for it replied he you have certainly a right to question me in your turn  i can only say my motives are such as even the charming miss beverly could not justly condemn i was struck with the uncommon elegance of her person her graceful manner  i will be very candid my lord said i finding he now made a pause  in talking of my accomplished friend your lordship uses the language of a lover  pardon me if i take the liberty of observing this is a language i do not think you can use with propriety on this occasion  i am not to learn my lord that the world talks loudly that you are paying your addresses to  lady beningfield  no man so circumstanced should  i will be candid also cried he interrupting me  the world is very much deceived if that is its opinion be assured had that been the case i would have spared you the trouble i have now given you  of this i give you my honor  so saying my dear miss rochley he took his leave  and i hope you will now acquit me of having been guilty of any impropriety  indeed i do replied i i ought to have known you were incapable of it my dear mrs bellmour yet you cannot i think wonder that a circumstance of this kind should surprise me nor after all can i conceive what his lordship means i wish it may not be something relating to my dearest brother  but that is absurd  i forget he believes my name beverly  she smiled at my speech saying indeed miss rochley were you not more void of vanity than thousands are who have smaller pretensions to it you could not i think be at a loss to guess  he was as he says and i will take upon me to affirm he says truth struck with your beauty  nothing could be more natural  he has not the character of a libertine  he has a very large fortune  is his own master  the enquiries he has made are a convincing proof to me that the wound you have made in his heart is not a slight one  whether it will heal without his applying to you for a cure i cannot say though i rather doubt it  o no fear of its proving mortal replied i men are not so vulnerable in these days as they were formerly the arrow must be tipped with gold that now hopes to kill  could you my good friend have added with truth when kindly giving him the catalogue of my virtues that i was also possessed of considerable fortune i have the vanity to think he might have been seriously wounded but as it is be under no apprehensions depend upon it his lordship will recover  besides what is to be done with his present flame lady beningfield  nay cried she he gave me his honor the world was wholly mistaken in regard to that matter  that she is violently in love with him i know from pretty good authority indeed it is one of those secrets known by the whole town but i firmly believe he has no more thoughts of marrying her ladyship than he has of doing me that honor  well said i be that as it will i am no less certain he will not marry me and so let the matter rest  all i entreat is my dear mrs bellmour in case he should take it in his head to mention me again that you will be cautious you know i am particularly circumstanced at present i wish to avoid making any new acquaintance till my brothers return  and especially under a feigned name  thus harriot have i laid this important business fully before you  happy was it i gave you my opinion of him in my last letter  were it still to do you might fancy the picture a little flattered in return for the portion he has bestowed upon me  adieu my dear let me hear from you soon do not give me cause to think you more negligent than formerly  yours ever isabella rochley  letter the sixteenth miss lenox to miss rochley northampton would you believe it cries my dear isabella this lord has actually been making a thousand impertinent enquiries about me  no to be sure  who could be simple enough to credit so great an improbability  the story wont go down with me child  isabella i am more than half out of my wits with joy  my father knows your adorer well  i will not tell you what he says of him lest you should be out of your wits too in case he makes no more inquiries  why my dear creature he is of all men upon the face of the earth the very being formed to make a woman too happy in al conscience  i die to hear more of him from you i mean  i can neither eat drink nor sleep since i heard of his impertinence  mrs bellmour behaved like an angel in the affair  dont be silly isabella  dont play the fool  there is a medium in all things one may be over prudish  be assured his lordship is a man of real honor were i not certain of it i would blot out the last sentence  lady beningfield will poison you beyond a doubt but that is a trifle  she is the greatest flirt breathing  and has made herself tolerably ridiculous about him already but take my word for it he will never make himself so by marrying her  i could treat you with a bit of scandal my dear concerning her ladyship but it would be thrown away upon you as i know you have no taste for it  pray how is that miserable wretch sir john is he determined to make a die of it out of mere spite to your brother i believe in my conscience he will at least make the utmost of the disaster though he may perhaps hesitate a little about carrying the joke quite so far as death  do let me hear how things go on but above all tell me if my lord has had the temmerity to be again impertinent  adieu  i am going a journey of five miles for a dinner dont you think i shall have a good appetite that is one of the many delights of a country life  the carriage is at the door so fare ye well my isabella  yours harriot lenox  letter the seventeenth miss rochley to miss lenox london is it possible  and does your worthy father really know lord templeton and is he indeed such a prodigy  i will not be over prudish harriot and say  what is all that to me  no i will not for the truth is i am exceedingly glad to hear it in case of accidents  but before i bestow another line upon him let me tell you i have heard from my dear orlando twice since i wrote last to you  do not my dear harriot now look stately and say i might have heard ten times instead of twice  forgive my too long silence  i own my fault and promise amendment  he is thank heaven in perfect health and good spirits his friend the general has promised to represent the affair in its true colors and is of opinion he has nothing to apprehend should the worst happen yet advises him to stay abroad a while as the safest plan  i am sorry to tell you sir john has had a return of his fever and is again thought in danger  he was so well a few days ago that i hear they talked of getting him conveyed by easy journies to the country but all thoughts of that sort are over for the present  heaven forbid he should make a die of it as you call it  most unfeignedly would his death be lamented my dear harriot  not altogether on his own account indeed but the consequences would be fatal to my dear brothers hopes  however i would gladly flatter myself as he has lived so long after the unfortunate rencontre he may still get over it  and now for another line or two about this same lord my dear  what he means heaven only knows but certain it is he has repeatedly called on mrs bellmour imploring her to contrive some way or other for him to see me again  this she said was a favor she could on no account twas a liberty she had no right to take with miss beverley she was entitled to more respect  would she then indulge him so sar as acquaint him heartily with every particular of the charming girls situation  no certainly  was again her answer she had no authority to do it though of this be assured added the worthy woman the more your lordship knows of miss beverlys character the more reason you will have to esteem her since i can from a thorough knowledge of her with truth declare that beauty which seems to have made so deep an impression on your lordship is her least perfection i have known her from a child my lord  i had the charge of her education as i believe i had the honor of telling you before  she is descended from one of the most respectable families in the kingdom  at least few can boast of a better  but will you my dear mrs bellmour said he only inform me why the lovely creature lives thus retired i can meet with no mortal who is acquainted with her though i have made every possible enquiry for that purpose in hopes i might by that means procure the honor of being properly introduced to her but all in vain  this astonishes me  i will freely own to you mrs bellmour she has made a very serious impression on me my heart subscribes to all you have said in her praise i have not a doubt of her worth  are you not cruel then my dear madam thus to deny me an opportunity to be still farther convinced you do her no more than justice  indeed my lord could i gratify your wishes with propriety i would  i have too good an opinion of you to believe your intentions are dishonorable i will not shock my own feelings so much as to suppose you would take this liberty with me if they were  i can only add your lordship must have patience i trust the time is not far distant when miss beverly will have a lation with her to whom your lordship may without impropriety apply for an introduction  till then i am persuaded she will on no account see any stranger  a relation  yes my lord a near one  and one justly dear to her should he have no objections to your lordships being introduced to miss beverly i think i may venture to say  she will have none as he is well worthy that deference she ever pays to his judgment  you alarm me mrs bellmour  is this so highly favored relation a young man perhaps  she smiling replied he is a young man my lord but you need not be so much alarmed as your expressive perhaps implies you are  he now begged she would tell him his name where he was  why absent  when i expected his return  and in short a thousand silly questions of that nature but to no purpose  i had charged her to be cautious you know and she was most prudently so  provokingly so he seemed to think  and now my dear harriot let me know your thoughts on the matter also  as for mine i have not yet been able to bring them into any sort of order certain it is i find his lordship has some times a share in them but in so confused a manner that i can give no account of it  it is possible i may be able to arrange them more methodically by and by  one sight of him is not quite sufficient for that purpose  were it consistent with propriety i should have no violent objections to take a second view particularly after reading the character you give of him but it certainly is not so i must as mrs bellmour very wisely advised his lordship to do wait till my orlandos return they may then adjust all the necessary preleminaries in case the wonderful impression my charms have made upon him should not before that time be worn out to make room for some other  lady beningfield you say will undoubtedly treat me with a cup of poison should i rob her of his heart  i vow i never saw a woman who appears more capable of it but that is a trifle as you say  and so my dear harriot adieu  believe me ever yours isabella rochley  letter the eighteenth miss westbury to lady bell sydney i hoped to have left town before now my brother was so much better that the doctors thought he might be removed without danger and wished it as change of air would have been of service to him  but his fever is returned with violence  heaven knows what may be the consequence of this relapse  what a miserable time have i had of it my dear lady bell  and what but a continuation of misery have i to expect should he not recover  alas it is not the loss of him alone i shall have to deplore  my amiable rochley oo must be the object of my sorrow for in that wretched case he never can be mine  but let me drop the melancholy subject it sinks my spirits  why should i also sink yours  you may possibly recollect my telling you how violently lord templeton was struck with the charms of the elegant creature we saw some time ago at mrs bellmours  i was convinced her charms had made a very deep impression  i however thought no more of it till calling one day last week to enquire for my brother i saw him  and by way of a little chat asked if he had been so fortunate as to get another sight of the lovely miss beverley  i have not yet i confess to you miss westbury but i would give half my estate could i obtain that happiness  are you serious my lord cried i quite astonished to find him so very far gone  upon my honor i am replied he with fervor  i never beheld a creature so formed to captivate she has absolutely robbed me of my peace  of your heart that is to say i presume my lord  why in fact i believe the terms on this occasion are synonimous  yet it is not according to my ideas of love  i never till now could persuade myself that passion could be excited by beauty alone and except that she is beautiful as an angel i know little more of her  but how comes that my lord surely you might before now have contrived to learn whether her mind is as lovely as her person for my own part i confess i have not a doubt of it for never did i see a countenance so expressive of every thing that is amiable  you are mistaken my dear miss westbury  it has been my principal employment from that time to this but without success  the only intelligence i can gather concerning the charming girl is from the person of the house where she resides  she indeed talks of her in terms of the highest respect says she had the charge of her education has known her from a child that she is of a good family  but i am as great a stranger to her as to her lovely friend all this may be true  nay my heart assures me of it  yet still there is something misterious  why this retired life in so young a person it is wonderful and creates a doubt which i would give worlds to have explained and to be introduced to her  this mrs bellmour could certainly do my lord  oh no this i asked but was refused  twas a liberty she could not presume to take miss beverly made a point of seeing no strangers   it is very odd said i yet certainly all this my lord is greatly in the the charming girls favor  no doubt of it she has it seems a relation who is at present absent and till his return has reasons for this reserve  a relation my lord  is it a father uncle brother good heavens  yet it cannot be  her name is beverly  who is this relation where is he  none of these particulars could i learn answered his lordship except that he is a young man and this information i got by mere chance  but why my dear miss westbury that exclamation what if her name was not beverly  o my lord were it not i could lay my life she is sister to my friend colonel rochley  never did i in any two creatures behold so striking a resemblance  i could not refrain from scrutinizing her any more than your lordship added i smiling though not merely on account of her uncommon beauty but the astonishing likeness i found between them  ah would to heaven replied he your conjecture was true all my anxiety about what now appears so perplexing would instantly vanish my only business then would be to endeavor to gain her affections could i but do that i should think myself the happiest of men  fortune is no object to me to raise an amiable a deserving woman to that rank she is so formed by nature to adorn would be the sublimest of all gratifications  but it cannot be  my cruel my lovely enslavers name is beverly  and i am really my dear miss westbury at this moment in a most painful suspense  but pray my lord said i give me leave to ask what lady beningfield says to this new passion  she at least would persuade the world she is sole mistress of your heart  upon my honor replied he if she is it is more than i know for i can with strict truth declare i never had an idea of putting it into her ladyships possession nay i am no less certain it was in my own till i beheld the lovely miss beverly from that hour i confess it is rather a doubt with me whether it is still in mine or not  if your lordship was to ask my opinion of the matter i should pronounce all doubt out of the question  i believe you are right madam yet i own i am unwilling to believe my case quite so desperate till better acquainted with the object of its attachment and how to manage that i cannot for my soul contrive  i am sorry for it i do assure you my lord for both your sakes as i own myself so exceedingly prejudiced in her favor that i think she must be worthy even of your lordships esteem and that is saying a great deal  he gracefully bowed in return for my compliment and bid me good morning  and now my dear lady bell i must wish you good night i have sat scribbling here till my fingers are cramped  adieu yours caroline westbury  letter the nineteenth miss rochley to miss lenox london mrs bellmour came up to me this morning my dear harriot to ask me a question which she was polite enough to say i should absolutely decide as i thought proper  it seems a person to whom she is under some obligations had just sent to her knowing her house was spacious and genteel to ask whether she could conveniently accommodate a gentleman with an apartment in it for a month or six weeks perhaps it might not be lo long as he was only come to town on business which might possibly be settled in a shorter time he wished to be near this family who live it seems in the next street is a man of fortune and not young  how could i you know my dear harriot make any objections supposing it had really been disagreeable to me particularly as she was so good as to put it upon that footing  none in the world said i my dear mrs bellmour i can have none had it been a gay young man indeed  but in that case i well know that you yourself would have been the first to object  most certainly replied she independently my dear madam of your being in my house  and pray when is he to come  this very evening he only waits for my answer which i could not think of sending till i had mentioned it first to you  be assured replied i i am exceedingly sensible of your very polite attention to me on this as well as every other occasion  on this she left me in order to send an immediate affirmative to her friend so much for that business  now harriot you must know as lord templeton and i are not likely to be farther acquainted though to say truth he has done his utmost endeavors toward it i have some thoughts of setting my cap at this old neighbor of mine that is to be he is it seems a man of fortune and should i find it equal to my ambition i will give him credit for all other perfections are you not surprised my dear to find me in so flippant a humor i have good reason  the vile sir john is once more pronounced out of danger  i may now you know venture to abuse him a little though while i believed the wretch dying i hope you observed i spared those flattering epithets he is going to bristol by the advice of his physicians  most heartily do i wish him a speedy recovery but speedy or not my beloved orlando may now return when he chooses  i have just dispatched this important intelligence to the dear creature and trust it will not now be long ever i shall have the supreme happiness to tell you that he is safely landed in england  you no longer wonder at my spirits i presume  i am half nay more than half out of my wits with joy and am determined he shall find me married to this rich old soul on his arrival it will be such an agreeable surprise you know harriot  to be sure we shall rather be hurried in the article of courtship but as my consent is ready it is the less matter we may make love after we are fettered since we have not time for it before that will be something new quite out of the common style  poor lord templeton it is really a pity but there is no help for it by the by he does not seem to have given up all hopes  perhaps indeed he has contracted a habit of calling here in his round of visits for scarce a day passes without his asking mrs bellmour how she does and she says how i do also  the truth is he made her very considerable offers on condition she would contrive to let him meet me in her company  bnt she is not the kind of woman for that purpose unless convinced beyond a doubt his designs were honorable  she has no idea of my submitting to be looked at with a view to see whether he may happen to approve of me  this however was my way of expressing the matter  marriage and another pleasant circumstance they say harriot goes by destiny  so if it is to be decreed we are to be united in the holy band of matrimony the thing will of course come to pass without our troubling our heads about it would his lordship but adopt this doctrine it would save his horses a considerable deal of labor lady beningfield also calls here frequently though her divine trimming has been finished some time but she is an excellent customer to mrs bellmour yet the latter suspects jealousy brings her ladyship as often as business for she perpetually asks a thousand ridicuculous questions about me evidently wishing to find out whether his lordship has ever seen me again to this you know mrs b has it in her power to give a satisfactory answer in the negative which of course she does  happily she does not enquire whether he has made any attempts of that nature taking it for granted i suppose if he had i should have been too much flattered by so great a distinction to have let him sigh in vain for an interview  silly creature she knows but little of your friend if this is her opinion  adieu my dear harriot let me have your congratulations on the good news i send you and believe me as usual most affectionately  yours isabella rochley  end of the first volume
