practical hints on opium considered as a poison  by r hamilton m d  of the royal college of physicians london member of the royal medical and physical societies of edinburgh and of the medical society london  ipswich printed and sold by g jermyn in the buttermarket  mdccxc  practical hints etc a melancholy accident having within these few days taken place in this neighborhood from a quantity of opium given to a young boy by mistake for a different medicine which soon proved fatal gave rise to the following remarks the author hopes the public will receive them with candor since they are laid before them to guard them in future and prevent them from keeping in their houses as family medicines drugs of violent operation undistinguished by proper labels from more innocent substances of the materia medica or should the like again take place that they may from these hints be the better prepared to put in force the means of cure he submits to their consideration which on many such occasions for too many such are on record have been found effectual when they were had early recourse to and strenuously applied  this drug of high use and deserved estimation in medicine like many others of the virulent vegetable poisons becomes when incautiously exhibited by those less acquainted with its powers and when given through mistake speedily destructive changing the regular motions of the living body into irregular and violent inducing stupefaction convulsions appoplexy etc soon to be followed by a total deprivation of life eos qui opium copiosius acceperunt sequitur in somnum gravem collapsio mentis sopor et sensus ablienatio cum frigiditate et pruritu vehementi ita ut hominem exitet odor opii per totum corpus effertur et exhalat maxilla laxatur tumescunt labra irruit singultus distorquetur nasus adest pallor livor unguium praecordiorum divulsio respiratio parva et frigida et ad finem etiam convulsio auctore aetio   without entering into a dissertation on the subject at large or a detail of the various opinions and hypotheses that have lately as well as heretofore been advanced relative to its mode of operation as a medicine this being foreign to my present purpose let me at once suppose such a quantity received into the stomach as must in a short time induce death should attempts and these almost instantaneously not be made to prevent its baneful effects and indeed admitting them made it must be confessed so great may the force of the poison be that its effects may be exerted even in a very short time altogether beyond the possibility of obviating notwithstanding the most diligent application of the most rational means  this reflection however should not slacken our endeavors or damp our ardour but ought rather to stimulate us to a trial of all the methods that have been known to succeed  the first thing then to which we are to turn our attention is the use of emetics and let one be thrown down the most speedy in its operation  powders of ipecacuanha tartarised antimony vinegar of squills or perhaps what may still be more quick in exciting the action of the stomach white vitriol  the contents of the stomach suppose the operation succeeds should be examined to find whether any of the opium has been evacuated this will be easily discovered by its smell and will afford encouragement to pursue our first advantage by continuing the vomiting till this organ be completely evacuated  the doses used must be in proportion to the exigencies of the case to the diminished energy and sensibility of the nervous system in general and the stomach in particular if the opium has begun to exert its effects the more will be necessary and as there is no time to loose and inevitable danger perhaps death awaiting we must hazard the larger quantities in proportion to the accustomed doses and persist in their use  to prevent stupefaction as far as in our power and the consequent train of bad symptoms strong agitation may be used such as walking running shaking etc this has been strenuously recommended by several authors in one case as i am lately informed by a medical gentleman in this county whose sister was the subject of the trial it appears to have had no small share in the cure the gentleman when a child about six years of age having observed his mother take something from a bottle in her closet went afterward and brought it to his sister a child about a year younger than himself persuading her to take of it which he intended to do also but his sister after taking some complained it was bad tasted on which he took none she soon became affected the family were alarmed and their apothecary was sent for among other things he ordered the child to be walked about though in a state of stupefaction being held up between two servants and kept in constant motion for several hours she recovered with difficulty   to these should be added stimulants of all kinds as volatile salts to the nose blisters to the skin etc if epispastics are applied they should be placed on the most sensible parts or joints as the ancles arms inside of the legs and soles of the feet and wherever the body is thinnest of flesh and the nervous fibrillae most numerous  it may be objected to the use of blisters that they will act too slowly in a case of this nature where expedition is so requisite but without attempting formally to remove this objection which we think might be easily done as it is not their evacuant but their stimulant effects for which we consider them expedient we shall only say that their application even in that case can do no harm by interrupting other means and on this ground alone i would not have them omitted  if we can rouse the mind so far that it will feel pain so far one point is thereby gained which adds somewhat to our hopes of success and should quicken our exertions  i know not how far electricity might in this sense be advantageous as it is acknowledged however one of the most powerful though transient stimulants and as it may be applied to the human body even for a length of time and frequency with the utmost safety we can run no great hazard in giving it a trial especially as machines for its commodious application are now in almost every bodys possession the poison being of the highest sedative nature the strongest stimulants would seem obviously indicated as its antidote  in the cases of drowned persons and those suffocated by the fumes of charcoal etc the analogy thus far holds good that in this as in those there is a suspension of the functions from a deprivation of sensibility in the system in those electricity is strongly recommended  the writer of these hints will not enter here into that part of the pathology which supposes the operation of the opium to be by augmenting or rarefying the volume of the blood in the sanguiferous system in general and the head in particular whereby a turgescence and overdistention of the vessels of this organ are said to be particuarly present and from which the symptoms of apoplexy are argued to arise of this opinion among others was the celebrated mead he affirms that it enflames the stomach and rarefies the blood to such a degree that the vessels cannot again recover their tone whereupon apoplectic symptoms etc will ensue to prove which he relates an experiment which he made with it on a dog  perhaps all stimulants and it appears to me by the bye that all substances taken into the stomach exert first a stimulant power whatever their after action may be have the effect less or more of sending a greater quantity of blood to the head at least quickening the circulation by which the face becomes flushed but surely stimulants for this reason alone are not here to be omitted the stimulant power of the opium seems transitory the sedative soon follows and now if we can rouse the powers of the heart to exert their wonted action and renew the motion of the blood flowing at present languidly we need the less dread this supposed plethora as the consequence must be a more equitable circulation and distribution of the blood i know no proof however that this fluid is augmenting in its volume but that it is in a state almost of stagnation is evident  dr alston in the presence and with the assistance of mr fullarton a gentleman skilled in microscopical observations in august      conveyed into the stomach of a frog some opium dissolved in water and after putting it into a glass cylinder they adapted the microscope to the membrane between the toes in such a manner that they had a distinct view of the circulation of the blood in this part the dr had found before that opium killed these animals and his design now was to observe its effects on the circulation no change however took place either in the color or consistence of the blood but the diminution of its velocity was extremely evident for it did not move half so swiftly as it used to do in these creatures this observation was repeatedly made and as the effects of the opium went off the blood became gradually quicker in its motion when the frog had entirely recovered its vigor they forced more opium into its stomach and observing again saw again the same diminution of the bloods velocity  from mr ramsays experiment made in april      on a dog we have a further proof of the pulse becoming slower the heart of this animal in its natural state beat vid med ess   0 times in a minute four minutes after the injection of the opium into the cavity of the abdomen he fell down senseless mr r opened the thorax which seemed to give the dog no pain and he felt plainly the motion of the heart through the pleura it beat now only    times in a minute and became slower immediately after counting the pulse he cut the ribs on each side of the sternum in the common way and laid them back by which the heart was brought into view it appeared quite turgid  from dr whytts experiments we have likewise ample proof of the lessened motion of the blood after the application of opium the veins he says after a large dose of opium especially those of the brain become much swelled whence it has been thought that opium produces its effects in the bodies of animals partly at least by rarefying the blood and compressing the brain but this distention of the veins seems to be no more than a consequence of a very slow motion of the blood through the heart on account of the insensibility with which this organ is affected the author tells us that in frogs into whose stomach and intestines he had injected opium he not only found the hearts auricle but the great viens leading to it much distended with blood from all this it must follow that the heart and arterial system being so reduced in their irritability cannot propel the blood with sufficient force through the larger vessels near much less through the extreme ones and less still through the veins  dr leigh gave two grs of the resin of opium to a healthy man of  0 years of age his pulse was then at  0 strokes in a minute half an hour after it rose to    this proves what we have already hinted that the first operation of this as well as other drugs is that of a stimulus but behold in a short time it fell down to    was full and strong and now headache vertigo and drowsiness succeeded  the same gentleman gave three grs of the gummy part of opium to a young woman in ten minutes her pulse fell    strokes became also full and strong  to a third person also he gave opium pulse rose six strokes in a minute but in a quarter of an hour it fell    and became extremely full  on the supposition however of rarefaction of this fluid as well as inflammation which has been contended was produced geoffroy and others of the ancient dr tissot is among the number who advise bleeding from the use of opium in a quantity too great for health in my opinion without a just foundation he says the patient is to be treated as if he had a sanguine apoplexy physicians recommended and practiced v s without duly considering we apprehend that it is a most powerfully debilitating means lessening the vigor of those functions which are already become too debile and without reflecting that as the stomach is the place of action the part first affected relief can only be rationally sought for by applications chiefly to this organ should evacuations however by blood letting be at all practiced scarifications on the head or opening the jugular veins or temporal artery would appear preferable to general v section  from an experiment of the celebrated dr mead on a dog which he killed by opium this practice would seem to receive some countenance for on dissection he found the blood vessels of the brain very full and took a large grume of concreted blood from the upper part of it as he cut into the sinus longitudinalis  no extravasated serum was found either in the ventricles or any of the membranes the stomach was wonderfully distended though empty of every thing but some water and opium parcels of frothy mucus swam in it and its inside was as clean as if scraped and washed from all the slime of the glands some redness was discovered here and there as if in the beginning of an inflammation the pylorus was found contracted  but even under these circumstances i should be inclined to defer opening these vessels till symptoms of apoplexy had commenced and other means better adapted to the cure had been pursued ineffectually  dr alston the doctor denies the rarefaction of the fluids in these cases makes a curious observation which may be mentioned here while he viewed the slow motion in the foot of the frog as above related he took notice that the frequency of the pulse was as usual but the heart was weak and had not power to propel the fluid with its wonted force to the extremities one thing says he was observable all along that notwithstanding the diminished velocity of the blood there was no sensible dimunition in the frequency of the pulse yet when there was no circulation or progressive motion of the blood in this part the foot the pulse was visible by an undulatory motion that is the blood returned as far back at every diastole of the heart as it was protruded by the preceding systole this continued till the frog was quite dead  he opened it and found nothing in its stomach but a clear mucus like a jelly a little colored with the opium every thing else seemed perfectly natural this experiment we often repeated he adds and it had always the same appearance and event  after the use of the emetics the next practice that i would recommend is that of cathartics they seem to hold the second place nay both emetics and cathartics may be conveniently exhibited at the same time these for the same reasons we gave in the use of emetics should be powerful and of a sufficiently stimulating nature aloetics with others from the tribe of resinous purges have been recommended the powder of jalap scammony and calomel are all active yet vinegar of squills may be perhaps conveniently added to the number and in some respects at least it may be found preferable as it both vomits and purges if administered to any extent  neutral salts and especially glaubers have been likewise recommended  while we use these we are not to omit glisters and these may be made of salt and water or strong brine to which may be added purgative ingredients as may best suit the prescribers intention they should be thrown up as warm as convenient  mr ramsay injected into the intestinum rectum of a small dog a solution of two scruples of opium in an ounce of water blood warm to which he added a dram of t opii in about a minute his hind legs became convulsed and in a few mimutes more their sensibility was so destroyed that when pinced they seemed insensible to pain in ten minutes more he became quite stupid fell into a profound sleep and was convulsed on observing this a strong solution of sea salt in water was injected into his guts this purged him severely and occasioned a prolopsus any soon after he awoke from his sleep and gradually recovered the use of his hind legs in a few hours he seemed well in every respect but could take no food for some time  before the enema be injected i would recommend the use of a suppository this may be prepared in an instant with some paper twisted up of a proper thickness well covered with oil or hogs lard and introduced per anum it will at once bring away the faeces that are hardened and filling up that part and thus give room for the enema to penetrate farther into the intestine  dr dobsons patient at liverpool was cured by the use of glaubers salts and emetics he had swallowed in the space of    hours    grains of solid opium in the shop composition called pil saponac by mistake for pil aloetic an ounce the doctor justly concluded that in all probability this would have proved fatal but for the following favorable circumstances first that the opium was in a solid form secondly that a strong emetic was ordered and repeated till it produced the desired effects and thirdly that a free discharge by stool was obtained by persisting in the use of glaubers salts he observes what is worthy of remark that the neutral salts gave relief even before they had occasioned any evacuation the salts were continued at proper intervals for three days after  having strengthened our hopes by evacuations per os and anum the next to be thought of is that by the perspirable pores to assist our endeavors here the patient should be immersed in warm water and i should prefer that of a stimulant to that of a relaxing heat or the water should be somewhat above the tepid temperature most commonly used when the warm bath is applied  irecommend this though at the same time i am well aware that too great a degree of heat is unfavourable to perspiration but we are to keep in view the want of due sensibility and that since for this reason we were obliged to augment the doses of emetics and purgatives so must we now make use of a higher degree of heat to produce the same effect those who contend for a rarefaction of the blood and the presence of sanguinous apoplexy will no doubt think this part of our practice unfavourable to the end we have in view the recovery of the patient as it will have a tendency to increase the rarefaction of the sanguiferous system and the fluids in general but they will remember that we thought it more than probable such a state of the fluids did not exist  to assist us in opening the perspirable pores diluents and diaphoretics must be conjoined for without a due proportion of diluents we cannot so easily force a sweat the principle on which i go by advising sweating is from a supposition that the lymphatic system has absorbed part of the opium and that it is by this means mixed with the fluids in the general habit and as our chief view is to evacuate it as completely as possible that part of it which has been absorbed and which creates a great share of the symptoms cannot be evacuated by means more effectual than by sudorifics  i need not quote the experiments of professor monro on this part of my subject he is clear that it is taken up by this system of vessels because among other proofs both urine and sweat smell of it the heart is a muscle very irritable when the opium is absorbed the nerves of its inner surface must be affected because it is then applied immediately to them as well as to the nerves of the inside of the arteries and through this medium as well as through the nerves of the stomach it must induce its peculiar symptoms the diaphoretics that have been generally used were of the warm kind such as confect aromatic mistur campherat etc   a man who swallowed an ounce of l laud within the space of an hour in small punch recovered by vomits purging blisters and sweating and a lady eighteen years of age who took the same quantity was cured by much the same means  a child of eighteen months old laboring under the hooping cough had a dose of elix paregor given with the intention of moderating the cough the quantity uncertain it was administered at night and the symptoms were not noticed till next morning when deep sleep and convulsions were observed recovery was here brought about by strong cordials the quantity of the elix appears not to have been so large as to induce those symptoms that end in speedy death  dr clarks patient who in july      swallowed a dram of solid opium was also cured by vomits purges glisters and sweating the patient was an adult he took half a dram and repeated the dose at a short interval in the space of  0 minutes it began to operate  there is reason i presume to suppose that sudorifics some sudorifics at least blunt the action of opium it is well known that when emetics neutral salts and opium are united a much larger dose of the opium may be administered with safety and success as a medicine than when given alone its action by this addition being modified  a proof of this we have in the composition commonly known by the name of dovers sweating powder this is an union of opium ipecac and vitriolated tartar to assist then both in modifying the action of the opium and procuring sweat either ipecac in powder or an antimonial may be employed in warm water to which a small quantitiy of a neutral salt may be added the opium being as we presume already in the stomach will form a strong sudorific and thus part at least of the offending matter be converted into an antidote to destroy its own noxious quality by hurrying it through the circulating fluids and expelling it by the pores of the skin  should the patient have lost the power of deglution for this has sometimes happened these and the other medicines we have recommended must be forced into the stomach by a small tube a woman was killed as dr alston relates by taking a quantity of liniment for the haemorrhoides composed of opium and myrrh by mistake for a purge when the mistake was discovered a vomit was given but though this was not above three quarters of an hour after the bolus had been taken she was so convulsed as to have lost the power of deglution she died in some hours after pulse large full and not very frequent when her physician first saw her there appeared a pale livor on her cheek and in other respects she was like a person drunk  there are few surgeons without hollow bougees provided nothing more convenient be at hand one of these may be employed to convey the medicines down especially for children where the aesophagus is shorter than in the adult  if the tube be long enough to pass beyond the epgilottis or the passage into the lungs it is all that is requisite the liquid of course must drop into the stomach and this is no great length as is well known to those who have used the probang in pushing down etc substances accidently sticking in the throat or who will take the trouble to examine the distance between the lower jaw and the top of the sternum where the trachaea and aesophagus dip under it  several authors have spoken highly in favor of acids both among the ancients and moderns for their power of modifying the noxious effects of opium among these also have been men of much celebrity wedelius amongst others strenously asserts the use of acids   to acids dr mead advises alkaline salts to be added dr cullen embraces the opinion that acids possess this power and he speaks of his having found them so from his own experience another means of weakening the powers of opium is the application of acids and we have found this very effectual cullens mat med  we wish the doctor had mentioned the instances to which he alludes and the other means which he pursued at the same time as we would then have been more able to determine what share they exerted and what might be at the same time attributed to the other methods he pursued he does not however pretend that it changes the nature of this drug for when it is given thus in union with opium in a large enough quantity he allows it to have all the same effects as opium alone  doctor webster an eminent medical teacher at edinburgh and whom i have the honor to rank as one of my preceptors in this science has the following observation which may be found in his syllabus acids render the stomach less capable of being acted on by other matters as spirits ale etc in the course of his lectures the doctor enlarges on the observation by saying that the action of hemlock opium and ipecacuanha are moderated much by the addition of an acid  an ingenious physician who has not long since made many experiments on this article of the mat med denies that any such effects follow he affirms that acids render the stomach less sensible of the operation of opium if given previous to it but should the opium be first administered and its effects have began in any degree to appear the acid then cannot lessen them  he gave to a boy of twelve years of age an ounce of common vinegar a quarter of an hour after  0 gutts of l laud in half an hour it produced a severe sickness at his stomach but no vomiting his head now began to be a little affected but this did not continue long the pulse remained steady except when the nausea appeared these symptoms soon went off and the boy was restored to his usual situation  to a healthy young man he gave two ounces of the common vegetable acid and in a quarter of an hour after  0 gutts of t opii two hours after taking it he complained of a little nausea and headache these symptoms continued only a short time when he felt himself as usual except a little sickness about the stomach the doctor could discover no change in the pulse whatsover he made similar experiments both on dogs and rabbits and concludes by saying that the opium seldom had much effect if an acid was previously given  he instituted other experiments both on frogs and dogs to satisfy himself farther how far the acid would act if the opium was given and had begun to exert its effects before the other was exhibited his conclusion is this  that the acid if given after the opium began to operate had not the smallest power of correcting its dangerous tendency hence it it is plain if we put any credit in the experiments of this ingenious gentleman that the supposition of acids correcting the deleterious effects of opium like many other of the ancient theories has no existence in reality and that we must not therefore place our dependence in their use when the patient is in danger from the noxious powers of opium though a different doctrine be supported by great names both among the ancient and modern physicians  how far diuretics may conduce to the cure i dare not determine as our great and chief business is to evacuate the opium from the habit and as the urine is found to contain it which is indicated by its smell i am inclined to think they may in their turn be advantageously had recourse to the discharges by the skin are generally observed to lessen that by the kidneys but both i am persuaded may be forwarded to a certain degree at the same time diluents was recommended to keep up a sweat diluents in plenty will excite the urinary discharges to these may be added medicines more directly stimulating the urinary organs parsley tea may be drank sp ether nitros has been generally considered as having specific effects on the kidneys  other methods more effectually for eliminating this poison from the human body i know of none and i fully believe where the circumstances are such that hopes can be entertained none other are necessary let me again recommend however expedition and diligence in their application dr willis informs us of a robust man who after taking a large dose of laudanum was dead in so short a time as four hours others have died in ten twelve and sixteen  dr leigh gave only five grains to a woman and it threw her into violent convulsions he gave her a few grains of ipecucuanha to remove it and afterward  0 gutts of ether she was not well however for two days after the same gentleman gave to a dog for an experiment an ounce dissolved in water in a very short time it threw him into convulsions and killed him we may remark by the bye that his stomach was immediately laid open and the coats attentively examined but not the smallest marks of inflammation were perceivable a much less quantity would most undoubtedly have killed him dr mead gave a quarter of an ounce to a dog and in so short a time as a quarter of an hour he began to sleep then was convulsed fell into universal tremblings breathed short and laborious lost the use of both his fore and hind legs and then as the doctor expresses it his limbs on a sudden grew limber and he instantly expired  when unhappily this drug has been swallowed to this quantity our first enquiry should be how long it has been in the stomach and in what form it was administered whether in a liquid or solid form whether united with other substances and what these substances were in a liquid form it is found to exert its effects much sooner than when taken in a solid and according to the experiments of the abbe fontana in conjunction with spirits it is the more powerfully deleterious  mr henderson the comedian it has been said died in a short time by some mistake in taking opium and the same has been asserted of the late dr brown who in a state it seems of intoxication took upwards of  00 gutts of laudanum and was found dead next morning if this be true it was a new way of taking off the effects of intoxication if he took it with this intention it was like adding oil to extinguish flame for opium and spirituous liquors in their effects are very analogous to each other and the means in general that cures the one will cure the other with this consideration that dilution is even more necessary where spirits have been drank to a dangerous excess than when opium has been taken to the same extent  to sum up the whole if we do not speedily have recourse to emetics and the other means already mentioned all other efforts when strong convulsions and apoplectic symptoms have taken place afford but little hopes that life can be saved if the dose be swallowed from even    minutes to  0 minutes to an hour according to the strength and age of the person and the quantity taken its operation may have already gone such lengths and exerted its baneful powers so far on the general system as to render every succeeding attempt to save life altogether abortive even under the management of the most active physicians of steady perseverance and ready thought  ipswich july      0 besides the case that gave rise to the foregoing reflections the following instance of the death of a young woman occasioned by opium about three years ago lately came to my knowledge on its being intimated to me i wrote to the gentleman under whose care she was during a few of her last hours when he obligingly sent me the subjoined particulars to dr hamilton physician ipswich dear sir i am sorry i cannot send you a more perfect account of the case you require than that which you will now receive the girls name who was the subject of it i forget her name as i am told was lydia spratt   june the  d      i was sent for between six and seven in the morning to a servant girl of a farmer who lives about four miles from hence the only information which i received was that they could not awake her accordingly on my going to her masters i found her in a deep sleep attended with laborious breathing and great sweating knowing that the mistress of the house frequently took laudanum for a complaint in the stomach i enquired whether the girl might not have taken some the phial was accordingly sought for and missing it upon farther search we found it under her pillow and empty the phial had been filled the day before and contained two ounces therefore from these circumstances we made no doubt but she had taken the whole about eleven oclock the preceding night i immediately gave her two scruples of ipecacuanha without the least effect she did not seem to have the power of deglution at any one time during my attendance which was four hours but the fluids which i gave seemed to go down her throat without any effort on her part she had a florid look but a languid pulse however i bled her about four ounces i made a large orifice but the blood came away very slowly and was very black i gave her vinegar and brandy mixed with some of the spirit ammon comp i likewise had her well rubbed in different parts of the body with the same mixture after we had continued this method about two hours i had her carried into the air and laid upon a cask which we kept moving about when after all i found she remained in a total insensible state i had her set in a chair where she remained till she died which was about another hour her breathing became more and more laborious at the end of every expiration there seemed to be a total inactivity of the lungs for some moments and the succeeding inspiration was long i should call her death a forgetting to breathe her eyelids were closed all the time and when lifted up the pupils appeared very much dilated and not to have the power of contraction  i remain dear sir your very humble servant etc r priest harleston july      0
