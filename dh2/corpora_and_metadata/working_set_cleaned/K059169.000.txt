a curious little oration delivered by father andrew concerning the present great quarrels that divide the clergy of france  the second edition translated from the fourth edition of the french by dan de fe  london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane and a dodd at the peacock without temple bar and m baldwin in storiespassage st jamess park mdccxvii price three pence  the translator to the reader it is not so much the itch of being thought an author nor of following the method of those writers whether originals or translators especially the last who think prefacing so necessary that rather than forego their opinion they will spoil a good work for the sake of a halfsheet of their own scribbling that induces me to attempt one in this place if i had had no particular advantage in so doing i must without flattery inform you that i had waved the trouble but since twas necessary pray take it and make the best on it and now all i have to say is to make these pages have a good run which i cannot pretend to do by any elogy on em but refer you to the perusal it has indeed two of the best recommendations book can have at this time it is like our fashions french and as the gallican mode though never so ridiculously adjusted upon an english person meets not only with reception but encouragement i am in great hopes the very place of this pamphlets birth will hide the blunders of the version and then it is against the jesuits if with these two qualities it should not meet acceptance i shall be apt to think diogenes who would be buried with his face downwards that when the world turned upsidedown which in his days he expected he might lie right in his grave has now got his wish and by the illvent of this commodity judge that all the beaux good protestants and wellmeaning papists if any such there be are lost in the hurricane  a curious little oration delivered by little father andrew etc it was one lent and about the time that monsieur arnaud had his famous disputes with the jesuits i mean when jansenism was at the greatest height a fantome which the jealous cunning of those good fathers knew how to improve to the detriment and prosecution of many better christians that little father andrew so famous for his witty jokes preached at alby  according to the custom this little good man on the samaritans day did not fail to make a discourse on grace and what was more upon efficacious grace by it self and solidly proved from st augustins principles that no one ever resisted that grace not but that men can but will not for its attribute is just to inspire what we will not oppugn he added that sufficient grace was a new system broached by the jesuit molina to reconcile the pretended contradictions of its omnipotent power with freewill in short he asserted jansenism to the last degree  those of the society who were present at this sermon being nettled to hear molinas reverend school used at this rate took it as you may well suppose in great dudgeon and resolved to load the poor preacher with the heavy weight of their holy and implacable fury they extracted several tenets which in their opinion contained the most poisonous venom of heresy packed away to the archbishop of alby and giving the contents into his hand is it not an errant shame say they with a zeal animated not for the glory of god but of the society is it not a shame my lord that this little whisk of a monk shall come hither to preach jansenism tooth and nail whilst the pope bishops kings magistrates and indeed all powers as well ecclesiastic as secular are endeavoring to root this cockle out of the field of the church  the archbishop who knew by experience how necessary their good will was at that time to the making of a mans fortune and on the contrary the danger as well as inconveniency of being hated by them the archbishop i say came into their resentments and promised them condign and speedy satisfaction he cited little father andrew and sharply rebuked him for having preached up heresy not without terrible threats of inflicting on him the punishments ordained in such cases by the canons of the church  the little priest who was too well acquainted with the jesuits not to know that they were not to be offended with impunity and that whoever offered to contradict their notions was at least a heretic gave a shrewd guess at what was coming and therefore was not mightily dismayed at the bishops thundering reprimand but with a becoming presence of mind made this answer god preserve me my lord from preaching heresy i can assure you i never had the least intention to deviate from the sentiments of the catholic church some unguarded expressions may perhaps in the heat of discourse have fallenn from me which having met with an evil construction have given room for the accusation now intended against me therefore be pleased my lord to let me know what heretical propositions i am charged with advancing that i may confront them with my sermon which contains no such matters and if i have said any thing that is not orthodox i will retract it next sunday and by my recantation undeceive those whom i have scandalized by my imprudence  the archbishop satisfied with this submission of the little father delivered to him the paper which contained such of his propositions as were condemned by the jesuits and gave those cunninghams as a french burlesque author guy patin calls them an account of what had passed who for once were out in their politics and sung io paean before the victory loudly publishing through the town the intended recantation of little father andrew they cloyed themselves beforehand with the mighty pleasure they were to receive from the great shame which they pretended he would be obliged at that time to undergo  heaven knows there was no want of them at sundays sermon and they had taken special care to invite all their partisans and to place themselves over against the preacher that they might more fully rejoice at his confusion they that knew the little father better did not doubt of finding this sermon curiously intermixed with scenes of mirth so that with those who were of the jesuitical faction and those who came to the unravelling of the little gentlemans late discourse there was a very numerous audience  father andrew got into the pulpit and after having crossed himself said sirs before i take my text give me leave to recount to you a vision i had the other night you may now perhaps think me a superstitiou coxcomb for coming hither to tell you my dreams yet when i let you know that i hope i am in the number of those servants to whom our lord is pleased to manifest his will in a misteriou manner as i think my vision instructive and besides that it will not be tiresome to you i can boldly beg your attention to what follows  this exordium attracted anew the ears of all sirs continues this little father the  night i dreamt that i was carried before the tribunal of jesus christ to be judged tink with your selves what a terror invaded me an unpenitent and unprepared sinner i was horribly frightened and my fears increased when the son of god thus accosted me come near  andrew that i may judge you seized at once with fear and respect i threw my  at his feet harkye says our lord to me with an irritated aspect was it not to lead my flock of alby into saving pastures that i gave you to that fold and yet instead of nourishing them with sound doctrines you are accused of preaching heresy my god says i i preach heresy you who search the reins and heart know perfectly i had no such intention and if by ignorance or weakness i have had the misfortune to advance any doctrines that are inconsistent with thy holy verities i am here ready to suffer whatever punishment your divine majesty shall please to inflict on me have not you returned our savior preached up such and such tenets and then father andrew cited the very passages condemned by the jesuits my dear redeemer continued i i confess i have but hitherto i thought they were not in the least heretical for i took them from a very great master what mighty master is this says our savior it is st thomas of aquin that angel of the school which you of late ages have raised to be the pillar of truth and scourge of heresy and it is so evident that this great doctor has taught what they condemn as hetorodox in me that my quotationis word for word his sentiments  and then the little priest made a repetition of what st thomas had written on that subject man is converted by his free will but his free will can never effect his conversion if god himself works it not in him according to the words of the prophet jeremy convert me o lord and i shall be converted because thou art my god s th     q    0  art   ad    although man has grace he cannot of himself do good and avoid evil without a new aid and incitement from god which must lead him to and rengthen him in the performance of good deeds id art     which passages were exactly consonant to those the jesuits had declared damnable  ho ho says our lord let him come before me appear thomas is it possible that you who have been so highly honored by me that you of whom i have rendered so glorious a testimony as that you have well written of me is it possible that you could notwithstanding all these favors pretend to teach that my will must infallibly and necessarily be accomplished when i am pleased that man shall consent to my grace not from an absolute necessity but from an infallible necessity which nevertheless does not obstruct free will yes my dear savior replied saint thomas i did teach this doctrine i assert it and i took it from st bernard that devout and famous doctor who is accounted the last of the fathers of thy holy church it is he that has taught such and such doctrines in such and such places of his writings and then father andrew recited all the passages in st bernard what can you believe your selves to be the principals or authors of your own merits and that you have power to insure your salvation simply by your own good deeds you that cannot so much as pronounce the sacred name of jesus with out the inspiration of the holy ghost presumptuou men have you forgot his words who says with out me you can do nothing you will answer w good then does free will and i in few return  saved by grace thus take away free will there nothing left to save a man take away grace freew loses the only means it had to save st bern de grace and lib arbit cap   when a man is fallen into sin by his own prope will he cannot by the same will retrieve himself god having been pleased to put it in adams power to stand fast without falling but not having give him power to recover himself after his fall and  this any great wonder for as a man ever falls easily down a precipice from the hurt of which fall he cannot so easily recover himself so when he ha precipitated himself into a profundity of sin he has no power to go back not being able to forbear sinning though his desire may be clean conttary ibid chap   concerning efficacious grace what means all this says jesus christ is sweet st bernard a jansenist then call him what bernard with your meek and sanctified air would one think you capable of asserting that my grace has an absolute power over free will and yet that this same grace does not hinder the free will and that every man acts infallibly as well as freely when i please to attract him to me by the sweetness of my efficacious inspirations can it be true that you have taught all this yes my savior says st bernard i will stand to it but st augustine is my guarantee and i ought to refer to him because your church not only approves what he has written concerning grace but has in a manner canonized his opinion of it in making use of that doctors sayings only to exemplify its sentiments on that matter and then the little man set himself to work to give the audience diverse texts in st augustine the holy spirit so far inspires mens will upon earth that they do good because they will it and they will that good because god works them a will thereto st aug de cor and de gr chap    n    when god will save no mans free will  resist this salvation ibid chap    that proved the invincible efficacy and omnipotence of grace  has augustine says our lord who ha shared so abundantly of my love and who is so indispensably bound to acknowledge the effects of it taught all this i must find out his master augustine who taught you that my grace has an absolute influence over mans will and disposes of it entirely by the sovereignty it has over it equally with the rest of the creatures under my canopy who was your preceptor st paul my savior is it st paul my apostle yes t your apostle st paul and it is god which works in you both  will and to do of his good pleasure phil chap xiii   he teaches that you promote in us whatever you think fit and that it is you who form in us  will and the action what means all this says our redeemer then there are none but jansenists in heaven call st paul to me and let him answer this i must find out the root of this circumstance come mr st paul tell us plainly have you taught the doctrine you are accused of concerning efficacious grace working by it self who taught you that my divine inspiration must infallibly prevail because mans will must consent freely who should teach it me but your own self my god of whom should i learn it but of the holy ghost who replenished my heart i set my hand to paper and the divine spirit dictated and is not the confirmation of these grand truths palpable in a thousand places of scripture no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him john vi    it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that has heard and has learned of the father comes unto me ibid    no man can come unto me except it were give unto him of my father ibid    from that time many of his disciples went bac and walked no more with him ibid    abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear the fruit of it self except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me  am the vine ye are the branches he that abidet in me and i in him the same brings forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing ibid chap xv      and have not you your self delivered them from your sacred mouth i have indeed says our redeemer i have taugh this doctrine and have left it to my church as a precious inheritance  but i know very well the origin of  this call me hither father ignatius the good saint who could hardly be found amon the crowd appeared at last  and now the jesuits trembled with indignation come hither father ignatius yo are a very good man and humble i wou not have you take it ill but i suppose yo you cannot have forgot that when you were five and thirty years old you were like a boy of five among the young students in the college of st barbe by the same token that you were often lashed for your childish tricks i have bestowed my heaven on you nor do i reproach you now seeing you are in it you are welcome to it but your children are mere firebands proud priests who would impose on the faithful their newfoisted and erroneous doctrines or the ancient and orthodox belief of my church i charge you to humble them it is a hard task i own but i command you again to go about it and if you cannot accomplish it i my self will put a helping hand and humble them to the dust that think themselves the only lights of the church  sirs this is my dream but since it is no more than a dream you may give what credit  please to it  postscript that the reader of the preceding pages may see how that holy that sanctified society is abused by those varlet the jansenists take a character of the founde of the jesuitical order st ignatius  in his youth being nobly born he behaved himself like those of the present age wh have the opportunity and means we wi not talk of whoring drinking etc as being unworthy of such a founder but  he liv some time at court and as the courtie commonly use to do he brought a nob to   when he was reduced god visited hi and then he turned saint and wrought innite miracles  and always in his performances had  particular kindness for women in labor for ignatiuss name would fright the chi from the woman as safely and easily  a jesuit denying absolution would fright poor penitent that knows nothing of  matter  much more of this good saints life  conversation you may read in that celebrat book entitled the provincial letter writ by monsieur paschal  finis
