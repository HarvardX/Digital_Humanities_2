a sermon preached to the people at the market cross of edinburgh on the subject of the union  eccles chap  0 ver    printed in the year mdccvl  a sermon preached to the people at the market cross of edinburgh eccles chap x ver    better is he that labors and abounds in all things than he that boasts himself and wants bread dearly beloved countrymen and fellow citizens suffer me to stop you a little in the furious carreer of your passion to hear a few words of sober and unprejudiced reason i hope they will not be the less grateful if i accost you in that manner of rhetoric which your ears are most accustomed to i have chosen an apocryphal text because my subject is not sacred but secular but if it has not the stamp of divine inspiration it is taken from a book which of all that are not canonical contains the most sublime most useful and most approved maxims of wisdom whether private oeconomical or political and as all wisdom and truth comes from god in that sense my text may be said to be of divine authority  dearly beloved countrymen a generous powerful and victorious nation invites you to an intimate union with themselves a nation whose laws are more just whose government is more mild whose people are more free easy and happy than any other in europe a nation who by their wealth wisdom and valor have broke the most formidable power that ever threatened christendom to whose victorious arms even you your selves owe your present security this nation i say invites you to a copartnership of all the advantages they presently enjoy or may reasonably hope for a gracious queen of the ancient line of our own monarchs desires nothing more than that the people from whom she derives her blood should enjoy the same liberty and plenty with others whom providence has called her to govern it might justly have been expected that such a generous proposal would have been wellcomd with the universal acclamations of all ranks and degrees of people instead of that you have received it with riots mobs and tumults if the offer had not been profitable it was at least civil and deserved a friendly reception and a courteous answer a treaty that was entered into at the desire of your own parliament as well as that of your neighbors and carried on by the authority of the common sovereign of both such a treaty i say was a matter of that weight as made it a very unfit subject for the judgment much more for the scorn and contempt of boys apprentices and tradesmen but since the transcendent wisdom of your leaders have thought otherways let me beseech you in the words of my author eccles    and   blame not before thou have examined the truth understand first and then rebuke to enable you in some measure to make such an enquiry i have chosen the words of my text better is he that labors and abounds in all things than he that boasts himself and wants bread  from the words you may observe a very intimate conjunction betwixt three dismal companions pride poverty and idleness this is a worse union a great deal than that which we are to discourse of at present these three love extremely to keep company and i could never guess for what reason unless it be to teaze and vex one another poverty does what she can to starve pride and pride eats out the heart blood and gutts of poverty and laziness will not stir an inch to relieve either that these three fatal sisters may not only be separated but eternally banished this kingdom it shall be the subject of my following discourse to show that it is better to increase our trade manufacture and riches by an union with england than to boast of our sovereignty and starve for better is he that labors and abounds in all things than he that boasts himself and wants bread  and here indeed it must be proved that an union with england will increase our trade and manufacture in order to which i will ask the greatest zealote against the union a few questions and let him answer me if he can whether the great difference betwixt the wealth of scotland and england is entirly owing to the natural advantages of england as of fruitfulness of soil situation etc or if it does not in some measure proceed from political causes scotland is equal at least in extent to a third of england its people more healthful more prolifick and more temperate why has england then seven times the number of people every acre in scotland is not barren nor every acre in england fruitful how comes it then that england has fifty times the riches of scotland for example why does oxfordshire not so big as fiffe pay to a land tax near as much as all scotland are there not many places on each side the firth of forth which exceed the town of newcastle in soil situation products natural and artificial how comes it to pass then that the town of newcastle has more trade more rich merchants and pays more customs than all the towns in scotland put together it is plain these great differences do not proceed merely from natural but likewise from political causes nay lts easy to assign a piece of england equal in extent much inferior to the gifts of nature of some part of scotland and yet triple in value i know wales is brought by some as an instance to prove that an union will not increase the trade and riches of a mountanous country that their condition is not bettered by an union with england to this i answer that the matter of fact is false if the objection has any strength it ought to prove that wales would not be the worse to be deprived of the benefit of the trade of england a paradox too sublime for any welchman but most obvious to the elevated understandings of some of our worthy patriots  dly i say the comparison is not fairly stated betwixt the worst part of england and the best of scotland wales in many places does not exceed the highlands of scotland in any thing except the height of the mountains but setting aside all these things let us state the comparison the twelve very small countys of wales contain     parishes    market towns    000 people and pay       lib sterling to the land tax which shows they are almost equal to half the number of people in scotland and pay near as much taxes as the whole and it is known that wales is more underrated in their taxes and easier in the excise than scotland thus you see it would be hard to find    of the richest counties in scotland to compare with an equal number and less extent of the worst in england which is as i said a demonstration that the riches of england is the effect of policy as much as of nature and is it not as plain that the protection of the same laws the influence of the same government the partnership of the same plantations and of all other privileges foregin and domestic will much better the condition of scotland there is hardly any subject of trade of the growth of england which we are totally deprived of and we have one peculiar which kind providence and nature has afforded us tho we never had the grace nor industry to make use of it i mean our fish thus we starve with that commodity at our doors from which our neighbors the dutch draw the very foundations of their wealth and maritime power will you then still be fond of that ill government and management which even deprives you of the provision that indulgent nature has thrown into your mouths but some will say has not our convention of burrows chosen men skilled in the deepest mysteries of trade of eminent abilities and greater integrity have not they told us that the trade of england is unsupportable that is untollerable not to be endured which is as much as if they had said we have not grandeur of soul to support so great wealth and prosperity we must be contented to live like pedlers whilst english merchants live like princes where is now your pride where is now your boastings but say you again the same convention of burrows not not less skilled in politics than in trade have told us that the trade of england is precarious it is hard to answer all the unreasonable fears and jealousies of people has wales since their union ever complained of the breach of one article is there any one privilege that an englishman enjoys which a welchman is deprived off do all the other counties unite to oppress yorkshire there are indeed some unequalities of taxes amongst themselves wherein they have thought fit not to depart from a rule once established but this is so sar from being a discouragement to scotland that it is their greatest security it shows how unwilling and incapable a parliament is to recede from quotas already settled though unequal besides matters in a free government never go with that unanimity nor in a british parliament will parties ever be so unequally trimmed that it will not be in the power of a lesser number than the scots members to cast the balance and if necessary so to preserve themselves from oppression and it is highly probable that the party of the north and west who are under taxed after an union will be much strengthnd i shall add no more on this head but that england has oppressed scotland ten times more since the union of the two crowns than ever they will be able to do after the union of the two parliaments but says the same ingenious convention to show their skill in political arthmetick the taxes of england are unsupportable to this i answer that it was hardly ever known that a nation was afraid of high customs upon their import and consumpt when did that ever ruin any people that is just as if a man should complain that he could not be rich because he has not leave to spend his money or that he will not accept of a lairdship for fear of paying two months cess with those intolerable customs the english merchants live higher and acquire much greater riches than ours do as for the land tax it can hardly ever be higher and will be often nothing or much lower than what we now pay indeed the increase of trade will be attended with an increase of excise and the benefit of the one will be much greater than the damage of the other but then the effect will not exceed the cause with this advantage that all that is raised by the public beyond the present sum by the articles of the treaty is to remain in the country if after all you should want money to pay your taxes i can propose no better expedient than that of the gospel launcb out into the deep and let down your nets and you may fetch your tribute money out of your fishes for after an union you will have stock to employ your people to catch them and vent for them when they are catched  another objection is that an union with england will draw our people out of scotland to the metropolis of the government and to the plantations to which i answer that after an union there are many reasons and inducements for our people to stay at home that do not subsist in the present state but not any one saving their attendance in the british parliament to draw them abroad how many people at present leave their country for want of employment i may say for want of bread is evident to every body that knows either scotland or other countries where multitudes of scots are to be met with nay i appeal to every family in the kingdom if they have not relations abroad some where or another and this is the chief cause why scotland notwithstanding the health temperance and fruitfulness of the inhabitants is under peopled now is it not extremely probable that the increase of trade would employ and keep many at home that are now forced to seek their bread in foreign countries and not only so but when the restraint of the laws of trade is taken off the cheapness of living and manufacture will invite people from other parts into scotland particularly the scots who are now settled in the west indies would choose to purchase and establish their families in their own country not being any more restrained by acts of navigation from the returning their effects thither   dly if any scotsman at present has a mind to settle in england the minute he sets his foot on english ground he has the privileges of an englishman what then can entice him to leave his own country after an union more than before i should imagine he would be less tempted to do so because he can then have the same privileges of trade and all other immunities in staying at home which now he cannot have without going into england if you say that after an union his access to preferment in the public stations of the government and consequently his temptations to go to london will be greater that is an advantage for then he goes to get an estate and not to spend one and he will readily purchase in his own country if our gentry and nobility have a mind to spend their estates at london i know no law at present that restrains them only necessity which has no law that indeed after an union may be less many of our nobility and gentry are now continually at london a few to govern some to oppress many to complain and all for strife and contention and suppose by their attendance on a british parliament the numbers of those should be doubled scotland gets little by an union if it is not able to discharge the expense of thirty noblemen and gentlemen at the rate of  000 l sterling a man and perhapes the times may not be so hard but some of them will carry more down than they brought up  thus i think i have fully answered this objection which is so far from being of any weight that i must entreat you by the kindness and natural affection you bear to your dear children and relations by the comfort of their society and having them established amongst your selves in a flowrishing condition by the casualties and dangers and by the unfortunate and fatal end which their strowling into foreign countries often exposes them to by all these moving arguments i beseech you to embrace so fair an opportunity of making them and your selves happy for ages to come for as the wise man says eccl    and    it is a miserable life to go from house to house for where thou art a stranger thou dare not opea thy mouth thou shall entertain and feast and have no thanks moreover thou shall hear bitter words these things are grieveous to a man of understanding thus i have gone throw my first head and have proved that as clearly as the sun shines at noonday and i call the same sun to witness against your matchless ignorance and stupidity if you reject so favorable an offer of liberty peace and plenty  i proceed now to the second part of my text which is your boasting of your sovereignty must we loose that must we be no more a kingdom in the first place i would ask any reasonable man do we lose our sovereignty in any other sense than england does is there not a new title new seal new arms and the same changes for them as for us for i take an incorporating union to be as if two pieces of metal were melted down into one mass neither can be said to retain its former form or substance as it did before the mixture we can never be so unreasonable as to pretend to an equal number of representatives in a british parliament when two nations join in a common assembly the most powerful and most numerous still will be the most powerful and most numerous whatever metal exceeded before the mixture the same will exceed in the mass it is impossible to change the nature of things according to this way of reasoning it is not only impossible for scotland ever to unite with england but for any lesser nation ever to unite with a greater why is it more dishonorable for scotland to unite with england than it is for england to unite with scotland what is it that scotland looses the country the people are not annihilated nor does an union cause that all the worthy deeds that have been done at any time by the scots nation or scotsman are undone a welchman would take it very unkindly if we should tell him that by his union with england he has sullid the glory and antiquity of the ancient british race none can have a greater value for noble achievements and honor of our ancestors than i have but as for our independency so much boasted of tho it be most certainly true in it self and undeniable in law as well as justifiable from history yet at present it is in effect only precarious imaginary and fantastical and is no more than the privilege to be governed by a ministry under foreign influence which i say not to insinuate the least reflection on our present ministry who have the honor to act a great part in putting an end to a grievance so much complained of a blessing perhaps in vain to be expected or looked for at another time can any man be so destitude of common sense as to think his liberty and property more safely and more honorably lodged in such hands than in those of a british parliament now in lieu of this titular sovereignty and imaginary independency by an union you acquire true and solid power and dominion to have sixty members in a british parliament the twelfth share of disposing of  000000 l of money which is the same with the sole power of disposing of  00000 to have your fleets and armies conquering abroad the arbitration of the affairs of europe your selves represented in foreign courts and assemblies when had sixty scotsmen affairs of that importance laid before them to have your nobility peers of great britain with their persons and reputations sacred over the island and their lives only subject to the inquest of a british house of lords to have your quota of the most eminent posts of the government of great britain are not these things substantial power and dominion preferable to the triffles you now enjoy besides that the value of those will be increased and is it not more eligible to have such a share both of the government of your selves and of england than to be managed by favorites often contrary to your most apparent interests  but all these advantages may be obtained by a faederal union some say it is an amazing thing to consider how people are banterd out of their common sense with mere names and chimeras to avoid multiplicity of words by a faederal union i suppose is meant that the english should barter their trade for our settling of their successor i would desire any man who thinks such a bargain feazible to make the following reflections in any vote that ever past yet in scotland against the settling the succession whether he thinks that england could not purchase the majority of that difference at a cheaper rate than the liberty of their trade and plantations let them ask the consciences of those who voted against the settlement of the succession if the hopes of a faederal union was the motive that induced them to do so let them ask those that voted for it if they will vote so no more till they have obtained it to show how unsincerly they deal who make this their pretense many of these very gentlemen will be contented to settle the succession on any terms but   ly where is there such a faederal union betwixt two nations without a common assembly the confederated provinces and the confederated cantons have one where the representatives of all the particular bodies meet   dly can any man believe that the english will mantain plantations garrison them and defend them with their fleets and armies to let scots who are at none of these charges reap the profit of the trade will they establish customs and duties as the rule of their export abroad and consumption at home and suffer the scots to trade without any rule of customs or no customs high or low as they please if they would do this it were no hard matter to have the monopoly of their trade this were a most precious jewel indeed and very well worth contending for but if such a concession should be thought unreasonable i would desire in the next place to know how a commone expense in mantaining and providing for forts plantations and factories can be carried on without a common thesaury and government and lastly if the english should allow us such a privilege can we be secure of it without we have our representatives in their parliament to take care of our interest and can any man of sense think that we should be more unsecure of our privileges when we have members in their assembly than when we have none when we are domestics than when we are strangers in the former case nothing destroies our privileges but what dissolves the union for it is hardly possible to conceive that all the other counties should unite to hinder a york shire man to trade to the plantations when the riches he acquires by his trade goes to the support of the government of which they themselves are members in the case of one nation and one people it is indifferent to the supreme power in what part of great britain their riches ly  i shall conclude this article with the words of the wise man eccl      the hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false and dreams lift up fools i have set before you to day on one hand industry and riches on the other pride and poverty i have not required a blind assent to what i affirm i have not imposed my opinion because it is fashionable or because such a lord who is my friend and patron thinks so or because mess john or mess james said so or because my drunken companions swear damn them it is so i deal with you as reasonable men and have purposely insisted on such arguments as are obvious to the meanest understanding i conclude with a general exhortation to all ranks and degrees of people to promote this good work it is manifestly the interest of you landedmen for the increase of trade and manufacture will double yea triple the value of your estates by raising the price of the product and the number of the purchassers besides your lands being generally in the worst repair that is the most improveable condition and your security by the use of a register the best in the island no doubt after the restraint of laws is taken off strangers will be encouraged to purchase among you why then will you choose to live in a miserable moyling condition paying high interest for money which landrents cannot discharge having no way to dispose of your younger children but by sending them abroad into the wide world to seek their fortunes whereas after the conclusion of this great affair you will have opportunities to employ them in trade and business and access according to merit to the best posts of great britain as for you tennents the necessity of your masters is the occasion of your poverty trade will enable them to let longer leases and you to take them and conform you in time to english customs where masters govern a free people and are duly paid their rents and tennents enjoy what remains with equal security as for you tradesmen the value of your manufacture will be raised you will have the opportunity to dispose of it not only over all the island but over all the world you are ingenious industrious and live cheap what then can hinder you to be more rich than those who have less of all these qualities where there are hands to work and simples to work upon and vent for the manufacture it is impossible but there must be trade if our own stock is not sufficient you will be assisted by that of england the very novelty of the thing will in some measure contribute to this for all the branches of traffic in england being traded bare where there are new subjects of trade merchants will try new projects their interest will never suffer them to be partial to this or that country but will send their money where they can have the best bargain and you poor laborers shall raise your wages from twopence to twelvepence from ten pounds to a hundred pounds  you see the objections used by the opposers of an union are either frivolous founded upon gross falsehoods or do plainly prove the contrary of what they are adduced for and i have that opinion of the underderstanding of several of the antiuniters that they do not so much as convince themselves they are only a vail drawn over your eyes to hide from you your present poverty and slavery and the glorious prospect which an union with england presents you with you are used only as tools and machines to bring about their factious and ambitious designs however i shall beseech all such gentlemen and persons of quality to consider that it is not a slight matter to sacrifice the present and future prosperity of their country to an unreasonable humor to make a numerous people and their posterity beggars and slaves for ages to come and perhapes their country a field of blood by endeavoring to entall this upon their neighbors as well as themselves or if they are swayed with some reason of less importance as the treaty not being of their own framing i desire them to consider that this is so very childish that a senator should be ashamed to own it if the pretty little masters their children should take their fathers places in parliament such a reason would hardly be allowed to pass current among them an union is a matter of great weight and importance and very good or bad in it self if it is a bad thing our most intimate friends the treaters can never recommend it if it is a good thing it is so great a good that we ought not to refuse it from those against whom our personal resentments run highest among the opposers of the union i know a great many persons of honor who have as true a sense of liberty and as great a concern for the well are of their country as any such need only lay aside some sew prejudices and reflections their judgments will quickly inform them of the true value of the proposal to such as are afraid of the church and religion i shall only say that the religion of the church of england is imposed upon no man within the dominions of england as for the squeemishness of sitting in parliament with prelates and the fear of being disarmed of all other weapons but what are allowed by the gospel these are such unchristian dissuasives from an union that to mention them only is to refute them the putting an end to uncharitable and unreasonable divisions about our triffling differences in religion is one of the great benefits scotland will reap by this union i am not so much terrified at the vision of a noble lord as he is himself but heartily wish to see a plantation of as rich jews as any in amsterdam as rich independents quakers and anabaptisms as any in england settled in all the trading towns of the kingdom not but that i think all motives that are not penal ought to be used for their conversion but would not have churchmen afraid of the increase of their manufacture for heretics are properly the subject which they are to work upon to be afraid to live among heretics is to refuse the task their master has imposed upon them their predecessors the apostles used to go at the hazard of their persons to preach the gospel to the jews they are afraid the jews should come to them where they run no risque at all in attempting their conversion in a word if any unjust tyranny over the persons estates or consciences of men be the motive which prevail with some to oppose this union i would have such consider that to govern a free people is a more noble and honorable character than to insult over slaves and beggars and if any such there be who hug their chains and are fond of their rags and as a wretched people once did by the romans refuse their liberty when offered they are unworthy of so generous and beneficial a proposal lastly if this is only a scuffle raised by the consederated force of the skillin and louis d or let such consider that both of them are not to be put in the balance with the guinea which they may get by their industry consider then in this your day the happy condition of your neighboring nation survey their verdant fields beautiful plantations and sumptuous gardens where culture art and expenses reign their populous and flowrishing cities view the magnificence of their public structures the neatness cleanliness convenience and costly furniture of their private houses consider the liberty and plenty of their meanest commons the comfortable estates which even the basest of their tradesmen leave to their families the immense riches of their merchants the grandeur and magnificence of their learned societies the prodigious stocks of their tradingcompanies the unconquerable force of their fleets and armies the justice and exact execution of their laws and the wise administration of their government ponder all these things and then sure you will not reckon them your enemies who offer you a partnership in so great blessings but will conclude with the wise man in my text better is he that labors and abounds in all things than he that boasts himself and wants bread  finis
