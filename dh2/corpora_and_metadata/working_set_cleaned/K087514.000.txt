a proposal for putting a speedy end to the war by ruining the commerce of the french and spaniards and securing our own without any additional expense to the nation  london printed for daniel brown at the black swan and bible without templebar and andrew bell at the crosskeys and bible in cornhil mdcciii  to his royal highness the prince lord high admiral of england sir the following proposal for the securing of commerce could be no where so properly addressed as to your royal highness who in your exalted station can do nothing at present that will be more for the security of these kingdoms or for your own glory than the protecting and maintaining our trade the french by their practice in the present war will show that it is their opinion that they can do nothing more fatal to these nations than the ruining their traffic for which reason i humbly conceive they will not pretend to engage us at sea but laying up their capital ships will infest us with their privateers and their cruisers and indeed why should they run the risk of engaging us when they can destroy us without it for by ruining our commerce our navigation sinks our seamen are lost and our royal fleet in a very few years must by consequence fall the french therefore with submission to your royal highness will not pretend to engage us for should they get the better of us they have not leisure at the present juncture to invade us and can reap no advantage from their victory but what they may have in a great degree without it and that is the destroying our trade which if they can promise themselves to do they need not run the hazard at present of an invasion tho they had leisure and troops to attempt it for from the destruction of our traffic they may promise themselves all the advantages which they could reap from an invasion without running the risk of it and whereas an invasion would be expensive as well as hazardous this other way will be gainful as well as certain since the ruin of our commerce will impoverish us and despirit us and bringing us up tame to their hands will conquer us without a blow for our traffic by frequent losses will be discouraged and daily lessened and the diminution of that will decrease our manufactures the decay of which will augment the number of the poor make the tenants less able to pay their rents and render the taxes at length intolerable since therefore it is plain that the only design which the french have against us at present is to ruin our commerce i leave it to be determined by your royal highness whether it ought not to be our chief care to destroy theirs and to preserve our own which if we can effect we may be sure of the victory without running the venture for it and barely supporting our allies and acting defensively on the continent may in a few years see the numerous armies of our enemies consumed and lost by famine  but that the royal navy of england alone is not sufficient to maintain our trade and to destroy theirs is plain because it never has done it for since in the separate war which we formerly had with spain and in that which we lately had with france our losses by sea were very grievous notwithstanding our formidable squadrons and our numerous cruisers how should those squadrons and cruisers prevent them in the war in which we are at present engaged against those potent kingdoms united to prevent our losses and to augment theirs i should be apt to believe requires an additional and a proportioned force and i leave it to your royal highness to consider whether it is not reasonable at the time we are making such vast preparations against their grand squadrons which will not appear to engage us that some effectual provision should be made against those robbers which will certainly appear to plunder us i thought it might be for the service of the queen and your royal highness to offer you a hint of such a provision by an additional and wellproportiond force if that hint is barely good your royal highness will easily see that it is highly important for if the french by means of their privateers can so grievously endamage our trade at the very time that their grand fleet dares not show it self on the ocean i leave it to your royal highness to consider what a terrible ravage we must make in their traffic by employing such a subordinate force as will be mentioned hereafter by employing such a force i say at the same time that the dutch and we with our grand squadrons under the auspicious conduct of your royal highness ride the unquestioned masters of the main  if your royal highness approves of the following hint it can never enter into the great council by a more valuable recommendation as is plain to all the world by the extraordinary testimony which they are giving of their esteem for you and the esteem which those awful assemblies have shown for you is a convincing proof that your royal highness tho born a stranger to us has not only lived for so many years with an unblemished character among a people who are generally thought to be averse to strangers but that the reputation of your virtue has gained the affections of all englishmen even to the remotest parts of the kingdom  the protecting and maintaining our commerce will not fail to advance your royal highnesss interest and to augment your glory for if such cries such clamours nay such curses were uttered against some commissioners of the admiralty in the late reigns for suffering by their malice or their mismanagement our trading vessels to become a prey to our enemies what numberless blessings must be heaped upon your royal highness by a happy people flourishing in their commerce under your auspicious conduct  to detain you no longer i conclude with my zealous wishes for the prosperity of the queen and your royal highness may she long reign in the hearts of all her people and you reign long in hers and while she with mildness governs the land may your highness with terror control the main and appear to the confusion of our enemies the dreadful wonder of god in the deep may both the queen and your royal highness find all her subjects as strongly inclined but much more able to serve you than  sir your royal highnesss most humble most dutiful and most obedient servant john dennis  proposals for putting a speedy end to the war etc that it is the joint interest of all the confederates to use their utmost efforts for the putting a speedy end to the present war is plain from hence that a delay will probably be more favorable to the french than it will be to us for wherever there is a war between a confederate power on the one side and an united absolute one on the other time if there is any proportion of strength between them must subject the confederate to more contingencies than it can the single absolute power  the making a very great effort at sea will be more effectual on our part toward the speedy ending of the war than the sending formidable forces to flanders or any part of the continent because at land we run a greater risk and the gain is not so significant  the french have more numerous armies than we and those armies are very well disciplined and they have a great many more impregnable garrisons from which it is evident that we run a hazard at land whether we shall be victorious or not and if we are the gain of several battles may not conclude the war  at sea the case is vastly different for there we need run little or no risk of the enemy unless we please our selves this being a thing that is never to be questioned that if the dutch and we will make an effort we may be masters of the sea  now this is certain that if we can continue entirely masters of the sea we must put a speedy end to the war for our entire command over the seas must ruin our enemies commerce and that utterly now commerce is the only fountain of treasure in countries that have no mines and silver and gold are the only sinews of war which sinews when they happen to be cut off or to be very much obstructed the body politic becomes of a sudden either maimed impotent or paralytick  but then this at the same time must be observed that they only are entire masters of the sea who can command it absolutely and they alone can be said to command it absolutely who make their maritime power answer all the ends for which it was designed and these are the defense of their coasts the security of their own commerce and the ruin of that of their enemies  from which it is plain that our present maritime forces are insufficient to render us entirely masters of the seas for being unable to protect us from the french privateers they cannot secure our commerce but that they are unable to protect us from the french privateers is evident not only from matter of fact and the vast number of vessels that we lost in the late war notwithstanding that we had above one hundred men of war equipped on our own part but from the nature of the thing it self for the french privateers being so much smaller and lighter at least for the generality than our ships of war which cruize upon them are consequently so much swifter and not drawing half the quantity of water which the cruizers draw are by that means enabled to escape from them in shole water besides that our fleet of war is obliged for the most part to act united  but if it is impossible to secure our own commerce with our present maritime power it is by consequence impossible to ruin that of the enemy for their robberies upon the seas are equivalent to them at least in some measure to commerce for by means of the aforesaid robberies they import those commodities into france for which their enemies trade for nothing besides that by this method they supply themselves with ships so that our present maritime power being insufficient to ruin the enemies commerce utterly and by that means to enervate the sinews of war is by consequence insufficient to put a speedy end to that war  but that it is in our power with an additional maritime force to secure our commerce and ruin that of the enemies and so to become entirely masters of the seas may i believe appear from hence that having more ships of every burden and more seamen than the french we are as able to make an effectual provision against their pirates and robbers as against their fleet of war by which we at once secure our trade and ruin that of our enemies nay and ruin it in all the branches of it not only cutting off their correspondence between the west indies and europe but that which they also at present maintain between one part of europe and another  to show how this may brought to pass is the end of the ensuing lines in order to the doing which i shall treat of the following points  first i shall show what number of ships of what bigness and how armed must be provided for the compassing this design secondly i shall enquire into the expense of setting them forth thirdly i shall discover a method to defray that expense without taxing the people fourthly i shall show how these ships are to be used and disposed fifthly i shall show the advantage which may be reaped from them sixthly i shall answer some objections first then besides the grand royal fleet which in conjunction with the dutch we suppose to be more than an equal match for the whole french royal navy not only in the channel but in the straits too and the west indies according to the several squadrons we next suppose a subordinate fleet to be equipped which for the most part is to act distinctly from the other and to consist of two hundred vessels english and two hundred dutch the best sailers that the queen and the states can light of all of them containing one with another two hundred tuns a vessel the whole to be armed with ten thousand english and ten thousand dutch who are to be a fifth part mariners and the rest marines the number of guns in every vessel to be proportioned to the bigness of the vessel and the number of the men the captain of every vessel to have the queens and the states commissions by which they are to be authorized to scowr the seas of privateers and pirates but they who have the queens commissions are not like the vessels of the great fleet to carry the royal flag because in case of a manifest disadvantage they are to be allowed to run which the honor of england will not allow to the flag  i come now to say something of the expense of equipping this fleet and without pretending to an exact calculation i shall content my self with coming something near to it let us allow then  00000 l per annum for the hire of the ships for our part of the expense and as much for the dutch and  00000 l per annum for us and as much for the dutch for the wages of the men their provision and ammunition and having done that let us proceed to the method of defraying so considerable a charge  nothing can be more natural than to conclude that since this additional expense is originally and immediately employed for the defense of the merchants that they should be obliged to defray it who principally derive their security from it it is true the whole nation will share in the defense which they will receive from it but the merchants will have the principal share in the gain of which it is but reasonable that they should contribute a part to support it especially since they will derive the security of their gain from that very contribution let us suppose then that every one should be obliged to ensure at the rate of   l per cent exports and  0 l per cent imports take one place with another and that this insurance money according to the value of imports and exports as they have been valued by late computations the imports at between seven and eight millions and the exports at between four and five will amount to a million of sterling money so that  00000 l being allowed on our part and as much on that of the dutch for the hire of the ships the wages of the men their ammunition and provision there remains  00000 l to us and  00000 l to the dutch to make good the losses  but now as every merchant is obliged to ensure the queen is supposed to become the general ensurer for us and the states for the dutch and this ensurance money is to be paid down at the customhouse at the same time with the customs to prevent a new creation of officers which may be troublesome and expensive but one thing i forgot to add that tho the queen is supposed to be general ensurer yet she is always to except the danger of the sea it self for reasons so obvious that they are needless to be insisted on here and is only to ensure the merchants against all captures and that the other ensurance against the danger of the seas may be practiced by those who undertake it in time of peace but then in case it would be more for the queens convenience that some of the ensurance money for the imports should be paid at the respective foreign ports from which the ships set forth because this method in some places particularly in the straits and the west indies may save the queen the trouble and charge and delay of remittances in that case it may be provided that the money be paid to the queens governor or consul residing at or near the respective ports and that debentures may be given by the aforesaid governors or consuls to the value of each receipt  i come to show how this subordinate fleet may be employed and disposed for the service of the nation  i suppose then that  0 of them should be always cruising in the seas between england and holland twenty between ostend and calais which takes in dunkirk five between calais and haver de grace five between haver de grace and la hogue before st malo twenty in the chops of the channel and the irish seas forty south west of ireland twenty bay of biscay thirty coasts of spain in the ocean thirty which numbers computed make two hundred in all the remaining two hundred are to be thus employed an hundred of them are to accompany the royal squadron to the straits there to separate from and to act distinctly unless necessity require otherwise and fifty to cruize in the mediterranean thirty in the gulf of venice and twenty in the archipelago the remaining hundred to be thus disposed of threescore and ten of them to be sent to the west indies fifty of them to act on the coasts of the spanishindies in conjunction with the buccaneers and the other twenty on the coasts of new england and new york and the remaining thirty are to be sent to the coasts of guinea and gambo  let us now say a word concerning the advantage which we should receive from employing so numerous a force in the forementioned manner  first we shall by this means effectually secure our commerce for if during the late war we did not lose above one ship in four in the time of the greatest mismanagement it is very probable we shall not lose above one in twenty now  if there should be no mismanagement in the present war yet our grand fleet would never be able wholly to secure our commerce for the french privateers would be too nimble for our men of war and our own privateers if we should set out any would scarce ever attack those of the enemy but it would be the main part of the business of this subordinate fleet to attack the french privateers and if it were supported and sustained by our cruizers we have no reason to doubt but that in a very little time it would be able to clear the seas of them so that by this method in all probability we should save the nation those vast sums which our losses would otherwise amount to besides as by this means we should secure our commerce we should expedite trade and by dispatching it in some measure double it because none of our trading vessels would be obliged to stay for convoys  secondly as by this means we should secure our own commerce we should ruin that of the french and i leave it to any one to judge whether fifty of these ships in the west indies acting in concert with the buccaneers and distinctly from our royal squadron unless there should prove at any time a necessity for their acting jointly would not cut off all manner of intercourse between france spain and the west indies and hinder the importation of bullion and the passage of their plate fleets by which alone they can pretend to be formidable and whether it would not prove the most effectual method for the seizing upon several places there which at the end of the war remaining our own by treaty would serve to defray the charges of it besides i leave it to any to consider whether the royal squadron to be sent to the west indies acting as it might do upon an emergency in concert with this additional force might not seize upon the most important places which the spaniards hold in those parts  by the squadron of these subordinate ships which we should have in the straits distinctly by our men of war the dutch and we should be enabled to secure the turkey trade to our selves we should as it were invest the kingdoms of naples and sicily and be instrumental in reducing them to the emperors party raise the credit of the emperor with the port and sink the reputation of the french prey on both sides the ecclesiastical state not only upon the mediterranean coasts adjacent to ostia and civita vecchia but likewise upon the adriatic shore adjoining to cesennate pesaro ravenna ancona rimini etc encourage the venetians to declare for the right side and be a terrible awe upon the rest of the italian princes this squadron cruizing in the mediterranean whilst the royal squadron observed the french would lamentably harass the spanish coasts and utterly intercept their trade while that in the ocean would hinder the intercourse between france and spain and be a severe bridle upon the portuguese  to come nearer home the french would have no correspondence by sea between one part of france and another their coasters in all likelihood would be a perpetual prey to us nothing could be transported from dunkirk to breast or from breast to dunkirk unless it should be by landcarriage which would put the french king to a prodigious expense besides we should hinder their traffic to denmark and sweden and hamborough and the rest of the northern ports from which they have not only their naval stores but their best timber  besides all this we should secure our newcastle trade and so provide in some measure for the relief of the poor and defend and support the fishery both of england and holland intercept the commerce of our enemies here and of those in france interrupt the nightly traffic of our owlers which is so prejudicial to the woollen manufacture and prevent and obstruct all manner of smugling and running of goods and so advance the customs sustain the commerce of our western ports which in the late war were ruined either for want of convoys or by too high an insurance all this we might do by this additional force rightly managed and according to the necessity of time and place supported and backed by our cruizers besides these subordinate vessels repairing to our coasts upon any necessity as to deal sandwich or the like while winter constrains our great ships to keep the harbor might prove an admirable outwork to our royal navy which is the natural bulwark of england moreover they might be serviceable in transporting our soldiers to any of the coasts of france or be made instrumental in bombarding any of their ports and the marines by frequent descents might continually spoil their coasts  to all this i might add that by employing the marines designed for this subordinate fleet we should establish a numerous nursery of seamen who as soon as the war is over may be made use of in recovering the fishery of greenland and newfound land and restoring the northern fishery  i come now to answer objections which are chiefly five the  first is that the merchants would think this a hardship upon them the second that the dutch would not comply with it the third that the french privateers would outnumber and consequently overpowr them the fourth that the money set apart for the making good the losses might prove insufficient and so bring the nation more into debt the fifth that this would be a needless preparation because our own privateers encouraged would answer the end first that the merchants would think this a hardship upon them to which i answer that this way of proceeding would make the merchants gain more certain tho it might not make it so great if the pressure upon them were to be intolerable nay very grievous or perpetual we might be inclined to bear with their complaints and to indulge the frailties of human nature but since they are to be but slight we must beg leave to tell them that at a time when their religion their liberty nay the whole of that very property for a trifling part of which they appear so much concerned is at stake they show themselves unreasonable to set an inconsiderable overplus of sordid gain in the balance against all this nay they proceed contrary to the maxims by which they are guided even in their own commerce for they make nothing of hazarding five hundred pounds that they may draw a thousand home from the indies how then can they reasonably murmur at the paying a small sum to the queen which will not much burden them for the security of all which they are to trade during the war and all they inherited or acquired before especially since this is a maxim among them that what is saved is got but they are but a part of that great body the people and they ought not to repine at any little inconvenience if it tends to the defense of the whole because the whole can never be ruined but the parts too must be destroyed if there remain any few among them who are so unreasonable as not to be satisfied with what has been said they are desired to consider that they are but a part of the whole body of the merchants and it is unreasonable in them to repine at what the state thinks necessary for the defense of themselves and their brethren and the common security of trade but to make this unreasonableness appear still greater i shall consider them in their different capacity for all the merchants by the present war are reduced under one of these three heads they who are insurers they who insure or they who run the venture    they who are insurers will infallibly oppose this design because it will oppose their gain but the unreasonableness of these people will appear from hence that they have a mind to be the only gainers by what the public does for the security of trade for even in the condition in which things are at present those ships which will be preserved must be protected by our men of war and therefore i think it very unreasonable that the government should be at the charge of sending out convoys to protect the merchants and that the jews for such in the late war were most of the insurers should be paid for it for i hope no one believes that they can contribute any thing to the security of any one ship for which they may underwrite but their unreasonableness may appear yet further from this that these people are for hazarding the public in hope of their private gain in our late war several of our most considerable merchants left off their trade to turn insurers i mean either left it wholy off or in a great part by which there followed two inconveniences to the public for first the extent of the trade was reduced to a narrow compass and secondly the kings customs were considerably lessened and will these men have the face to tell the government that they ought to reject the present design because their embracing it would infallibly put these people out of capacity of doing the public the same mischief again  but now let us come to those who in case of a war are resolved to insure and for these gentlemen i desire only in short to ask them two or three questions first whether they had rather the queen and the public should get that money which they are resolved to part with for their private security or a few private persons who have no relation at all to and perhaps are mere strangers to them secondly whether they had rather part with their money to those who can secure them or who cannot the government is solvable in case of loss whereas private men often fail no sort of people in the late war being more known to break than the body of insurers but supposing they do not private men at the best can secure but the prime cost supposing the dealing to be direct and fair between them nor even the whole prime cost because the insurers pay but seventy five or eighty pounds for a hundred whereas the government not only secures the prime cost and the whole prime cost but by scowring the seas according to the scope of the present design secures their gain too in a very great degree and by so doing confirms it self which is a double security to them for they would have little cause to boast of their gain if after having thriven in their private capacity they should be undone at last with the public they ought to consider then that by insuring with private persons they make no provision at all for the public with which they must stand or fall and a very invalid one in the mean while for themselves because private persons who appear to be the most considerable are often seen to be utterly undone in a moment whereas by paying this insurance money to the public they make an effectual provision for that and a valid security for themselves because by proceeding thus they are certain not to fall unless the government falls with them without which they cannot stand in short i desire to ask these gentlemen whether since the loss of every man who lives under the protection of the government is a loss to the public which no private insurer ever did or can pretend to make good it is not very reasonable nay very natural that the public should be enabled to provide effectually against it  but now let us come to the merchantadventurer who neither underwrites nor insures but is resolved to run the risk he is in a wealthy and sanguine condition both his veins and his coffers are full and consequently he is inclined to hope the best and he is willing to venture because if he succeeds his gain will be more considerable it is true but then so will his loss provided he does not succeed but fortune he says has been favorable to him hitherto and why should he doubt of her being so for the future why for that very reason because she has been favorable hitherto and the reason is good considering her usual inconstancy he would be a foolish gamester that should be confident of his winning in the latter part of the night because he had luck in the former well but if he has a loss he is very well able to bear it but then he is a great deal better able to bear the insurance money and therefore ought the less to repine at it for since whatever he loses is so much loss to the public because every mans single property is infallibly part of the national stock i believe it will be found but reasonable that what he gets should likewise be a gain to the public but that he who is able to bear a loss is better able to bear the insurance is plain from hence that during the time of the late war when the privateers made most havoc there was about one ship lost in four so that but three parts in four both of the imports and exports went and came safe whereas the insurance will not amount to above a sixth part of each considering that in the present war our enemies will be more numerous and our ports abroad fewer we have no reason to believe that our losses will be fewer unless we take effectual and timely care so that our adventurer may very well lose one ship in three and if fortune should prove severe to him one in two since therefore he cannot foresee the future is it not a most unreasonable thing in him to murmur against a design which will most probably be advantageous to him and may possibly save him from ruin so that being unable to authorize his complaint by reason he has nothing left to justify it but his fancy and what a pleasant person must he be who sets so senseless a thing as his humor in balance against the common security of traffic and the safety of his country  but now i come to the next objection which is that the dutch will not fall in with a design which is concerted here in answer to which i shall only take notice that the dutch are as immediately concerned and perhaps more immediately to put an end to the present war than we for it the war should be protracted   or   or  0 years like the last several destructive accidents might very well happen in that space which would not probably happen in   years the queen whom god long preserve may die so may the emperor so may the king of the romans these things in seven or eight or ten years may fall out considering the common condition of mortality and the machinations of our enemies and in that case considering the present confusions of england and the distractions of the empire what would become of the liberties of europe and of holland particularly well then the dutch are concerned as immediately or rather more immediately than we to put a speedy end to the war now nothing can put a speedy end to the war but the entirely ruining the commerce of the enemy and the securing our own and the doing this in three years time would either bring down the french to our own terms or reduce them to so poor a condition that if any of these fatal accidents should happen they would not be able to make their advantage of them but like an old greyhound upon too hot a course they would be forced to lie down and only pant and blow upon the prey which they would not be able to touch whether the expedient above proposed is sufficient to the compassing this design i leave to be determined by the impartial reader but if this expedient is sufficient for the ruining the french commerce and the securing our own why then the dutch would act most unreasonably if at a time when we so cheerfully contribute beyond what we are obliged to by ancient treaties to their support and assistance by land where their danger is so much greater and so much nearer than ours they should refuse to contribute their part to our common support at sea where our concern is equal  but if it be objected that most of the forces aboard these subordinate vessels being to consist of landmen it would be unreasonable to expect that the dutch should send landforces to sea at the very time that they borrow of their neighbors to defend their frontiers to that we answer that we may raise landmen for the dutch and the dutch in return supply us with seamen  supposing then that the dutch will join with us i shall proceed to the next objection which is that the french and spanish privateers will outnumber the foresaid vessels and consequently overpowr them in order to the answering this i desire leave to take notice of the most remarkable differences in the constitution if i may so call it of the french privateers and the abovementioned vessels and then to observe what influence those differences must necessarily have on their action and on their conduct  first then the privateers fight only for their own interest whereas the foresaid vessels are supposed to fight for their countries interest and their own  secondly the privateers fight for the most part upon this condition to have no purchase no pay whereas the others are to be in constant pay from the queen  thirdly the privateers have no other incitement than the hopes of immediate gain whereas the others will have that and the spur of honor and ambition besides for if they do well in the queens service they may expect advancement from her from which differences in their constitution there would follow these considerable ones in their conduct the privateers being governed each within it self and each of them absolutely independent of others would act for the most part singly for acting in concert can hardly answer their end which is to enrich themselves for they can scarce get so many together as to be potent enough for a trading fleet and its convoy and they could never find their account while they were altogether employed in taking of single ships but while they act singly or by two or three in a company the forementioned vessels would act in concert always within call one of another as having their general and subaltern officers like a royal navy for which reason the privateers would seldom or never have any advantage over them and they would never attack them without such an advantage because gain being their only incitement they would hardly be induced to fight when there was a great deal more danger of losing their own ships than of taking their enemies whereas our ships acting in concert and upon occasion in considerable numbers would very often have the advantage of the privateers and when they had not would be obliged by honor to attack them on the square and whereas they who did so would have both ambition and interest to sustain them the others would have only mere private interest it is true indeed the number of privateers may be something augmented by the d of anjous accession to the crown of spain but it will not be much because the spaniards have neither much money nor many seamen to spare and if sometimes our cruizers alone during the time of the late war made such terrible work with the french privateers and would have made more if they had not been too nimble and too light for them what must not so considerable and so well proportioned a force do backed by those very cruizers how would those privateers get out of st malo or dunkirk or how would they get in again with their plunder when those ports should be blocked up by our foresaid vessels sustained by our fourthrate cruizers or would they not be afraid to venture when the hazard is so great and the gain so uncertain and when in open sea it would be difficult for them to distinguish our trading ships from the very vessels that would lie in wait for their ruin but if it should be urged that the french king in a very little time would be for using the same method and send out his privateers on his own account backed by some of his men of war in numbers and strength sufficient to resist ours to that we answer that he can never find seamen enough to supply both his navy and those smaller vessels and that if he could this method would infallibly bring on a sea fight which is the very thing that we chiefly ought to desire  i come now to answer another objection which is that the money set apart for making the losses good would be insufficient and that consequently this design would bring the nation more into debt but by what has been said already and by what shall be now said i doubt not of making it appear that it would be an infallible means for the keeping the nation out of debt for first we have shown in the preceding paragraph that the french would not be likely to take many of our ships and consequently this method by saving the ships would preserve the customs and so prove a considerable support to one of the greatest branches of the public revenue but secondly since this method will hinder them from taking our ships we must take theirs if they stir and consequently there would be more money coming to the queen as well as to the seamen to encourage them besides that several of the ships which we take from them might be employed in the room of as many of the hired ones and so lessen the charge of the undertaking but if on the other side their ships should not stir out we should do our business without taking them for they cannot subsist without commerce thirdly the money coming in daily at the customhouses for insurance may save the government the borrowing of several sums and consequently save the nation a great deal in extravagant interest fourthly the money that may be paid for importations at the outports and particularly at jamaica and barbados may save the queen a great deal of charge as well as trouble and time in remittances thither fifthly the prosecution of this method will capacitate us the sooner to make an end of the war and consequently enable us the sooner to get out of debt and so may save us vast sums in interest and in principal  there remains yet one more objection and that is that this would be a needless preparation because our privateers encouraged would answer all the ends of it to which i reply that first the whole number of privateers would not amount to half the force secondly that that number which should be equipped of them would not act in concert thirdly that in privateers the seamen would not have half the encouragement that they will have in this subordinate fleet for we suppose that besides the ordinary premiums upon guns such a proportion of the prizes as shall be thought convenient shall still be allowed to the officers and the seamen fourthly our ordinary privateers would rarely attack those of the enemy fifthly the gain to the public from privateers would not be so much by a tenth part sixthly it would be a hard matter to encourage privateers without burdening the public because the french are a people of small traffic and others for the most part carry out their goods for them  thus i have laid down the method which came into my thoughts for the securing of commerce and which the sense of the duty that i owe my country obliged me to propose to the great assembly which is chosen to represent it at this important juncture whether the method that i have proposed be sufficient to answer the end i leave to be determined by that illustrious assembly if it appears to be effectual i make no doubt but it will be followed for then tho we may be victorious without it yet we may not but the securing our commerce will secure our victory and the representatives of a great and a wise people will if they can help it leave nothing to fortune if we can secure our commerce we must remain a free independent people if we cannot we may become a conquered province  finis
