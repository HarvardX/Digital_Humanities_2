damon and phillida altered from cibber into a comic opera with the addition of new songs and chorusses as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  the music entirely new composed by mr dibdin  london printed for w griffin at garricks head in catharinestreet strand      price  s  preface mr garrick having allowed me as miss radleys master to choose what second part she should appear in i turned my thoughts toward the ballad farce of damon and phillida but when i came to look at it i not only found that the music consisted of a great many heavy minuets and old fashioned countrydances but that there was too much dialogue without the intervention of airs which being also in blank verse rendered the drama still more tiresome as well as hurt the simplicity of some of the characters which in the idea were not contemptible add that the opening and conclusion were extremely flat and unoperatical  in order to remedy the first objection i ventured to reset some of the ballads intending out of esteem for our old melodies to let the rest remain with the addition only of modern accompanyments but here again i found the trouble would be equal to new setting the whole and i also saw that without the chance of adding any thing to my own little reputation i might lay myself open to censure by endeavoring to mend what in the opinion of many people might want no improvement  for these reasons i have composed all the songs entirely new and as the piece has never pleased upon the stage and for that reason has been very seldom performed since that great actress mrs clive was so justly celebrated in the part of phillida i have taken the farther liberty to make such alterations in the drama as i presumed necessary  i have thrown the dialogue into prose added several new songs restored others from love in a riddle inserted chorusses and whether for the better or the worse made the whole very different from what it has ever yet appeared with regard to the music i shall only say that while i have endeavored to give light and familiar airs i have also endeavored to give such as are neither trite nor vulgar  c dibdin  persons arcas mr hurst corydon mr

hear your story and whatever power i have to serve you you may freely command   corydon ah my good lord you are our general friend  this is my daughter i have ever studied to make her happy and to own the trurh her cheerful compliance with all my commands from her infancy has rendered that task a great satisfaction to me now my lord lest i should die and leave her in an unfriendly world i would fain see her well married and for that purpose have found her out a pair of wellmeaning youths to take her choice of cymon and mopsus here they are brothers and their manners suit her condition i am well assured she might be happy with either of them for they both love her sincerely   cymon yes an please you we are both cruelly in love   arcas a little patience honest cymon   corydon these lads i say my lord if there was no obstruction in the way might one or the other make her a good husband perhaps  but this soppish rambling damon here has bewitched her i think his squeaking pipe has rivaled both cymon and mopsus and they toy and play together all day long   cymon ay so they do an please you   corydon nay nay cymon   cymon well well i have done i am sure it is true though   mopsus hoh hoh

ruin her which would but ill recompense me for all my care and fatherly advice the favor i would beg of you my lord is to interpose your authority in my behalf and though you are not our king it is well known you rule our hearts and the continual good you do us every day makes it but gratitude that we should yield to whatever is your pleasure therefore if you think my case deserves pity i hope your wisdom will point out to me a way to prevent any ill that may ensue from it   arcas i take your grief to heart good corydon and wish i may have it in my power to make you easy damon you hear your accusation do you think it honest to trifle in an affair like this or that it will add to your reputation to say you purchased this unwary maids affection at the price of all she possessed for which she could be counted amiable think seriously and tell me what i shall say i have done to right this good old man   damon my lord my professions are sincere let the girl please herself if she has a mind to marry there is her choice if she has a mind to make a frolic of life here is her man   air the man for life that takes a wife is like a thousand dismal things a fox in trap or worse mayhap an owl in cage that never sings from morn till night he hates her sight yet he poor soul must endure it bed of thorns head of horns such a life rope or knife can only cure it a bull at stake to merry make he roars aloud and the laugh is strong like dog and cat or puss and rat he fights for life and it lasts as long but the man that is free is like the be who every flower is tasting never cloys with his joys day or night new delight is only lasting     corydon you see my lord i did not accuse him falsely   arcas it is true  well my friends i hope your hearts are honest endeavor to rival this

have at her   air there is not a swain on the plain would be blessed as i o could you but on me smile but you appear so severe that trembling with fear my heart goes pit a pat all the while when i cry must i die you make no reply but look shy and with a scornful eye kill me with your cruelty how can you be so hard to me     corydon well phillida has this no effect upon you   cymon no no poor cymon thou art never the nearer not all thy songs nor sighs nor sobs can move her   arcas perhaps she may like mopsus better come my lad let us hear what you have to say you seem cheerful   mopsus yes i am always so i loves to laugh for my part let things go how they will what do i care for her frowns it gives a bodys mind some ease to think that cymons used as ill as i all my comfort is that happen as it will i shall have him to laugh at   arcas but now corydon let us enquire into your daughters heart phillida here are three youths who labor to deserve your love tell me freely which is the man that is favored most by you trust me with the secret of your wishes that i may prove your friend   phillida since i am urged to speak the truth i own my heart my lord has been foolishly imposed upon my fathers will i never disobeyed and sincerely wish i had it now in my power to please him but i can never consent to lead a savage life and what could i expect better from the company of these lads   cymon oh oh oh o scornful maid my poor heart will burst with grief   mopsus hoh hoh hoh poor cymons in a bitter taking   phillida it is hard that i must choose from such extremes of folly  damons infidelity should make me hate him but i fear he has too many tender advocates in my heart it is true i have tried a thousand times to shut him from my thoughts as often found i tried in vain my weakness will find excuses for his treatment of me whenever he submits he is sure to be forgiven and whenever i forgive i am sure to be forsaken   air what woman could do i have tried to be free yet do all i can i find that i love him and though he flies me still still he is the man they tell me at once he to twenty will swear when vows are so sweet who the falsehood can fear so when you have said all you can still  still he is the man i caught him one day making love to a maid when to him i ran he turned and he kissed me then who could upbraid so civil a man the next day i found to a third he was kind i rated him soundly he swore i was blind so let me do all that i can still  still he is the man the shepherds all bid me beware of his art i do what i can but he has taken such hold of my heart i doubt he is the man so sweet are his kisses his looks are so kind he may have his faults but if none i can find who can do more than they can he  still is the man     arcas take comfort corydon your daughters unreserved confession of her love persuades me of the goodness of her heart and though licentious damon may deserve severe reproof yet for her sake let us not harden him by punishment but rather tempt him by reward to virtue my favor shall be shown to every one who seeks by honest means to gain it therefore if he or any other swain can win this gentle maid to be his bride the portion she expected from her father i will double on the marriage day  come friends let us leave these lovers   chorus hail the day ye nymphs and swains to your plains that gave a lord who
