kants critique of practical reason and other works on the theory of ethics translated by thomas kingsmill abbott bd fellow and tutor of trinity college dublin fourth edition revised with memoir and portrait london longmans green  co paternosterrow      iv for heavens sake buy two books kants fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals and kants critical examination of the practical reason kant is not a light of the world but a whole solar system at once jean paul richter first edition of this translation      second edition enlarged      third edition further enlarged      fourth edition      dublin printed at the university press by ponsonby and weldrick v translators preface to third edition this volume contains the whole of kants works on the general theory of ethies it consists of four parts—   i a complete translation of the grundlegung zur metaphysik der sitten this work was first published in        ii a complete translation of the kritik der praktischen vernunft first published in        iii a translation of the general introduction to the metaphysical elements of moral philosophy metaphysische anfangsgrunde der sittenlehre and of the preface and introduction to the metaphysical elements of ethics metaph anfangsgründe der tugendlehre   iv the first portion of die religion innerhalb der grenzen der blossen vernunft   otherwise named philosophische religionslehre this portion was first published vi by kant himself separately in      and it appears to me to be indispensable to a complete view of kants ethics the remainder of the work first edition      does not come within the sphere of ethics proper i have added in an appendix a translation of kants essay—ueber ein vermeintes recht aus menschenliebe zu lügen      werke ed rosenkr vol vii which is interesting as throwing further light on kants application of his principles the first of these treatises and half of the second were translated by mr semple edinburgh      reprinted      in connexion with the greater part of the metaphysik der sitten which is concerned with the discussion of particular virtues and vices mr semple has also translated in a distinct volume the religion u s w the edition which i have used is that of kants whole works by rosenkranz and schubert vol viii of which contains the grundlegung and the kritik and vol x the religion for convenience of reference to the original i have given at the top of each page the corresponding pages of rosenkranz edition it is not very accurately printed and where the errors are obvious i have silently corrected them others i have vii noticed in footnotes many of these errors seem to have been handed down through all editions from the first hartensteins edition is more carefully revised and i have referred to it and to kirchmanns in cases of doubt kants grammatical errors partly provincialisms partly due to his age are usually corrected by hartenstein but silently which is a somewhat questionable proceeding in an editor amongst these errors are uncertainty in the use of the indicative and conjunctive an almost thoroughgoing misuse of prepositions hartenstein and irregularities in the gender of substantives his use of vor for für has been generally corrected by editors where vor remains the reader must remember that its retention is a matter of judgment i have to express my obligation to professor selss for his kindness in revising the proofs and for many valuable suggestions the memoir prefixed will it is hoped prove interesting in the present fourth edition some corrections have been made the portrait prefixed is from a photograph of an oilpainting in the possession of gräfe and unzer booksellers of königsberg it is inferior as a work of art to the portrait engraved in the former edition viii but as it represents kant in the vigour of his age and unlike the former has never appeared in any book readers will probably be pleased with the substitution i possess also a copy of a rare fulllength silhouette photographic copies of which can be supplied my notes are in square brackets ix xiii memoir of kant immanuel kant was born in königsberg on the   nd of april      thirteen years after hume and fourteen after reid his family was of scottish origin his grandfather having been one of the many scotchmen who emigrated from scotland at the end of the seventeenth century some settling in prussia and some in sweden and he is said to have been himself the first to change the spelling of the name from cant which he did in order to avoid the mispronunciation zant his father was a saddler in modest if not humble circumstances both parents were persons of simple and sincere piety kant himself although he did not sympathize with their religious views bears the strongest testimony to the practical effect of their religion on their life although said he speaking warmly the religious ideas of that time and the notions of what was called virtue and piety were far from being distinct and satisfactory yet such persons had the root of the matter in them let men decry pietism as they may the people who were in earnest with it were honourably distinguished they possessed the highest that man can possess—that calm that serenity that inward peace which is not disturbed by any passion no trouble no persecution dismayed them no contest had the power to stir xiv them up to anger or hostility in a word even the mere observer was involuntarily compelled to respect them i still remember added he how a quarrel once broke out between the harnessmakers and the saddlers about their respective privileges my father suffered considerably nevertheless even in conversation amongst his own family he spoke about this quarrel with such forbearance and love towards his opponents and with such firm trust in providence that although i was then only a boy i shall never forget it of his mother especially he ever retained a tender and grateful memory saying i shall never forget my mother for she planted and fostered the first germ of good in me she opened my heart to the impressions of nature she awoke and enlarged my thoughts and her teaching has always had an enduring and wholesome influence on my life she died when he was only thirteen and even in his later years he could scarcely restrain his emotion when he related to his intimate friends how she had sacrificed her own life through her devotion to a friend   kant strongly resembled his mother in features and in his singularly contracted chest xv at ten years of age kant was sent to the collegium fridericianum where he continued for seven years here he applied himself chiefly to classical studies and learned to write latin with ease and fluency of greek he does not seem to have ever read much amongst his schoolfellows was david ruhnken and these two with a third named kunde read their favourite authors together and laid their plans for the future all three proposing to devote themselves to classical literature ruhnken actually attained high distinction in this field at the age of sixteen kant passed to the university where he applied himself chiefly to mathematics and philosophy the instruction in his favourite subject the ancient classics being inadequate he had entered himself as a theological student and as was then the practice with such students in prussia he occasionally preached in the neighbouring churches indeed he had completed his theological course when he finally gave up that line of study no doubt his tastes had been long turning in a different direction but the immediate cause of his decision seems to have been the failure of his application for a subordinate post in a school such posts being usually the first step to ecclesiastical appointments during the latter part of his residence at the university he had been obliged to eke out his scanty means by giving instruction in classics mathematics and natural philosophy to some of his fellowstudents for whom the lectures of the professors were too difficult but the little that he could earn in this way was insufficient for his support when by his fathers death      he was thrown altogether on his own resources xvi he therefore sought and obtained employment as a resident tutor in families of distinction he was thus engaged for nine years and according to his own candid confession in later years there was hardly ever a tutor with a better theory or a worse practice however that may be he certainly gained the affection of his pupils and the respect of their parents at the beginning of this period he published his first work—an essay on the estimation of vis viva and towards the end of it his second—a brief discussion of the question whether the length of the day has undergone any change a question which had been proposed by the berlin academy as the subject for a prize essay kant argues that the tides must have the effect of retarding the earths rotation and he enters into a rough calculation of the amount of this retardation his first step to a conjectural approximation being an estimate of the effect of the impulse of the water on the whole east coast of the american continent his suggestion was sound   and sagacious but he overrated vastly the amount of the effect he inferred that the day had lengthened by about  ½s in two thousand years according to delaunay the actual amount of retardation is  s in  00000 years this result is based on historical facts the record of eclipses kants was a purely physical calculation and for this he did not xvii possess sufficient data on account of this inevitable lack of precision he did not offer his essay in competition for the prize the same essay contained another very remarkable suggestion in explanation of the fact that the moon always presents the same face to the earth in fact if the moon were originally in a fluid state the tides produced in it by the earth which would be very great would similarly retard its rotation until the fluid surface attained a position of equilibrium relatively to the earth i e until the moon rotated round its axis in the same time that it revolved round the earth this speculation has been recently brought forward as novel the conjecture as to the moons original fluidity was no isolated one in kants mind on the contrary he speaks of it as part of a general theory of the heavens which he was about to publish in the following year      accordingly he published anonymously an important work of about  00 pages entitled a general theory of the heavens or essay on the mechanical origin of the structure of the universe on the principles of newton this work is an elaborate exposition of the nebular theory commonly called by the name of laplace although laplaces système du monde was not published till forty years later      the only considerable differences are first that laplace supposes the condensation of the diffused matter to be the result of cooling and secondly that he postulates an original movement of rotation whereas kant thought he could account for both condensation and rotation from the two elementary forces of attraction and repulsion it is not easy to say whether laplace xviii was aware of kants priority he asserts indeed that he was not aware of any theory except buffons a rather extravagant one but then laplace never did acknowledge that he borrowed anything from anybody else even when he used the mathematical discoveries of contemporary frenchmen he introduces them as if they were his own how much more if he adopted a suggestion of an anonymous german philosopher if he really did calculate on the ignorance of his reader the event has justified his expectation for even those writers who mention kants priority speak as if kant had merely thrown out a hint while laplace had developed a theory whereas in fact kant wrote a treatise on the subject and laplace only a few pages   kant begins by defending his attempt against the possible objections of those who might regard it as an endeavour to dispense with the necessity for a divine author such persons he says appear to suppose that nature left to its own laws would produce only disorder and that the adaptations we admire indicate the interference of a compelling hand as if nature were a rebellious subject that could be reduced to order only by compulsion or else were an independent principle whose properties are uncaused and which god strives to reduce into the plan of his purposes but answers he if the general laws of matter are themselves a result of supreme wisdom must they not be fitted to carry out its wise design in fact xix we have here a powerful weapon in aid of theism when we trace certain beneficial effects to the regular working of the laws of nature we see that these effects are not produced by chance but that these laws can work in no other way but if the nature of things were independent and necessary what an astounding accident or rather what an impossibility would it not be that they should fit together just as a wise and good choice would have made them fit as this applies to such reasoning in general so it applies also to the present undertaking we shall find that matter had certain laws imposed on it by virtue of which it necessarily produced the finest combinations that there is a god is proved even by this that nature even in chaos could only proceed with regularity and order he proceeds to work out in detail the problem of the formation of the planets out of the originally diffused matter taking into consideration the eccentricities inclinations c of the planets the rings of saturn the satellites the comets it is noticeable that he does not like laplace regard the rings of saturn as an illustration of his theory on account of their large inclination to the ecliptic   ° he thought it necessary to assign to them a different origin his hypothesis was that they were produced by emanations from the planet itself and he showed further as laplace afterwards did that the ring must have a movement of rotation and that in consequence of the different velocities belonging to different distances from the planet its stability required that it should consist of several distinct rings this conjecture or rather deduction xx has been verified he also conjectured as a result of his hypothesis regarding the formation of the ring that the great velocity of rotation of particles of the inner ring would be the same as that of the planets equator from this consideration combined with the assumption that the ring conforms to keplers third law he deduced the time of the planets rotation he drew particular attention to this as the first prediction of the kind his deduction however has not been verified saturns time of rotation is nearly double what it ought to be on kants theory   another conjecture of his subsequently verified was that there are planets beyond saturn later he conjectured also the existence of a planet between mars and jupiter   kant then extends his view to the sidereal system he states that the first to suggest to him that the fixed stars constituted a system was wright of durham   kant develops this conception if gravitation is a xxi universal property of matter we cannot suppose the suns attractive force limited to our system but if it extends to the nearest fixed star and if the fixed stars like suns exercise a similar force around them then they would sooner or later fall together if not prevented like the planets by a centrifugal force hence we may conclude that all the stars of the firmament have their own orbital motion if we conceive our planetary system multiplied a thousandfold and the several bodies in it to be selfluminous the appearance as seen from the earth would resemble that of the milky way the form of the heaven of the fixed stars then is in great an effect of the same systematic arrangement as our system in little our sun with the other stars are in short the planets of a vaster system which is in fact the milky way   there may be many such systems and some of these may appear to us as nebulæ and these being seen obliquely would present an elliptic form the milky way seen from a sufficient distance would appear like one of these elliptic nebulæ but these systems again may be mutually related and constitute together a still more immeasurable system this opens to us a view into the infinite field of creation and gives us a conception of the work of god suitable to the infinity of the great creator if the magnitude of a planetary system in which the earth is as a grain of sand fills our understanding with wonder with what amazement are we seized when we consider the vast multitude of worlds and systems which constitute xxii the milky way and how is this amazement increased again when we learn that all these immeasurable star systems are in their turn only a unit in a number whose limit we know not and which is perhaps as inconceivably great as the former while it is itself the unit of a new combination   there is here a veritable abyss of immensity in which all human power of conception is lost the wisdom the goodness the power that are revealed are infinite and in the same degree fruitful and active the plan of its revelation must therefore be equally infinite he ventures upon the conjecture giving his reasons that nature may in course of time be again reduced to chaos and again emerge like a phœnix from its ashes when we contemplate nature in these successive changes carrying out the plan by which god reveals himself in wonders that fill space and eternity the mind is overwhelmed with astonishment but not satisfied with this vast yet perishable object the soul desires to know more nearly that being whose intelligence and whose greatness are the source of that light which spreads as from a centre over all nature with what awe must not the soul regard even its own nature when it reflects that it shall outlive all these changes o happy he exclaims when amid the tumult of the elements and the ruin of nature it is placed on a height from whence it can as it were see beneath its feet the desolation of all perishable things xxiii of the world reason could not even dare to wish for such happiness but revelation teaches us to hope for it with confidence when the fetters that have bound us to the vanity of the creature have fallen off the immortal spirit will find itself in the enjoyment of true happiness in communion with the infinite being the contemplation of the harmony of universal nature with the will of god must fill with everincreasing satisfaction the rational creature who finds himself united to this source of all perfection   viewed from this centre nature will show on all sides nothing but stability and fitness its changes cannot interfere with the happiness of a creature who has reached this height in sweet foretaste of this condition the soul can exercise its mouth in those songs of praise with which all eternity shall ring—   when nature fails and day and night   divide thy works no more   my evergrateful heart o lord   thy mercy shall adore   through all eternity to thee   a joyful song ill raise   for oh eternitys too short   to utter all thy praise     addison   discussing the question whether the planets are inhabited he states his opinion that it would be absurd to deny this as to all or even most of them but in the wealth of nature in which worlds and systems are to the whole creation only sundust there may well be xxiv waste and uninhabited places as there are uninhabited waste on our own earth perhaps indeed he adds some of the planets are not yet brought into a state fit for habitation it may take thousands of years to bring the matter of a great planet into a steady condition jupiter appears to be in this transition state one planet may come to its perfection thousands of years later than another   we may be sure that most of the planets are inhabited and those that are not will be so in due time he imagines that the further the planets are from the sun the more the inhabitants excel in liveliness and distinctness of thought indulging in fancy he asks does sin exist in those worlds and suggests that perhaps the beings in the inferior planets may be too low to be responsible those in the superior planets too wise and too elevated to fall into sin with the exception perhaps of mars perhaps he adds some of these bodies may be preparing for our future habitation who knows whether the satellites which revolve round jupiter are destined one day to illumine us no one however will base his hopes of the future on such uncertain fancies when corruption has claimed its part in human nature then shall the immortal spirit swiftly soar above all that is finite and continue its existence in a new relation to the whole of nature arising from its nearer relation to the supreme being when we gaze on the starry heavens with our mind filled with such thoughts as have here been expressed while all nature is at rest and our senses also in repose the hidden faculties of xxv the immortal soul speak in a language unutterable and give us conceptions which can be felt but not described if there are on this planet thinking beings so base as to bind themselves to the service of corruption in spite of all that draws them away from it how unhappy is this globe to produce such miserable creatures but how happy on the other hand that under conditions worthy of all acceptation a way is opened to them to attain to a happiness and a dignity infinitely beyond all the advantages which the most favourable arrangements of nature can reach in all the bodies of the universe the reader who is interested in kant himself will readily pardon this long notice of a work to which he attached some importance at its first publication it was dedicated to the king frederick the great and the theory developed in it is frequently referred to by kant in his subsequent writings   for he never ceased to take an interest in these subjects so late as      he wrote an essay on the volcanoes in the moon with reference to an observation of herschel in this paper he suggests a mode of accounting for the great heat of the sun and originally of the planets his suggestion is based on the discovery of crawford that heat is developed by condensation on the hypothesis then that the sun and planets were formed by the condensation of matter originally diffused through the whole xxvi space this heat would be a direct consequence of the condensation still later in      writing on the influence of the moon on the weather he throws out the suggestion that the moons centre of gravity may for reasons which he gives lie beyond its centre of figure   a consequence of which would be that any air and water which might be upon its surface would be collected at the side remote from us in another instance both kant and laplace might have had reason to say pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt in      kant wrote a short paper on the theory of the winds in which for the first time as he believed he gave the true account of the trade winds and monsoons halley had shown that the effect of the sun in heating the atmosphere at the equator would be to cause an indraught towards the equator from north and south this indraught according to him naturally followed the daily course of the sun and hence the easting   kant showed that this theory was untenable in fact the wind would tend rather to meet the sun the region to the west being the cooler nor could a wind from such a cause extend with nearly equal force all round the earth kant showed further that owing to the difference in the velocity of rotation between the parts near the equator and those near the poles all winds that move from the poles towards the equator tend to become more and more easterly and those that move from the equator towards the poles become more and more xxvii westerly   hence in the northern hemisphere every north wind tends to become a northeast and every south wind a southwest wind in the southern hemisphere on the contrary south winds tend to become southeast and north winds northwest he follows out in some detail the general principles of this circulation of the atmosphere we can thus explain for instance the monsoons of the indian ocean c which blow from april to september from the southwest for when the sun is north of the equator the wind blows from the equator towards these parts and therefore takes a southwesterly direction again the current from the poles towards the equator is balanced by a counter current the heated air in the upper strata at the equator overflowing as it were towards the poles when this descends or overcomes the weaker motion of the lower strata it becomes in the northern hemisphere a westerly wind such as prevail between the   th and  0th degrees of latitude kant subsequently introduced this theory into his course of lectures on physical geography which was very numerously attended laplace propounded the same theory forty years later xxviii in      kant published his essay on the only possible demonstrative proof of the existence of god the proof developed in this essay is founded on the principle that every possibility of existence presupposes an actually existing thing on which it depends this he characterizes as a more thoroughly à priori argument than any other that has been proposed since it does not assume any actual fact of existence i need not explain how he develops step by step the attributes of unity intelligence c at a later period he himself abandoned this line of argument however the greater part of the essay is occupied with remarks on design in the constitution of nature and with an exposition of the theory developed in the abovementioned treatise on the structure of the heavens we may he observes argue from design either as exhibited in a contingent arrangement for example in the body of an animal or in a plant or we may argue from the necessary results of the constitution of matter the laws of motion c the latter method has the great advantage of presenting the first cause not merely as an architect but as a creator from this point of view he instances first the simplicity and harmony resulting from the geometrical conditions of space e g that if we seek all the paths which a falling body would traverse either to or from the same point in the same time they are found to be chords of the same circle again he takes the manifold and harmonious benefits resulting by necessary laws from the mere fact of the existence of an atmosphere there may be many reasons for its existence if we suppose its primary purpose to be that it should serve for respiration we find that its existence leads to other xxix important beneficial results it makes clouds possible which intercept excessive heat prevents too rapid cooling and drying and keeps the land supplied with the necessary moisture from the great reservoir of the sea by causing twilight it prevents the strain on the eyes which would be caused by the sudden change from day to night its existence prevents rain from dropping with too great force and its pressure makes sucking possible if it occurs to anyone to say—oh these are all the necessary results of the nature of matter c he answers yes it is just this that shows that they proceed from a wise creator he treats of the laws of motion from the same point of view and then takes occasion to show how the laws of the planetary motions result from the simplest laws of matter attraction and repulsion in conclusion he remarks that while it is of the greatest consequence to be convinced of the existence of god it is by no means necessary to have a demonstration of it and those who cannot grasp the demonstrative proof are advised to hold fast by the more easily apprehended proof from design hardly indeed he observes would anyone stake his whole happiness on the correctness of a metaphysical proof especially if it were opposed to the convictions of sense the argument from design is more striking and vivid as well as easy to the common understanding and more natural than any other it also gives an idea of the wisdom and providence c of god which comes home and has the greatest effect in producing awe and humility and it is in fine more practical than any other even in the view of a philosopher it does not indeed give a definite abstract idea of xxx divinity nor does it claim mathematical certainty but so many proofs each of great force take possession of the soul and the speculation may calmly follow since conviction has preceded—a conviction far above the force of any subtile objections in the same year in which kant published his theory of the heavens he issued his first metaphysical treatise principiorum primorum cognitionis metaphysicœ nova dilucidatio and publicly defended it as an exercise prior to his obtaining permission to deliver lectures in the university as a privatdocent he forthwith commenced lecturing on mathematics and physics to these subjects he afterwards added lectures on philosophy natural theology physical geography anthropology and fortification he had already so great a reputation that at his first lecture the room in his own house was filled literally to overflowing the students crowding even on the stairs his lectures are thus described by the celebrated herder who attended them in the years          i have had the good fortune to know a philosopher who was my teacher he had the happy sprightliness of a youth and this i believe he retains even in old age his open thoughtful brow was the seat of unruffled calmness and joy discourse full of thought flowed from his lips jest and wit and humour were at his command and his lecture was the most entertaining conversation with the same genius with which he criticised leibnitz wolf crusius hume and expounded the laws of newton and kepler he would also take up the writings of rousseau or any recent discovery in nature give his estimate of them and come back again to the knowledge of nature and xxxi to the moral worth of man natural history natural philosophy the history of nations and human nature mathematics and experience—these were the sources from which he enlivened his lecture and his conversation nothing worth knowing was indifferent to him no party no sect no desire of fame or profit had the smallest charm for him compared with the advancement and elucidation of the truth he encouraged and urged to independent thought and was far from wishing to dominate this man whom i name with the greatest gratitude and reverence is immanuel kant his image stands pleasantly before me his lectures attracted many hearers of mature age and visitors to königsberg even prolonged their stay for the purpose of attending them at the same time he continued to act as tutor to young men specially entrusted to his care who lived with him he had to wait fifteen years in the position of privatdocent before obtaining a professorship he had indeed been offered a professorship by the government before this but it was almost the only chair which he felt he could not worthily fill—the chair of poetry this involved not only the censorship of new poems but the composition of poems for academic celebrations and kant declined the office in the following year he was appointed sublibrarian at the modest salary of    thalers this was his first official appointment œt    four years later he was nominated to the professorship of logic and metaphysics    with an income from all sources of xxxii  00 thalers this was ultimately increased to   0 this was of course exclusive of fees from students he inaugurated his professorship by defending his essay de mundi sensibilis atque intelligibilis forma et principiis in this he distinguishes the sensible apprehension of phenomena from the concept of the understanding just as in the critique of pure reason he shows precisely as in the latter work that space and time are forms of the intuitions of sense as professor he continued to lecture in the same wide circle of subjects as before the lectures on physical geography and anthropology were especially popular he was fond of studying nature but especially human nature in all its phases and took great pleasure in reading books of travel although he never travelled having an excellent memory and a lively power of imagination he could distinctly picture to himself even in minute detail the several objects described on one occasion he described westminster bridge its form dimensions c with such detail and distinctness that an englishman who was present thought he was an architect and had spent some years in london at another time he spoke of italy as if he had known it from long personal acquaintance so popular were his lectures that we find von zedlitz the prussian minister writing from berlin to say that he is reading with pleasure an imperfect manuscript report of the lectures on physical geography and requesting kant to favour him with a xxxiii correct copy these lectures were published in   0  the lectures on anthropology had appeared in      both works are written in an extremely interesting and popular style and those on anthropology are full of entertaining remarks and illustrative anecdotes not without humour thus speaking of the emotions that nature employs for the promotion of health which are chiefly laughing and weeping he remarks that anger also conduces to health if one can indulge in a good scolding without fear of opposition and in fact many a housewife gets no hearty exercise except in scolding her children and servants and provided these take it patiently a pleasant feeling of fatigue spreads itself through the organism this sort of exercise however he adds is not without danger as the objects of the scolding may possibly resist even when lecturing on metaphysics kant is said to have been lucid and interesting when the difficulty of his writings was complained of he used to say that he wrote for thinkers by profession and with these technical expressions had the advantage of brevity besides said he it flatters the vanity of the reader to find perplexities and obscurities here and there which he can solve by his own acuteness but in his lectures he endeavoured to be clear and intelligible he sought as he expressed it to teach not philosophy but to philosophize in one of his letters he states that he was unceasingly observant of phenomena and their laws even in common life so that from first to last his hearers should not have to listen to a dry exposition but be interested by being led to compare his remarks with their own observations it was his custom to keep his eyes fixed on some xxxiv particular student sitting near him perhaps in order to judge from the hearers countenance whether he was making himself understood so arago in his popular lectures used to select for the same purpose the most stupidlooking person in the audience continuing his explanations until the person fixed showed signs of intelligence with kant however the consequences were disastrous if the student happened to have any peculiarity or defect either in person or dress one day the student thus selected happened to have lost a button from his coat kants glance recurred to the vacant spot and during the whole lecture his thoughts were distracted and even confused in a manner inexplicable to those who were not in the secret he did not like to see his hearers taking notes but would say put up your pencils gentlemen and would not begin until they had done so the reason of this was that he thought such attempts at reporting interfered with their attention to the matter of the lecture by fixing it on the words some of his hearers took full notes nevertheless in      he formed the design of writing a critical examination of pure reason theoretical and practical the former part of which he hoped to complete in three months the months grew to years six years later he writes that he expects it to appear this summer and that it would not be a large volume it did not see the light however until      nine years after he had announced that it would be ready in three months when this masterwork was produced kant was fiftyseven years of age he states himself that it was hume that roused xxxv him from his dogmatic slumber and compelled him to seek a solid barrier against scepticism   it is stated on kants own authority that he did not commit to writing a single sentence in this work on which he had not first asked the judgment of his friend green a man to whom kant showed such deference deserves a brief notice he was an english merchant and during the american war of independence happened to be present when kant who sympathized with the americans denounced the conduct of england in strong terms green sprang up in a rage declared that kants words were a personal insult to him as an englishman and demanded satisfaction kant replied so calmly and persuasively that green shook hands with him and they became fast friends and continued so until the death of green in      a loss which kant deeply felt of the critique of pure reason i need not here speak suffice it to say that as lockes attempt to keep the mind from going beyond its tether was followed at no long interval by the idealism of berkeley and the annihilating scepticism of hume so kants analogous attempt led in a still shorter space to the most complete idealism and transcendentalism indeed his reviewers not unnaturally mistook him for an idealist and hamann called him the prussian hume xxxvi the work excited a lively controversy in the philosophical world but most of the publications to which it gave rise have been long forgotten kants fame however rose to the highest and königsberg became a shrine to which students and tourists made pilgrimages the critique of pure reason was to be followed by the metaphysical elements of natural philosophy and of moral philosophy the former appeared in      under the title metaphysische anfangsgründe der naturwissenschaft   the views respecting motion with which this treatise commences had however already been published as a programme of lectures in      motion is only relative to the surrounding space while i sit with a ball on the table before me in the cabin of a ship moored in a river i say that the ball is at rest i look out and see that the ship has been unmoored and is drifting westward the ball then is moving but i reflect that the earth is rotating with greater velocity eastward the ball then is moving eastward nay for the earth in its orbit is moving westward with still higher speed the orbit itself is moving i cannot tell how rapidly nor do i know in what direction in any case then it is the same thing whether i regard a point as moving in its space or regard the space as moving and the point as at rest hence the law of the composition of motions results directly for if a be a point having a motion of one foot per second westward and two feet per second southward i can regard it as having only the southward motion while the space in which it is is moving one foot per second eastward at the end therefore xxxvii of one second the point will be found two feet to the south and as its space in moving east has left it one foot behind it will also be one foot west relatively to its surrounding space this is the same as if it had moved in the diagonal of the parallelogram kant claimed as an advantage of this proof that it represented the resultant motion not as an effect of the two motions but as actually including them it is incomparably simpler and more philosophical than the proof given by dalembert and other contemporary mathematicians when we treat of collision of bodies this mode of viewing the matter becomes absolutely indispensable if the body a is approaching the body b equal to it with a velocity of two degrees we regard a as moving with a speed of one degree while b and its space move one degree in the opposite direction the motions being equal and opposite the result of their contact is mutual rest but as the space is moving this rest is equivalent to a motion of the two bodies in contact relative to the surrounding space and in amount one degree if the bodies are unequal and have unequal velocities we have only to divide the velocities in the inverse proportion of the masses and assign to the space the motion which we take from one to add to the other and the result will again be mutual rest which is equivalent to a motion of the bodies in contact with a velocity equal and opposite to what we have assigned to the space we can in this way banish altogether the notion of vis inertiœ matter could not exist unless there were both a repulsive force and an attractive force if attraction only existed matter would be condensed into a point xxxviii if repulsion only it would be dispersed infinitely the relative incompressibility of matter is nothing but the repulsive force emanating from points which increases as the distance diminishes perhaps inversely as the cube and would therefore require an infinite pressure to overcome it altogether physical contact is the immediate action and reaction of incompressibility the action of matter on matter without contact is what is called actio in distans and the attraction of gravitation is of this kind both attraction and repulsion being elementary forces are inexplicable but the force of attraction is not a whit more incomprehensible than the original repulsive force incompressibility appears more comprehensible solely because it is immediately presented to the senses whereas attraction is only inferred it seems at first sight a contradiction to say that a body can act where it is not but in fact we might rather say that everything in space acts where it is not for to act where it is it should occupy the very same space as the thing acted on to say that there can be no action without physical contact is as much as to say that matter can act only by the force of incompressibility in other words that repulsive forces are either the only forces of matter or the conditions of all its action which is a groundless assertion the ground of the mistake is a confusion between mathematical contact and physical contact that bodies attract one another without contact means that they approach one another according to a certain law without any force of repulsion being required as a condition and this is just as conceivable as that they should separate from xxxix one another without an attractive force being supposed as a condition   kant however thought it conceivable that in the case of chemical solution there might be complete interpenetration or intussusception on this view of matter we may he remarks regard matter as infinitely divisible the fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals had appeared the year before the lastmentioned work and was followed in      by the critical examination of practical reason both these are translated in the present volume the few remarks i have to offer on them will be found at the end of the memoir in    0 was published the critical examination of the faculty of judgment the essay on the corruption of human nature which forms the third part of this volume appeared in      in a berlin magazine four years before this an edict had been issued limiting the freedom of the press and appointing special censors whose xl business was to examine as to the orthodoxy not only of books but of professors lecturers and theological candidates the magazine in question was printed in jena but in order to avoid any appearance of underhand dealing kant expressly desired that his essay should be submitted to the berlin licensing authority who gave his imprimatur on the ground that only deep thinkers read kants works the second part of the work on the theory of religion was referred to the theological censor who refused his imprimatur kant accordingly submitted his essay to the censorship of the theological faculty of königsberg and this unanimously sanctioned the publication which reached a second edition in the following year the berlin censors were naturally annoyed at this way of escaping their decision and the severe remarks in the preface did not tend to conciliate them a few months afterwards kant received an order from the king frederick william ii forbidding him to teach or write anything further in this manner kant did not mention the order even to his intimate friends a slip of paper found after his death contained this reflection to deny ones inner conviction is mean but in such a case as this silence is the duty of a subject and although a man must say only what is true it is not always a duty to say all the truth publicly he therefore in his reply to the king declared that to avoid all suspicion he as his majestys most loyal subject solemnly engaged to refrain from writing or lecturing on religion natural or revealed the words as your majestys most loyal subject were inserted with the intention of limiting his engagement to the life of xli the king and on the death of frederick william in      kant regarded himself as free and published his contest of the faculties i e of the academical faculties in      kant ceased to lecture publicly in the same year he published his metaphysical elements of morals which treats of the several virtues and vices in detail   and metaphysical elements of law after the publication of these he seems to have been regarded as a counsellor to be consulted in all difficulties and an authority in all questions of conscience the pains he took to give real assistance in such cases both by his own reflection and by inquiring from his colleagues are attested by his written and often corrected memoranda as an example may be mentioned the question whether inoculation was morally allowable or not this question was addressed to him at the same time by a professor of medicine in halle and by a young nobleman who was going to be married and whose bride wished to be inoculated kants reply is not known although some memoranda for it exist after this time he began to feel the burden of age and his powers mental and bodily gradually failed he was quite aware of his condition and resigned gentlemen said he one day i do not fear to die i assure you as in the presence of god that if on this very night suddenly the summons to death were to reach me i should bear it with calmness should raise my hands to heaven and say blessed be god were it indeed possible that such a whisper as this xlii could reach my ear—fourscore years thou hast lived in which time thou hast inflicted much evil upon thy fellowmen the case would be otherwise this was spoken says wasianski in a tone of earnest sincerity two days after his seventyninth birthday he wrote in his memoranda according to the bible our life lasts seventy years and if very long fourscore years and though it was pleasant it has been labour and sorrow   up to this time he was able to read the smallest print without spectacles although he had lost the sight of one eye nearly twenty years before but soon after he had written this memorandum his sight also failed and he died in february   0  in his eightieth year his body was so dried up that the physicians said they had hardly ever seen so wasted a body indeed he had himself said jestingly some years before that he thought he had reached the minimum of muscular substance   kant was of weak frame and still weaker muscular power he was barely five feet in height   his chest was flat almost concave the right shoulder slightly crooked his complexion fresh his forehead high square and broad while his piercing blue eyes made so lively an impression that it was long remembered by some of his pupils even after he had lost the sight of one eye the defect was not visible to a stranger in consequence of his contracted chest he suffered from a feeling of oppression which early in life caused a tendency to hypochondria to such an xliii extent as even to make him feel weary of life this however he overcame by force of thought when engaged on the kritik in      he speaks of his health being seriously impaired and some years later he says that it is unceasingly broken yet by dint of careful attention and great regularity he was able without medical aid to maintain such good health on the whole that at a later period he used to say to himself on going to bed is it possible to conceive any human being enjoying better health than i do his maxim for preserving health was sustine et abstine his practice illustrated this the two indulgences of which he was found were tobacco and coffee but of the former he limited himself to a single pipe in the morning whilst he altogether abstained from the latter until far advanced in life thinking it injurious to health at the age of seventy he wrote an essay on the power of the mind to master the feeling of illness by force of resolution   the essay was originally addressed to hufeland the celebrated author of the treatise on the art of prolonging life and the principles contained in it are exemplified from kants own experience he attached great importance to the habit of breathing through the nostrils instead of through the mouth and asserted that he had by this means overcome a tendency to cough and cold in the head there is more truth in this than is perhaps generally thought   kant however is said to have xliv regarded it as of so much importance that he did not like to have a companion in his daily walk lest he should have to open his mouth the true reason of this preference in later life only for solitary walks was beyond doubt that which is mentioned in this essay that it is undesirable to exercise the limbs and the brain or the brain and the stomach at the same time his punctilious attention to health is amusingly illustrated by the artifice he used for suspending his stockings thinking that garters injuriously impeded the circulation he had a couple of bands attached to each stocking and passing through a hole in the pocket of his breeches inside the pocket they were connected with a spring enclosed in a box and this spring regulated the tension that he might not be without some exercise in his study he habitually left his handkerchief at the other side of the room so that now and then he should have to get up and walk to it on the same principle his hours of sleep c were adhered to with the utmost regularity he went to bed punctually at ten and rose punctually at five his servant had orders not to let him sleep longer on any account and on being asked once by kant in presence of guests testified that for thirty years his master had never once indulged beyond the appointed hour on rising he took a cup indefinite cups of tea but no solid food the early hours were devoted to preparation for his lectures which in his earlier years occupied four or five hours but subsequently only two at seven oclock precisely or eight as the case might be he entered his lectureroom lectures ended at nine or ten he returned to his study and applied himself to preparing his books for the press xlv he worked thus without interruption until one oclock the hour for dinner this was his only meal and he liked to have pleasant company and to prolong the meal ducere cœnam with lively sometimes brilliant conversation for three or four hours kant had no boswell and nothing is preserved of these conversations in which he is said to have often thrown out profound and suggestive remarks with extraordinary richness   until his sixtythird year not having a house of his own he dined at a public restaurant which however he occasionally found it necessary to change in consequence of persons coming for the purpose of discussing philosophical questions with him he considered that mealtime ought to be a time of perfect mental relaxation and was not disposed to turn the dinner table into a lecture pulpit his afternoons were however often spent at the houses of his friends where he enjoyed meeting foreign merchants sea captains and travelled scholars from whom he might learn much about foreign nations and countries his instructive and entertaining conversation flavoured with mild satiric humour made him a welcome guest and even with the children he was a favourite after he became famous he declined invitations if he thought he was to be made a lion of xlvi when he had a house of his own he had every day a few friends to dine with him he liked to have a mixed company—merchants professional men and especially a few younger men after dinner followed regularly his daily walk for an hour or more along what was from him named the philosophers walk until he was driven from it by the number of beggars whom his habit of almsgiving had attracted there   even the severest weather did not interfere with this daily walk in which in his earlier years he usually had companions after sixty years of age he walked alone for the reason already mentioned he had on one occasion a narrow escape from assassination a lunatic who had made up his mind to kill some one waylaid kant for the purpose and followed him for three miles but on reflection thinking it a pity to kill an old professor who must have so many sins on his head the unfortunate madman killed a child instead the evening was devoted to lighter reading and meditation he would read over and over again such books as don quixote hudibras swifts tale of a tub juvenal and horace in his later years he was especially fond of reading books on physical science and books of travel purely speculative works he cared little for but liked to read locke hutcheson pope hume montaigne rousseau how unwilling kant was to depart from his regular routine appears from a characteristic anecdote one day as he was returning from his walk a nobleman xlvii who was driving came up with him and politely invited him to take a drive with him as the evening was fine kant yielded to the first impulse of politeness and consented the count after driving over some of his property near the city proposed to visit a friend some miles from the town and kant of course could not refuse at last kant was set down at his own door near ten oclock full of vexation at this violation of his regular habits he thereupon made it a fixed rule never to get into a carriage that he had not hired himself so that he could manage it as he pleased when once he had made such a resolution he was satisfied that he could not be taken by surprise and nothing would make him depart from it so his life passed says one of his biographers like the most regular of regular verbs punctual however as he was his punctuality did not come up to the standard of his friend green one evening kant had promised that he would accompany green in a drive the next morning at eight at a quarter before eight green was walking up and down his room watch in hand at fifty minutes past seven he put on his coat at fiftyfive he took his stick and at the first stroke of eight entered his carriage and drove off and although he met kant who was a couple of minutes late he would not stop for him because this was against the agreement and against his rule this gentleman for whom kant had a great esteem served as the model for the description of the english character in the anthropologie kants savings were invested with this mr green and allowed to accumulate at   per cent interest kant is said to have been on two occasions on the xlviii point of marrying or at least of making a proposal but he took so long to calculate his incomings and outgoings with exactness in order to see whether he could afford it that the lady in the first case was married and in the second had left königsberg before he had made up his mind when he was seventy years of age an officious friend actually printed a dialogue on marriage with a view to persuade the philosopher to marry kant reimbursed him for the expense of printing but at that age not unnaturally thought the advice rather too late how sensible he was to the charms of female society appears from the essay on the sublime and beautiful p     ff where he discusses the difference between the sublime and beautiful in the natural relations of the sexes kants personal character is described by those who knew him best as truly childlike he was kindhearted and actively benevolent of rare candour in estimating the abilities of other men with high respect for every thing that was noble or deserving always disposed to recognise the good rather than the bad in mens characters he was always ready with counsel and assistance for the young his modesty towards scholars of great fame almost degenerated into shyness as may be supposed from the regularity of his habits he never allowed himself to run into debt when a student at the university with very narrow means his only coat had once become so shabby that some friends subscribed a sum of money which was offered to him in the most delicate manner possible for the purchase of a new one kant however preferred to retain his shabby coat rather than incur debt xlix or lose his independence   in his old age he boasted that he had never owed any man a penny so that when a knock came to his door he was never afraid to say come in when his means had increased chiefly through the profits on his writings he assisted such of his relatives as were in want in the most liberal manner on the death of his brother he assigned to the widow a pension of  00 thalers many poor persons also received a weekly allowance from him and wasianski who in later years managed kants affairs for him states that his charitable expenses amounted to about  00 thalers annually his kindness was shown in his last will in which he left an annual sum to a servant who had treated him shamefully but who had served him not indeed faithfully for thirty years kant had dismissed him two years before with a pension on condition of his never setting foot inside the house again after some other small legacies the residue was left to the children of his brother and sisters the whole amount was under four thousand pounds the principal questions on the theory of morals may with sufficient accuracy for the present purpose be said to be these first the purely speculative question what is the essential nature of moral rightness secondly the practical questions what is to man the criterion of his duty and what is the foundation of obligation the additional question by what faculty do we discern right and wrong is properly a psychological one l if we had only to do with a being in whom reason was irresistibly dominant we should not need to raise any further questions but having to treat of a being with affections and appetites distinct from reason and not of themselves dependent on it we must answer the further question how is reason to maintain its authority in spite of these resisting forces ie what is the motive lastly since we have to deal with a corrupt creature a new question arises how is such a creature to be reformed now how does kant deal with these questions his categorical imperative—act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature—gives perhaps not the essence of virtue but a property of it which may indeed serve as a subjective criterion that this criterion is formal only and therefore empty is hardly of itself a valid objection the test of valid reasoning the syllogism is equally empty the categorical imperative is however rather negative than positive and it is far from being sufficiently clear as a test of the morality of actions this appears even in the examples which kant himself gives for example treating of compassion he supposes that if a man refuses aid to the distressed it is out of selfishness and then shows that if selfishness was the ruling principle it would contradict itself but why assume a motive for refusing help what we want is a motive for giving help there is nothing contradictory in willing that none should help others so in the case of gratitude there is no contradiction in willing that those who receive benefits should entertain no peculiar feeling toward their benefactor it is true we should look li for it ourselves but this implies that such a feeling is natural to man and that we approve it again put the case of selfsacrifice of a man giving his life to save his friend it would seem as easy on kants principle to prove this a vice as a virtue kant has in fact treated human nature too abstractly in eliminating the matter he has eliminated that on which frequently the whole question turns indeed in some of the instances he himself chooses he elicits a contradiction only by bringing in a teleological consideration e g as to suicide he brings in the end for which selflove was given the will to destroy ones own life is not contradictory of the will to sustain it unless the circumstances be supposed the same these remarks however only show that the formula is not a mechanical rule of conduct they do not disprove its scientific value in fact precisely similar objections have been alleged against the logical analysis of speculative reasoning that it leaves untouched what in practice is the most difficult part of the problem if all poisonous substances could be brought under a single chemical formula the generalization would be of value both theoretically and practically although its application to particular cases might be difficult and uncertain kant never attempted to deduce a complete code of duty from a purely formal principle   he expressly states that lii this is only a negative principle and that the matter of practical maxims is to be derived from a different source cf the present work p     nor is it to be supposed that kant was not fully aware of the difficulty of applying his formula to the complex circumstances of actual life in his metaphysic of morals he states a great number of questions of casuistry which he leaves undecided as puzzles or exercises to the reader and indeed similar difficulties might be raised from a speculative point of view respecting the rule whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you even so do unto them—a rule of which we may nevertheless say that in practice it probably never misled anyone for everyone sees that the essence of it is the elimination of selfpartiality and inward dishonesty the scientific basis of it is stated by clarke in language nearly equivalent to kants the reason of it says the former is the same as that which forces us in speculation to affirm that if one line or number be equal to another that other is equal to it whatever relation or proportion one man in any case bears to another the same that other when put in like circumstances bears to him whatever i judge reasonable or unreasonable for another to do for me that by the same judgment i declare reasonable or unreasonable that i in the like case should do for him   kants rule is a generalization of this so as to include duties to ourselves as well as to others as such it has a real scientific value practically its value liii consists like that of the golden rule in the elimination of inward dishonesty mr mills criticism on kants formula is that when we speak of a maxim being fit to be a universal law it is obvious that some test of fitness is required and that kant in fact tests the maxims by their consequences as if the whole gist of kants argument were not that the only test of this fitness is logical possibility or as if this were not the one thing expressed in his formula as to testing maxims by consequences he does so in the same sense in which euclid in indirect demonstrations tests a hypothesis by its consequences and in no other i e by the logical consequences not the practical take the case of a promise in kants view the argument against the law permitting unfaithfulness is not that it would be attended with consequences injurious to society but that it would annihilate all promises the present included and therefore annihilate itself of inconvenience to society not a word is said or implied hence kants objection rests wholly on the absolute universality of the supposed law whereas the utilitarian objection from practical consequences would be applicable in a proportionate degree to a law not supposed universal hence also kants test would hold even if the present promise were never to be followed by another nay it would be of equal force even though it should be proved that it would be better for society that there should be no verbal promises it has been said   that in applying kants formula liv we must qualify it by introducing the consideration of the probability that our example or rule will be generally followed and the instance of celibacy has been suggested which it is said would be necessarily condemned as a crime if tested by kants rule pure and simple for if all men practised celibacy there would be an end of the race and on the greatest happiness principle to effect this would be the worst of crimes now if a qualification were required or admissible kants formula would be deprived of all scientific significance and its application made dependent on private and uncertain opinion as to the example of celibacy kant has himself indicated how he would dispose of it by the way in which he treats suicide he does not show its unlawfulness by alleging that if everyone committed suicide the human race would come to an end but by exposing the inconsistency in the principle of action which would lead to suicide in every case it is the mental principle which is to be tested not the mere external action bearing this in mind we shall find no difficulty in the case of celibacy it may proceed from motives which there would be no absurdity in supposing universal because the circumstances which give them this particular direction could only be exceptional but suppose celibacy recommended on grounds which are in their own nature universal eg as a condition of moral perfection then kants formula would properly lv apply for moral perfection is an end to be aimed at by all one might just as well say that kants rule would make all killing criminal whereas kant would obviously require us to take into account the motive selfdefence or other on the other hand apply mr sidgwicks qualification and what would result why that we might innocently kill provided the action were not likely to be generally imitated if occasional celibacy is justified only because there exists a natural passion which is sure to be usually powerful enough to prevent the example being followed then we may equally justify occasional violence or murder on the ground that fear or benevolence will naturally prevent the action from being extensively imitated kants view of the source of obligation in the autonomy of the will appears to require qualification if we would avoid a contradiction a law must be above the nature to which it is a law and which is subject to it a being which gave itself the moral law and whose freedom therefore is autonomy would not be conscious of obligation or duty since the moral law would coincide with its will kant draws the apparently selfcontradictory conclusion that we though willing the law yet resist it even if this be granted it would follow not that we should feel obliged but that either no action at all would follow or the more powerful side would prevail that we condemn ourselves when we have violated the law is an important fact on which kant very strongly insists but which his theory fails to explain is it not a far simpler and truer explanation to say that this selfcondemnation this humiliation in the presence of an unbending judge is a proof that we have not given ourselves the law lvi that we are subjects of a higher power   there is indeed a sense in which autonomy may be truly vindicated to man the moral law is not a mere precept imposed upon us from without nor is it forced upon us by our sensitive nature it is a law prescribed to us or more correctly speaking revealed to us by our own reason but reason is not our own in the sense in which our appetites or sensations are our own it is not under our own control it bears the stamp of universality and authority thus it declares itself impersonal in other words what reason reveals we regard as valid for all beings possessed of intelligence equal or superior to our own hence many ethical writers both ancient and modern have insisted as strongly as kant that the moral law is common to man with all rational creatures   and when kant speaks of autonomy this is all that his argument requires accordingly he sometimes speaks of rational creatures as the subjects of reason which is the supreme legislator as regards the sanctions of the moral law which practically to imperfect creatures furnish the motive these consist according to kant in the happiness and misery which are the natural consequences of virtue lvii and vice and he thinks that when they are regarded as natural consequences the dread of the misery will have more effect than if it were thought to be an arbitrary punishment the view into an illimitable future of happiness or misery is sufficient to serve as a motive to the virtuous to continue steadfast in welldoing and to arouse in the vicious the condemning voice of conscience to check his evil course   in this kant agrees with cumberland kants argument for immortality is in substance that it is necessary for a continued indefinite approximation to the ideal of the moral law but since as he maintains we have ourselves to blame for not having attained this ideal what right have we to expect such an opportunity having missed the true moment in his argument which led to the existence of a supreme lawgiver he arrived at this fundamental truth by a roundabout way through the conception of the summum bonum but this introduces a quite heterogeneous notion viz that of happiness happiness belongs to a man as a sensible creature and all that he has a right to say is that if practical reason had happiness to confer it would confer it on virtue how much more direct and convincing is the argument suggested by butlers brief words consciousness of a rule or guide of action in creatures who are capable of considering it as given them by their maker not only raises immediately a sense of duty but also a sense of security in following it and of danger in deviating from it a direction of the author of nature given to creatures capable of looking upon it as such is plainly a command from lviii him and a command from him necessarily includes in it at least an implicit promise in case of obedience or threatening in case of disobedience and since his method of government is to reward and punish actions his having annexed to some actions an inseparable sense of good desert and to others of ill this surely amounts to declaring upon whom his punishments shall be inflicted and his rewards bestowed kant sees no mode of reconciling morality with the law of causality except by his distinction of noumena and phenomena when the law of causality is rightly understood there is no inconsistency for the cause which it demands is an efficient cause and the idea of an efficient cause involves the idea of mind   it is involved in the idea of matter that it cannot originate this kant himself adopts as a first principle in his metaphysics of natural philosophy whereas it is the very idea of mind with will that it does originate lix when we seek the cause of motion we are satisfied when we trace it to a will true we may then ask for the motive but the nature of motive and that of efficient cause are heterogeneous kants view of freedom however does not involve anything of caprice or indeterminateness freedom according to him is not independence on law which we can consciously follow but independence on the physical relation of causality the not being determined by physical or sensible causes on this view the contradiction which to hobbes and others seemed to exist between the conception of freedom and that of the divine foreknowledge would have little weight a short consideration suffices to show that there is a fallacy involved in hobbes argument suppose a being perfectly wise and good and at the same time free then we should only require perfect knowledge of the circumstances of a particular case in order to predict his conduct and that infallibly if he were not free we could not do so and the more nearly a being approaches such perfection the more certainly could we predict his actions if his goodness were perfect but his knowledge imperfect and if we knew how far his knowledge extended we could still predict it would be absurd to say that this would be a contradiction it is worthy of notice that cudworths conception of liberty corresponds closely with that of kant the true liberty of a man as it speaks pure perfection is when by the right use of the faculty of free will together with the assistance of divine grace he is habitually fixed in moral good but when by the abuse of that faculty of free will men come to be lx habitually fixed in evil and sinful inclinations then are they as boëthius well expresses it propriæ libertati captivi—made captive and brought into bondage by their own free will it may have been suggested to both of them by st paul who represents sin as slavery righteousness as freedom kant is by no means happy in his treatment of the corruption of human nature in order to escape the difficulty of reconciling responsibility with the innate corruption on which he so strongly dwells he has recourse as in the case of freedom to the distinction between man noumenon and man phenomenon the innate evil of human nature rests on an inversion of the natural order the legislative will being subordinated to the sensibility but how can this be reconciled with the selfgiven and therefore selfwilled law which makes good a duty it is inconceivable that the pure supersensible essence could invest the sensational nature the objects of which have for it no reality with a preponderance over itself a further contradiction appears to be involved in the relation of evil to freedom for he states that freedom is as inseparably connected with the law of practical reason as the physical cause with the law of nature so that freedom without the law of practical reason is a causality without law which would be absurd and yet on the other hand he regards freedom as an ability from which proceeds contradiction to the moral law a still more insuperable difficulty meets him when he attempts to answer the question is reformation possible he replies yes for it is a duty you ought therefore you can how the return from evil lxi to good is possible cannot indeed be comprehended but the original fall from good to evil is equally incomprehensible and yet is a fact now freedom which belongs to the supersensible sphere the sphere of noumena cannot be determined by anything in the phenomenal world consequently if freedom has apart from time given the man a determination then no event in time can produce a change nay it would be a contradiction to suppose the removal of an act in the noumenal supersensible world by a succeeding act contrary or contradictory attributes cannot be attributed to the same subject except under the condition of time if therefore the intelligent being is timeless we cannot possibly attribute to it two decisions of which one annuls the other he is not even consistent for he argues that it is not possible to destroy this radical corruption by human power but only to overcome it why does he not conclude here i ought to destroy it therefore i can lastly even if this i can were granted it would be only a theoretical not a practical possibility if the man endowed with the faculties in their true subordination with reason supreme has yet not had strength or purity of will to remain so what practical possibility is there that having this subordination perverted he can restore it there is obviously an external aid necessary here not that anything wholly external could effect the change which can only be produced by something operating on mans own moral nature but there must be a moral leverage an external fulcrum a πονˆ στωˆ such aid such leverage are provided by the christian religion it has introduced a new motive perfectly original and lxii unique the overpowering force of which has been proved in many crucial instances and no more complete theoretical proof of the absolute necessity of some such revelation could be given than is supplied by the attempts of the profoundest philosopher of modern times to dispense with it kants own position with respect to christianity is that of a rationalist he accepts the whole moral and spiritual teaching of the new testament because he finds it in accordance with reason and this being so he judges that it is a matter of no practical consequence whether its introduction was supernatural or not he did not deny that divine aid was required to make reformation possible but he thought that no intellectual belief or knowledge of ours could be a condition of this aid and therefore that all historical questions were adiaphora but this is to take for granted that if god gives such aid at all it must be in a particular way butlers argument from analogy is conclusive against such assumptions and indeed it is certain that the moral and the positive in christianity cannot be thus kept apart it is to the facts that the doctrines owe their life and motive power it is these that supply the leverage without which the most perfect moral teaching will fall dead on the ears at least of the masses of mankind besides as butler shows revealed facts may be the foundation of moral duties to those to whom the revelation has come it is remarkable that although kant was fond of reading english authors and was influenced in his moral discussions by english moralists butler who had written half a century before the publication of lxiii the kritik was wholly unknown to him what is more remarkable is that butler has remained equally unknown to german writers up to the present day whilst german historians of moral philosophy are careful to note the merits of even wollaston and ferguson they pass over butlers name in silence the reason of this silence doubtless is to be found in the title of his work but although foreign philosophers could not be expected to look for a treatise on moral philosophy in a book called fifteen sermons how is it that attention was not called to him by the notices in mackintosh who is largely cited e g by i h fichte which showed the high estimation in which the work was held in england it is certainly a curious and suggestive fact that writers professedly and learnedly treating of english moral philosophers should be wholly ignorant of the writer who holds by far the highest rank among them whose work is the classical work the textbook of the universities and with a wider circulation probably than the works of all the other moralists put together the most striking peculiarity of kants moral theory is its connexion with his metaphysical system it is in the moral law that he finds the means of establishing the existence and to some extent the nature of the supersensible reality he has been charged with inconsistency in this what he pulls down in the critique of the speculative reason he restores illogically it is said in that of the practical reason the fact appears to be that readers of the former work are apt to fall into two mistakes first they suppose that they have before them a complete system instead of a portion only and secondly they mistake lxiv the attitude of suspense with regard to the supersensible reality for a dogmatic negation of all knowledge thereof when they come to the practical works they find the impression thus formed respecting kants attitude towards the supersensible contradicted but the inconsistency is not between the two parts of kants system but between his system as a whole and the impression derived from a partial view of it that he limits his affirmation of the supersensible to its practical aspect is quite in accordance with the spirit of his philosophy nor is this limitation so very unlike that of the commonsense philosopher locke who in speaking of the limits of our faculties says that men have reason to be well satisfied since god hath given them whatever is necessary for the conveniences of life and the information of virtue adding how short soever their knowledge may come of an universal or perfect comprehension of whatsoever is it yet secures their great concernments that they have light enough to lead them to the knowledge of their maker and the sight of their own duties essay bk   ch i §     fundamental principles of the metaphysics of morals preface ancient greek philosophy was divided into three sciences physics ethics and logic this division is perfectly suitable to the nature of the thing and the only improvement that can be made in it is to add the principle on which it is based so that we may both satisfy ourselves of its completeness and also be able to determine correctly the necessary subdivisions all rational knowledge is either material or formal the former considers some object the latter is concerned only with the form of the understanding and of the reason itself and with the universal laws of thought in general without distinction of its objects formal philosophy is called logic material philosophy however which has to do with determinate objects and the laws to which they are subject is again twofold for these laws are either laws of nature or of freedom the science of the former is physics that of the latter ethics they are also called natural philosophy and moral philosophy respectively logic cannot have any empirical part that is a part in which the universal and necessary laws of thought should rest on grounds taken from experience otherwise it would not be logic ie a canon for the understanding or the reason valid for all thought and capable of demonstration   natural and   moral philosophy on the contrary can each have their empirical part since the former has to determine the laws of nature as an object of experience the latter the laws of the human will so far as it is affected by nature the former however being laws according to which everything does happen the latter laws according to which everything ought to happen   ethics however must also consider the conditions under which what ought to happen frequently does not we may call all philosophy empirical so far as it is based on grounds of experience on the other hand that which delivers its doctrines from à priori principles alone we may call pure philosophy when the latter is merely formal it is logic if it is restricted to definite objects of the understanding it is metaphysic in this way there arises the idea of a twofold metaphysic—a metaphysic of nature and a metaphysic of morals physics will thus have an empirical and also a rational part it is the same with ethics but here the empirical part might have the special name of practical anthropology the name morality being appropriated to the rational part all trades arts and handiworks have gained by division of labour namely when instead of one man doing everything each confines himself to a certain kind of work distinct from others in the treatment it requires so as to be able to perform it with greater facility and in the greatest perfection where the different kinds of work are not so distinguished and divided where everyone is a jackofalltrades there manufactures remain still in the greatest barbarism it might deserve to be considered   whether pure philosophy in all its parts does not require a man specially devoted to it and whether it would not be better for the whole business of science if those who to please the tastes of the public are wont to blend the rational and empirical elements together mixed in all sorts of proportions unknown to themselves   and who call themselves independent thinkers giving the name of minute philosophers to those who apply themselves to the rational part only—if these i say were warned not to carry on two employments together which differ widely in the treatment they demand for each of which perhaps a special talent is required and the combination of which in one person only produces bunglers but i only ask here whether the nature of science does not require that we should always carefully separate the empirical from the rational part and prefix to physics proper or empirical physics a metaphysic of nature and to practical anthropology a metaphysic of morals which must be carefully cleared of everything empirical so that we may know how much can be accomplished by pure reason in both cases and from what sources it draws this its à priori teaching and that whether the latter inquiry is conducted by all moralists whose name is legion or only by some who feel a calling thereto as my concern here is with moral philosophy i limit the question suggested to this whether it is not of the utmost necessity to construct a pure moral philosophy perfectly cleared of everything which is only empirical and which belongs to anthropology for that such a philosophy must be possible is evident from the common idea of duty and of the moral laws everyone must admit that if a law is to have moral force i e to be the basis of an obligation it must carry with it absolute necessity that for example the precept thou shalt not lie   is not valid for men alone as if other rational beings had no need to observe it and so with all the other moral laws properly so called that therefore the basis of obligation must not be sought in the nature of man or in the circumstances in the world in which he is placed but à priori simply in the conceptions of   pure reason and although any other precept which is founded on principles of mere experience may be in certain respects universal yet in as far as it rests even in the least degree on an empirical basis perhaps only as to a motive such a precept while it may be a practical rule can never be called a moral law thus not only are moral laws with their principles essentially distinguished from every other kind of practical knowledge in which there is anything empirical but all moral philosophy rests wholly on its pure part when applied to man it does not borrow the least thing from the knowledge of man himself anthropology but gives laws à priori to him as a rational being no doubt these laws require a judgment sharpened by experience in order on the one hand to distinguish in what cases they are applicable and on the other to procure for them access to the will of the man and effectual influence on conduct since man is acted on by so many inclinations that though capable of the idea of a practical pure reason he is not so easily able to make it effective in concreto in his life a metaphysic of morals is therefore indispensably necessary not merely for speculative reasons in order to investigate the sources of the practical principles which are to be found à priori in our reason but also because morals themselves are liable to all sorts of corruption as long as we are without that clue and supreme canon by which to estimate them correctly for in order that an action should be morally good it is not enough   that it conform to the moral law but it must also be done for the sake of the law otherwise that conformity is only very contingent and uncertain since a principle which is not moral although it may now and then produce actions conformable to the law will also often produce actions which contradict it   now it is only in a pure philosophy that we can look for the moral law in its purity and genuineness and in a practical matter this is of the utmost consequence we must therefore begin with pure philosophy metaphysic and without it there cannot be any moral philosophy at all that which mingles these pure principles with the empirical does not deserve the name of philosophy for what distinguishes philosophy from common rational knowledge is that it treats in separate sciences what the latter only comprehends confusedly much less does it deserve that of moral philosophy since by this confusion it even spoils the purity of morals themselves and counteracts its own end let it not be thought however that what is here demanded is already extant in the propædeutic prefixed by the celebrated wolf   to his moral philosophy namely his socalled general practical philosophy and that therefore we have not to strike into an entirely new field just because it was to be a general practical philosophy it has not taken into consideration a will of any particular kind—say one which should be determined solely from à priori principles without any empirical motives and which we might call a pure will but volition in general with all the actions and conditions which belong to it in this   general signification by this it is distinguished from a metaphysic of morals just as general logic which treats of the acts and canons of thought in general is distinguished from transcendental philosophy which treats of the particular acts and canons of pure thought ie that whose cognitions are altogether à priori for the metaphysic of morals has to examine the idea and the principles of a possible pure will and not the acts and conditions of human volition generally which for the most part are drawn from psychology   it is true that moral laws and duty are spoken of in the general practical philosophy contrary indeed to all fitness but this is no objection for in this respect also the authors of that science remain true to their idea of it they do not distinguish the motives which are prescribed as such by reason alone altogether à priori and which are properly moral from the empirical motives which the understanding raises to general conceptions merely by comparison of experiences but without noticing the difference of their sources and looking on them all as homogeneous they consider only their greater or less amount it is in this way they frame their notion of obligation which though anything but moral is all that can be asked for in a philosophy which passes no judgment at all on the origin of all possible practical concepts whether they are à priori or only à posteriori intending to publish hereafter a metaphysic of morals i issue in the first instance these fundamental principles indeed there is properly no other foundation for it than the critical examination of a pure practical reason just as that of metaphysics is the critical examination of the pure speculative reason already published but in the first place the former is not so absolutely necessary as the latter because in moral concerns human reason can easily be brought to a high degree of correctness   and completeness even in the commonest understanding while on the contrary in its theoretic but pure use it is wholly dialectical and in the second place if the critique of a pure practical reason is to be complete it must be possible at the same time to show its identity with the speculative reason in a common principle for it can ultimately be only one and the same reason which has to be distinguished merely in its application i could not however bring it to such completeness here without introducing considerations of a wholly different kind which would be perplexing to the reader   on this account i have adopted the title of fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals instead of that of a critical examination of the pure practical reason but in the third place since a metaphysic of morals in spite of the discouraging title is yet capable of being presented in a popular form and one adapted to the common understanding i find it useful to separate from it this preliminary treatise on its fundamental principles in order that i may not hereafter have need to introduce these necessarily subtle discussions into a book of a more simple character the present treatise is however nothing more than the investigation and establishment of the supreme principle of morality and this alone constitutes a study complete in itself and one which ought to be kept apart from every other moral investigation no doubt my conclusions on this weighty question which has hitherto been very unsatisfactorily examined would receive much light from the application of the same principle to the whole system and would be greatly confirmed by the adequacy which it exhibits throughout but i must forego this advantage which indeed would be after all more gratifying than useful since the easy applicability of a principle and its apparent   adequacy give no very certain proof of its soundness but rather inspire a certain partiality which prevents us from examining and estimating it strictly in itself and without regard to consequences i have adopted in this work the method which i think most suitable proceeding analytically from common knowledge to the determination of its ultimate principle and again descending synthetically from the examination of this principle and its sources to the common knowledge in which we find it employed the division will therefore be as follows  0—     first section—transition from the common rational knowledge of morality to the philosophical     second section—transition from popular moral philosophy to the metaphysic of morals     third section—final step from the metaphysic of morals to the critique of the pure practical reason   first section transition from the common rational knowledge of morality to the philosophical nothing can possibly be conceived in the world or even out of it which can be called good without qualification except a good will intelligence wit judgment and the other talents of the mind however they may be named or courage resolution perseverance as qualities of temperament are undoubtedly good and desirable in many respects but these gifts of nature may also become extremely bad and mischievous if the will which is to make use of them and which therefore constitutes what is called character is not good it is the same with the gifts of fortune power riches honour even health and the general wellbeing and contentment with ones condition which is called happiness inspire pride and often presumption if there is not a good will to correct the influence of these on the mind and with this also to rectify the whole principle of acting and adapt it to its end the sight of a being who is not adorned with a single feature of a pure and good will enjoying unbroken prosperity can never give pleasure to an impartial rational spectator    thus a good will appears to constitute the indispensable condition even of being worthy of happiness there are even some qualities which are of service to this good will itself and may facilitate its action yet which have no intrinsic unconditional value but always presuppose a good will and this qualifies the esteem that we justly have for them and does not permit us to regard them as absolutely good moderation in the affections and passions selfcontrol and calm deliberation are not only good in many respects but even seem to constitute part of the intrinsic worth of the person but they are far from deserving to be called good without qualification  0 although they have been so unconditionally praised by the ancients for without the principles of a good will they may become extremely bad and the coolness of a villain not only makes him far more dangerous but also directly makes him more abominable in our eyes than he would have been without it a good will is good not because of what it performs or effects not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end but simply by virtue of the volition that is it is good in itself and considered by itself is to be esteemed much higher than all that can be brought about by it in favour of any inclination nay even of the sum total of all inclinations even if it should happen that owing to special disfavour of fortune or the niggardly provision of a stepmotherly nature this will should wholly lack power to accomplish its purpose if with its greatest efforts it should yet achieve nothing and there should remain only the good will not to be sure a mere wish but the summoning of all means in our power then like a jewel it would still shine by its own light as a thing which has its whole value in itself    its usefulness or fruitlessness can neither add to nor take away anything from this value it would be as it were only the setting to enable us to handle it the more conveniently in common commerce or to attract to it the attention of those who are not yet connoisseurs but not to recommend it to true connoisseurs or to determine its value there is however something so strange in this idea of the absolute value of the mere will in which no account is taken of its utility that notwithstanding the thorough assent of even common reason to the idea yet a suspicion must arise that it may perhaps really be the product of mere highflown fancy and that we may have misunderstood the purpose of nature in assigning reason as the governor of our will therefore we will examine this idea from this point of view in the physical constitution of an organized being that is a being adapted suitably to the purposes of life we assume it as a fundamental principle that no organ for any purpose will be found but what is also the fittest and best adapted for that    purpose now in a being which has reason and a will if the proper object of nature were its conservation its welfare in a word its happiness then nature would have hit upon a very bad arrangement in selecting the reason of the creature to carry out this purpose for all the actions which the creature has to perform with a view to this purpose and the whole rule of its conduct would be far more surely prescribed to it by instinct and that end would have been attained thereby much more certainly than it ever can be by reason should reason have been communicated to this favoured creature over and above it must only have served it to contemplate the happy constitution of its nature    to admire it to congratulate itself thereon and to feel thankful for it to the beneficent cause but not that it should subject its desires to that weak and delusive guidance and meddle bunglingly with the purpose of nature in a word nature would have taken care that reason should not break forth into practical exercise nor have the presumption with its weak insight to think out for itself the plan of happiness and of the means of attaining it nature would not only have taken on herself the choice of the ends but also of the means and with wise foresight would have entrusted both to instinct and in fact we find that the more a cultivated reason applies itself with deliberate purpose to the enjoyment of life and happiness so much the more does the man fail of true satisfaction and from this circumstance there arises in many if they are candid enough to confess it a certain degree of misology that is hatred of reason especially in the case of those who are most experienced in the use of it because after calculating all the advantages they derive i do not say from the invention of all the arts of common luxury but even from the sciences which seem to them to be after all only a luxury of the understanding they find that they have in fact only brought more trouble on their shoulders rather than gained in happiness and they end by envying rather than despising the more common stamp of men who keep closer to the guidance of mere instinct and do not allow their reason much influence on their conduct and this we must admit that the judgment of those who would very    much lower the lofty eulogies of the advantages which reason gives us in regard to the happiness and satisfaction of life or who would even reduce them below zero is by no means morose or ungrateful to the goodness with which the world is governed but that there lies at the root of these judgments the idea    that our existence has a different and far nobler end for which and not for happiness reason is properly intended and which must therefore be regarded as the supreme condition to which the private ends of man must for the most part be postponed for as reason is not competent to guide the will with certainty in regard to its objects and the satisfaction of all our wants which it to some extent even multiplies this being an end to which an implanted instinct would have led with much greater certainty and since nevertheless reason is imparted to us as a practical faculty ie as one which is to have influence on the will therefore admitting that nature generally in the distribution of her capacities has adapted the means to the end its true destination must be to produce a will not merely good as a means to something else but good in itself for which reason was absolutely necessary this will then though not indeed the sole and complete good must be the supreme good and the condition of every other even of the desire of happiness under these circumstances there is nothing inconsistent with the wisdom of nature in the fact that the cultivation of the reason which is requisite for the first and unconditional purpose does in many ways interfere at least in this life with the attainment of the second which is always conditional namely happiness nay it may even reduce it to nothing without nature thereby failing of her purpose for reason recognises the establishment of a good will as its highest practical destination and in attaining this purpose is capable only of a satisfaction of its own proper kind namely that from the attainment of an end which end again is determined by reason only notwithstanding that this may involve many a disappointment to the ends of inclination    we have then to develop the notion of a will which deserves to be highly esteemed for itself and is good without a view to    anything further a notion which exists already in the sound natural understanding requiring rather to be cleared up than to be taught and which in estimating the value of our actions always takes the first place and constitutes the condition of all the rest in order to do this we will take the notion of duty which includes that of a good will although implying certain subjective restrictions and hindrances these however far from concealing it or rendering it unrecognisable rather bring it out by contrast and make it shine forth so much the brighter i omit here all actions which are already recognised as inconsistent with duty although they may be useful for this or that purpose for with these the question whether they are done from duty cannot arise at all since they even conflict with it i also set aside those actions which really conform to duty but to which men have no direct inclination performing them because they are impelled thereto by some other inclination for in this case we can readily distinguish whether the action which agrees with duty is done from duty or from a selfish view it is much harder to make this distinction when the action accords with duty and the subject has besides a direct inclination to it for example it is always a matter of duty that a dealer should not overcharge an inexperienced purchaser and wherever there is much commerce the prudent tradesman does not overcharge but keeps a fixed price for everyone so that a child buys of him as well as any other men are thus honestly served but this is not enough to make us believe that the tradesman has so acted from duty and from principles of honesty his own advantage required it it is out of the question in this case to suppose that he might besides have a direct inclination in favour of the buyers so that    as it were from love he should give no advantage to one over another accordingly the action was done neither from duty nor from direct inclination but merely with a selfish view on the other hand it is a duty to maintain ones life and in addition every one has also a direct inclination to do so but on this account the often anxious care which most men take for    it has no intrinsic worth and their maxim has no moral import they preserve their life as duty requires no doubt but not because duty requires on the other hand if adversity and hopeless sorrow have completely taken away the relish for life if the unfortunate one strong in mind indignant at his fate rather than desponding or dejected wishes for death and yet preserves his life without loving it—not from inclination or fear but from duty—then his maxim has a moral worth to be beneficent when we can is a duty and besides this there are many minds so sympathetically constituted that without any other motive of vanity or selfinterest they find a pleasure in spreading joy around them and can take delight in the satisfaction of others so far as it is their own work but i maintain that in such a case an action of this kind however proper however amiable it may be has nevertheless no true moral worth but is on a level with other inclinations e g the inclination to honour which if it is happily directed to that which is in fact of public utility and accordant with duty and consequently honourable deserves praise and encouragement but not esteem for the maxim lacks the moral import namely that such actions be done from duty not from inclination put the case that the mind of that philanthropist were clouded by sorrow of his own    extinguishing all sympathy with the lot of others and that while he still has the power to benefit others in distress he is not touched by their trouble because he is absorbed with his own and now suppose that he tears himself out of this dead insensibility and performs the action without any inclination to it but simply from duty then first has his action its genuine moral worth further still if nature has put little sympathy in the heart of this or that man if he supposed to be an upright man is by temperament cold and indifferent to the sufferings of others perhaps because in respect of his own he is provided with the special gift of patience and fortitude and supposes or even requires that others should have the same—and such a man would certainly not be the meanest product of nature—but if nature had not specially framed him for a philanthropist would he not still find in himself a source    from whence to give himself a far higher worth than that of a goodnatured temperament could be unquestionably it is just in this that the moral worth of the character is brought out which is incomparably the highest of all namely that he is beneficent not from inclination but from duty to secure ones own happiness is a duty at least indirectly for discontent with ones condition under a pressure of many anxieties and amidst unsatisfied wants might easily become a great temptation to transgression of duty but here again without looking to duty all men have already the strongest and most intimate inclination to happiness because it is just in this idea that all inclinations are combined in one total but the precept of happiness is often of such a sort that it greatly interferes with some inclinations and yet a man cannot form any definite and certain conception of the sum of satisfaction of all of them which is called happiness    it is not then to be wondered at that a single inclination definite both as to what it promises and as to the time within which it can be gratified is often able to overcome such a fluctuating idea and that a gouty patient for instance can choose to enjoy what he likes and to suffer what he may since according to his calculation on this occasion at least he has only not sacrificed the enjoyment of the present moment to a possibly mistaken expectation of a happiness which is supposed to be found in health but even in this case if the general desire for happiness did not influence his will and supposing that in his particular case health was not a necessary element in this calculation there yet remains in this as in all other cases this law namely that he should promote his happiness not from inclination but from duty and by this would his conduct first acquire true moral worth it is in this manner undoubtedly that we are to understand those passages of scripture also in which we are commanded to love our neighbour even our enemy for love as an affection cannot be commanded but beneficence for dutys sake may even though we are not impelled to it by any inclination—nay are even repelled by a natural and unconquerable aversion this is practical love and not pathological—a love which is seated in    the will and not in the propensions of sense—in principles of action and not of tender sympathy and it is this love alone which can be commanded the second   proposition is that an action done from duty derives its moral worth not from the purpose which is to be attained by it but from the maxim by which it is determined and therefore does not depend on the realization of the object of the action but merely on the principle of volition by which the action has taken place without regard to any object of desire  0 it is clear from what precedes that the purposes which we may have in view in our actions or their effects regarded as ends and springs of the will cannot give to actions any unconditional or moral worth in what then can their worth lie if it is not to consist in the will and in reference to its expected effect it cannot lie anywhere but in the principle of the will without regard to the ends which can be attained by the action for the will stands between its à priori principle which is formal and its à posteriori spring which is material as between two roads and as it must be determined by something it follows that it must be determined by the formal principle of volition when an action is done from duty in which case every material principle has been withdrawn from it the third proposition which is a consequence of the two preceding i would express thus duty is the necessity of acting from respect for the law i may have inclination for an object as the effect of my proposed action but i cannot have respect for it just for this reason that it is an effect and not an energy of will similarly i cannot have respect for inclination whether my own or anothers i can at most if my own approve it if anothers sometimes even love it i e look on it as favourable to my own interest it is only what is connected with my will as a principle by no means as an effect—what does not subserve my inclination but overpowers it or at least in case of choice excludes it from its calculation—in other words simply the law    of itself which can be an object of respect and hence a command now an action done from duty must wholly exclude the influence of inclination and with it every object of the will so that nothing remains which can determine the will except objectively the law and subjectively pure respect    for this practical law and consequently the maxim   that i should follow this law even to the thwarting of all my inclinations thus the moral worth of an action does not lie in the effect expected from it nor in any principle of action which requires to borrow its motive from this expected effect for all these effects—agreeableness of ones condition and even the promotion of the happiness of others—could have been also brought about by other causes so that for this there would have been no need of the will of a rational being whereas it is in this alone that the supreme and unconditional good can be found the preeminent good which we call moral can therefore consist in nothing else than the conception of law in itself which certainly is only possible in a rational being in so far as this conception and not the expected effect determines the will this is a good which is already present in the person who acts accordingly and we have not to wait for it to appear first in the result      but what sort of law can that be the conception of which must determine the will even without paying any regard to the effect expected from it in order that this will may be called    good absolutely and without qualification as i have deprived the will of every impulse which could arise to it from obedience to any law there remains nothing but the universal conformity of its actions to law in general which alone is to serve the will as a principle i e i am never to act otherwise than so that i could also will that my maxim should become a universal law here now it is the simple conformity to law in general without assuming any particular law applicable to certain actions that serves the will as its principle and must so serve it if duty is not to be a vain delusion and a chimerical notion the common reason of men in its practical judgments perfectly coincides with this and always has in view the principle here suggested let the question be for example may i when in distress make a promise with the intention not to keep it i readily distinguish here between the two significations which the question may have whether it is prudent    or whether it is right to make a false promise the former may undoubtedly often be the case i see clearly indeed that it is not enough to extricate myself from a present difficulty by means of this subterfuge but it must be well considered whether there may not hereafter spring from this lie much greater inconvenience than that from which i now free myself and as with all my supposed cunning the consequences cannot be so easily foreseen but that credit    once lost may be much more injurious to me than any mischief which i seek to avoid at present it should be considered whether it would not be more prudent to act herein according to a universal maxim and to make it a habit to promise nothing except with the intention of keeping it but it is soon clear to me that such a maxim will still only be based on the fear of consequences now it is a wholly different thing to be truthful from duty and to be so from apprehension of injurious consequences in the first case the very notion of the action already implies a law for me in the second case i must first look about elsewhere to see what results may be combined with it which would affect myself for to deviate from the principle of duty is beyond all doubt wicked but to be unfaithful to my maxim of prudence may often be very advantageous to me although to abide by it is certainly safer the shortest way however and an unerring one to discover the answer to this question whether a lying promise is consistent with duty is to ask myself should i be content that my maxim to extricate myself from difficulty by a false promise should hold good as a universal law for myself as well as for others and should i be able to say to myself every one may make a deceitful promise when he finds himself in a difficulty from which he cannot otherwise extricate himself    then i presently become aware that while i can will the lie i can by no means will that lying should be a universal law for with such a law there would be no promises at all since it would be in vain to allege my intention in regard to my future actions to those who would not believe this allegation or if they overhastily did so would pay me back in my own coin hence my maxim as soon as it should be made a universal law would necessarily destory itself i do not therefore need any farreaching penetration to discern what i have to do in order that my will may be morally good inexperienced in the course of the world incapable of being prepared for all its contingencies i only ask myself canst thou also will that thy maxim should be a universal law if not then it must be rejected and that not because of a disadvantage accruing from it to myself or even to others but  0 because it cannot enter as a principle into a possible universal legislation and reason extorts from me immediate respect for such legislation i do not indeed as yet discern on what this respect is based this the philosopher may inquire but at least i understand this that it is an estimation of the worth which far outweighs all worth of what is recommended by inclination and that the necessity of acting from pure respect for the practical law is what constitutes duty to which every other motive must give place because it is the condition of a will being good in itself and the worth of such a will is above everything thus then without quitting the moral knowledge of common human reason we have arrived at its principle and although no doubt common men do not conceive it in such an abstract and universal form yet they always have it really before their eyes and use it as the standard of their decision here it would be easy to show how with this compass in hand    men are well able to distinguish in every case that occurs what is good what bad conformably to duty or inconsistent with it if without in the least teaching them anything new we only like socrates direct their attention to the principle they themselves employ and that therefore we do not need science and philosophy to know what we should do to be honest and good yea even wise and virtuous indeed we might well have conjectured beforehand that the knowledge of what every man is bound to do and therefore also to know would be within the reach of every man even the commonest   here we cannot forbear admiration when we see how great an advantage the practical judgment has over the theoretical in the common understanding of men in the latter if common reason ventures to depart from the laws of experience and from the perceptions of the senses it falls into mere inconceivabilities and selfcontradictions at least into a chaos of uncertainty obscurity and instability but in the practical sphere it is just when the    common understanding excludes all sensible springs from practical laws that its power of judgment begins to show itself to advantage it then becomes even subtle whether it be that it chicanes with its own conscience or with other claims respecting what is to be called right or whether it desires for its own instruction to determine honestly the worth of actions and in the latter case it may even have as good a hope of hitting the mark as any philosopher whatever can promise himself nay it is almost more sure of doing so because the philosopher cannot have any other principle while he may easily perplex his judgment by a multitude of considerations foreign to the matter and so turn aside from the right way would it not therefore be wiser in moral concerns to acquiesce in the judgment of common reason    or at most only to call in philosophy for the purpose of rendering the system of morals more complete and intelligible and its rules more convenient for use especially for disputation but not so as to draw off the common understanding from its happy simplicity or to bring it by means of philosophy into a new path of inquiry and instruction innocence is indeed a glorious thing only on the other hand it is very sad that it cannot well maintain itself and is easily seduced on this account even wisdom—which otherwise consists more in conduct than in knowledge—yet has need of science not in order to learn from it but to secure for its precepts admission and permanence against all the commands of duty which reason represents to man as so deserving of repect he feels in himself a powerful counterpoise in his wants and inclinations the entire satisfaction of which he sums up under the name of happiness now reason issues its commands unyieldingly without promising anything to the inclinations and as it were with disregard and contempt for these claims which are so impetuous and at the same time so plausible and which will not allow themselves to be suppressed by any command hence there arises a natural dialectic i e a disposition to argue against these strict laws of duty and to question their validity or at least their purity and strictness and if possible to make them more accordant with our wishes and inclinations    that is to say to corrupt them at their very source and entirely to destroy their worth—a thing which even common practical reason cannot ultimately call good thus is the common reason of man compelled to go out of its sphere and to take a step into the field of a practical philosophy not to satisfy any speculative want which never occurs to it as long as it is content to be mere sound reason but even on practical grounds    in order to attain in it information and clear instruction respecting the source of its principle and the correct determination of it in opposition to the maxims which are based on wants and inclinations so that it may escape from the perplexity of opposite claims and not run the risk of losing all genuine moral principles through the equivocation into which it easily falls thus when practical reason cultivates itself there insensibly arises in it a dialectic which forces it to seek aid in philosophy just as happens to it in its theoretic use and in this case therefore as well as in the other it will find rest nowhere but in a thorough critical examination of our reason    second section transition from popular moral philosophy to the metaphysic of morals if we have hitherto drawn our notion of duty from the common use of our practical reason it is by no means to be inferred that we have treated it as an empirical notion on the contrary if we attend to the experience of mens conduct we meet frequent and as we ourselves allow just complaints that one cannot find a single certain example of the disposition to act from pure duty although many things are done in conformity with what duty prescribes it is nevertheless always doubtful whether they are done strictly from duty so as to have a moral worth hence there have at all times been philosophers who have altogether denied that this disposition actually exists at all in human actions and have ascribed everything to a more or less refined selflove not that they have on that account questioned the soundness of the conception of morality on the contrary they spoke with sincere regret of the frailty and corruption of human nature which though noble enough to take as its rule an idea so worthy of respect is yet too weak to follow it and employs reason which ought to give it the law    only for the purpose of providing for the interest of the inclinations whether singly or at the best in the greatest possible harmony with one another in fact it is absolutely impossible to make out by experience with complete certainty a single case in which the maxim of an action however right in itself rested simply on moral grounds and on the conception of duty sometimes it happens that with the sharpest selfexamination we can find nothing beside the moral principle of duty which could have been powerful enough to move us to this or that action and to    so great a sacrifice yet we cannot from this infer with certainty that it was not really some secret impulse of selflove under the false appearance of duty that was the actual determining cause of the will we like then to flatter ourselves by falsely taking credit for a more noble motive whereas in fact we can never even by the strictest examination get completely behind the secret springs of action since when the question is of moral worth it is not with the actions which we see that we are concerned but with those inward principles of them which we do not see moreover we cannot better serve the wishes of those who ridicule all morality as a mere chimera of human imagination overstepping itself from vanity than by conceding to them that notions of duty must be drawn only from experience as from indolence people are ready to think is also the case with all other notions for this is to prepare for them a certain triumph i am willing to admit out of love of humanity that even most of our actions are correct but if we look closer at them we everywhere come upon the dear self which is always prominent and it is this they have in view and not the strict command of duty which would often require selfdenial  0 without being an enemy of virtue a cool observer one that does not mistake the wish for good however lively for its reality may sometimes doubt whether true virtue is actually found anywhere in the world and this especially as years increase and the judgment is partly made wiser by experience and partly also more acute in observation this being so nothing can secure us from falling away altogether from our ideas of duty or maintain in the soul a wellgrounded respect for its law but the clear conviction that although there should never have been actions which really sprang from such pure sources yet whether this or that takes place is not at all the question but that reason of itself independent on all experience ordains what ought to take place that accordingly actions of which perhaps the world has hitherto never given an example the feasibility even of which might be very much doubted by one who founds everything on experience are nevertheless inflexibly commanded by reason that ex gr even though there might never yet have been a sincere    friend yet not a whit the less is pure sincerity in friendship required of every man because prior to all experience this duty is involved as duty in the idea of a reason determining the will by à priori principles when we add further that unless we deny that the notion of morality has any truth or reference to any possible object we must admit that its law must be valid not merely for men but for all rational creatures generally not merely under certain contingent conditions or with exceptions but with absolute necessity then it is clear that no experience could enable us to infer even the possibility of such apodictic laws    for with what right could we bring into unbounded respect as a universal precept for every rational nature that which perhaps holds only under the contingent conditions of humanity or how could laws of the determination of our will be regarded as laws of the determination of the will of rational beings generally and for us only as such if they were merely empirical and did not take their origin wholly à priori from pure but practical reason nor could anything be more fatal to morality than that we should wish to derive it from examples for every example of it that is set before me must be first itself tested by principles of morality whether it is worthy to serve as an original example i e as a pattern but by no means can it authoritatively furnish the conception of morality even the holy one of the gospels must first be compared with our ideal of moral perfection before we can recognise him as such and so he says of himself why call ye me whom you see good none is good the model of good but god only whom ye do not see but whence have we the conception of god as the supreme good simply from the idea of moral perfection which reason frames à priori and connects inseparably with the notion of a freewill imitation finds no place at all in morality and examples serve only for encouragement i e they put beyond doubt the feasibility of what the law commands they make visible that which the practical rule expresses more generally but they can never authorize us to set aside the true original which lies in reason and to guide ourselves by examples    if then there is no genuine supreme principle of morality but what must rest simply on pure reason independent on all experience i think it is not necessary even to put the question whether it is good    to exhibit these concepts in their generality in abstracto as they are established à priori along with the principles belonging to them if our knowledge is to be distinguished from the vulgar and to be called philosophical in our times indeed this might perhaps be necessary for if we collected votes whether pure rational knowledge separated from everything empirical that is to say metaphysic of morals or whether popular practical philosophy is to be preferred it is easy to guess which side would preponderate this descending to popular notions is certainly very commendable if the ascent to the principles of pure reason has first taken place and been satisfactorily accomplished this implies that we first found ethics on metaphysics and then when it is firmly established procure a hearing for it by giving it a popular character but it is quite absurd to try to be popular in the first inquiry on which the soundness of the principles depends it is not only that this proceeding can never lay claim to the very rare merit of a true philosophical popularity since there is no art in being intelligible if one renounces all thoroughness of insight but also it produces a disgusting medley of compiled observations and halfreasoned principles shallow pates enjoy this because it can be used for everyday chat but the sagacious find in it only confusion and being unsatisfied and unable to help themselves they turn away their eyes while philosophers who see quite well through this delusion are little listened to when they call men off for a time from this pretended popularity in order that they might be rightfully popular after they have attained a definite insight we need only look at the attempts of moralists in that favourite fashion and we shall find at one time the special constitution of human nature    including however the idea of a rational nature generally at one time perfection at another happiness here moral sense there fear of god a little of this and a little of that in marvellous mixture without its    occurring to them to ask whether the principles of morality are to be sought in the knowledge of human nature at all which we can have only from experience and if this is not so if these principles are to be found altogether à priori free from everything empirical in pure rational concepts only and nowhere else not even in the smallest degree then rather to adopt the method of making this a separate inquiry as pure practical philosophy or if one may use a name so decried as metaphysic of morals   to bring it by itself to completeness and to require the public which wishes for popular treatment to await the issue of this undertaking such a metaphysic of morals completely isolated not mixed with any anthropology theology physics or hyperphysics and still less with occult qualities which we might call hypophysical is not only an indispensable substratum of all sound theoretical knowledge of duties but is at the same time a desideratum of the highest importance to the actual fulfilment of their precepts for the pure conception of duty unmixed with any foreign addition of empirical attractions    and in a word the conception of the moral law exercises on the human heart by way of reason alone which first becomes aware with this that it can of itself be practical an influence so much more powerful than all other springs   which may be derived from the field of experience that in the consciousness of its worth it despises the latter and can by degrees become their master whereas a mixed ethics compounded partly of motives drawn from feelings and inclinations and partly also of conceptions of reason must    make the mind waver between motives which cannot be brought under any principle which lead to good only by mere accident and very often also to evil from what has been said it is clear that all moral conceptions have their seat and origin completely à priori in the reason and that moreover in the commonest reason just as truly as in that which is in the highest degree speculative that they cannot be obtained by abstraction from any empirical and therefore merely contingent knowledge that it is just this purity of their origin that makes them worthy to serve as our supreme practical principle    and that just in proportion as we add anything empirical we detract from their genuine influence and from the absolute value of actions that it is not only of the greatest necessity in a purely speculative point of view but is also of the greatest practical importance to derive these notions and laws from pure reason to present them pure and unmixed and even to determine the compass of this practical or pure rational knowledge i e to determine the whole faculty of pure practical reason and in doing so we must not make its principles dependent on the particular nature of human reason though in speculative philosophy this may be permitted or may even at times be necessary but since moral laws ought to hold good for every rational creature we must derive them from the general concept of a rational being in this way although for its application to man morality has need of anthropology yet in the first instance we must treat it independently as pure philosophy    i e as metaphysic complete in itself a thing which in such distinct branches of science is easily done knowing well that unless we are in possession of this it would not only be vain to determine the moral element of duty in right actions for purposes of speculative criticism but it would be impossible to base morals on their genuine principles even for common practical purposes especially of moral instruction so as to produce pure moral dispositions and to engraft them on mens minds to the promotion of the greatest possible good in the world but in order that in this study we may not merely advance by the natural steps from the common moral judgment in this case very worthy of respect to the philosophical as has been already done but also from a popular philosophy which goes no further than it can reach by groping with the help of examples to metaphysic which does not allow itself to be checked by anything empirical    and as it must measure the whole extent of this kind of rational knowledge goes as far as ideal conceptions where even examples fail us we must follow and clearly describe the practical faculty of reason from the general rules of its determination to the point where the notion of duty springs from it everything in nature works according to laws rational beings alone have the faculty of acting according to the conception of laws that is according to principles i e have a will since the deduction of actions from principles requires reason the will is nothing but practical reason if reason infallibly determines the will then the actions of such a being which are recognised as objectively necessary are subjectively necessary also i e the will is a faculty to choose that only which reason independent on inclination recognises as practically necessary i e as good but if reason of itself does not sufficiently determine the will if the latter is subject also to subjective conditions particular impulses which do not always coincide with the objective conditions in a word if the will does not in itself completely accord with reason which is actually the case with men then the actions which objectively are recognised as necessary are subjectively contingent and the determination of such a will  0 according to objective laws is obligation that is to say the relation of the objective laws to a will that is not thoroughly good is conceived as the determination of the will of a rational being by principles of reason but which the will from its nature does not of necessity follow the conception of an objective principle in so far as it is obligatory for a will is called a command of reason and the formula of the command is called an imperative all imperatives are expressed by the word ought or shall and thereby indicate the relation of an objective law    of reason to a will which from its subjective constitution is not necessarily determined by it an obligation they say that something would be good to do or to forbear but they say it to a will which does not always do a thing because it is conceived to be good to do it that is practically good however which determines the will by means of the conceptions of reason and consequently not from subjective causes but objectively that is on principles which are valid for every rational being as such it is distinguished from the pleasant as that which influences the will only by means of sensation from merely subjective causes valid only for the sense of this or that one and not as a principle of reason which holds for every one      a perfectly good will would therefore be equally subject to objective laws viz laws of good but could not be conceived as obliged thereby to act lawfully because of itself from its subjective constitution it can only be determined by the conception of good    therefore no imperatives hold for the divine will or in general for a holy will ought is here out of place because the volition is already of itself necessarily in unison with the law therefore imperatives are only formulæ to express the relation of objective laws of all volition to the subjective imperfection of the will of this or that rational being e g the human will now all imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically the former represent the practical necessity of a possible action as means to something else that is willed or at least which one might possibly will the categorical imperative would be that which represented an action as necessary of itself without reference to another end ie as objectively necessary since every practical law represents a possible action as good and on this account for a subject who is practically determinable by reason necessary all imperatives are formulæ determining an action which is necessary according to the principle of a will good in some respects if now the action is good only as a means to something else then the imperative is hypothetical if it is conceived as good in itself and consequently as being necessarily the principle of a will which of itself conforms to reason then it is categorical thus the imperative declares what action possible by me would be good and presents the practical rule in relation to a will which does not forthwith perform an action simply because it is good whether because the subject does not always know that it is good or because even if it know this yet its maxims might be opposed to the objective principles of practical reason accordingly the hypothetical imperative only says that the action is good for some purpose possible or actual    in the first case it is a problematical in the second an assertorial    practical principle the categorical imperative which declares an action to be objectively necessary in itself without reference to any purpose ie without any other end is valid as an apodictic practical principle whatever is possible only by the power of some rational being may also be conceived as a possible purpose of some will and therefore the principles of action as regards the means necessary to attain some possible purpose are in fact infinitely numerous all sciences have a practical part consisting of problems expressing that some end is possible for us and of imperatives directing how it may be attained these may therefore be called in general imperatives of skill here there is no question whether the end is rational and good but only what one must do in order to attain it the precepts for the physician to make his patient thoroughly healthy and for a poisoner to ensure certain death are of equal value in this respect that each serves to effect its purpose perfectly since in early youth it cannot be known what ends are likely to occur to us in the course of life parents seek to have their children taught a great many things and provide for their skill in the use of means for all sorts of arbitrary ends of none of which can they determine whether it may not perhaps hereafter be an object to their pupil but which it is at all events possible that he might aim at and this anxiety is so great that they commonly neglect to form and correct their judgment on the value of the things which may be chosen as ends  0 there is one end however which may be assumed to be actually such to all rational beings so far as imperatives apply to them viz as dependent beings and therefore one purpose which they not merely may have but which we may with certainty assume that they all actually have by a natural necessity and this is happiness the hypothetical imperative which expresses the practical necessity of an action as means to the advancement of happiness is assertorial we are not to present it as necessary for an uncertain and merely possible purpose but for a purpose which we may presuppose with certainty and à priori in every man because it belongs to his being now    skill in the choice of means to his own greatest wellbeing may be called prudence   in the narrowest sense and thus the imperative which refers to the choice of means to ones own happiness i e the precept of prudence is still always hypothetical the action is not commanded absolutely but only as means to another purpose finally there is an imperative which commands a certain conduct immediately without having as its condition any other purpose to be attained by it this imperative is categorical it concerns not the matter of the action or its intended result but its form and the principle of which it is itself a result    and what is essentially good in it consists in the mental disposition let the consequence be what it may this imperative may be called that of morality there is a marked distinction also between the volitions on these three sorts of principles in the dissimilarity of the obligation of the will in order to mark this difference more clearly i think they would be most suitably named in their order if we said they are either rules of skill or counsels of prudence or commands laws of morality for it is law only that involves the conception of an unconditional and objective necessity which is consequently universally valid and commands are laws which must be obeyed that is must be followed even in opposition to inclination counsels indeed involve necessity but one which can only hold under a contingent subjective condition viz they depend on whether this or that man reckons this or that as part of his happiness the categorical imperative on    the contrary is not limited by any condition and as being absolutely although practically necessary may be quite properly called a command we might also call the first kind of imperatives technical belonging to art the second pragmatic   to welfare the third moral belonging to free conduct generally that is to morals now arises the question how are all these imperatives possible this question does not seek to know how we can conceive the accomplishment of the action which the imperative ordains but merely how we can conceive the obligation of the will    which the imperative expresses no special explanation is needed to show how an imperative of skill is possible whoever wills the end wills also so far as reason decides his conduct the means in his power which are indispensably necessary thereto this proposition is as regards the volition analytical for in willing an object as my effect there is already thought the causality of myself as an acting cause that is to say the use of the means and the imperative educes from the conception of volition of an end the conception of actions necessary to this end synthetical propositions must no doubt be employed in defining the means to a proposed end but they do not concern the principle the act of the will but the object and its realization ex gr that in order to bisect a line on an unerring principle i must draw from its extremities two interesecting ares this no doubt is taught by mathematics only in synthetical propositions but if i know that it is only by this process that the intended operation can be performed then to say that if i fully will the operation i also will the action required for it is an analytical proposition for it is one and the same thing to conceive something as an effect which i can    produce in a certain way and to conceive myself as acting in this way if it were only equally easy to give a definite conception of happiness the imperatives of prudence would correspond exactly with those of skill and would likewise be analytical for in this case as in that it could be said whoever wills the end wills also according to the dictate of reason necessarily the indispensable means thereto which are in his power but unfortunately the notion of happiness is so indefinite that although every man wishes to attain it yet he never can say definitely and consistently what it is that he really wishes and wills    the reason of this is that all the elements which belong to the notion of happiness are altogether empirical ie they must be borrowed from experience and nevertheless the idea of happiness requires an absolute whole a maximum of welfare in my present and all future circumstances now it is impossible that the most clearsighted and at the same time most powerful being supposed finite should frame to himself a definite conception of what he really wills in this does he will riches how much anxiety envy and snares might he not thereby draw upon his shoulders does he will knowledge and discernment perhaps it might prove to be only an eye so much the sharper to show him so much the more fearfully the evils that are now concealed from him and that cannot be avoided or to impose more wants on his desires which already give him concern enough would he have long life who guarantees to him that it would not be a long misery would he at least have health how often has uneasiness of the body restrained from excesses into which perfect health would have allowed one to fall and so on in short he is unable on any principle to determine with certainty what would make him truly happy because to do so he would need to be omniscient we cannot therefore act on any definite principles to secure happiness but only on empirical counsels ex gr of regimen frugality courtesy reserve c which experience teaches do on the average most promote wellbeing hence it follows that the imperatives of prudence do not strictly speaking command    at all that is they cannot present actions objectively as practically necessary that they are rather to be regarded as counsels consilia than precepts præcepta of reason that the problem to determine certainly and universally    what action would promote the happiness of a rational being is completely insoluble and consequently no imperative respecting it is possible which should in the strict sense command to do what makes happy because happiness is not an ideal of reason but of imagination resting solely on empirical grounds and it is vain to expect that these should define an action by which one could attain the totality of a series of consequences which is really endless this imperative of prudence would however be an analytical proposition if we assume that the means to happiness could be certainly assigned for it is distinguished from the imperative of skill only by this that in the latter the end is merely possible in the former it is given as however both only ordain the means to that which we suppose to be willed as an end it follows that the imperative which ordains the willing of the means to him who wills the end is in both cases analytical thus there is no difficulty in regard to the possibility of an imperative of this kind either on the other hand the question how the imperative of morality is possible is undoubtedly one the only one demanding a solution as this is not at all hypothetical and the objective necessity which it presents cannot rest on any hypothesis as is the case with the hypothetical imperatives only here we must never leave out of consideration that we cannot make out by any example in other words empirically whether there is such an imperative at all but it is rather to be feared that all those which seem to be categorical may yet be at bottom hypothetical for instance when the precept is thou shalt not promise deceitfully and it is assumed that the necessity of this is not a mere counsel to avoid some other evil so that it should mean thou shalt not make a lying promise lest if it become known thou shouldst destroy thy credit    but that an action of this kind must be regarded as evil in itself so that the imperative of the prohibition is categorical then we cannot    show with certainty in any example that the will was determined merely by the law without any other spring of action although it may appear to be so for it is always possible that fear of disgrace perhaps also obscure dread of other dangers may have a secret influence on the will who can prove by experience the nonexistence of a cause when all that experience tells us is that we do not perceive it but in such a case the socalled moral imperative which as such appears to be categorical and unconditional would in reality be only a pragmatic precept drawing our attention to our own interests and merely teaching us to take these into consideration we shall therefore have to investigate à priori the possibility of a categorical imperative as we have not in this case the advantage of its reality being given in experience so that the elucidation of its possibility should be requisite only for its explanation not for its establishment in the meantime it may be discerned beforehand that the categorical imperative alone has the purport of a practical law all the rest may indeed be called principles of the will but not laws since whatever is only necessary for the attainment of some arbitrary purpose may be considered as in itself contingent and we can at any time be free from the precept if we give up the purpose on the contrary the unconditional command leaves the will no liberty to choose the opposite consequently it alone carries with it that necessity which we require in a law secondly in the case of this categorical imperative or law of morality the difficulty of discerning its possibility is a very profound one    it is an à priori synthetical practical proposition   and as there is so much difficulty in discerning the possibility    of speculative propositions of this kind it may readily be supposed that the difficulty will be no less with the practical in this problem we will first inquire whether the mere conception of a categorical imperative may not perhaps supply us also with the formula of it containing the proposition which alone can be a categorical imperative for even if we know the tenor of such an absolute command yet how it is possible will require further special and laborious study which we postpone to the last section when i conceive a hypothetical imperative in general i do not know beforehand what it will contain until i am given the condition but when i conceive a categorical imperative i know at once what it contains for as the imperative contains besides the law only the necessity that the maxims   shall conform to this law while the law contains no conditions restricting it there remains nothing but the general statement that the maxim of the action should conform to a universal law    and it is this conformity alone that the imperative properly represents as necessary   there is therefore but one categorical imperative namely this act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law now if all imperatives of duty can be deduced from this one imperative as from their principle then although it should remain undecided whether what is called duty is not merely a    vain notion yet at least we shall be able to show what we understand by it and what this notion means since the universality of the law according to which effects are produced constitutes what is properly called nature in the most general sense as to form that is the existence of things so far as it is determined by general laws the imperative of duty may be expressed thus act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature we will now enumerate a few duties adopting the usual division of them into duties to ourselves and to others and into perfect and imperfect duties        a man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels wearied of life but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can ask himself whether it would not be contrary to his duty to himself to take his own life now he inquires whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of nature his maxim is from selflove i adopt it as a principle to shorten my life when its longer duration is likely to bring more evil than satisfaction it is asked then simply whether this principle founded on selflove can become a universal law of nature now we see at once that a system of nature of which it should be a law to destroy life by means of the very feeling whose special nature it is to impel to the improvement of life would contradict itself and therefore could not exist as a system of nature hence that maxim cannot possibly exist as a universal law of nature and consequently  0 would be wholly inconsistent with the supreme principle of all duty     another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money he knows that he will not be able to repay it but sees also that nothing will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a definite time he desires to make this promise but he has still so much conscience as to ask himself is it not unlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out of a difficulty in this way suppose however that he resolves to do so then the maxim of his action would be expressed thus when i think myself in want of money i will borrow money and promise to repay it although i know that i never can do so now this principle of selflove or of ones own advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future welfare but the question now is is it right i change then the suggestion of selflove into a universal law and state the question thus    how would it be if my maxim were a universal law then i see at once that it could never hold as a universal law of nature but would necessarily contradict itself for supposing it to be a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should be able to promise whatever he pleases with the purpose of not keeping his promise the promise itself would become impossible as well as the end that one might have in view in it since no one would consider that anything was promised to him but would ridicule all such statements as vain pretences   a third finds in himself a talent which with the help of some culture might make him a useful man in many respects but he finds himself in comfortable circumstances and prefers to indulge in pleasure rather than to take pains in enlarging and improving his happy natural capacities he asks however whether his maxim of neglect of his natural gifts besides agreeing with his inclination to indulgence agrees also with what is called duty he sees then that a system of nature could indeed subsist with such a universal law although men    like the south sea islanders should let their talents rust and resolve to devote their lives merely to idleness amusement and propagation of their species—in a word to enjoyment but he cannot possibly will that this should be a universal law of nature or be implanted in us as such by a natural instinct for as a rational being he necessarily wills that his faculties be developed since they serve him and have been given him for all sorts of possible purposes   a fourth who is in prosperity while he sees that others have to contend with great wretchedness and that he could help them thinks what concern is it of mine let everyone be as happy  0 as heaven pleases or as he can make himself i will take nothing from him nor even envy him only i do not wish to contribute anything to his welfare or to his assistance in distress now no doubt if such a mode of thinking were a universal law the human race might very well subsist and doubtless even better than in a state in which everyone talks of sympathy and goodwill or even takes care occasionally to put it into practice but on the other side also cheats when he can betrays the rights of men or otherwise violates them but although it is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance with that maxim it is impossible to will that such a principle should have the universal validity of a law of nature for a will which resolved this would contradict itself inasmuch as many cases might occur in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others and in which by such a law of nature sprung from his own will he would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires these are a few of the many actual duties or at least what we regard as such which obviously fall into two classes on the one principle that we have laid down we must be able to will that a maxim of our action should be a universal law this is the canon of the moral appreciation of the action generally some actions are of such a character that their maxim cannot without contradiction be even conceived as a universal law of nature far from it being possible that we should will that it should be so in others this intrinsic impossibility is not    found but still it is impossible to will that their maxim should be raised to the universality of a law of nature since such a will would contradict itself it is easily seen that the former violate strict or rigorous inflexible duty    the latter only laxer meritorious duty thus it has been completely shown by these examples how all duties depend as regards the nature of the obligation not the object of the action on the same principle if now we attend to ourselves on occasion of any transgression of duty we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim should be a universal law for that is impossible for us on the contrary we will that the opposite should remain a universal law only we assume the liberty of making an exception in our own favour or just for this time only in favour of our inclination consequently if we considered all cases from one and the same point of view namely that of reason we should find a contradiction in our own will namely that a certain principle should be objectively necessary as a universal law and yet subjectively should not be universal but admit of exceptions as however we at one moment regard our action from the point of view of a will wholly conformed to reason and then again look at the same action from the point of view of a will affected by inclination there is not really any contradiction but an antagonism of inclination to the precept of reason whereby the universality of the principle is changed into a mere generality so that the practical principle of reason shall meet the maxim half way now although this cannot be justified in our own impartial judgment yet it proves that we do really recognise the validity of the categorical imperative and with all respect for it only allow ourselves a few exceptions which we think unimportant and forced from us we have thus established at least this much that if duty is a conception which is to have any import and real legislative authority for our actions    it can only be expressed in categorical and not at all in hypothetical imperatives we have also which is of great importance exhibited clearly and definitely for every practical application the content of the categorical imperative which must contain the principle of all    duty if there is such a thing at all we have not yet however advanced so far as to prove à priori that there actually is such an imperative that there is a practical law which commands absolutely of itself and without any other impulse and that the following of this law is duty with the view of attaining to this it is of extreme importance to remember that we must not allow ourselves to think of deducing the reality of this principle from the particular attributes of human nature for duty is to be a practical unconditional necessity of action it must therefore hold for all rational beings to whom an imperative can apply at all and for this reason only be also a law for all human wills on the contrary whatever is deduced from the particular natural characteristics of humanity from certain feelings and propensions   nay even if possible from any particular tendency proper to human reason and which need not necessarily hold for the will of every rational being this may indeed supply us with a maxim but not with a law with a subjective principle on which we may have a propension and inclination to act but not with an objective principle on which we should be enjoined to act even though all our propensions inclinations and natural dispositions were opposed to it in fact the sublimity and intrinsic dignity of the command in duty are so much the more evident the less the subjective impulses favour it and the more they oppose it without being able in the slighest degree to weaken the obligation of the law or to diminish its validity    here then we see philosophy brought to a critical position since it has to be firmly fixed notwithstanding that it has nothing to support it either in heaven or earth here it must show its purity as absolute dictator of its own laws not the    herald of those which are whispered to it by an implanted sense or who knows what tutelary nature although these may be better than nothing yet they can never afford principles dictated by reason which must have their source wholly à priori and thence their commanding authority expecting everything from the supremacy of the law and the due respect for it nothing from inclination or else condemning the man to selfcontempt and inward abhorrence thus every empirical element is not only quite incapable of being an aid to the principle of morality but is even highly prejudicial to the purity of morals for the proper and inestimable worth of an absolutely good will consists just in this that the principle of action is free from all influence of contingent grounds which alone experience can furnish we cannot too much or too often repeat our warning against this lax and even mean habit of thought which seeks for its principle amongst empirical motives and laws for human reason in its weariness is glad to rest on this pillow and in a dream of sweet illusions in which instead of juno it embraces a cloud it substitutes for morality a bastard patched up from limbs of various derivation which looks like anything one chooses to see in it only not like virtue to one who has once beheld her in her true form      the question then is this is it a necessary law for all rational beings that they should always judge of their actions by maxims of which they can themselves will that they should serve as universal laws if it is so then it must be connected altogether à priori with the very conception of the will of a rational being generally but in order to discover this connexion we must however reluctantly take a step into metaphysic although into a domain of it which is distinct from speculative philosophy namely the metaphysic of morals in    a practical philosophy where it is not the reasons of what happens that we have to ascertain but the laws of what ought to happen even although it never does i e objective practical laws there it is not necessary to inquire into the reasons why anything pleases or displeases how the pleasure of mere sensation differs from taste and whether the latter is distinct from a general satisfaction of reason on what the feeling of pleasure or pain rests and how from it desires and inclinations arise and from these again maxims by the cooperation of reason for all this belongs to an empirical psychology which would constitute the second part of physics if we regard physics as the philosophy of nature so far as it is based on empirical laws but here we are concerned with objective practical laws and consequently with the relation of the will to itself so far as it is determined by reason alone in which case whatever has reference to anything empirical is necessarily excluded since if reason of itself alone determines the conduct    and it is the possibility of this that we are now investigating it must necessarily do so à priori the will is conceived as a faculty of determining oneself to action in accordance with the conception of certain laws and such a faculty can be found only in rational beings now that which serves the will as the objective ground of its selfdetermination is the end and if this is assigned by reason alone it must hold for all rational beings on the other hand that which merely contains the ground of possibility of the action of which the effect is the end this is called the means the subjective ground of the desire is the spring the objective ground of the volition is the motive hence the distinction between subjective ends which rest on springs and objective ends which depend on motives valid for every rational being practical principles are formal when they abstract from all subjective ends they are material when they assume these and therefore particular springs of action the ends which a rational being proposes to himself at pleasure as effects of his actions material ends are all only relative for it is only their relation to the particular desires of the subject that gives them their worth    which therefore cannot furnish principles universal and necessary for all rational beings and for every volition that is to say practical laws hence all these relative ends can give rise only to hypothetical imperatives supposing however that there were something whose existence has in itself an absolute worth something which being an end in itself could be a source of definite laws then in this and this alone would lie the source of a possible categorical imperative ie a practical law    now i say man and generally any rational being exists as an end in himself not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will but in all his actions whether they concern himself or other rational beings must be always regarded at the same time as an end all objects of the inclinations have only a conditional worth for if the inclinations and the wants founded on them did not exist then their object would be without value but the inclinations themselves being sources of want are so far from having an absolute worth for which they should be desired that on the contrary it must be the universal wish of every rational being to be wholly free from them thus the worth of any object which is to be acquired by our action is always conditional beings whose existence depends not on our will but on natures have nevertheless if they are irrational beings only a relative value as means and are therefore called things rational beings on the contrary are called persons because their very nature points them out as ends in themselves that is as something which must not be used merely as means and so far therefore restricts freedom of action and is an object of respect these therefore are not merely subjective ends whose existence has a worth for us as an effect of our action but objective ends that is things whose existence is an end in itself an end moreover for which no other can be substituted which they should subserve merely as means for otherwise nothing whatever would possess absolute worth but if all worth were conditioned and therefore contingent then there would be no supreme practical principle of reason whatever if then there is a supreme practical principle or in respect of    the human will a categorical imperative it must be one which    being drawn from the conception of that which is necessarily an end for every one because it is an end in itself constitutes an objective principle of will and can therefore serve as a universal practical law the foundation of this principle is rational nature exists as an end in itself man necessarily conceives his own existence as being so so far then this is a subjective principle of human actions but every other rational being regards its existence similarly just on the same rational principle that holds for me   so that it is at the same time an objective principle from which as a supreme practical law all laws of the will must be capable of being deduced accordingly the practical imperative will be as follows so act as to treat humanity whether in thine own person or in that of any other in every case as an end withal never as means only we will now inquire whether this can be practically carried out to abide by the previous examples firstly under the head of necessary duty to oneself he who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself if he destroys himself in order to escape from painful circumstances he uses a person merely as a mean to maintain a tolerable condition up to the end of life but a man is not a thing that is to say something which can be used merely as means but must in all his actions be always considered as an end in himself i cannot therefore dispose in any way of a man in my own person so as to mutilate him to damage or kill him    it belongs to ethics proper to define this principle more precisely so as to avoid all misunderstanding eg as to the amputation of the limbs in order to preserve myself as to exposing my life to danger with a view to preserve it c this question is therefore omitted here secondly as regards necessary duties or those of strict obligation towards others he who is thinking of making a lying    promise to others will see at once that he would be using another man merely as a mean without the latter containing at the same time the end in himself for he whom i propose by such a promise to use for my own purposes cannot possibly assent to my mode of acting towards him and therefore cannot himself contain the end of this action this violation of the principle of humanity in other men is more obvious if we take in examples of attacks on the freedom and property of others for then it is clear that he who transgresses the rights of men intends to use the person of others merely as means without considering that as rational beings they ought always to be esteemed also as ends that is as beings who must be capable of containing in themselves the end of the very same action   thirdly as regards contingent meritorious duties to oneself is not enough that the action does not violate humanity in our own person as an end in itself it must also harmonise with it    now there are in humanity capacities of greater perfection which belong to the end that nature has in view in regard to humanity in ourselves as the subject to neglect these might perhaps be consistent with the maintenance of humanity as an end in itself but not with the advancement of this end fourthly as regards meritorious duties towards others the natural end which all men have is their own happiness now humanity might indeed subsist although no one should contribute anything to the happiness of others provided he did not intentionally withdraw anything from it but after all this would only harmonise negatively not positively with humanity    as an end in itself if every one does not also endeavour as far as in him lies to forward the ends of others for the ends of any subject which is an end in himself ought as far as possible to be my ends also if that conception is to have its full effect with me this principle that humanity and generally every rational nature is an end in itself which is the supreme limiting condition of every mans freedom of action is not borrowed from experience firstly because it is universal applying as it does to all rational beings whatever and experience is not capable of determining anything about them secondly because it does not present humanity as an end to men subjectively that is as an object which men do of themselves actually adopt as an end but as an objective end which must as a law constitute the supreme limiting condition of all our subjective ends let them be what we will it must therefore spring from pure reason in fact the objective principle of all practical legislation lies according to the first principle in the rule and its form of universality which makes it capable of being a law say e g a law of nature but the subjective principle is in the end now by the second principle the subject of all ends is each rational being  0 inasmuch as it is an end in itself hence follows the third practical principle of the will which is the ultimate condition of its harmony with the universal practical reason viz the idea of the will of every rational being as a universally legislative will on this principle all maxims are rejected which are inconsistent with the will being itself universal legislator thus the will is not subject simply to the law but so subject that it must be regarded as itself giving the law and on this ground only subject to the law of which it can regard itself as the author in the previous imperatives namely that based on the conception of the conformity of actions to general laws as in a physical system of nature and that based on the universal prerogative of rational beings as ends in themselves—these imperatives just because they were conceived as categorical excluded  0 from any share in their authority all admixture of any interest as a spring of action they were however only assumed to be categorical because such an assumption was necessary to explain the conception of duty but we could not prove independently that there are practical propositions which command categorically nor can it be proved in this section one thing however could be done namely to indicate in the imperative itself by some determinate expression that in the case of volition from duty all interest is renounced which is the specific criterion of categorical as distinguished from hypothetical imperatives this is done in the present third formula of the principle namely in the idea of the will of every rational being as a universally legislating will    for although a will which is subject to laws may be attached to this law by means of an interest yet a will which is itself a supreme lawgiver so far as it is such cannot possibly depend on any interest since a will so dependent would itself still need another law restricting the interest of its selflove by the condition that it should be valid as universal law thus the principle that every human will is a will which in all its maxims gives universal laws    provided it be otherwise justified would be very well adapted to be the categorical imperative in this respect namely that just because of the idea of universal legislation it is not based on any interest and therefore it alone among all possible imperatives can be unconditional or still better converting the proposition if there is a categorical imperative i e a law for the will of every rational being it can only command that everything be done from maxims of ones will regarded as a will which could at the same time will that it should itself give universal laws for in that case only the practical principle and the imperative which it obeys are unconditional since they cannot be based on any interest    looking back now on all previous attempts to discover the principle of morality we need not wonder why they all failed it was seen that man was bound to laws by duty but it was not observed that the laws to which he is subject are only those of his own giving though at the same time they are universal    and that he is only bound to act in conformity with his own will a will however which is designed by nature to give universal laws for when one has conceived man only as subject to a law no matter what then this law required some interest either by way of attraction or constraint since it did not originate as a law from his own will but this will was according to a law obliged by something else to act in a certain manner now by this necessary consequence all the labour spent in finding a supreme principle of duty was irrevocably lost for men never elicited duty but only a necessity of acting from a certain interest whether this interest was private or otherwise in any case the imperative must be conditional and could not by any means be capable of being a moral command i will therefore call this the principle of autonomy of the will in contrast with every other which i accordingly reckon as heteronomy   the conception of every rational being as one which must consider itself as giving in all the maxims of its will universal laws so as to judge itself and its actions from this point of view—this conception leads to another which depends on it and is very fruitful namely that of a kingdom of ends by a kingdom i understand the union of different rational beings in a system by common laws now since it is by laws that ends are determined as regards their universal validity hence if we abstract from the personal differences of rational beings and likewise from all the content of their private ends we shall be able to conceive all ends combined in a systematic whole including both rational beings as ends in themselves and also the special ends which each may propose to himself that is    to say we can conceive a kingdom of ends which on the preceding principles is possible    for all rational beings come under the law that each of them must treat itself and all others never merely as means but in every case at the same time as ends in themselves hence results a systematic union of rational beings by common objective laws ie a kingdom which may be called a kingdom of ends since what these laws have in view is just the relation of these beings to one another as ends and means it is certainly only an ideal a rational being belongs as a member to the kingdom of ends when although giving universal laws in it he is also himself subject to these laws he belongs to it as sovereign when while giving laws he is not subject to the will of any other a rational being must always regard himself as giving laws either as member or as sovereign in a kingdom of ends which is rendered possible by the freedom of will he cannot however maintain the latter position merely by the maxims of his will but only in case he is a completely independent being without wants and with unrestricted power adequate to his will morality consists then in the reference of all action to the legislation which alone can render a kingdom of ends possible this legislation must be capable of existing in every rational being and of emanating from his will so that the principle of this will is never to act on any maxim which could not without contradiction be also a universal law and accordingly always so to act that the will could at the same time regard itself as giving in its maxims universal laws if now the maxims of rational beings are not by their own nature coincident with this objective principle then the necessity of acting on it is called practical necessitation    ie duty duty does not apply to the sovereign in the kingdom of ends but it does to every member of it and to all in the same degree the practical necessity of acting on this principle ie duty does not rest at all on feelings impulses or inclinations but solely on the relation of rational beings to one another a relation in which the will of a rational being must always be regarded as legislative since otherwise it could not be conceived    as an end in itself reason then refers every maxim of the will regarding it as legislating universally to every other will and also to every action towards oneself and this not on account of any other practical motive or any future advantage but from the idea of the dignity of a rational being obeying no law but that which he himself also gives in the kingdom of ends everything has either value or dignity whatever has a value can be replaced by something else which is equivalent whatever on the other hand is above all value and therefore admits of no equivalent has a dignity whatever has reference to the general inclinations and wants of mankind has a market value whatever without presupposing a want corresponds to a certain taste that is to a satisfaction in the mere purposeless play of our faculties has a fancy value but that which constitutes the condition under which alone anything can be an end in itself this has not merely a relative worth ie value but an intrinsic worth that is dignity now morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in himself since by this alone is it possible that he should be a legislating member in the kingdom of ends thus morality and humanity as capable of it is that which alone has dignity    skill and diligence in labour have a market value wit lively imagination and humour have fancy value on the other hand fidelity to promises benevolence from principle not from instinct have an intrinsic worth neither nature nor art contains anything which in default of these it could put in their place for their worth consists not in the effects which spring from them not in the use and advantage which they secure but in the disposition of mind that is the maxims of the will which are ready to manifest themselves in such actions even though they should not have the desired effect these actions also need no recommendation from any subjective taste or sentiment that they may be looked on with immediate favour and satisfaction they need no immediate propension or feeling for them they exhibit the will that performs them as an object of an immediate respect    and nothing but reason is required to impose them on the will not to flatter it into them which in the case of duties would be a contradiction this estimation therefore shows that the worth of such a disposition is dignity and places it infinitely above all value with which it cannot for a moment be brought into comparison or competition without as it were violating its sanctity what then is it which justifies virtue or the morally good disposition in making such lofty claims it is nothing less than the privilege it secures to the rational being of participating in the giving of universal laws by which it qualifies him to be a member of a possible kingdom of ends a privilege to which he was already destined by his own nature as being an end in himself and on that account legislating in the kingdom of ends free as regards all laws of physical nature and obeying those only which he himself gives and by which his maxims can belong to a system of universal law to which at the same time he submits himself for nothing has any worth except    what the law assigns it now the legislation itself which assigns the worth of everything must for that very reason possess dignity that is an unconditional incomparable worth and the word respect alone supplies a becoming expression for the esteem which a rational being must have for it autonomy then is the basis of the dignity of human and of every rational nature the three modes of presenting the principle of morality that have been adduced are at bottom only so many formulæ of the very same law and each of itself involves the other two there is however a difference in them but it is rather subjectively than objectively practical intended namely to bring an idea of the reason nearer to intuition by means of a certain analogy and thereby nearer to feeling all maxims in fact have—   a form consisting in universality and in this view the formula of the moral imperative is expressed thus that the maxims must be so chosen as if they were to serve as universal laws of nature      a matter   namely an end and here the formula says that the rational being as it is an end by its own nature and therefore an end in itself must in every maxim serve as the condition limiting all merely relative and arbitrary ends   a complete characterisation of all maxims by means of that formula namely that all maxims ought by their own legislation to harmonise with a possible kingdom of ends as with a kingdom of nature      there is a progress here in the order of the categories of unity of the form of the will its universality plurality of the matter the objects ie the ends and totality of the system of these in forming our moral judgment of actions it is better to proceed always on the strict method and start from the general formula of the categorical imperative act according to a maxim which can at the same time make itself a universal law if however we wish to gain an entrance for the moral law it is very useful to bring one and the same action under the three specified conceptions and thereby as far as possible to bring it nearer to intuition we can now end where we started at the beginning namely with the conception of a will unconditionally good that will is absolutely good which cannot be evil in other words whose maxim if made a universal law could never contradict itself this principle then is its supreme law act always on such a maxim as thou canst at the same time will to be a universal law this is the sole condition under which a will can never contradict itself and such an imperative is categorical since the validity of the will as a universal law for possible actions is analogous to the universal connexion of the existence of things by general laws which is the formal notion of nature in general    the categorical imperative can also be expressed thus act on maxims which can at the same time have for their object themselves as universal laws of nature such then is the formula of an absolutely good will rational nature is distinguished from the rest of nature by this that it sets before itself an end this end would be the matter of every good will    but since in the idea of a will that is absolutely good without being limited by any condition of attaining this or that end we must abstract wholly from every end to be effected since this would make every will only relatively good it follows that in this case the end must be conceived not as an end to be effected but as an independently existing end consequently it is conceived only negatively i e as that which we must never act against and which therefore must never be regarded merely as means but must in every volition be esteemed as an end likewise now this end can be nothing but the subject of all possible ends since this is also the subject of a possible absolutely good will for such a will cannot without contradiction be postponed to any other object the principle so act in regard to every rational being thyself and others that he may always have place in thy maxim as an end in himself is accordingly essentially identical with this other act upon a maxim which at the same time involves its own universal validity for every rational being for that in using means for every end i should limit my maxim by the condition of its holding good as a law for every subject this comes to the same thing as that the fundamental principle of all maxims of action must be that the subject of all ends ie the rational being himself be never employed merely as means but as the supreme condition restricting the use of all means that is in every case as an end likewise it follows incontestably that to whatever laws any rational being may be subject he being an end in himself must be able to regard himself as also legislating universally in respect of these same laws since it is just this fitness of his maxims for universal legislation that distinguishes him as an end in himself    also it follows that this implies his dignity prerogative above all mere physical beings that he must always take his    maxims from the point of view which regards himself and likewise every other rational being as lawgiving beings on which account they are called persons in this way a world of rational beings mundus intelligibilis is possible as a kingdom of ends and this by virtue of the legislation proper to all persons as members therefore every rational being must so act as if he were by his maxims in every case a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends the formal principle of these maxims is so act as if thy maxim were to serve likewise as the universal law of all rational beings a kingdom of ends is thus only possible on the analogy of a kingdom of nature the former however only by maxims that is selfimposed rules the latter only by the laws of efficient causes acting under necessitation from without nevertheless although the system of nature is looked upon as a machine yet so far as it has reference to rational beings as its ends it is given on this account the name of a kingdom of nature now such a kingdom of ends would be actually realised by means of maxims conforming to the canon which the categorical imperative prescribes to all rational beings if they were universally followed but although a rational being even if he punctually follows this maxim himself cannot reckon upon all others being therefore true to the same nor expect that the kingdom of nature and its orderly arrangements shall be in harmony with him as a fitting member so as to form a kingdom of ends to which he himself contributes that is to say that it shall favour his expectation of happiness still that law act according to the maxims of a member of a merely possible kingdom of ends legislating in it universally remains in its full force inasmuch as it commands categorically and it is just in this that the paradox lies that the mere dignity of man as a rational creature  0 without any other end or advantage to be attained thereby in other words respect for a mere idea should yet serve as an inflexible precept of the will and that it is precisely in this independence of the maxim on all such springs of    action that its sublimity consists and it is this that makes every rational subject worthy to be a legislative member in the kingdom of ends for otherwise he would have to be conceived only as subject to the physical law of his wants and although we should suppose the kingdom of nature and the kingdom of ends to be united under one sovereign so that the latter kingdom thereby ceased to be a mere idea and acquired true reality then it would no doubt gain the accession of a strong spring but by no means any increase of its intrinsic worth for this sole absolute lawgiver must notwithstanding this be always conceived as estimating the worth of rational beings only by their disinterested behaviour as prescribed to themselves from that idea the dignity of man alone the essence of things is not altered by their external relations and that which abstracting from these alone constitutes the absolute worth of man is also that by which he must be judged whoever the judge may be and even by the supreme being morality then is the relation of actions to the autonomy of the will that is to the potential universal legislation by its maxims an action that is consistent with the autonomy of the will is permitted one that does not agree therewith is forbidden a will whose maxims necessarily coincide with the laws of autonomy is a holy will good absolutely the dependence of a will not absolutely good on the principle of autonomy moral necessitation is obligation this then cannot be applied to a holy being the objective necessity of actions from obligation is called duty    from what has just been said it is easy to see how it happens that although the conception of duty implies subjection to the law we yet ascribe a certain dignity and sublimity to the person who fulfils all his duties there is not indeed any sublimity in him so far as he is subject to the moral law but inasmuch as in regard to that very law he is likewise a legislator and on that account alone subject to it he has sublimity we have also shown above that neither fear nor inclination but simply respect for the law is the spring which can give actions a moral worth our own will so far as we suppose    it to act only under the condition that its maxims are potentially universal laws this ideal will which is possible to us is the proper object of respect and the dignity of humanity consists just in this capacity of being universally legislative though with the condition that it is itself subject to this same legislation the autonomy of the will as the supreme principle of morality autonomy of the will is that property of it by which it is a law to itself independently on any property of the objects of volition the principle of autonomy then is always so to choose that the same volition shall comprehend the maxims of our choice as a universal law we cannot prove that this practical rule is an imperative ie that the will of every rational being is necessarily bound to it as a condition by a mere analysis of the conceptions which occur in it since it is a synthetical proposition    we must advance beyond the cognition of the objects to a critical examination of the subject that is of the pure practical reason for this synthetic proposition which commands apodictically must be capable of being cognised wholly à priori this matter however does not belong to the present section but that the principle of autonomy in question is the sole principle of morals can be readily shown by mere analysis of the conceptions of morality for by this analysis we find that its principle must be a categorical imperative and that what this commands is neither more nor less than this very autonomy heteronomy of the will as the source of all spurious principles of morality if the will seeks the law which is to determine it anywhere else than in the fitness of its maxims to be universal laws of its own dictation consequently if it goes out of itself and seeks this law in the character of any of its objects there always results heteronomy the will in that case does not give itself the law but it is given by the object through its relation to the will this relation whether it rests on inclination or on conceptions of  0 reason only admits of hypothetical imperatives i ought to do something because i wish for something else on the contrary the moral and therefore categorical imperative says i ought to do so and so even though i should not wish for anything else ex gr the former says i ought not to lie if i would retain my reputation the latter says i ought not to lie although it should not bring me the least discredit the latter therefore must so far abstract from all objects that they shall have no influence on the will in order that practical reason will may not be restricted to administering an interest not belonging to it    but may simply show its own commanding authority as the supreme legislation thus ex gr i ought to endeavour to promote the happiness of others not as if its realization involved any concern of mine whether by immediate inclination or by any satisfaction indirectly gained through reason but simply because a maxim which excludes it cannot be comprehended as a universal law   in one and the same volition classification of all principles of morality which can be founded on the conception of heteronomy here as elsewhere human reason in its pure use so long as it was not critically examined has first tried all possible wrong ways before it succeeded in finding the one true way all principles which can be taken from this point of view are either empirical or rational the former drawn from the principle of happiness are built on physical or moral feelings the latter drawn from the principle of perfection are built either on the rational conception of perfection as a possible effect or on that of an independent perfection the will of god as the determining cause of our will empirical principles are wholly incapable of serving as a foundation for moral laws for the universality with which    these should hold for all rational beings without distinction the unconditional practical necessity which is thereby imposed on them is lost when their foundation is taken from the particular constitution of human nature or the accidental    circumstances in which it is placed the principle of private happiness however is the most objectionable not merely because it is false and experience contradicts the supposition that prosperity is always proportioned to good conduct nor yet merely because it contributes nothing to the establishment of morality—since it is quite a different thing to make a prosperous man and a good man or to make one prudent and sharpsighted for his own interests and to make him virtuous—but because the springs it provides for morality are such as rather undermine it and destroy its sublimity since they put the motives to virtue and to vice in the same class and only teach us to make a better calculation the specific difference between virtue and vice being entirely extinguished on the other hand as to moral feeling this supposed special sense   the appeal to it is indeed superficial when those who cannot think believe that feeling will help them out even in what concerns general laws and besides feelings which naturally differ infinitely in degree cannot furnish a uniform standard of good and evil nor has any one a right to form judgments for others by his own feelings nevertheless this moral feeling is nearer to morality and its dignity in this respect that it pays virtue the honour of ascribing to her immediately the satisfaction and esteem we have for her and does not as it were tell her to her face that we are not attached to her by her beauty but by profit    amongst the rational principles of morality the ontological conception of perfection notwithstanding its defects is better than the theological conception which derives morality    from a divine absolutely perfect will the former is no doubt empty and indefinite and consequently useless for finding in the boundless field of possible reality the greatest amount suitable for us moreover in attempting to distinguish specifically the reality of which we are now speaking from every other it inevitably tends to turn in a circle and cannot avoid tacitly presupposing the morality which it is to explain it is nevertheless preferable to the theological view first because we have no intuition of the divine perfection and can only deduce it from our own conceptions the most important of which is that of morality and our explanation would thus be involved in a gross circle and in the next place if we avoid this the only notion of the divine will remaining to us is a conception made up of the attributes of desire of glory and dominion combined with the awful conceptions of might and vengeance and any system of morals erected on this foundation would be directly opposed to morality however if i had to choose between the notion of the moral sense and that of perfection in general two systems which at least do not weaken morality although they are totally incapable of serving as its foundation then i should decide for the latter because it at least withdraws the decision of the question from the sensibility and brings it to the court of pure reason and although even here it decides nothing it at all events preserves the indefinite idea of a will good in itself free from corruption until it shall be more precisely defined for the rest i think i may be excused here from a detailed refutation of all these doctrines that would only be superfluous labour since it is so easy and is probably so well seen even by those whose office requires them to decide for one of these theories because their hearers would not tolerate suspension of judgment    but what interests us more here is to know that the prime foundation of morality laid down by all these principles is nothing but heteronomy of the will and for this reason they must necessarily miss their aim in every case where an object of the will has to be supposed in order that the rule may be prescribed which is to    determine the will there the rule is simply heteronomy the imperative is conditional namely if or because one wishes for this object one should act so and so hence it can never command morally that is categorically whether the object determines the will by means of inclination as in the principle of private happiness or by means of reason directed to objects of our possible volition generally as in the principle of perfection in either case the will never determines itself immediately by the conception of the action but only by the influence which the foreseen effect of the action has on the will i ought to do something on this account because i wish for something else and here there must be yet another law assumed in me as its subject by which i necessarily will this other thing and this law again requires an imperative to restrict this maxim for the influence which the conception of an object within the reach of our faculties can exercise on the will of the subject in consequence of its natural properties depends on the nature of the subject either the sensibility inclination and taste or the understanding and reason the employment of which is by the peculiar constitution of their nature attended with satisfaction it follows that the law would be properly speaking given by nature and as such it must be known and proved by experience and would consequently be contingent and therefore incapable of being an apodictic practical rule such as the moral rule must be not only so but it is inevitably only heteronomy    the will does not give itself the law but it is given by a foreign impulse by means of a particular natural constitution of the subject adapted to receive it an absolutely good will then the principle of which must be a categorical imperative will be indeterminate as regards all objects and will contain merely the form of volition generally and that as autonomy that is to say the capability of the maxims of every good will to make themselves a universal law is itself the only law which the will of every rational being imposes on itself without needing to assume any spring or interest as a foundation how such a synthetical practical à priori proposition is possible    and why it is necessary is a problem whose solution does not lie within the bounds of the metaphysic of morals and we have not here affirmed its truth much less professed to have a proof of it in our power we simply showed by the development of the universally received notion of morality that an autonomy of the will is inevitably connected with it or rather is its foundation whoever then holds morality to be anything real and not a chimerical idea without any truth must likewise admit the principle of it that is here assigned this section then like the first was merely analytical now to prove that morality is no creation of the brain which it cannot be if the categorical imperative and with it the autonomy of the will is true and as an à priori principle absolutely necessary this supposes the possibility of a synthetic use of pure practical reason which however we cannot venture on without first giving a critical examination of this faculty of reason in the concluding section we shall give the principal outlines of this critical examination as far as is sufficient for our purpose    third section transition from the metaphysic of morals to the critique of pure practical reason    the concept of freedom is the key that explains the autonomy of the will the will is a kind of causality belonging to living beings in so far as they are rational and freedom would be this property of such causality that it can be efficient independently on foreign causes determining it just as physical necessity is the property that the causality of all irrational beings has of being determined to activity by the influence of foreign causes the preceding definition of freedom is negative and therefore unfruitful for the discovery of its essence but it leads to a positive conception which is so much the more full and fruitful since the conception of causality involves that of laws according to which by something that we call cause something else namely the effect must be produced laid down   hence although freedom is not a property of the will depending on physical laws yet it is not for that reason lawless on the contrary it must be a causality acting according to immutable laws but of a peculiar kind otherwise a free will would be an absurdity physical necessity    is a heteronomy of the efficient causes for every effect is possible only according to this law that something else determines the efficient cause to exert its causality what else then can freedom of the will be but autonomy that is the property of the will to be a law to    itself but the proposition the will is in every action a law to itself only expresses the principle to act on no other maxim than that which can also have as an object itself as a universal law now this is precisely the formula of the categorical imperative and is the principle of morality so that a free will and a will subject to moral laws are one and the same on the hypothesis then of freedom of the will morality together with its principle follows from it by mere analysis of the conception however the latter is still a synthetic proposition viz an absolutely good will is that whose maxim can always include itself regarded as a universal law for this property of its maxim can never be discovered by analysing the conception of an absolutely good will now such synthetic propositions are only possible in this way that the two cognitions are connected together by their union with a third in which they are both to be found the positive concept of freedom furnishes this third cognition which cannot as with physical causes be the nature of the sensible world in the concept of which we find conjoined the concept of something in relation as cause to something else as effect we cannot now at once show what this third is to which freedom points us and of which we have an idea à priori nor can we make intelligible how the concept of freedom is shown to be legitimate from principles of pure practical reason and with it the possibility of a categorical imperative but some further preparation is required freedom must be presupposed as a property of the will of all rational beings  0 it is not enough to predicate freedom of our own will from whatever reason if we have not sufficient grounds for predicating the same of all rational beings for as morality serves as a law for us only because we are rational beings it must also hold for all rational beings and as it must be deduced simply from the property of freedom it must be shown that freedom also is a property of all rational beings it is not enough then    to prove it from certain supposed experiences of human nature which indeed is quite impossible and it can only be shown à priori but we must show that it belongs to the activity of all rational beings endowed with a will now i say every being that cannot act except under the idea of freedom is just for that reason in a practical point of view really free that is to say all laws which are inseparably connected with freedom have the same force for him as if his will had been shown to be free in itself by a proof theoretically conclusive   now i affirm that we must attribute to every rational being    which has a will that it has also the idea of freedom and acts entirely under this idea for in such a being we conceive a reason that is practical that is has causality in reference to its objects now we cannot possibly conceive a reason consciously receiving a bias from any other quarter with respect to its judgments for then the subject would ascribe the determination of its judgment not to its own reason but to an impulse it must regard itself as the author of its principles independent on foreign influences consequently as practical reason or as the will of a rational being it must regard itself as free that is to say the will of such a being cannot be a will of its own except under the idea of freedom this idea must therefore in a practical point of view be ascribed to every rational being of the interest attaching to the ideas of morality we have finally reduced the definite conception of morality to the idea of freedom this latter however we could not prove to be actually a property of ourselves or of human nature    only we saw that it must be presupposed if we would conceive a being as rational and conscious of its causality in respect of its actions i e as endowed with a will and so we find that on just the same grounds we must ascribe to every being endowed with reason and will this attribute of determining itself to action under the idea of its freedom now it resulted also from the presupposition of this idea that we became aware of a law that the subjective principles of action i e maxims must always be so assumed that they can also hold as objective    that is universal principles and so serve as universal laws of our own dictation but why then should i subject myself to this principle and that simply as a rational being thus also subjecting to it all other beings endowed with reason i will allow that no interest urges me to this for that would not give a categorical imperative but i must take an interest in it and discern how this comes to pass for this i ought is properly an i would valid for every rational being provided only that reason determined his actions without any hindrance but for beings that are in addition affected as we are by springs of a different kind namely sensibility and in whose case that is not always done which reason alone would do for these that necessity is expressed only as an ought and the subjective necessity is different from the objective it seems then as if the moral law that is the principle of autonomy of the will were properly speaking only presupposed in the idea of freedom and as if we could not prove its reality and objective necessity independently in that case we should still have gained something considerable by at least determining the true principle more exactly than had previously been done but as regards its validity and the practical necessity of subjecting oneself to it we should not have advanced a step for if we were asked why the universal validity of our maxim as a law must be the condition restricting our actions and on what we ground the worth which we assign to this manner of acting—a worth so great that there cannot be any higher interest and if we were asked further how it happens that it is by    this alone a man believes he feels his own personal worth in comparison with which that of an agreeable or disagreeable condition is to be regarded as nothing to these questions we could give no satisfactory answer    we find indeed sometimes that we can take an interest   in a personal quality which does not involve any interest of external condition provided this quality makes us capable of participating in the condition in case reason were to effect the allotment that is to say the mere being worthy of happiness can interest of itself even without the motive of participating in this happiness this judgment however is in fact only the effect of the importance of the moral law which we before presupposed when by the idea of freedom we detach ourselves from every empirical interest but that we ought to detach ourselves from these interests ie to consider ourselves as free in action and yet as subject to certain laws so as to find a worth simply in our own person which can compensate us for the loss of everything that gives worth to our condition this we are not yet able to discern in this way nor do we see how it is possible so to act—in other words whence the moral law derives its obligation it must be freely admitted that there is a sort of circle here from which it seems impossible to escape in the order of efficient causes we assume ourselves free in order that in the order of ends we may conceive ourselves as subject to moral laws and we afterwards conceive ourselves as subject to these laws because we have attributed to ourselves freedom of will for freedom and selflegislation of will are both autonomy and therefore are reciprocal conceptions and for this very reason one must not be used to explain the other or give the reason of it but at most only for logical purposes to reduce apparently different notions of the same object to one single concept as we reduce different fractions of the same value to the lowest terms one resource remains to us namely to inquire whether we do not occupy different points of view when by means of  0 freedom    we think ourselves as causes efficient à priori and when we form our conception of ourselves from our actions as effects which we see before our eyes it is a remark which needs no subtle reflection to make but which we may assume that even the commonest understanding can make although it be after its fashion by an obscure discernment of judgment which it calls feeling that all the ideas   that come to us involuntarily as those of the senses do not enable us to know objects otherwise than as they affect us so that what they may be in themselves remains unknown to us and consequently that as regards ideas of this kind even with the closest attention and clearness that the understanding can apply to them we can by them only attain to the knowledge of appearances never to that of things in themselves as soon as this distinction has once been made perhaps merely in consequence of the difference observed between the ideas given us from without and in which we are passive and those that we produce simply from ourselves and in which we show our own activity then it follows of itself that we must admit and assume behind the appearance something else that is not an appearance namely the things in themselves although we must admit that as they can never be known to us except as they affect us we can come no nearer to them nor can we ever know what they are in themselves this must furnish a distinction however crude between a world of sense and the world of understanding of which the former may be different according to the difference of the sensuous impressions in various observers while the second which is its basis always remains the same even as to himself a man cannot pretend to know what he is in himself from the knowledge he has by internal sensation    for as he does not as it were create himself and does not come by the conception of himself à priori but empirically it naturally follows that he can obtain his knowledge even of himself only by the inner sense and consequently    only through the appearances of his nature and the way in which his consciousness is affected at the same time beyond these characteristics of his own subject made up of mere appearances he must necessarily suppose something else as their basis namely his ego whatever its characteristics in itself may be thus in respect to mere perception and receptivity of sensations he must reckon himself as belonging to the world of sense but in respect of whatever there may be of pure activity in him that which reaches consciousness immediately and not through affecting the senses he must reckon himself as belonging to the intellectual world of which however he has no further knowledge to such a conclusion the reflecting man must come with respect to all the things which can be presented to him it is probably to be met with even in persons of the commonest understanding who as is well known are very much inclined to suppose behind the objects of the senses something else invisible and acting of itself they spoil it however by presently sensualizing this invisible again that is to say wanting to make it an object of intuition so that they do not become a whit the wiser now man really finds in himself a faculty by which he distinguishes himself from everything else even from himself as affected by objects and that is reason this being pure spontaneity is even elevated above the understanding for although the latter is a spontaneity and does not like sense merely contain intuitions that arise when we are affected by things and are therefore passive yet it cannot produce from its activity any other conceptions than those which merely serve to bring the intuitions of sense under rules    and thereby to unite them in one consciousness and without this use of the sensibility it could not think at all whereas on the contrary reason shows so pure a spontaneity in the case of what i call ideas ideal conceptions that it thereby far transcends everything that the sensibility can give it and exhibits its most important function in distinguishing the world of sense from that of understanding and thereby prescribing the limits of the understanding itself    for this reason a rational being must regard himself qua intelligence not from the side of his lower faculties as belonging not to the world of sense but to that of understanding hence he has two points of view from which he can regard himself and recognise laws of the exercise of his faculties and consequently of all his actions first so far as he belongs to the world of sense he finds himself subject to laws of nature heteronomy secondly as belonging to the intelligible world under laws which being independent on nature have their foundation not in experience but in reason alone as a rational being and consequently belonging to the intelligible world man can never conceive the causality of his own will otherwise than on condition of the idea of freedom for independence on the determining causes of the sensible world an independence which reason must always ascribe to itself is freedom now the idea of freedom is inseparably connected with the conception of autonomy and this again with the universal principle of morality which is ideally the foundation of all actions of rational beings just as the law of nature is of all phenomena now the suspicion is removed which we raised above that there was a latent circle involved in our reasoning from freedom to autonomy and from this to the moral law viz that we laid down the idea of freedom because of the moral law only that we might afterwards in turn infer the latter from freedom    and that consequently we could assign no reason at all for this law but could only present   it as a petitio principii which well disposed minds would gladly concede to us but which we could never put forward as a provable proposition for now we see that when we conceive ourselves as free we transfer ourselves into the world of understanding as members of it and recognise the autonomy of the will with its consequence morality whereas if we conceive ourselves as under obligation we consider ourselves as belonging to the world of sense and at the same time to the world of understanding    how is a categorical imperative possible every rational being reckons himself qua intelligence as belonging to the world of understanding and it is simply as an efficient cause belonging to that world that he calls his causality a will on the other side he is also conscious of himself as a part of the world of sense in which his actions which are mere appearances phenomena of that causality are displayed we cannot however discern how they are possible from this causality which we do not know but instead of that these actions as belonging to the sensible world must be viewed as determined by other phenomena namely desires and inclinations if therefore i were only a member of the world of understanding then all my actions would perfectly conform to the principle of autonomy of the pure will if i were only a part of the world of sense they would necessarily be assumed to conform wholly to the natural law of desires and inclinations in other words to the heteronomy of nature the former would rest on morality as the supreme principle the latter on happiness since however the world of understanding contains the foundation of the world of sense and consequently of its laws also and accordingly gives the law to my will which belongs wholly to the world of understanding directly    and must be conceived as doing so it follows that although on the one side i must regard myself as a being belonging to the world of sense yet on the other side i must recognise myself as subject as an intelligence to the law of the world of understanding ie to reason which contains this law in the idea of freedom and therefore as subject to the autonomy of the will consequently i must regard the laws of the world of understanding as imperatives for me and the actions which conform to them as duties and thus what makes categorical imperatives possible is this that the idea of freedom makes me a member of an intelligible world in consequence of which if i were nothing else all my actions would always conform to the autonomy of the will but as i at the same time intuite myself as a member of the world    of sense they ought so to conform and this categorical ought implies a synthetic à priori proposition inasmuch as besides my will as affected by sensible desires there is added further the idea of the same will but as belonging to the world of the understanding pure and practical of itself which contains the supreme condition according to reason of the former will precisely as to the intuitions of sense there are added concepts of the understanding which of themselves signify nothing but regular form in general and in this way synthetic à priori propositions become possible on which all knowledge of physical nature rests the practical use of common human reason confirms this reasoning there is no one not even the most consummate villain provided only that he is otherwise accustomed to the use of reason who when we set before him examples of honesty of purpose of steadfastness in following good maxims of sympathy and general benevolence even combined with great sacrifices of advantages and comfort does not wish that he might also possess these qualities only on account of his inclinations and impulses he cannot attain this in himself    but at the same time he wishes to be free from such inclinations which are bundensome to himself he proves by this that he transfers himself in thought with a will free from the impulses of the sensibility into an order of things wholly different from that of his desires in the field of the sensibility since he cannot expect to obtain by that wish any gratification of his desires nor any position which would satisfy any of his actual or supposable inclinations for this would destroy the preeminence of the very idea which wrests that wish from him he can only expect a greater intrinsic worth of his own person this better person however he imagines himself to be when he transfers himself to the point of view of a member of the world of the understanding to which he is involuntarily forced by the idea of freedom ie of independence on determining causes of the world of sense and from this point of view he is conscious of a good will which by his own confession constitutes the law for the bad will that he possesses as a member of the world of sense—a law whose authority he    recognises while transgressing it what he morally ought is then what he necessarily would as a member of the world of the understanding and is conceived by him as an ought only inasmuch as he likewise considers himself as a member of the world of sense on the extreme limits of all practical philosophy all men attribute to themselves freedom of will hence come all judgments upon actions as being such as ought to have been done although they have not been done however this freedom is not a conception of experience nor can it be so since it still remains  0 even though experience shows the contrary of what on supposition of freedom are conceived as its necessary consequences on the other side it is equally necessary that everything that takes place should be fixedly determined according to laws of nature this necessity of nature is likewise not an empirical conception just for this reason that it involves the motion of necessity and consequently of à priori cognition but this conception of a system of nature is confirmed by experience and it must even be inevitably presupposed if experience itself is to be possible that is a connected knowledge of the objects of sense resting on general laws therefore freedom is only an idea ideal conception of reason and its objective reality in itself is doubtful while nature is a concept of the understanding which proves and must necessarily prove its reality in examples of experience there arises from this a dialectic of reason since the freedom attributed to the will appears to contradict the necessity of nature and placed between these two ways reason for speculative purposes finds the road of physical necessity much more beaten and more appropriate than that of freedom yet for practical purposes the narrow footpath of freedom is the only one on which it is possible to make use of reason in our conduct hence it is just as impossible for the subtlest philosophy as for the commonest reason of men to argue away freedom philosophy must then assume that no real contradiction will be found between freedom and physical necessity of the same human    actions for it cannot give up the conception of nature any more than that of freedom nevertheless even though we should never be able to comprehend how freedom is possible we must at least remove this apparent contradiction in a convincing manner for if the thought of freedom contradicts either itself or nature which is equally necessary    it must in competition with physical necessity be entirely given up it would however be impossible to escape this contradiction if the thinking subject which seems to itself free conceived itself in the same sense or in the very same relation when it calls itself free as when in respect of the same action it assumes itself to be subject to the law of nature hence it is an indispensable problem of speculative philosophy to show that its illusion respecting the contradiction rests on this that we think of man in a different sense and relation when we call him free and when we regard him as subject to the laws of nature as being part and parcel of nature it must therefore show that not only can both these very well coexist but that both must be thought as necessarily united in the same subject since otherwise no reason could be given why we should burden reason with an idea which though it may possibly without contradiction be reconciled with another that is sufficiently established yet entangles us in a perplexity which sorely embarrasses reason in its theoretic employment this duty however belongs only to speculative philosophy in order that it may clear the way for practical philosophy the philosopher then has no option whether he will remove the apparent contradiction or leave it untouched for in the latter case the theory respecting this would be bonum vacans into the possession of which the fatalist would have a right to enter and chase all morality out of its supposed domain as occupying it without title we cannot however as yet say that we are touching the bounds of practical philosophy for the settlement of that controversy does not belong to it it only demands from speculative reason that it should put an end to the discord in which it entangles itself in theoretical questions so that    practical reason may have rest and security from external attacks    which might make the ground debatable on which it desires to build the claims to freedom of will made even by common reason are founded on the consciousness and the admitted supposition that reason is independent on merely subjectively determined causes which together constitute what belongs to sensation only and which consequently come under the general designation of sensibility man considering himself in this way as an intelligence places himself thereby in a different order of things and in a relation to determining grounds of a wholly different kind when on the one hand he thinks of himself as an intelligence endowed with a will and consequently with causality and when on the other he perceives himself as a phenomenon in the world of sense as he really is also and affirms that his causality is subject to external determination according to laws of nature   now he soon becomes aware that both can hold good nay must hold good at the same time for there is not the smallest contradiction in saying that a thing in appearance belonging to the world of sense is subject to certain laws on which the very same as a thing or being in itself is independent and that he must conceive and think of himself in this twofold way rests as to the first on the consciousness of himself as an object affected through the senses and as to the second on the consciousness of himself as an intelligence i e as independent on sensible impressions in the employment of his reason in other words as belonging to the world of understanding hence it comes to pass that man claims the possession of a will which takes no account of anything that comes under the head of desires and inclinations and on the contrary conceives actions as possible to him nay even as necessary which can only be done by disregarding all desires and sensible inclinations    the causality of such actions   lies in him as an intelligence and in the laws of effects and actions which depend on the principles    of an intelligible world of which indeed he knows nothing more than that in it pure reason alone independent on sensibility gives the law moreover since it is only in that world as an intelligence that he is his proper self being as man only the appearance of himself those laws apply to him directly and categorically so that the incitements of inclinations and appetites in other words the whole nature of the world of sense cannot impair the laws of his volition as an intelligence nay he does not even hold himself responsible for the former or ascribe them to his proper self i e his will he only ascribes to his will any indulgence which he might yield them if he allowed them to influence his maxims to the prejudice of the rational laws of the will when practical reason thinks itself into a world of understanding it does not thereby transcend its own limits as it would if it tried to enter it by intuition or sensation the former is only a negative thought in respect of the world of sense which does not give any laws to reason in determining the will and is positive only in this single point that this freedom as a negative characteristic is at the same time conjoined with a positive faculty and even with a causality of reason which we designate a will namely a faculty of so acting that the principle of the actions shall conform to the essential character of a rational motive i e the condition that the maxim have universal validity as a law but were it to borrow an object of will that is a motive from the world of understanding then it would overstep its bounds and pretend to be acquainted with something of which it knows nothing the conception of a world of the understanding is then only a point of view which reason finds itself compelled to take outside the appearances in order to conceive itself as practical which would not be possible if the influences of the sensibility had a    determining power on man    but which is necessary unless he is to be denied the consciousness of himself as an intelligence and consequently as a rational cause energizing by reason that is operating freely this thought certainly involves the idea of an order and a system of laws different from that of the mechanism of nature which belongs to the sensible world and it makes the conception of an intelligible world necessary that is to say the whole system of rational beings as things in themselves but it does not in the least authorize us to think of it further than as to its formal condition only that is the universality of the maxims of the will as laws and consequently the autonomy of the latter which alone is consistent with its freedom whereas on the contrary all laws that refer to a definite object give heteronomy which only belongs to laws of nature and can only apply to the sensible world but reason would overstep all its bounds if it undertook to explain how pure reason can be practical which would be exactly the same problem as to explain how freedom is possible for we can explain nothing but that which we can reduce to laws the object of which can be given in some possible experience but freedom is a mere idea ideal conception the objective reality of which can in no wise be shown according to laws of nature and consequently not in any possible experience and for this reason it can never be comprehended or understood because we cannot support it by any sort of example or analogy it holds good only as a necessary hypothesis of reason in a being that believes itself conscious of a will that is of a faculty distinct from mere desire namely a faculty of determining itself to action as an intelligence in other words by laws of reason independently on natural instincts    now where determination according to laws of nature ceases there all explanation ceases also and nothing remains but defence i e the removal of the objections of those who pretend to have seen deeper into the nature of things and thereupon boldly declare freedom impossible we can only point out to them that the  0 supposed contradiction that they have discovered in it arises only from this that in order to be able to apply the law of nature to human actions they must necessarily consider man as an appearance then when we demand of them that they should also think of him qua intelligence as a thing in itself they still persist in considering him in this respect also as an appearance in this view it would no doubt be a contradiction to suppose the causality of the same subject that is his will to be withdrawn from all the natural laws of the sensible world but this contradiction disappears if they would only bethink themselves and admit as is reasonable that behind the appearances there must also lie at their root although hidden the things in themselves and that we cannot expect the laws of these to be the same as those that govern their appearances the subjective impossibility of explaining the freedom of the will is identical with the impossibility of discovering and explaining an interest   which    man can take in the moral law nevertheless he does actually take an interest in it the basis of which in us we call the moral feeling which some have falsely assigned as the standard of our moral judgment whereas it must rather be viewed as the subjective effect that the law exercises on the will the objective principle of which is furnished by reason alone in order indeed that a rational being who is also affected through the senses should will what reason alone directs such    beings that they ought to will it is no doubt requisite that reason should have a power to infuse a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction in the fulfilment of duty that is to say that it should have a causality by which it determines the sensibility according to its own principles but it is quite impossible to discern i e to make it intelligible à priori how a mere thought which itself contains nothing sensible can itself produce a sensation of pleasure or pain for this is a particular kind of causality of which as of every other causality we can determine nothing whatever à priori we must only consult experience about it but as this cannot supply us with any relation of cause and effect except between two objects of experience whereas in this case although indeed the effect produced lies within experience yet the cause is supposed to be pure reason acting through mere ideas which offer no object to experience it follows that for us men it is quite impossible to explain how and why the universality of the maxim as a law that is morality interests this only is certain that it is not because it interests us that it has validity for us for that would be heteronomy and dependence of practical reason on sensibility namely on a feeling as its principle in which case it could never give moral laws    but that it interests us because it is valid for us as men inasmuch as it had its source in our will as intelligences in other words in our proper self and what belongs to mere appearance is necessarily subordinated by reason to the nature of the thing in itself the question then how a categorical imperative is possible can be answered to this extent that we can assign the only hypothesis on which it is possible namely the idea of freedom and we can also discern the necessity of this hypothesis and this is sufficient for the practical exercise of reason that is for the conviction of the validity of this imperative and hence of the moral law but how this hypothesis itself is possible can never be discerned by any human reason on the hypothesis however that the will of an intelligence is free its autonomy as the essential formal condition of its determination is a necessary consequence moreover this freedom of will is not merely quite    possible as a hypothesis not involving any contradiction to the principle of physical necessity in the connexion of the phenomena of the sensible world as speculative philosophy can show but further a rational being who is conscious of a causality   through reason that is to say of a will distinct from desires must of necessity make it practically that is in idea the condition of all his voluntary actions but to explain how pure reason can be of itself practical without the aid of any spring of action that could be derived from any other source i e how the mere principle of the universal validity of all its maxims as laws which would certainly be the form of a pure practical reason can of itself supply a spring without any matter object of the will in which one could antecedently take any interest    and how it can produce an interest which would be called purely moral or in other words how pure reason can be practical—to explain this is beyond the power of human reason and all the labour and pains of seeking an explanation of it are lost it is just the same as if i sought to find out how freedom itself is possible as the causality of a will for then i quit the ground of philosophical explanation and i have no other to go upon i might indeed revel in the world of intelligences which still remains to me but although i have an idea of it which is well founded yet i have not the least knowledge of it nor can i ever attain to such knowledge with all the efforts of my natural faculty of reason it signifies only a something that remains over when i have eliminated everything belonging to the world of sense from the actuating principles of my will serving merely to keep in bounds the principle of motives taken from the field of sensibility fixing its limits and showing that it does not contain all in all within itself but that there is more beyond it but this something more i know no further of pure reason which frames this ideal there remains after the abstraction of all matter i e knowledge of objects nothing but the form namely the practical law of the universality of the    maxims and in conformity with this the conception of reason in reference to a pure world of understanding as a possible efficient cause that is a cause determining the will there must here be a total absence of springs unless this idea of an intelligible world is itself the spring or that in which reason primarily takes an interest but to make this intelligible is precisely the problem that we cannot solve here now is the extreme limit of all moral inquiry    and it is of great importance to determine it even on this account in order that reason may not on the one hand to the prejudice of morals seek about in the world of sense for the supreme motive and an interest comprehensible but empirical and on the other hand that it may not impotently flap its wings without being able to move in the for it empty space of transcendent concepts which we call the intelligible world and so lose itself amidst chimeras for the rest the idea of a pure world of understanding as a system of all intelligences and to which we ourselves as rational beings belong although we are likewise on the other side members of the sensible world this remains always a useful and legitimate idea for the purposes of rational belief although all knowledge stops at its threshold useful namely to produce in us a lively interest in the moral law by means of the noble ideal of a universal kingdom of ends in themselves rational beings to which we can belong as members then only when we carefully conduct ourselves according to the maxims of freedom as if they were laws of nature concluding remark the speculative employment of reason with respect to nature leads to the absolute necessity of some supreme cause of the world the practical employment of reason with a view to freedom leads also to absolute necessity but only of the laws of the actions of a rational being as such now it is an essential principle of reason however employed to push its knowledge to a consciousness of its necessity without which it would not be rational knowledge it is however an equally essential restriction of the same reason that it can neither discern the    necessity  00 of what is or what happens nor of what ought to happen unless a condition is supposed on which it is or happens or ought to happen in this way however by the constant inquiry for the condition the satisfaction of reason is only further and further postponed hence it unceasingly seeks the unconditionally necessary and finds itself forced to assume it although without any means of making it comprehensible to itself happy enough if only it can discover a conception which agrees with this assumption it is therefore no fault in our deduction of the supreme principle of morality but an objection that should be made to human reason in general that it cannot enable us to conceive the absolute necessity of an unconditional practical law such as the categorical imperative must be it cannot be blamed for refusing to explain this necessity by a condition that is to say by means of some interest assumed as a basis since the law would then cease to be a moral law i e a supreme law of freedom and thus while we do not comprehend the practical unconditional necessity of the moral imperative we yet comprehend its incomprehensibility and this is all that can be fairly demanded of a philosophy which strives to carry its principles up to the very limit of human reason    critical examination of practical reason       preface this work is called the critical examination of practical reason not of the pure practical reason although its parallelism with the speculative critique would seem to require the latter term the reason of this appears sufficiently from the treatise itself its business is to show that there is pure practical reason and for this purpose it criticises the entire practical faculty of reason if it succeeds in this it has no need to criticise the pure faculty itself in order to see whether reason in making such a claim does not presumptuously overstep itself as is the case with the speculative reason for if as pure reason it is actually practical it proves its own reality and that of its concepts by fact and all disputation against the possibility of its being real is futile with this faculty transcendental freedom is also established freedom namely in that absolute sense in which speculative reason required it in its use of the concept of causality in order to escape the antinomy into which it inevitably falls when in the chain of cause and effect it tries to think the unconditioned speculative reason could only exhibit this concept of freedom problematically as not impossible to thought without assuring it any objective reality and merely lest the supposed impossibility of what it must at least allow to be thinkable  0     should endanger its very being and plunge it into an abyss of scepticism inasmuch as the reality of the concept of freedom is proved by an apodictic law of practical reason it is the keystone of the whole system of pure reason even the speculative and all other concepts those of god and immortality which as being mere ideas remain in it unsupported now attach themselves to this concept and by it obtain consistence and objective reality that is to say their possibility is proved by the fact that freedom actually exists for this idea is revealed by the moral law freedom however is the only one of all the ideas of the speculative reason of which we know the possibility à priori without however understanding it because it is the condition of the moral law which we know   the ideas of god and immortality however are not conditions of the moral law but only conditions of the necessary object of a will determined by this law that is to say conditions of the practical use of our pure reason hence with respect to these ideas we cannot affirm that we know and understand i will not say the actuality but even the possibility of them however they are the conditions of the application of the morally  0  determined will to its object which is given to    it à priori viz the summum bonum consequently in this practical point of view their possibility must be assumed although we cannot theoretically know and understand it to justify this assumption it is sufficient in a practical point of view that they contain no intrinsio impossibility contradiction here we have what as far as speculative reason is concerned is a merely subjective principle of assent which however is objectively valid for a reason equally pure but practical and this principle by means of the concept of freedom assures objective reality and authority to the ideas of god and immortality nay there is a subjective necessity a need of pure reason to assume them nevertheless the theoretical knowledge of reason is not hereby enlarged but only the possibility is given which heretofore was merely a problem and now becomes assertion and thus the practical use of reason is connected with the elements of theoretical reason and this need is not a merely hypothetical one for the arbitrary purposes of speculation that we must assume something if we wish in speculation to carry reason to its utmost limits but it is a need which has the force of law to assume something without which that cannot be which we must inevitably set before us as the aim of our action it would certainly be more satisfactory to our speculative reason if it could solve these problems for itself without this circuit and preserve the solution for practical use as a thing to be referred to but in fact our faculty of speculation is not so well provided those who boast of such high knowledge ought not to keep it back but to exhibit it publicly that it may be tested and appreciated they want to prove very good let them prove and the critical philosophy lays its arms at their feet as the victors quid statis nolint  0 atqui licet esse beatis as they then do not in fact choose to do so probably because  0  they cannot we must take up these arms again in order to seek in the mortal use of reason and to base on this the notions of god freedom and immortality the possibility of which speculation cannot adequately prove here first is explained the enigma of the oritical philosophy viz how we deny objective reality to the supersensible use of the categories in speculation and yet admit this reality with respect to the objects of pure practical reason this must at first seem inconsistent as long as this practical use is only nominally known but when by a thorough analysis of it one becomes aware that the reality spoken of does not imply any theoretical determination of the categories and extension of our knowledge to the supersensible but that what is meant is that in this respect an object belongs to them because either they are contained in the necessary determination of the will à priori or are inseparably connected with its object then this inconsistency disappears because the use we make of these concepts is different from what speculative reason requires on the other hand there now appears an unexpected and very satisfactory proof of the consistency of the speculative critical philosophy for whereas it insisted that the objects of experience as such including our own subject have only the value of phenomena while at the same time things in themselves must be supposed as their basis so that not everything supersensible was to be regarded as a fiction and its concepts as empty so now practical reason itself without any concert with the speculative assures reality to a supersensible object of the category of causality viz freedom although as becomes a practical concept  0  only    for practical use and this establishes on the evidence of a fact that which in the former case could only be conceived by this the strange but certain doctrine of the speculative critical philosophy that the thinking subject is to itself in internal intuition only a phenomenon obtains in the critical examination of the practical reason its full confirmation and that so thoroughly that we should be compelled to adopt this doctrine even if the former had never proved it at all   by this also i can understand why the most considerable objections which i have as yet met with against the critique turn about these two points namely on the one side the objective reality of the categories as applied to noumena which is in the theoretical department of knowledge denied in the practical affirmed and on the other side the paradoxical demand to regard oneself quâ subject of freedom as a noumenon and at the same time from the point of view of physical nature as a phenomenon in ones own empirical consciousness for as long as one has formed no definite notions of morality and freedom one could not conjecture on the one side what was intended to be the noumenon the basis of the alleged phenomenon and on the other side it seemed doubtful whether it was at all possible to form any notion of it seeing that we had previously assigned all the notions of the pure understanding in its theoretical use exclusively to phenomena nothing but a detailed criticism of the practical reason can remove all this    misapprehension and set in a clear light the consistency which constitutes its greatest merit   0 so much by way of justification of the proceeding by which in this work the notions and principles of pure speculative reason which have already undergone their special critical examination are now and then again subjected to examination this would not in other cases be in accordance with the systematic process by which a science is established since matters which have been decided ought only to be cited and not again discussed in this case however it was not only allowable but necessary because reason is here considered in transition to a different use of these concepts from what it had made of them before such a transition necessitates a comparison of the old and the new usage in order to distinguish well the new path from the old one and at the same time to allow their connexion to be observed accordingly considerations of this kind including those which are once more directed to the concept of freedom in the practical use of the pure reason must not be regarded as an interpolation serving only to fill up the gaps in the critical system of speculative reason for this is for its own purpose complete or like the props and buttresses which in a hastily constructed building are often added afterwards but as true members which make the connexion of the system plain and show us concepts here presented as real which there could only be presented problematically this remark applies especially to the concept of freedom respecting which one cannot but observe with surprise that so many boast of being able to understand it quite well and to explain its possibility while they regard it only psychologically whereas if they had studied it in a transcendental point of view they must    have recognised that it is not only indispensable as a problematical concept in the complete use of speculative reason but also quite incomprehensible     and if they afterwards came to consider its practical use they must needs have come to the very mode of determining the principles of this to which they are now so loth to assent the concept of freedom is the stone of stumbling for all empiricists but at the same time the key to the loftiest practical principles for critical moralists who perceive by its means that they must necessarily proceed by a rational method for this reason i beg the reader not to pass lightly over what is said of this concept at the end of the analytic i must leave it to those who are acquainted with works of this kind to judge whether such a system as that of the practical reason which is here developed from the critical examination of it has cost much or little trouble especially in seeking not to miss the true point of view from which the whole can be rightly sketched it presupposes indeed the fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals but only in so far as this gives a preliminary acquaintance with the principle of duty and assigns and justifies a definite formula thereof in other respects it is independent   it results from the nature of this practical faculty itself that    the complete classification of all practical sciences cannot be added as in the critique of the speculative reason     for it is not possible to define duties specially as human duties with a view to their classification until the subject of this definition viz man is known according to his actual nature at least so far as is necessary with respect to duty this however does not belong to a critical examination of the practical reason the business of which is only to assign in a complete manner the principles of its possibility extent and limits without special reference to human nature the classification then belongs to the system of science not to the system of criticism in the second part of the analytic i have given as i trust a sufficient answer to the objection of a truthloving and acute critic   of the fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals—a critic always worthy of respect—the objection namely that the notion of good was not established before the moral principle as he thinks it ought to have been          i have also had regard to many of the objections which have reached me from men who show that they have at heart the discovery of the truth and i shall continue to do so for those who have only their old system before their eyes and who have already settled what is to be approved or disapproved do not desire any explanation which might stand in the way of their own private opinion when we have to study a particular faculty of the human mind in its sources its content and its limits then from the nature of human knowledge we must begin with its parts with an accurate and complete exposition of them complete namely so far as is possible in the present state of our knowledge of its elements but there is another thing to be attended to which is of a more philosophical and architectonic character namely to grasp correctly the idea of the whole and from thence to get a view of all those parts as mutually related by the aid of pure reason and by means of their derivation from the concept of the whole     this is only    possible through the most intimate acquaintance with the system and those who find the first inquiry too troublesome and do not think it worth their while to attain such an acquaintance cannot reach the second stage namely the general view which is a synthetical return to that which had previously been given analytically it is no wonder then if they find inconsistencies everywhere although the gaps which these indicate are not in the system itself but in their own incoherent train of thought i have no fear as regards this treatise of the reproach that i wish to introduce a new language since the sort of knowledge here in question has itself somewhat of an everyday character nor even in the case of the former critique could this reproach occur to any one who had thought it through and not merely turned over the leaves to invent new words where the language has no lack of expressions for given notions is a childish effort to distinguish oneself from the crowd if not by new and true thoughts yet by new patches on the old garment if therefore the readers of that work know any more familiar expressions which are as suitable to the thought as those seem to me to be or if they think they can show the futility of these thoughts themselves and hence that of the expression they would in the first case very much oblige me for i only desire to be understood and in the second case they would deserve well of philosophy but as long as these thoughts stand i very much doubt that suitable and yet more common expressions for them can be found          in this manner then the à priori principles of two faculties of the mind the faculty of cognition and     that of desire would be found and determined as to the conditions extent and limits of their use and thus a sure foundation be laid for a scientific system of philosophy both theoretic and practical nothing worse could happen to these labourers than that anyone should make the unexpected discovery that there neither is nor can be any à priori knowledge at all but there is no danger of this this would be the same thing as if one sought to prove by reason that there is no reason for we only say that we know something by reason when we are conscious that we could have known it even if it had not been given to us in experience hence rational knowledge and knowledge à priori are one and the same it is a clear contradiction to try to extract necessity from a principle of experience ex pumice aquam and to try by this to give a judgment true universality without which there is no rational inference not even inference from analogy which is at least a presumed universality and objective necessity to substitute subjective necessity that is custom for objective which exists only in à priori judgments is to deny to reason the power of judging about the object ie of knowing it and what belongs to it it implies for example that we must not say of something which often or always follows a certain antecedent state that we can conclude from this to that for this would imply objective necessity and the notion of an à priori connexion but only that we may expect    similar cases just as animals do that is that we reject the notion of cause altogether as false and a mere delusion as to attempting to remedy this want of objective and consequent universal validity by saying that we can see no ground     for attributing any other sort of knowledge to other rational beings if this reasoning were valid our ignorance would do more for the enlargement of our knowledge than all our meditation for then on this very ground that we have no knowledge of any other rational beings besides man we should have a right to suppose them to be of the same nature as we know ourselves to be that is we should really know them i omit to mention that universal assent does not prove the objective validity of a judgment ie its validity as a cognition and although this universal assent should accidentally happen it could furnish no proof of agreement with the object on the contrary it is the objective validity which alone constitutes the basis of a necessary universal consent    hume would be quite satisfied with this system of universal empiricism for as is well known he desired nothing more than that instead of ascribing any objective meaning to the necessity in the concept of cause a merely subjective one should be assumed viz custom in order to deny that reason could judge about god freedom and immortality and if once his principles were granted he was certainly well able to deduce his conclusions therefrom with all logical coherence but even hume did not make his empiricism so universal as to include mathematics he holds the principles of mathematics to be analytical and if this were correct they would certainly be apodictic also but we could not infer from this that reason has the faculty of forming apodictic judgments in philosophy also—that is to say those which are synthetical judgments like the judgment of causality but if we adopt a universal empiricism then mathematics will be included now if this science is in contradiction with a reason that  00 admits only empirical principles     as it inevitably is in the antinomy in which mathematics prove the infinite divisibility of space which empiricism cannot admit then the greatest possible evidence of demonstration is in manifest contradiction with the alleged conclusions from experience and we are driven to ask like cheseldens blind patient which deceives me sight or touch for empiricism is based on a necessity felt rationalism on a necessity seen and thus universal empiricism reveals itself as absolute scepticism it is erroneous to attribute this in such an unqualified sense to hume   since he left at least one certain touchstone of experience namely mathematics whereas thorough scepticism admits no such touchstone which can only be found in à priori principles although experience consists not only of feelings but also of judgments however as in this philosophical and critical age such empiricism can scarcely be serious and it is probably put forward only as an intellectual exercise and for the purpose of putting in a clearer light by contrast the necessity of rational à priori principles we can only be grateful to those who employ themselves in this otherwise uninstructive labour  0  introduction of the idea of a critique of practical reason the theoretical use of reason was concerned with objects of the cognitive faculty only and a critical examination of it with reference to this use applied properly only to the pure faculty of cognition because this raised the suspicion which was afterwards confirmed that it might easily pass beyond its limits and be lost among unattainable objects or even contradictory notions it is quite different with the practical use of reason in this reason is concerned with the grounds of determination of the will which is a faculty either to produce objects corresponding to ideas or to determine ourselves to the effecting of such objects whether the physical power is sufficient or not that is to determine our causality for here reason can at least attain so far as to determine the will and has always objective reality in so far as it is the volition only that is in question the first question here then is whether pure reason of itself alone suffices to determine the will or whether it can be a ground of determination only as dependent on empirical conditions   0 now here there comes in a notion of causality justified by the critique of the pure reason although not capable of being presented empirically viz that of freedom and if we can now discover means of proving that this property does in fact belong to the human will and so to the will of all rational beings then it will not only be shown that pure reason can be practical but that it alone and not reason empirically limited is indubitably practical consequently we shall have to make a critical examination not of pure practical reason but  0  only of practical reason generally for when once pure reason is shown to exist it needs no critical examination for reason itself contains the standard for the critical examination of every use of it the critique then of practical reason generally is bound to prevent the empirically conditioned reason from claiming exclusively to furnish the ground of determination of the will if it is proved that there is a practical   reason its employment is alone immanent the empirically conditioned use which claims supremacy is on the contrary transcendent and expresses itself in demands and precepts which go quite beyond its sphere this is just the opposite of what might be said of pure reason in its speculative employment however as it is still pure reason the knowledge of which is here the foundation of its practical employment the general outline of the classification of a critique of practical reason must be arranged in accordance with that of the speculative we must then have the elements and the methodology of it and in the former an analytic as the rule of truth and a dialectic as the exposition and dissolution of the illusion in the judgments of practical reason     but the order in the subdivision of the analytic will be the reverse of that in the critique of the pure speculative reason for in the present case we shall commence with the principles and proceed to the concepts and only then if possible to the senses whereas in the case of the speculative reason we began with the senses and had to end with the principles the reason of this lies again in this that now we have to do with a will and have to consider reason not in its relation to objects but to this will and its causality we must then begin with the principles of a causality not empirically conditioned after which the attempt can be made to establish our notions of the determining grounds of such a will of their application to objects and finally to the subject and its sense faculty we necessarily begin with the law of causality from freedom that is with a pure practical principle and this determines the objects to which alone it can be applied  0  part first elements of pure practical reason  0   0  book i the analytic of pure practical reason chapter i of the principles of pure practical reason § i — definition practical principles are propositions which contain a general determination of the will having under it several practical rules they are subjective or maxims when the condition is regarded by the subject as valid only for his own will but are objective or practical laws when the condition is recognised as objective that is valid for the will of every rational being remark supposing that pure reason contains in itself a practical motive     that is one adequate to determine the will then there are practical laws otherwise all practical principles will be mere maxims in case the will of a rational being is pathologically affected there may occur a conflict of the maxims with the practical laws recognised by itself for example one may make it his maxim to let no injury pass unrevenged and yet he may see that this is not a practical law but only his own maxim that on the contrary regarded as being in one and the same maxim a rule for the will of every rational being it must contradict itself in natural philosophy the principles of what happens eg  0  the principle of equality of action and reaction in the communication of motion are at the same time laws of nature for the use of reason there is theoretical and determined by the nature of the object in practical philosophy ie that which has to do only with the grounds of determination of the will the principles which a man makes for himself are not laws by which one is inevitably bound because reason in practical matters has to do with the subject namely with the faculty of desire the special character of which may occasion variety in the rule the practical rule is always a product of reason because it prescribes action as a means to the effect but in the case of a being with whom reason does not of itself determine the will this rule is an imperative i e a rule characterised by shall which expresses the objective necessitation of the action and signifies that if reason completely determined the will the action would inevitably take place according to this rule imperatives therefore are objectively valid and are quite distinct from maxims which are subjective principles the former either determine the conditions of the causality of the rational being as an efficient cause i e merely in reference to the effect and the means of attaining it or they determine the will only whether it is adequate to the effect or not     the former would be hypothetical imperatives and contain mere precepts of skill the latter on the contrary would be categorical and would alone be practical laws thus maxims are principles but not imperatives imperatives themselves however when they are conditional i e do not determine the will simply as will but only in respect to a desired effect that is when they are hypothetical imperatives are practical precepts but not laws laws must be sufficient to determine the will as will even before i ask whether i have power sufficient for a desired effect or the means necessary to produce it hence they are categorical otherwise they are not laws at all because the necessity is wanting which if it is to be practical must be independent on conditions which are pathological and are therefore only contingently connected with the will tell a  0  man for example that he must be industrious and thrifty in youth in order that he may not want in old age this is a correct and important practical precept of the will but it is easy to see that in this case the will is directed to something else which it is presupposed that it desires and as to this desire we must leave it to the actor himself whether he looks forward to other resources than those of his own acquisition or does not expect to be old or thinks that in case of future necessity he will be able to make shift with little reason from which alone can spring a rule involving necessity does indeed give necessity to this precept else it would not be an imperative but this is a necessity dependent on subjective conditions and cannot be supposed in the same degree in all subjects but that reason may give laws it is necessary that it should only need to presuppose itself because rules are objectively and universally valid only when they hold without any contingent subjective conditions which distinguish one rational being from another now tell a man that he should never make a deceitful promise this is a rule which only concerns his will whether the purposes he may have can be attained thereby or not     it is the volition only which is to be determined à priori by that rule if now it is found that this rule is practically right then it is a law because it is a categorical imperative thus practical laws refer to the will only without considering what is attained by its causality and we may disregard this latter as belonging to the world of sense in order to have them quite pure § ii — theorem i all practical principles which presuppose an object matter of the faculty of desire as the ground of determination of the will are empirical and can furnish no practical laws by the matter of the faculty of desire i mean an object the realization of which is desired now if the desire for this object precedes the practical rule and is the condition of our making it a principle then i say in the first place this principle  0  is in that case wholly empirical for then what determines the choice is the idea of an object and that relation of this idea to the subject by which its faculty of desire is determined to its realization such a relation to the subject is called the pleasure in the realization of an object this then must be presupposed as a condition of the possibility of determination of the will but it is impossible to know à priori of any idea of an object whether it will be connected with pleasure or pain or be indifferent in such cases therefore the determining principle of the choice must be empirical and therefore also the practical material principle which presupposes it as a condition     in the second place since susceptibility to a pleasure or pain can be known only empirically and cannot hold in the same degree for all rational beings a principle which is based on this subjective condition may serve indeed as a maxim for the subject which possesses this susceptibility but not as a law even to him because it is wanting in objective necessity which must be recognised à priori it follows therefore that such a principle can never furnish a practical law § iii — theorem ii all material practical principles as such are of one and the same kind and come under the general principle of selflove or private happiness pleasure arising from the idea of the existence of a thing in so far as it is to determine the desire of this thing is founded on the susceptibility of the subject since it depends on the presence of an object hence it belongs to sense feeling and not to understanding which expresses a relation of the idea to an object according to concepts not to the subject according to feelings it is then practical only in so far as the faculty of desire is determined by the sensation of agreeableness which the subject expects from the actual existence of the object now a rational beings consciousness of the pleasantness of life uninterruptedly accompanying his whole existence is happiness and the principle which makes this the supreme ground  0  of determination of the will is the principle of selflove all material principles then which place the determining ground of the will in the pleasure or pain to be received from the existence of any object are all of the same kind   0 inasmuch as they all belong to the principle of selflove or private happiness corollary all material practical rules place the determining principle of the will in the lower desires and if there were no purely formal laws of the will adequate to determine it then we could not admit any higher desire at all remark i it is surprising that men otherwise acute can think it possible to distinguish between higher and lower desires according as the ideas which are connected with the feeling of pleasure have their origin in the senses or in the understanding for when we inquire what are the determining grounds of desire and place them in some expected pleasantness it is of no consequence whence the idea of this pleasing object is derived but only how much it pleases whether an idea has its seat and source in the understanding or not if it can only determine the choice by presupposing a feeling of pleasure in the subject it follows that its capability of determining the choice depends altogether on the nature of the inner sense namely that this can be agreeably affected by it however dissimilar ideas of objects may be though they be ideas of the understanding or even of the reason in contrast to ideas of sense yet the feeling of pleasure by means of which they constitute the determining principle of the will the expected satisfaction which impels the activity to the production of the object     is of one and the same kind not only inasmuch as it can be only known empirically but also inasmuch as it affects one and the same vital force which manifests itself in the faculty of desire and in this respect can only differ in degree from every other ground of determination otherwise how could we compare in respect of   0 magnitude two principles of determination the ideas of which depend upon different faculties so as to prefer that which affects the faculty of desire in the highest degree the same man may return unread an instructive book which he cannot again obtain in order not to miss a hunt he may depart in the midst of a fine speech in order not to be late for dinner he may leave a rational conversation such as he otherwise values highly to take his place at the gamingtable he may even repulse a poor man whom he at other times takes pleasure in benefiting because he has only just enough money in his pocket to pay for his admission to the theatre if the determination of his will rests on the feeling of the agreeableness or disagreeableness that he expects from any cause it is all the same to him by what sort of ideas he will be affected the only thing that concerns him in order to decide his choice is how great how long continued how easily obtained and how often repeated this agreeableness is just as to the man who wants money to spend it is all the same whether the gold was dug out of the mountain or washed out of the sand provided it is everywhere accepted at the same value so the man who cares only for the enjoyment of life does not ask whether the ideas are of the understanding or the senses but only how much and how great pleasure they will give for the longest time it is only those that would gladly deny to pure reason the power of determining the will without the presupposition of any feeling who could deviate so far from their own exposition as to describe as quite heterogeneous what they have themselves previously brought under one and the same principle     thus for example it is observed that we can find pleasure in the mere exercise of power in the consciousness of our strength of mind in overcoming obstacles which are opposed to our designs in the culture of our mental talents etc and we justly call these more refined pleasures and enjoyments because they are more in our power than others they do not wear out but rather increase the capacity for further enjoyment of them and while they delight they at the same time cultivate but to say on this account that they determine the will in a different way and not through     sense whereas the possibility of the pleasure presupposes a feeling for it implanted in us which is the first condition of this satisfaction this is just as when ignorant persons that like to dabble in metaphysics imagine matter so subtle so supersubtle that they almost make themselves giddy with it and then think that in this way they have conceived it as a spiritual and yet extended being if with epicurus we make virtue determine the will only by means of the pleasure it promises we cannot afterwards blame him for holding that this pleasure is of the same kind as those of the coarsest senses for we have no reason whatever to charge him with holding that the ideas by which this feeling is excited in us belong merely to the bodily senses as far as can be conjectured he sought the source of many of them in the use of the higher cognitive faculty but this did not prevent him and could not prevent him from holding on the principle above stated that the pleasure itself which those intellectual ideas give us and by which alone they can determine the will is just of the same kind consistency is the highest obligation of a philosopher and yet the most rarely found the ancient greek schools give us more examples of it than we find in our syncretistic age in which a certain shallow and dishonest system of compromise of contradictory principles is devised because it commends itself better to a public     which is content to know something of everything and nothing thoroughly so as to please every party   the principle of private happiness however much understanding and reason may be used in it cannot contain any other determining principles for the will than those which belong to the lower desires and either there are no higher   desires at all or pure reason must of itself alone be practical that is it must be able to determine the will by the mere form of the practical rule without supposing any feeling and consequently without any idea of the pleasant or unpleasant which     is the matter of the desire and which is always an empirical condition of the principles then only when reason of itself determines the will not as the servant of the inclination it is really a higher desire to which that which is pathologically determined is subordinate and is really and even specifically distinct from the latter so that even the slightest admixture of the motives of the latter impairs its strength and superiority just as in a mathematical demonstration the least empirical condition would degrade and destroy its force and value reason with its practical law determines the will immediately not by means of an intervening feeling of pleasure or pain not even of pleasure in the law itself and it is only because it can as pure reason be practical that it is possible for it to be legislative remark ii to be happy is necessarily the wish of every finite rational being and this therefore is inevitably a determining principle of its faculty of desire for we are not in possession originally of satisfaction with our whole existence—a bliss which would imply a consciousness of our own independent selfsufficiency—this is a problem imposed upon us by our own finite nature because we have wants and these wants regard     the matter of our desires that is something that is relative to a subjective feeling of pleasure or pain which determines what we need in order to be satisfied with our condition but just because this material principle of determination can only be empirically known by the subject it is impossible to regard this problem as a law for a law being objective must contain the very same principle of determination of the will in all cases and for all rational beings for although the notion of happiness is in every case the foundation of the practical relation of the objects to the desires yet it is only a general name for the subjective determining principles and determines nothing specifically whereas this is what alone we are concerned with in this practical problem which cannot be solved at all without such specific determination for it is every mans own special feeling of     pleasure and pain that decides in what he is to place his happiness and even in the same subject this will vary with the difference of his wants according as this feeling changes and thus a law which is subjectively necessary as a law of nature is objectively a very contingent practical principle which can and must be very different in different subjects and therefore can never furnish a law since in the desire for happiness it is not the form of conformity to law that is decisive but simply the matter namely whether i am to expect pleasure in following the law and how much principles of selflove may indeed contain universal precepts of skill how to find means to accomplish ones purposes but in that case they are merely theoretical principles   as for example how he who would like to eat bread     should contrive a mill but practical precepts founded on them can never be universal for the determining principle of the desire is based on the feeling of pleasure and pain which can never be supposed to be universally directed to the same objects even supposing however that all finite rational beings were thoroughly agreed as to what were the objects of their feelings of pleasure and pain and also as to the means which they must employ to attain the one and avoid the other still they could by no means set up the principle of selflove as a practical law for this unanimity itself would be only contingent the principle of determination would still be only subjectively valid and merely empirical and would not possess the necessity which is conceived in every law namely an objective necessity arising from à priori grounds unless indeed we hold this necessity to be not at all practical but merely physical viz that our action is as inevitably determined by our inclination as yawning when we see others yawn it would be better     to maintain that there are no practical laws at all but only counsels for the service of our desires than to raise merely subjective principles to the rank of practical laws which have objective necessity and not merely subjective and which must be known by reason à priori not by experience however empirically universal this may be even the rules of corresponding phenomena are only called laws of nature e g the mechanical laws when we either know them really à priori or as in the case of chemical laws suppose that they would be known à priori from objective grounds if our insight reached further but in the case of merely subjective practical principles it is expressly made a condition     that they rest not on objective but on subjective conditions of choice and hence that they must always be represented as mere maxims never as practical laws this second remark seems at first sight to be mere verbal refinement but it defines   the terms of the most important distinction which can come into consideration in practical investigations § iv — theorem iii a rational being cannot regard his maxims as practical universal laws unless he conceives them as principles which determine the will not by their matter but by their form only by the matter of a practical principle i mean the object of the will this object is either the determining ground of the will or it is not in the former case the rule of the will is subjected to an empirical condition viz the relation of the determining idea to the feeling of pleasure and pain consequently it cannot be a practical law now when we abstract from a law all matter i e every object of the will as a determining principle nothing is left but the mere form of a universal legislation therefore either a rational being cannot conceive his subjective practical principles that is his maxims as being     at the same time universal laws or he must suppose that their mere form by which they are fitted for universal legislation is alone what makes them practical laws remark     the commonest understanding can distinguish without instruction what form of maxim is adapted for universal legislation and what is not suppose for example that i have made it my maxim to increase my fortune by every safe means now i have a deposit in my hands the owner of which is dead and has left no writing about it this is just the case for my maxim i desire then to know whether that maxim can also hold good as a universal practical law i apply it therefore to the present case and ask whether it could take the form of a law and consequently whether i can by my maxim at the same time give such a law as this that everyone may deny a deposit of which no one can produce a proof i at once become aware that such a principle viewed as a law would annihilate itself because the result would be that there would be no deposits a practical law which i recognize as such must be qualified for universal legislation this is an identical proposition and therefore selfevident now if i say that my will is subject to a practical law i cannot adduce my inclination e g in the present case my avarice as a principle of determination fitted to be a universal practical law for this is so far from being fitted for a universal legislation that if put in the form of a universal law it would destroy itself it is therefore surprising that intelligent men could have thought of calling the desire of happiness a universal practical law on the ground that the desire is universal and therefore also the maxim by which everyone makes this desire determine his will for whereas in other cases a universal law of nature makes everything harmonious here on the contrary if we attribute to the maxim the universality of a law the extreme opposite of harmony will follow the greatest opposition and the complete     destruction of the maxim itself and its     purpose for in that case the will of all has not one and the same object but everyone has his own his private welfare which may accidentally accord with the purposes of others which are equally selfish but it is far from sufficing for a law because the occasional exceptions which one is permitted to make are endless and cannot be definitely embraced in one universal rule in this manner then results a harmony like that which a certain satirical poem depicts as existing between a married couple bent on going to ruin o marvellous harmony what he wishes she wishes also or like what is said of the pledge of francis i to the emperor charles v what my brother charles wishes that i wish also viz milan empirical principles of determination are not fit for any universal external legislation but just as little for internal for each man makes his own subject the foundation of his inclination and in the same subject sometimes one inclination sometimes another has the preponderance to discover a law which would govern them all under this condition namely bringing them all into harmony is quite impossible § v — problem i supposing that the mere legislative form of maxims is alone the sufficient determining principle of a will to find the nature of the will which can be determined by it alone since the bare form of the law can only be conceived by reason and is therefore not an object of the senses and consequently does not belong to the class of phenomena it follows that the idea of it     which determines the will is distinct from all the principles that determine events in nature according to the law of causality because in their case the determining principles must themselves be phenomena now if no other determining principle can serve as a law for the will except that universal legislative form such a will must be conceived as quite independent on the natural law of phenomena in their mutual relation namely the law of causality such independence is called freedom in the strictest that is in the transcendental     sense consequently a will which can have its law in nothing but the mere legislative form of the maxim is a free will § vi — problem ii supposing that a will is free to find the law which alone is competent to determine it necessarily since the matter of the practical law i e an object of the maxim can never be given otherwise than empirically and the free will is independent on empirical conditions that is conditions belonging to the world of sense and yet is determinable consequently a free will must find its principle of determination in the law and yet independently of the matter of the law but besides the matter of the law nothing is contained in it except the legislative form it is the legislative form then contained in the maxim which can alone constitute a principle of determination of the free will remark   0 thus freedom and an unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each other now i do not ask here whether they are in fact distinct or whether an unconditioned law is not rather merely the consciousness of a pure practical reason and the latter identical with the positive concept of freedom i only ask whence begins our knowledge of the unconditionally practical whether it is from freedom or from the practical law now it cannot begin from freedom for of this we cannot be immediately conscious since the first concept of it is negative nor can we infer it from experience for experience gives us the knowledge only of the law of phenomena and hence of the mechanism of nature the direct opposite of freedom it is therefore the moral law of which we become directly conscious as soon as we trace for ourselves maxims of the will that first presents itself to us and leads directly to the concept of freedom inasmuch as reason presents it as a principle of determination     not to be outweighed by any sensible conditions nay wholly independent of them but how is the consciousness of that moral law possible we can become conscious of pure practical laws just as we are conscious of pure theoretical principles by attending to the necessity with which reason prescribes them and to the elimination of all empirical conditions which it directs the concept of a pure will arises out of the former as that of a pure understanding arises out of the latter that this is the true subordination of our concepts and that it is morality that first discovers to us the notion of freedom hence that it is practical reason which with this concept first proposes to speculative reason the most insoluble problem thereby placing it in the greatest perplexity is evident from the following consideration—since nothing in phenomena can be explained by the concept of freedom but the mechanism of nature must constitute the only clue     moreover when pure reason tries to ascend in the series of causes to the unconditioned it falls into an antinomy which is entangled in incomprehensibilities on the one side as much as the other whilst the latter namely mechanism is at least useful in the explanation of phenomena therefore no one would ever have been so rash as to introduce freedom into science had not the moral law and with it practical reason come in and forced this notion upon us experience however confirms this order of notions suppose some one asserts of his lustful appetite that when the desired object and the opportunity are present it is quite irresistible ask him—if a gallows were erected before the house where he finds this opportunity in order that he should be hanged thereon immediately after the gratification of his lust whether he could not then control his passion we need not be long in doubt what he would reply ask him however—if his sovereign ordered him on pain of the same immediate execution to bear false witness against an honourable man whom the prince might wish to destroy under a plausible pretext would he consider it possible in that case to overcome his love of life however great it may be he would perhaps not venture to affirm whether he would do so or not but he must unhesitatingly admit that it is possible     to do so he judges therefore that he can do a certain thing because he is conscious that he ought and he recognizes that he is free a fact which but for the moral law he would never have known § vii — fundamental law of the pure practical reason act so that the maxim of thy will can always at the same time hold good as a principle of universal legislation remark     pure geometry has postulates which are practical propositions but contain nothing further than the assumption that we can do something if it is required that we should do it and these are the only geometrical propositions that concern actual existence they are then practical rules under a problematical condition of the will but here the rule says—we absolutely must proceed in a certain manner the practical rule is therefore unconditional and hence it is conceived à priori as a categorically practical proposition by which the will is objectively determined absolutely and immediately by the practical rule itself which thus is in this case a law for pure reason practical of itself is here directly legislative the will is thought as independent on empirical conditions and therefore as pure will determined by the mere form of the law and this principle of determination is regarded as the supreme condition of all maxims the thing is strange enough and has no parallel in all the rest of our practical knowledge for the à priori thought of a possible universal legislation which is therefore merely problematical is unconditionally commanded as a law without borrowing anything from experience or from any external will this however is not a precept to do something by which some desired effect can be attained for then the will would depend on physical conditions but a rule that determines the will à priori only so far as regards the forms of its maxims and thus it is at least not impossible to conceive that   0 a law which only applies to the subjective form of principles yet serves as a principle of determination by means of the objective form of law in general we may call the consciousness of this fundamental law a fact of reason because we cannot reason it out from antecedent data of reason e g the consciousness of freedom for this is not antecedently given but it forces itself on us as a synthetic à priori proposition     which is not based on any intuition either pure or empirical it would indeed be analytical if the freedom of the will were presupposed but to presuppose freedom as a positive concept would require an intellectual intuition which cannot here be assumed however when we regard this law as given it must be observed in order not to fall into any misconception that it is not an empirical fact but the sole fact of the pure reason which thereby announces itself as originally legislative sic volo sic jubeo corollary pure reason is practical of itself alone and gives to man a universal law which we call the moral law remark the fact just mentioned is undeniable it is only necessary to analyse the judgment that men pass on the lawfulness of their actions in order to find that whatever inclination may say to the contrary reason incorruptible and selfconstrained always confronts the maxim of the will in any action with the pure will that is with itself considering itself as à priori practical now this principle of morality just on account of the universality of the legislation which makes it the formal supreme determining principle of the will without regard to any subjective differences is declared by the reason to be a law for all rational beings in so far as they have a will that is a power to determine their causality by the conception of rules and therefore so far as they are capable of acting according to principles and consequently also according to     practical à priori principles for these alone have the necessity that reason requires in a principle it is therefore not limited to men only but applies to all finite beings that possess reason and will     nay it even includes the infinite being as the supreme intelligence in the former case however the law has the form of an imperative because in them as rational beings we can suppose a pure will but being creatures affected with wants and physical motives not a holy will that is one which would be incapable of any maxim conflicting with the moral law in their case therefore the moral law is an imperative which commands categorically because the law is unconditioned the relation of such a will to this law is dependence under the name of obligation which implies a constraint to an action though only by reason and its objective law and this action is called duty because an elective will subject to pathological affections though not determined by them and therefore still free implies a wish that arises from subjective causes and therefore may often be opposed to the pure objective determining principle whence it requires the moral constraint of a resistance of the practical reason which may be called an internal but intellectual compulsion in the supreme intelligence the elective will is rightly conceived as incapable of any maxim which could not at the same time be objectively a law and the notion of holiness which on that account belongs to it places it not indeed above all practical laws but above all pratically restrictive laws and consequently above obligation and duty this holiness of will is however a practical idea which must necessarily serve as a type to which finite rational beings can only approximate indefinitely and which the pure moral law which is itself on this account called holy constantly and rightly holds before their eyes the utmost that finite practical reason can effect is to be certain of this indefinite progress of ones maxims and of their steady disposition to advance this is virtue and virtue at least as a naturally acquired faculty can never be perfect because assurance in such a case never becomes apodictic certainty and when it only amounts to persuasion is very dangerous     § viii — theorem iv     the autonomy of the will is the sole principle of all moral laws and of all duties which conform to them on the other hand heteronomy of the elective will not only cannot be the basis of any obligation but is on the contrary opposed to the principle thereof and to the morality of the will in fact the sole principle of morality consists in the independence on all matter of the law namely a desired object and in the determination of the elective will by the mere universal legislative form of which its maxim must be capable now this independence is freedom in the negative sense and this selflegislation of the pure and therefore practical reason is freedom in the positive sense thus the moral law expresses nothing else than the autonomy of the pure practical reason that is freedom and this is itself the formal condition of all maxims and on this condition only can they agree with the supreme practical law if therefore the matter of the volition which can be nothing else than the object of a desire that is connected with the law enters into the practical law as the condition of its possibility there results heteronomy of the elective will namely dependence on the physical law that we should follow some impulse or inclination in that case the will does not give itself the law but only the precept how rationally to follow pathological law and the maxim which in such a case never contains the universally legislative form not only produces no obligation but is itself opposed to the principle of a pure practical reason and therefore also to the moral disposition even though the resulting action may be conformable to the law remark i     hence a practical precept which contains a material and therefore empirical condition must never be reckoned a practical law for the law of the pure will which is free brings the will into a sphere quite different from the empirical and as the necessity involved in the law is not a physical necessity it     can only consist in the formal conditions of the possibility of a law in general all the matter of practical rules rests on subjective conditions which give them only a conditional universality in case i desire this or that what i must do in order to obtain it and they all turn on the principle of private happiness now it is indeed undeniable that every volition must have an object and therefore a matter but it does not follow that this is the determining principle and the condition of the maxim for if it is so then this cannot be exhibited in a universally legislative form since in that case the expectation of the existence of the object would be the determining cause of the choice and the volition must presuppose the dependence of the faculty of desire on the existence of something but this dependence can only be sought in empirical conditions and therefore can never furnish a foundation for a necessary and universal rule thus the happiness of others may be the object of the will of a rational being but if it were the determining principle of the maxim we must assume that we find not only a rational satisfaction in the welfare of others but also a want such as the sympathetic disposition in some men occasions but i cannot assume the existence of this want in every rational being not at all in god the matter then of the maxim may remain but it must not be the condition of it else the maxim could not be fit for a law hence the mere form of law which limits the matter must also be a reason     for adding this matter to the will not for presupposing it for example let the matter be my own happiness this rule if i attribute it to everyone as in fact i may in the case of every finite being can become an objective practical law only if i include the happiness of others therefore the law that we should promote the happiness of others does not arise from the assumption that this is an object of everyones choice but merely from this that the form of universality which reason requires as the condition of giving to a maxim of selflove the objective validity of a law is the principle that determines the will therefore it was not the object the happiness of others that determined the pure will but it was the form of law only by which i restricted my     maxim founded on inclination so as to give it the universality of a law and thus to adapt it to the practical reason and it is this restriction alone and not the adddition of an external spring that can give rise to the notion of the obligation to extend the maxim of my selflove to the happiness of others remark ii the direct opposite of the principle of morality is when the principle of private happiness is made the determining principle of the will and with this is to be reckoned as i have shown above everything that places the determining principle which is to serve as a law anywhere but in the legislative form of the maxim this contradiction however is not merely logical like that which would arise between rules empirically conditioned if they were raised to the rank of necessary principles of cognition but is practical and would ruin morality altogether were not the voice of reason in reference to the will so clear so irrepressible so distinctly audible even to the commonest men it can only indeed be maintained in the perplexing     speculations of the schools which are bold enough to shut their ears against that heavenly voice in order to support a theory that costs no trouble suppose that an acquaintance whom you otherwise liked were to attempt to justify himself to you for having borne false witness first by alleging the in his view sacred duty of consulting his own happiness then by enumerating the advantages which he had gained thereby pointing out the prudence he had shown in securing himself against detection even by yourself to whom he now reveals the secret only in order that he may be able to deny it at any time and suppose he were then to affirm in all seriousness that he has fulfilled a true human duty you would either laugh in his face or shrink back from him with disgust and yet if a man has regulated his principles of action solely with a view to his own advantage you would have nothing whatever to object against this mode of proceeding or suppose some one recommends you a     man as steward as a man to whom you can blindly trust all your affairs and in order to inspire you with confidence extols him as a prudent man who thoroughly understands his own interest and is so indefatigably active that he lets slip no opportunity of advancing it lastly lest you should be afraid of finding a vulgar selfishness in him praises the good taste with which he lives not seeking his pleasure in moneymaking or in coarse wantonness but in the enlargement of his knowledge in instructive intercourse with a select circle and even in relieving the needy while as to the means which of course derive all their value from the end he is not particular and is ready to use other peoples money for the purpose as if it were his own provided only he knows that he can do so safely and without discovery you would either believe that the recommender was mocking you or that he had lost his senses so sharply and clearly marked are the boundaries of morality and selflove that even the commonest eye     cannot fail to distinguish whether a thing belongs to the one or the other the few remarks that follow may appear superfluous where the truth is so plain but at least they may serve to give a little more distinctness to the judgment of common sense the principle of happiness may indeed furnish maxims but never such as would be competent to be laws of the will even if universal happiness were made the object for since the knowledge of this rests on mere empirical data since every mans judgment on it depends very much on his particular point of view which is itself moreover very variable it can supply only general rules not universal that is it can give rules which on the average will most frequently fit but not rules which must hold good always and necessarily hence no practical laws can be founded on it just because in this case an object of choice is the foundation of the rule and must therefore precede it the rule can refer to nothing but what is felt    and therefore it refers to experience and is founded on it and then the variety of judgment must be endless this     principle therefore does not prescribe the same practical rules to all rational beings although the rules are all included under a common title namely that of happiness the moral law however is conceived as objectively necessary only because it holds for everyone that has reason and will the maxim of selflove prudence only advises the law of morality commands now there is a great difference between that which we are advised to do and that to which we are obliged the commonest intelligence can easily and without hesitation see what on the principle of autonomy of the will requires to be done but on supposition of heteronomy of the will it is hard and requires knowledge of the world to see what is to be done that is to say what duty is in plain of itself to everyone but what is to bring true durable advantage such as will extend to the whole of ones existence   0 is always veiled in impenetrable obscurity and much prudence is required to adapt the practical rule founded on it to the ends of life even tolerably by making proper exceptions but the moral law commands the most punctual obedience from everyone it must therefore not be so difficult to judge what it requires to be done that the commonest unpractised understanding even without worldly prudence should fail to apply it rightly it is always in everyones power to satisfy the categorical command of morality whereas it is but seldom possible and by no means so to everyone to satisfy the empirically conditioned precept of happiness even with regard to a single purpose the reason is that in the former case there is question only of the maxim which must be genuine and pure but in the latter case there is question also of ones capacity and physical power to realise a desired object a command that everyone should try to make himself happy would be foolish for one never commands anyone to do what he of himself infallibly wishes to do we must only command the means or rather supply them since he cannot do everything that he wishes but to command morality under the name of duty is quite rational for in the first place not everyone is willing     to obey its precepts if they oppose his inclinations and as to the means of obeying this law these need not in this case be taught for in this respect whatever he wishes to do he can do he who has lost at play may be vexed at himself and his folly but if he is conscious of having cheated at play although he has gained thereby he must despise himself as soon as he compares himself with the moral law this must therefore be something different from the principle of private happiness for a man must have a different criterion when he is compelled to say to himself i am a worthless fellow though i have filled my purse and when he approves himself     and says i am a prudent man for i have enriched my treasure finally there is something further in the idea of our practical reason which accompanies the transgression of a moral law—namely its ill desert now the notion of punishment as such cannot be united with that of becoming a partaker of happiness for although he who inflicts the punishment may at the same time have the benevolent purpose of directing this punishment to this end yet it must first be justified in itself as punishment i e as mere harm so that if it stopped there and the person punished could get no glimpse of kindness hidden behind this harshness he must yet admit that justice was done him and that his reward was perfectly suitable to his conduct in every punishment as such there must first be justice and this constitutes the essence of the notion benevolence may indeed be united with it but the man who has deserved punishment has not the least reason to reckon upon this punishment then is a physical evil which though it be not connected with moral evil as a natural consequence ought to be connected with it as a consequence by the principles of a moral legislation now if every crime even without regarding the physical consequence with respect to the actor is in itself punishable that is forfeits happiness at least partially it is obviously absurd to say that the crime consisted just in this that he has drawn punishment on himself thereby injuring his private happiness which on the principle of selflove must be the proper notion of all crime according to this view the punishment would     be the reason for calling anything a crime and justice would on the contrary consist in omitting all punishment and even preventing that which naturally follows for if this were done there would no longer be any evil in the action since the harm which otherwise followed it and on account of which alone the action was called evil would now be prevented to look however on all rewards and punishments as merely the machinery in the hand     of a higher power which is to serve only to set rational creatures striving after their final end happiness this is to reduce the will to a mechanism destructive of freedom this is so evident that it need not detain us more refined though equally false is the theory of those who suppose a certain special moral sense which sense and not reason determines the moral law and in consequence of which the consciousness of virtue is supposed to be directly connected with contentment and pleasure that of vice with mental dissatisfaction and pain thus reducing the whole to the desire of private happiness without repeating what has been said above i will here only remark the fallacy they fall into in order to imagine the vicious man as tormented with mental dissatisfaction by the consciousness of his transgressions they must first represent him as in the main basis of his character at least in some degree morally good just as he who is pleased with the consciousness of right conduct must be conceived as already virtuous the notion of morality and duty must therefore have preceded any regard to this satisfaction and cannot be derived from it a man must first appreciate the importance of what we call duty the authority of the moral law and the immediate dignity which the following of it gives to the person in his own eyes in order to feel that satisfaction in the consciousness of his conformity to it and the bitter remorse that accompanies the consciousness of its transgression it is therefore impossible to feel this satisfaction or dissatisfaction prior to the knowledge of obligation or to make it the basis of the latter a man must be at least half honest in order even to be able to form a conception of these feelings i do not deny that as the human will is by virtue of liberty     capable of being immediately determined by the moral law so frequent practice in accordance with this principle of determination can at last produce subjectively a feeling of satisfaction     on the contrary it is a duty to establish and to cultivate this which alone deserves to be called properly the moral feeling but the notion of duty cannot be derived from it else we should have to suppose a feeling for the law as such and thus make that an object of sensation which can only be thought by the reason and this if it is not to be a flat contradiction would destroy all notion of duty and put in its place a mere mechanical play of refined inclinations sometimes contending with the coarser if now we compare our formal supreme principle of pure practical reason that of autonomy of the will with all previous material principles or morality we can exhibit them all in a table in which all possible cases are exhausted except the one formal principle and thus we can show visibly that it is vain to look for any other principle than that now proposed in fact all possible principles of determination of the will are either merely subjective and therefore empirical or are also objective and rational and both are either external or internal     practical material principles of determination taken as the foundation of morality are— subjective objective external internal internal external education physical feeling perfection will of god montaigne epicurus wolf and the stoics crusius and other theological moralists the civil constitution moral feeling    hutcheson   mandeville        those at the left hand are all empirical and evidently incapable of furnishing the universal principle of morality but those on the right hand are based on reason for perfection as a quality of things and the highest perfection conceived as substance that is god can only be thought by means of rational concepts but the former notion namely that of perfection   0 may either be taken in a theoretic signification and then it means nothing but the completeness of each thing in its own kind transcendental or that of a thing merely as a thing metaphysical and with that we are not concerned here but the notion of perfection in a practical sense is the fitness or sufficiency of a thing for all sorts of purposes this perfection as a quality of man and consequently internal is nothing but talent and what strengthens or completes this skill supreme perfection conceived as substance that is god and consequently external considered practically is the sufficiency of this being for all ends ends then must first be given relatively to which only can the notion of perfection whether internal in ourselves or external in god be the determining principle of the will but an end—being an object which must precede the determination of the will by a practical rule and contain the ground of the possibility of this determination and therefore contain also the matter of the will taken as its determining principle—such an end is always empirical and therefore may serve for the epicurean principle of the happiness theory but not for the pure rational principle of morality and duty thus talents and the improvement of them because they contribute to the advantages of life or the will of god if agreement with it be taken as the object of the will without any antecedent independent practical principle can be motives only by reason of the happiness expected therefrom hence it follows first that all the principles here stated are material secondly that they include all possible material principles     and finally the conclusion that since material principles are quite incapable of furnishing the supreme moral law as has been shown the formal practical principle of the pure reason according to which the mere form of a universal legislation must constitute the supreme and immediate determining principle of the will is the only one possible which is adequate to furnish categorical imperatives that is practical laws which make actions a duty and in general to serve as the principle of morality both in criticising conduct and also in its application to the human will to determine it     i —of the deduction of the fundamental principles of the pure practical reason     this analytic shows that pure reason can be practical that is can of itself determine the will independently of anything empirical and this it proves by a fact in which pure reason in us proves itself actually practical namely the autonomy shown in the fundamental principle of morality by which reason determines the will to action it shows at the same time that this fact is inseparably connected with the consciousness of freedom of the will nay is identical with it and by this the will of a rational being although as belonging to the world of sense it recognises itself as necessarily subject to the laws of causality like other efficient causes yet at the same time on another side namely as a being in itself is conscious of existing in and being determined by an intelligible order of things conscious not     by virtue of a specal intuition of itself but by virtue of certain dynamical laws which determine its causality in the sensible world for it has been elsewhere proved that if freedom is predicated of us it transports us into an intelligible order of things now if we compare with this the analytical part of the critique of pure speculative reason we shall see a remarkable contrast there it was not fundamental principles but pure sensible intuition space and time that was the first datum that made à priori knowledge possible though only of objects of the senses synthetical principles could not be derived from mere concepts without intuition on the contrary they could only exist with reference to this intuition and therefore to objects of possible experience since it is the concepts of the understanding united with this intuition which alone make that knowledge possible which we call experience beyond objects of experience and therefore with regard to things as noumena all positive knowledge was rightly disclaimed for speculative reason this reason however went so far as to establish with certainty the concept of noumena that is the possibility nay     the necessity of thinking them for example it showed against all objections that the supposition of freedom negatively considered was quite consistent with those principles and limitations of pure theoretic reason but it could not give us any definite enlargement of our knowledge with respect to such objects but on the contrary cut off all view of them altogether on the other hand the moral law although it gives no view yet gives us a fact absolutely inexplicable from any data of the sensible world and the whole compass of our theoretical use of reason a fact which points to a pure world of the understanding     nay even defines it positively and enables us to know something of it namely a law this law as far as rational beings are concerned gives to the world of sense which is a sensible system of nature the form of a world of the understanding that is of a supersensible system of nature without interfering with its mechanism now a system of nature in the most general sense is the existence of things under laws the sensible nature of rational beings in general is their existence under laws empirically conditioned which from the point of view of reason is heteronomy the supersensible nature of the same beings on the other hand is their existence according to laws which are independent on every empirical condition and therefore belong to the autonomy of pure reason and since the laws by which the existence of things depends on cognition are practical supersensible nature so far as we can form any notion of it is nothing else than a system of nature under the autonomy of pure practical reason now the law of this autonomy is the moral law which therefore is the fundamental law of a supersensible nature and of a pure world of understanding whose counterpart must exist in the world of sense but without interfering with its laws we might call the former the archetypal world natura archetypa which we only know in the reason and the latter the ectypal world natura ectypa because it contains the possible effect of the idea of the former which is the determining principle of the will for the moral law in fact transfers     us ideally into a system in which pure reason if it were accompanied with adequate physical power would produce the summum bonum and it determines our will to give the sensible world the form of a system of rational beings   the least attention to oneself proves that this idea really serves as the model for the determinations of our will     when the maxim which i am disposed to follow in giving testimony is tested by the practical reason i always consider what it would be if it were to hold as a universal law of nature it is manifest that in this view it would oblige everyone to speak the truth for it cannot hold as a universal law of nature that statements should be allowed to have the force of proof and yet to be purposely untrue similarly the maxim which i adopt with respect to disposing freely of my life is at once determined when i ask myself what it should be in order that a system of which it is the law should maintain itself it is obvious that in such a system no one could arbitrarily put an end to his own life for such an arrangement would not be a permanent order of things and so in all similar cases now in nature as it actually is an object of experience the free will is not of itself determined to maxims which could of themselves be the foundation of a natural system of universal laws or which could even be adapted to a system so constituted on the contrary its maxims are private inclinations which constitute indeed a natural whole in conformity with pathological physical laws but could not form part of a system of nature which would only be possible through our will acting in accordance with pure practical laws yet we are through reason conscious of a law to which all our maxims are subject as though a natural order must be originated from our will this law therefore must be the idea of a natural system not given in experience and yet possible through freedom a system therefore which is supersensible and to which we give objective reality at least in a practical point of view since we look on it as an object of our will as pure rational beings     hence the distinction between the laws of a natural system to which the will is subject and of a natural system which is subject to a will as far as its relation to its free actions is concerned   0 rests on this that in the former the objects must be causes of the ideas which determine the will whereas in the latter the will is the cause of the objects so that its causality has its determining principle solely in the pure faculty of reason which may therefore be called a pure practical reason there are therefore two very distinct problems how on the one side pure reason can cognise objects à priori and how on the other side it can be an immediate determining principle of the will that is of the causality of the rational being with respect to the reality of objects through the mere thought of the universal validity of its own maxims as laws the former which belongs to the critique of the pure speculative reason requires a previous explanation how intuitions without which no object can be given and therefore none known synthetically are possible à priori and its solution turns out to be that these are all only sensible and therefore do not render possible any speculative knowledge which goes further than possible experience reaches and that therefore all the principles of that pure speculative   reason avail only to make experience possible either experience of given objects or of those that may be given ad infinitum but never are completely given the latter which belongs to the critique of practical reason requires no explanation how the objects of the faculty of desire are possible for that being a problem of the theoretical knowledge of nature is left to the critique of the speculative reason but only how reason can determine the maxims of the will whether this takes place only by means of empirical ideas as principles of determination or whether pure reason can be practical and be the law of a possible order of nature which is not empirically knowable     the possibility of such a supersensible system of nature the conception of which can     also be the ground of its reality through our own free will does not require any à priori intuition of an intelligible world which being in this case supersensible would be impossible for us for the question is only as to the determining principle of volition in its maxims namely whether it is empirical or is a conception of the pure reason having the legal character belonging to it in general and how it can be the latter it is left to the theoretic principles of reason to decide whether the causality of the will suffices for the realization of the objects or not this being an inquiry into the possibility of the objects of the volition intuition of these objects is therefore of no importance to the practical problem we are here concerned only with the determination of the will and the determining principles of its maxims as a free will not at all with the result for provided only that the will conforms to the law of pure reason then let its power in execution be what it may whether according to these maxims of legislation of a possible system of nature any such system really results or not this is no concern of the critique which only inquires whether and in what way pure reason can be practical that is directly determine the will in this inquiry criticism may and must begin with pure practical laws and their reality but instead of intuition it takes as their foundation the conception of their existence in the intelligible world namely the concept of freedom for this concept has no other meaning and these laws are only possible in relation to freedom of the will but freedom being supposed they are necessary or conversely freedom is necessary because those laws are necessary being practical postulates it cannot be further explained how this consciousness of the moral law or what is the same thing of freedom is possible but that it is admissible is well established in the theoretical critique     the exposition of the supreme principle of practical reason is now finished that is to say it has been shown first what it contains that it subsists for itself quite à priori and independent on empirical principles and next in what it is     distinguished from all other practical principles with the deduction that is the justification of its objective and universal validity and the discernment of the possibility of such a synthetical proposition à priori we cannot expect to succeed so well as in the case of the principles of pure theoretical reason for these referred to objects of possible experience namely to phenomena and we could prove that these phenomena could be known as objects of experience only by being brought under the categories in accordance with these laws and consequently that all possible experience must conform to these laws but i could not proceed in this way with the deduction of the moral law for this does not concern the knowledge of the properties of objects which may be given to the reason from some other source but a knowledge which can itself be the ground of the existence of the objects and by which reason in a rational being has causality i e pure reason which can be regarded as a faculty immediately determining the will now all our human insight is at an end as soon as we have arrived at fundamental powers or faculties for the possibility of these cannot be understood by any means and just as little should it be arbitrarily invented and assumed therefore in the theoretic use of reason it is experience alone that can justify us in assuming them but this expedient of adducing empirical proofs instead of a deduction from à priori sources of knowledge is denied us here in respect to the pure practical faculty of reason     for whatever requires to draw the proof of its reality from experience must depend for the grounds of its possibility on principles of experience and pure yet practical reason by its very notion cannot be regarded as such further the moral law is given as a fact of pure reason of which we are à priori conscious and which is apodictically certain though it be granted that in experience no example of its exact fulfilment can be found hence the objective reality of the moral law cannot be proved by any deduction by any efforts of theoretical reason whether speculative or empirically supported and therefore even if we renounced its apodictic     certainty it could not be proved à posteriori by experience and yet it is firmly established of itself but instead of this vainly sought deduction of the moral principle something else is found which was quite unexpected namely that this moral principle serves conversely as the principle of the deduction of an inscrutable faculty which no experience could prove but of which speculative reason was compelled at least to assume the possibility in order to find amongst its cosmological ideas the unconditioned in the chain of causality so as not to contradict itself—i mean the faculty of freedom the moral law which itself does not require a justification proves not merely the possibility of freedom but that it really belongs to beings who recognise this law as binding on themselves the moral law is in fact a law of the causality of free agents and therefore of the possibility of a supersensible system of nature just as the metaphysical law of events in the world of sense was a law of causality of the sensible system of nature and it therefore determines what speculative philosophy was compelled to leave undetermined namely the law for a causality the concept of which in the latter was only negative and therefore for the first time gives this concept objective reality     this sort of credential of the moral law viz that it is set forth as a principle of the deduction of freedom which is a causality of pure reason is a sufficient substitute for all à priori justification since theoretic reason was compelled to assume at least the possibility of freedom in order to satisfy a want of its own for the moral law proves its reality so as even to satisfy the critique of the speculative reason by the fact that it adds a positive definition to a causality previously conceived only negatively the possibility of which was incomprehensible to speculative reason which yet was compelled to suppose it for it adds the notion of a reason that directly determines the will by imposing on its maxims the condition of a universal legislative form and thus it is able for the first time to give objective though only practical reality to reason which always became transcendent when it sought to proceed speculatively     with its ideas it thus changes the transcendent use of reason into an immanent   use so that reason is itself by means of ideas an efficient cause in the field of experience the determination of the causality of beings in the world of sense as such can never be unconditioned and yet for every series of conditions there must be something unconditioned and therefore there must be a causality which is determined wholly by itself hence the idea of freedom as a faculty of absolute spontaneity was not found to be a want but as far as its possibility is concerned an analytic principle of pure speculative reason but as it is absolutely impossible to find in experience any example in accordance with this idea because amongst the causes of things as phenomena it would be impossible to meet with any absolutely unconditioned determination of causality we were only able to defend our supposition that a freely acting cause might be a being in the world of sense in so far as it is considered in the other point of view as a noumenon     showing that there is no contradiction in regarding all its actions as subject to physical conditions so far as they are phenomena and yet regarding its causality as physically unconditioned in so far as the acting being belongs to the world of understanding   and in thus making the concept of freedom the regulative principle of reason by this principle i do not indeed learn what the object is to which that sort of causality is attributed but i remove the difficulty for on the one side in the explanation of events in the world and consequently also of the actions of rational beings i leave to the mechanism of physical necessity the right of ascending from conditioned to condition ad infinitum while on the other side i keep open for speculative reason the place which for it is vacant namely the intelligible in order to transfer the unconditioned     thither but i was not able to verify this supposition that is to change it into the knowledge of a being so acting not even into the knowledge of the possibility of such a being this vacant place is now filled by pure practical reason with a definite law of causality in an intelligible world causality with freedom namely the moral law speculative reason does not hereby gain anything as regards its insight but only as regards the certainty of its problematical notion of freedom which here obtains objective reality which though only practical is nevertheless undoubted even the notion of causality—the application and consequently the signification of which holds properly only in relation to phenomena so as to connect them into experiences as is shown by the critique of pure reason—is not so enlarged as to extend its use beyond these limits for if reason sought to do this it would have to show how the logical relation of principle and consequence can be used synthetically in a different sort of intuition from the sensible that is how a causa noumenon is possible     this it can never do and as practical reason it does not even concern itself with it since it only places the determining principle of causality of man as a sensible creature which is given in pure reason which is therefore called practical and therefore it employs the notion of cause not in order to know objects but to determine causality in relation to objects in general it can abstract altogether from the application of this notion to objects with a view to theoretical knowledge since this concept is always found à priori in the understanding even independently on any intuition reason then employs it only for a practical purpose and hence we can transfer the determining principle of the will into the intelligible order of things admitting at the same time that we cannot understand how the notion of cause can determine the knowledge of these things but reason must cognise causality with respect to the actions of the will in the sensible world in a definite manner otherwise practical reason could not really produce any action but as to the notion which it forms of its own causality as noumenon it need not determine it theoretically with a view to the cognition of its   0 supersensible existence so as to give it significance in this way for it acquires significance apart from this though only for practical use namely through the moral law theoretically viewed it remains always a pure à priori concept of the understanding which can be applied to objects whether they have been given sensibly or not although in the latter case it has no definite theoretical significance or application but is only a formal though essential conception of the understanding relating to an object in general the significance which reason gives it through the moral law is merely practical inasmuch as the idea of the law of causality of the will has self causality or is its determining principle ii —of the right that pure reason in its practical use has to an extension which is not possible to it in its speculative use     we have in the moral principle set forth a law of causality the determining principle of which is set above all the conditions of the sensible world we have it conceived how the will as belonging to the intelligible world is determinable and therefore we have its subject man not merely conceived as belonging to a world of pure understanding and in this respect unknown which the critique of speculative reason enabled us to do but also defined as regards his causality by means of a law which cannot be reduced to any physical law of the sensible world and therefore our knowledge is extended beyond the limits of that world a pretension which the critique of the pure reason declared to be futile in all speculation now how is the practical use of pure reason here to be reconciled with the theoretical as to the determination of the limits of its faculty david hume of whom we may say that he commenced the assault on the claims of pure reason which made a thorough investigation of it necessary argued thus the notion of cause is a notion that involves the necessity of the connexion of the existence of different things and that in so far as they are different so that given a i know that something quite distinct therefrom namely b must necessarily also exist         now necessity can be attributed to a connexion only in so far as it is known à priori for experience would only enable us to know of such a connexion that it exists not that it necessarily exists now it is impossible says he to know à priori and as necessary the connexion between one thing and another or between one attribute and another quite distinct when they have not been given in experience therefore the notion of a cause is fictitious and delusive and to speak in the mildest way is an illusion only excusable inasmuch as the custom a subjective necessity of perceiving certain things or their attributes as often associated in existence along with or in succession to one another is insensibly taken for an objective necessity of supposing such a connexion in the objects themselves and thus the notion of a cause has been acquired surreptitiously and not legitimately nay it can never be so acquired or authenticated since it demands a connexion in itself vain chimerical and untenable in presence of reason and to which no object can ever correspond in this way was empiricism first introduced as the sole source of principles as far as all knowledge of the existence of things is concerned mathematics therefore remaining excepted and with empiricism the most thorough scepticism even with regard to the whole science of nature as philosophy for on such principles we can never conclude from giving attributes of things as existing to a consequence for this would require the notion of cause which involves the necessity of such a connexion we can only guided by imagination except similar cases—an expectation which is never certain however often it has been fulfilled of no event could we say a certain thing must have preceded it     on which it necessarily followed that is it must have a cause and therefore however frequent the cases we have known in which there was such an antecedent so that a rule could be derived from them yet we never could suppose it as always and necessarily so happening we should therefore be obliged to leave its share to blind chance with which all use of reason comes to an end and this firmly establishes scepticism in reference to arguments ascending from effects to causes and makes it impregnable     mathematics escaped well so far because hume thought that its propositions were analytical that is proceeded from one property to another by virtue of identity and consequently according to the principle of contradiction this however is not the case since on the contrary they are synthetical and although geometry for example has not to do with the existence of things but only with their à priori properties in a possible intuition yet it proceeds just as in the case of the causal notion from one property a to another wholly distinct b as necessarily connected with the former nevertheless mathematical science so highly vaunted for its apodictic certainty must at last fall under this empiricism for the same reason for which hume put custom in the place of objective necessity in the notion of cause and in spite of all its pride must consent to lower its bold pretention of claiming assent à priori and depend for assent to the universality of its propositions on the kindness of observers who when called as witnesses would surely not hesitate to admit that what the geometer propounds as a theorem they have always perceived to be the fact and consequently although it be not necessarily true yet they would permit us to expect it to be true in the future in this manner humes empiricism leads inevitably to scepticism even with regard   0 to mathematics and consequently in every scientific theoretical use of reason for this belongs either to philosophy or mathematics whether with such a terrible overthrow of the chief branches of knowledge common reason will escape better and will not rather become irrecoverably involved in this destruction of all knowledge so that from the same principles a universal scepticism should follow affecting indeed only the learned this i will leave everyone to judge for himself as regards my own labours in the critical examination of pure reason which were occasioned by humes sceptical teaching but went much farther and embraced the whole field of pure theoretical reason in its synthetic use and consequently the field of what is called metaphysics in general i proceeded in the following manner with respect to the doubts raised by     the scottish philosopher touching the notion of causality if hume took the objects of experience for things in themselves as is almost always done he was quite right in declaring the notion of cause to be a deception and false illusion for as to things in themselves and their attributes as such it is impossible to see why because a is given b which is different must necessarily be also given and therefore he could by no means admit such an à priori knowledge of things in themselves still less could this acute writer allow an empirical origin of this concept since this is directly contradictory to the necessity of connexion which constitutes the essence of the notion of causality hence the notion was proscribed and in its place was put custom in the observation of the course of perceptions it resulted however from my inquiries that the objects with which we have to do in experience     are by no means things in themselves but merely phenomena and that although in the case of things in themselves it is impossible to see how if a is supposed it should be contradictory that b which is quite different from a should not also be supposed i e to see the necessity of the connexion between a as cause and b as effect yet it can very well be conceived that as phenomena they may be necessarily connected in one experience in a certain way e g with regard to timerelations so that they could not be separated without contradicting that connexion by means of which this experience is possible in which they are objects and in which alone they are cognisable by us and so it was found to be in fact so that i was able not only to prove the objective reality of the concept of cause in regard to objects of experience but also to deduce it as an à priori concept by reason of the necessity of the connexion it implied that is to show the possibility of its origin from pure understanding without any empirical sources and thus after removing the source of empiricism i was able also to overthrow the inevitable consequence of this namely scepticism first with regard to physical science and then with regard to mathematics in which empiricism has just the same grounds both     being sciences which have reference to objects of possible experience herewith overthrowing the thorough doubt of whatever theoretic reason professes to discern but how is it with the application of this category of causality and all the others for without them there can be no knowledge of anything existing to things which are not objects of possible experience but lie beyond its bounds for i was able to deduce the objective reality of these concepts only with regard to objects of possible experience     but even this very fact that i have saved them only in case i have proved that objects may by means of them be thought though not determined à priori this it is that gives them a place in the pure understanding by which they are referred to objects in general sensible or not sensible if anything is still wanting it is that which is the condition of the application of these categories and especially that of causality to objects namely intuition for where this is not given the application with a view to theoretic knowledge of the object as a noumenon is impossible and therefore if anyone ventures on it is as in the critique of the pure reason absolutely forbidden still the objective reality of the concept of causality remains and it can be used even of noumena but without our being able in the least to define the concept theoretically so as to produce knowledge for that this concept even in reference to an object contains nothing impossible was shown by this that even while applied to objects of sense its seat was certainly fixed in the pure understanding and although when referred to things in themselves which cannot be objects of experience it is not capable of being determined so as to represent a definite object for the purpose of theoretic knowledge yet for any other purpose for instance a practical it might be capable of being determined so as to have such application this could not be the case if as hume maintained this concept of causality contained something absolutely impossible to be thought in order now to discover this condition of the application of the said concept to noumena we need only recall why we are not content with its application to objects of experience but     desire also to apply it to things in themselves it will appear then that it is not a theoretic but a practical purpose     that makes this a necessity in speculation even if we were successful in it we should not really gain anything in the knowledge of nature or generally with regard to such objects as are given but we should make a wide step from the sensibly conditioned in which we have already enough to do to maintain ourselves and to follow carefully the chain of causes to the supersensible in order to complete our knowledge of principles and to fix its limits whereas there always remains an infinite chasm unfilled between those limits and what we know and we should have hearkened to a vain curiosity rather than a solid desire of knowledge but besides the relation in which the understanding stands to objects in theoretical knowledge it has also a relation to the faculty of desire which is therefore called the will and the pure will inasmuch as pure understanding in this case called reason is practical through the mere conception of a law the objective reality of a pure will or what is the same thing of a pure practical reason is given in the moral law à priori as it were by a fact for so we may name a determination of the will which is inevitable although it does not rest on empirical principles now in the notion of a will the notion of causality is already contained and hence the notion of a pure will contains that of a causality accompanied with freedom that is one which is not determinable by physical laws and consequently is not capable of any empirical intuition in proof of its reality but nevertheless completely justifies its objective reality à priori in the pure practical law not indeed as is easily seen for the purposes of the theoretical but of the practical use of reason now the notion of a being that has free will is the notion of a causa noumenon and that this notion involves no contradiction     we are already assured by the fact—that inasmuch as the concept of cause has arisen wholly from pure understanding and has its objective reality assured by the deduction as it is moreover in its origin independent on any sensible conditions it is therefore not restricted to phenomena unless we wanted     to make a definite theoretic use of it but can be applied equally to things that are objects of the pure understanding but since this application cannot rest on any intuition for intuition can only be sensible therefore causa noumenon as regards the theoretic use of reason although a possible and thinkable is yet an empty notion now i do not desire by means of this to understand theoretically the nature of a being in so far as it has a pure will it is enough for me to have thereby designated it as such and hence to combine the notion of causality with that of freedom and what is inseparable from it the moral law as its determining principle now this right i certainly have by virtue of the pure notempirical origin of the notion of cause since i do not consider myself entitled to make any use of it except in reference to the moral law which determines its reality that is only a practical use if with hume i had denied to the notion of causality all objective reality in its theoretic    use not merely with regard to things in themselves the supersensible but also with regard to the objects of the senses it would have lost all significance and being a theoretically impossible notion would have been declared to be quite useless and since what is nothing cannot be made any use of the practical use of a concept theoretically null would have been absurd but as it is the concept of a causality free from empirical conditions although empty i e without any appropriate intuition is yet theoretically possible     and refers to an indeterminate object but in compensation significance is given to it in the moral law and consequently in a practical sense i have indeed no intuition which should determine its objective theoretic reality but not the less it has a real application which is exhibited in concreto in intentions or maxims that is it has a practical reality which can be specified and this is sufficient to justify it even with a view to noumena now this objective reality of a pure concept of the understanding in the sphere of the supersensible once brought in     gives an objective reality also to all the other categories although only so far as they stand in necessary connexion with the determining principle of the will the moral law a reality only of practical application which has not the least effect in enlarging our theoretical knowledge of these objects or the discernment of their nature by pure reason so we shall find also in the sequel that these categories refer only to beings as intelligences and in them only to the relation of reason to the will consequently always only to the practical and beyond this cannot pretend to any knowledge of these beings and whatever other properties belonging to the theoretical representation of supersensible things may be brought into connexion with these categories this is not to be reckoned as knowledge but only as a right in a practical point of view however it is a necessity to admit and assume such beings even in the case where we conceive    supersensible beings e g god according to analogy that is a purely rational relation of which we make a practical use with reference to what is sensible and thus the application to the supersensible solely in a practical point of view does not give pure theoretic reason the least encouragement to run riot into the transcendent     chapter ii of the concept of an object of pure practical reason     by a concept of the practical reason i understand the idea of an object as an effect possible to be produced through freedom to be an object of practical knowledge as such signifies therefore only the relation of the will to the action by which the object or its opposite would be realized and to decide whether something is an object of pure practical reason or not is only to discern the possibility or impossibility of willing the action by which if we had the required power about which experience must decide a certain object would be realized if the object be taken as the determining principle of our desire it must first be known whether it is physically possible by the free use of our powers before we decide whether it is an object of practical reason or not on the other hand if the law can be considered à priori as the determining principle of the action and the latter therefore as determined by pure practical reason the judgment whether a thing     is an object of pure practical reason or not does not depend at all on the comparison with our physical power and the question is only whether we should will an action that is directed to the existence of an object if the object were in our power hence the previous question is only as to the moral possibility of the action for in this case it is not the object but the law of the will that is the determining principle of the action the only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil for by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason by the latter one necessarily shunned also according to a principle of reason if the notion of good is not to be derived from an antecedent     practical law but on the contrary is to serve as its foundation it can only be the notion of something whose existence promises pleasure and thus determines the causality of the subject to produce it that is to say determines the faculty of desire now since it is impossible to discern à priori what idea will be accompanied with pleasure and what with pain it will depend on experience alone to find out what is primarily   good or evil the property of the subject with reference to which alone this experiment can be made is the feeling of pleasure and pain a receptivity belonging to the internal sense thus that only would be primarily good with which the sensation of pleasure is immediately connected and that simply evil which immediately excites pain since however this is opposed even to the usage of language which distinguishes the pleasant from the good the unpleasant from the evil and requires that good and evil shall always be judged by reason and therefore by concepts which can be communicated to everyone and not by mere sensation which is limited to individual subjects   and their susceptibility     and since nevertheless pleasure or pain cannot be connected with any idea of an object à priori the philosopher who thought himself obliged to make a feeling of pleasure the foundation of his practical judgments would call that good which is a means to the pleasant and evil what is a cause of unpleasantness and pain for the judgment on the relation of means to ends certainly belongs to reason but although reason is alone capable of discerning the connexion of means with their ends so that the will might even be defined as the faculty of ends since these are always determining principles of the desires yet the practical maxims which would follow from the aforesaid principle of the good being merely a means would never contain as the object of the will anything good in itself but only something good for something the good would always be merely the useful and that for which it is   0 useful must always lie outside the will in sensation now if this as a pleasant sensation were to be distinguished from the notion of good then there would be nothing primarily good at all but the good would have to be sought only in the means to something else namely some pleasantness it is an old formula of the schools nihil appetimus nisi sub ratione boni nihil aversamur nisi sub ratione mali and it is used often correctly but often also in a manner injurious to philosophy because the expressions boni and mali are ambiguous owing to the poverty of language in consequence of which they admit a double sense and therefore inevitably bring the practical laws into ambiguity and philosophy which in employing them becomes aware of the different meanings in the same word but can find no special expressions for them is driven to subtile distinctions about which there is subsequently no unanimity because the distinction     could not be directly marked by any suitable expression   the german language has the good fortune to possess expressions which do not allow this difference to be overlooked it possesses two very distinct concepts and especially distinct expressions for that which the latins express by a single word bonum for bonum it has das gute good and das wohl well weal for malum das böse evil and das übel ill bad or das weh woe so that we express two quite distinct judgments when we consider in an action the good and evil of it or our weal and woe ill hence it already follows that the above quoted psychological proposition is at least very doubtful if it is translated we desire nothing except with a view to our weal or woe on the other hand if     we render it thus under the direction of reason we desire nothing except so far as we esteem it good or evil it is indubitably certain and at the same time quite clearly expressed   well or ill always implies only a reference to our condition as pleasant or unpleasant as one of pleasure or pain and if we desire or avoid an object on this account it is only so far as it is referred to our sensibility and to the feeling of pleasure or pain that it produces but good or evil always implies a reference to the will as determined by the law of reason to make something its object   0 for it is never determined directly by the object and the idea of it but is a faculty of taking a rule of reason for the motive of an action by which an object may be realized good and evil therefore are properly referred to actions not to the sensations of the person and if anything is to be good or evil absolutely i e in every respect and without any further condition or is to be so esteemed it can only be the manner of acting the maxim of the will and consequently the acting person himself as a good or evil man that can be so called and not a thing however then men may laugh at the stoic who in the severest paroxysms of gout cried out pain however thou tormentest me i will never admit that thou art an evil κακόν malum he was right a bad thing it certainly was and his cry betrayed that but that any evil attached to him thereby this he had no reason whatever to admit for pain did not in the least diminish the worth of his person but only that of his condition if he had been conscious of a single lie it would     have lowered his pride but pain served only to raise it when he was conscious that he had not deserved it by any unrighteous action by which he had rendered himself worthy of punishment what we call good must be an object of desire in the judgment of every rational man and evil an object of aversion in the eyes of everyone therefore in addition to sense this judgment requires reason so it is with truthfulness as opposed to lying so with justice as opposed to violence c but we may call a thing a bad or ill thing which yet everyone must at the same time acknowledge to be good sometimes directly sometimes indirectly     the man who submits to a surgical operation feels it no doubt as a bad ill thing but by their reason he and everyone acknowledge it to be good if a man who delights in annoying and vexing peaceable people at last receives a right good beating this is no doubt a bad ill thing but everyone approves it and regards it as a good thing even though nothing else resulted from it nay even the man who receives it must in his reason acknowledge that he has met justice because he sees the proportion between good conduct and good fortune which reason inevitably places before him here put into practice no doubt our weal and woe are of very great importance in the estimation of our practical reason and as far as our nature as sensible beings is concerned our happiness is the only thing of consequence provided it is estimated as reason especially requires not by the transitory sensation but by the influence that this has on our whole existence and on our satisfaction therewith but it is not absolutely the only thing of consequence man is a being who as belonging to the world of sense has wants and so far his reason has an office which it cannot refuse namely to attend to the interest of his sensible nature and to form practical maxims even with a view to the happiness of this life and if possible even to that of a future but he is not so completely an animal as to be indifferent to what reason says on its own account and to use it merely as an instrument for the satisfaction of his wants as a sensible being     for the possession of reason would not raise his worth above that of the brutes if it is observe serve him only for the same purpose that instinct serves in them it would in that case be only a particular method which nature had employed to equip man for the same ends     for which it has qualified brutes without qualifying him for any higher purpose no doubt once this arrangement of nature has been made for him he requires reason in order to take into consideration his weal and woe but besides this he possesses it for a higher purpose also namely not only to take into consideration what is good or evil in itself about which only pure reason uninfluenced by any sensible interest can judge but also to distinguish this estimate thoroughly from the former and to make it the supreme condition thereof in estimating what is good or evil in itself as distinguished from what can be so called only relatively the following points are to be considered either a rational principle is already conceived as of itself the determining principle of the will without regard to possible objects of desire and therefore by the mere legislative form of the maxim and in that case that principle is a practical à priori law and pure reason is supposed to be practical of itself the law in that case determines the will directly the action conformed to it is good in itself a will whose maxim always conforms to this law is good absolutely in every respect and is the supreme condition of all good or the maxim of the will is consequent on a determining principle of desire which presupposes an object of pleasure or pain something therefore that pleases or displeases and the maxim of reason that we should pursue the former and avoid the latter determines our actions as good relatively to our inclination that is good indirectly i e relatively to a different end to which they are means and in that case these maxims can never be called laws but may be called rational practical precepts the end itself the pleasure that we seek is in the latter case not a good but a welfare not a concept of reason     but an empirical concept of an object of sensation but the use of the means thereto that is the action is nevertheless called good because rational deliberation is required for it not however     good absolutely but only relatively to our sensuous nature with regard to its feelings of pleasure and displeasure but the will whose maxim is affected thereby is not a pure will this is directed only to that in which pure reason by itself can be practical this is the proper place to explain the paradox of method in a critique of practical reason namely that the concept of good and evil must not be determined before the moral law of which it seems as if it must be the foundation but only after it and by means of it in fact even if we did not know that the principle of morality is a pure à priori law determining the will yet that we may not assume principles quite gratuitously we must at least at first leave it undecided whether the will has merely empirical principles of determination or whether it has not also pure à priori principles for it is contrary to all rules of philosophical method to assume as decided that which is the very point in question supposing that we wished to begin with the concept of good in order to deduce from it the laws of the will then this concept of an object as a good would at the same time assign to us this object as the sole determining principle of the will now since this concept had not any practical à priori law for its standard the criterion of good or evil could not be placed in anything but the agreement of the object with our feeling of pleasure or pain and the use of reason could only consist in determining in the first place this pleasure or pain in connexion with all the sensations of my existence and in the second place the means of securing to myself the object of the pleasure     now as experience alone can decide what conforms to the feeling of pleasure and by hypothesis the practical law is to be based on this as a condition it follows that the possibility of à priori practical laws would be at once excluded because it was imagined to be necessary first of all to find an object the concept of which as a good should constitute the universal though empirical principle of determination of the will but what it was necessary to inquire first of all was whether there is not an à priori determining principle of the will and this could never be found anywhere but in a pure     practical law in so far as this law prescribes to maxims merely their form without regard to an object since however we laid the foundation of all practical law in an object determined by our conceptions of good and evil whereas without a previous law that object could only be conceived by empirical concepts we have deprived ourselves beforehand of the possibility of even conceiving a pure practical law on the other hand if we had first investigated the latter analytically we should have found that it is not the concept of good as an object that determines the moral law and makes it possible but that on the contrary it is the moral law that first determines the concept of good and makes it possible so far as it deserves the name of good absolutely this remark which only concerns the method of ultimate ethical inquiries is of importance it explains at once the occasion of all the mistakes of philosophers with respect to the supreme principle of morals for they sought for an object of the will which they could make the matter and principle of a law which consequently could not determine the will directly but by means of that object referred to the feeling of pleasure or pain     whereas they ought first to have searched for a law that would determine the will à priori and directly and afterwards determine the object in accordance with the will now whether they placed this object of pleasure which was to supply the supreme conception of goodness in happiness in perfection in moral feeling    or in the will of god their principle in every case implied heteronomy and they must inevitably come upon empirical conditions of a moral law since their object which was to be the immediate principle of the will could not be called good or bad except in its immediate relation to feeling which is always empirical it is only a formal law—that is one which prescribes to reason nothing more than the form of its universal legislation as the supreme condition of its maxims—that can be à priori a determining     principle of practical reason the ancients avowed this error without concealment by directing all their moral inquiries to the determination of the notion of the summum bonum which they intended afterwards to make the determining principle of the will in the moral law whereas it is only far later when the moral law has been first established for itself and shown to be the direct determining principle of the will that this object can be presented to the will whose form is now determined à priori and this we shall undertake in the dialectic of the pure practical reason the moderns with whom the question of the summum bonum has gone out of fashion or at least seems to have become a secondary matter hide the same error under vague expressions as in many other cases it shows itself nevertheless in their systems as it always produces heteronomy of practical reason and from this can never be derived a moral law giving universal commands     now since the notions of good and evil as consequences of the à priori determination of the will imply also a pure practical principle and therefore a causality of pure reason hence they do not originally refer to objects so as to be for instance special modes of the synthetic unity of the manifold of given intuitions in one consciousness    like the pure concepts of the understanding or categories of reason in its theoretic employment on the contrary they presuppose that objects are given but they are all modes modi of a single category namely that of causality the determining principle of which consists in the rational conception of a law which as a law of freedom reason gives to itself thereby à priori proving itself practical however as the actions on the one side come under a law which is not a physical law but a law of freedom and consequently belong to the conduct of beings in the world of intelligence yet on the other side as events in the world of sense they belong to phenomena hence the determinations of a practical reason are only possible in     reference to the latter and therefore in accordance with the categories of the understanding not indeed with a view to any theoretic employment of it ie so as to bring the manifold of sensible intuition under one consciousness à priori but only to subject the manifold of desires to the unity of consciousness of a practical reason giving it commands in the moral law i e to a pure will à priori these categories of freedom—for so we choose to call them in contrast to those theoretic categories which are categories of physical nature—have an obvious advantage over the latter inasmuch as the latter are only forms of thought which designate objects in an indefinite manner by means of universal concepts for every possible intuition the former on the contrary refer to the determination of a free elective will to which indeed no exactly corresponding intuition can be assigned     but which has as its foundation a pure practical à priori law which is not the case with any concepts belonging to the theoretic use of our cognitive faculties hence instead of the form of intuition space and time which does not lie in reason itself but has to be drawn from another source namely the sensibility these being elementary practical concepts have as their foundation the form of a pure will which is given in reason and therefore in the thinking faculty itself from this it happens that as all precepts of pure practical reason have to do only with the determination of the will not with the physical conditions of practical ability of the execution of ones purpose the practical à priori principles in relation to the supreme principle of freedom are at once cognitions and have not to wait for intuitions in order to acquire significance and that for this remarkable reason because they themselves produce the reality of that to which they refer the intention of the will which is not the case with theoretical concepts only we must be careful to observe that these categories only apply to the practical reason and thus they proceed in order from those which are as yet subject to sensible conditions and morally indeterminate to those which are free from sensible conditions and determined merely by the moral law           table of the categories of freedom relatively to the notions of good and evil    i —quantitysubjective according to maxims practical opinions of the individual objective according to principles precepts a priori both objective and subjective principles of freedom laws    ii —qualitypractical rules of action præceptivæ practical rules of omission prohibitivæ practical rules of exceptions exceptivæ    iii —relationto personality to the condition of the person reciprocal of one person to the condition of the others    iv —modalitythe permitted and the forbidden duty and the contrary to duty perfect and imperfect duty      it will at once be observed that in this table freedom is considered as a sort of causality not subject to empirical principles of determination in regard to actions possible by it which are phenomena in the world of sense and that consequently it is referred to the categories which concern its physical possibility whilst yet each category is taken so universally that the determining principle of that causality can be placed outside the world of sense in freedom as a property of a being in the world of intelligence and finally the categories of modality introduce the transition from practical principles generally to those of morality but only problematically these can be established dogmatically only by the moral law i add nothing further here in explanation of the present table since it is intelligible enough of itself a division of this kind based on principles is very useful in any science both for the sake of thoroughness and intelligibility thus for instance we know from the preceding table and its first number what we     must begin from in practical inquiries namely from the maxims which everyone founds on his own inclinations the precepts which hold for a species of rational beings so far as they agree in certain inclinations and finally the law which holds for all without regard to their inclinations c in this way we survey the whole plan of what has to be done every question of practical philosophy that has to be answered and also the order that is to be followed of the typic of the pure practical judgment it is the notions of good and evil that first determine an object of the will they themselves however   0 are subject to a practical rule of reason which if it is pure reason determines the will à priori relatively to its object now whether an action which is possible to us in the world of sense comes under the rule or not is a question to be decided by the practical judgment by which what is said in the rule universally in abstracto is applied to an action in concreto but since a practical rule of pure reason in the first place as practical concerns the existence of an object and in the second place as a practical rule of pure reason implies necessity as regards the existence of the action and therefore is a practical law not a physical law depending on empirical principles of determination but a law of freedom by which the will is to be determined independently on anything empirical merely by the conception of a law and its form whereas all instances that can occur of possible actions can only be empirical that is belong to the experience of physical nature hence it seems absurd to expect to find in the world of sense a case which while as such it depends only on the law of nature yet admits of the application to it of a law of freedom and to which we can apply the supersensible idea of the morally good which is to be exhibited in it in concreto thus the judgment of the pure practical reason is subject to the same difficulties as that of the pure theoretical reason the latter however had means at hand of escaping from these difficulties because in regard to the theoretical   0 employment intuitions were required to which pure concepts of the understanding could be applied and such intuitions though only of objects of the senses can be given à priori and therefore as far as regards the union of the manifold in them conforming to the pure à priori concepts of the understanding as schemata on the other hand the morally good is something whose object is supersensible for which therefore nothing corresponding can be found in any sensible intuition     judgment depending on laws of pure practical reason seems therefore to be subject to special difficulties arising from this that a law of freedom is to be applied to actions which are events taking place in the world of sense and which so far belong to physical nature but here again is opened a favourable prospect for the pure practical judgment when i subsume under a pure practical law an action possible to me in the world of sense i am not concerned with the possibility of the action as an event in the world of sense this is a matter that belongs to the decision of reason in its theoretic use according to the law of causality which is a pure concept of the understanding for which reason has a schema in the sensible intution physical causality or the condition under which it takes place belongs to the physical concepts the schema of which is sketched by transcendental imagination here however we have to do not with the schema of a case that occurs according to laws but with the schema of a law itself if the word is allowable here since the fact that the will not the action relatively to its effect is determined by the law alone without any other principle connects the notion of causality with quite different conditions from those which constitute physical connexion the physical law being a law to which the objects of sensible intuition as such are subject must have a schema corresponding to it—that is a general procedure of the imagination by which it exhibits à priori to the senses the pure concept of the understanding which the law determines but the law of freedom that is of a causality not subject to sensible conditions and consequently the concept of the unconditionally     good cannot have any intuition nor consequently any schema supplied to it for the purpose of its application in concreto consequently the moral law has no faculty     but the understanding to aid its application to physical objects not the imagination and the understanding for the purposes of the judgment can provide for an idea of the reason not a schema of the sensibility but a law though only as to its form as law such a law however as can be exhibited in concreto in objects of the senses and therefore a law of nature we can therefore call this law the type of the moral law the rule of the judgment according to laws of pure practical reason is this ask yourself whether if the action you propose were to take place by a law of the system of nature of which you were yourself a part you could regard it as possible by your own will everyone does in fact decide by this rule whether actions are morally good or evil thus people say if everyone permitted himself to deceive when he thought it to his advantage or thought himself justified in shortening his life as soon as he was thoroughly weary of it or looked with perfect indifference on the necessity of others and if you belonged to such an order of things would you do so with the assent of your own will now everyone knows well that if he secretly allows himself to deceive it does not follow that everyone else does so or if unobserved he is destitute of compassion others would not necessarily be so to him hence this comparison of the maxim of his actions with a universal law of nature is not the determining principle of his will such a law is nevertheless a type of the estimation of the maxim on moral principles if the maxim of the action is not such as to stand the test of the form of a universal law of nature then it is morally impossible this is the judgment even of common sense for its ordinary judgments even those of experience are always based on the law of nature it has it therefore always at hand only that in cases     where causality from freedom is to be criticised it makes that law of nature only the type of a law of freedom because without something which it could use as an example in a case of experience it could not     give the law of a pure practical reason its proper use in practice it is therefore allowable to use the system of the world of sense as the type of a supersensible system of things provided i do not transfer to the latter the intuitions and what depends on them but merely apply to it the form of law in general the notion of which occurs even in the commonest   use of reason but cannot be definitely known à priori for any other purpose than the pure practical use of reason for laws as such are so far identical no matter from what they derive their determining principles further since of all the supersensible absolutely nothing is known except freedom through the moral law and this only so far as it is inseparably implied in that law and moreover all supersensible objects to which reason might lead us following the guidance of that law have still no reality for us except for the purpose of that law and for the use of mere practical reason and as reason is authorized and even compelled to use physical nature in its pure form as an object of the understanding as the type of the judgment hence the present remark will serve to guard against reckoning amongst concepts themselves that which belongs only to the typic of concepts this namely as a typic of the judgment guards against the empiricism of practical reason which founds the practical notions of good and evil merely on experienced consequences so called happiness no doubt happiness and the infinite advantages which would result from a will determined by selflove if this will at the same time erected itself into a universal law of nature     may certainly serve as a perfectly suitable type for the morally good but it is not identical with it the same typic guards also against the mysticism of practical reason which turns what served only as a symbol into a schema that is proposes to provide for the moral concepts actual intuitions which however are not sensible intuitions of an invisible kingdom of god and thus plunges into the transcendent     what is befitting the use of the moral concepts is only the rationalism of the judgment which takes from the sensible system of nature only what pure reason can also conceive of itself that is conformity to law and transfers into the supersensible nothing but what can conversely be actually exhibited by actions in the world of sense according to the formal rule of a law of nature however the caution against empiricism of practical reason is much more important for   mysticism is quite reconcilable with the purity and sublimity of the moral law and besides it is not very natural or agreeable to common habits of thought to strain ones imagination to supersensible intuitions and hence the danger on this side is not so general empiricism on the contrary cuts up at the roots the morality of intentions in which and not in actions only consists the high worth that men can and ought to give to themselves and substitutes for duty something quite different namely an empirical interest with which the inclinations generally are secretly leagued and empiricism moreover being on this account allied with all the inclinations which no matter what fashion they put on degrade humanity when they are raised to the dignity of a supreme practical principle and as these nevertheless are so favourable to everyones feelings it is for that reason much more dangerous than mysticism which can never constitute a lasting condition of any great number of persons     chapter iii of the motives of pure practical reason     what is essential in the moral worth of actions is that the moral law should directly determine the will if the determination of the will takes place in conformity indeed to the moral law but only by means of a feeling no matter of what kind which has to be presupposed in order that the law may be sufficient to determine the will and therefore not for the sake of the law then the action will possess legality but not morality now if we understand by motive or spring elater animi the subjective ground of determination of the will of a being whose reason does not necessarily conform to the objective law by virtue of its own nature then it will follow first that no motives can be attributed to the divine will and that the motives of the human will as well as that of every created rational being can never be anything else than the moral law and consequently that the objective principle of determination must always and alone be also the subjectively sufficient determining principle of the action     if this is not merely to fulfil the letter of the law without containing its spirit   since then for the purpose of giving the moral law influence over the will we must not seek for any other motives that might enable us to dispense with the motive of the law itself because that would produce mere hypocrisy without consistency and it is even dangerous to allow other motives for instance that of interest even to cooperate along with the moral law hence nothing is left us but to determine carefully     in what way the moral law becomes a motive and what effect this has upon the faculty of desire for as to the question how a law can be directly and of itself a determining principle of the will which is the essence of morality this is for human reason an insoluble problem and identical with the question how a free will is possible therefore what we have to show à priori is not why the moral law in itself supplies a motive but what effect it as such produces or more correctly speaking must produce on the mind the essential point in every determination of the will by the moral law is that being a free will it is determined simply by the moral law not only without the cooperation of sensible impulses but even to the rejection of all such and to the checking of all inclinations so far as they might be opposed to that law so far then the effect of the moral law as a motive is only negative and this motive can be known à priori to be such for all inclination and every sensible impulse is founded on feeling and the negative effect     produced on feeling by the check on the inclinations is itself feeling consequently we can see à priori that the moral law as a determining principle of the will must by thwarting all our inclinations produce a feeling which may be called pain and in this we have the first perhaps the only instance in which we are able from à priori considerations to determine the relation of a cognition in this case of pure practical reason to the feeling of pleasure or displeasure all the inclinations together which can be reduced to a tolerable system in which case their satisfaction is called happiness constitute selfregard solipsismus this is either the selflove that consists in an excessive fondness for oneself philautia or satisfaction with oneself arrogantia the former is called particularly selfishness the latter selfconceit pure practical reason only checks selfishness looking on it as natural and active in us even prior to the moral law so far as to limit it to the condition of agreement with this law and then it is called rational selflove but selfconceit reason strikes down altogether since all claims to selfesteem which precede agreement with the moral law are vain and unjustifiable     for the certainty of a state of mind that coincides with this law is the first condition of personal worth as we shall presently show more clearly and prior to this conformity any pretension to worth is false and unlawful now the propensity to selfesteem is one of the inclinations which the moral law checks inasmuch as that esteem rests only on morality therefore the moral law breaks down selfconceit but as this law is something positive in itself namely the form of an intellectual causality that is of freedom it must be an object of respect for by opposing the subjective antagonism of the inclinations     it weakens selfconceit and since it even breaks down that is humiliates this conceit it is an object of the highest respect and consequently is the foundation of a positive feeling which is not of empirical origin but is known à priori therefore respect for the moral law is a feeling which is produced by an intellectual cause and this feeling is the only one that we know quite à priori and the necessity of which we can perceive in the preceding chapter we have seen that everything that presents itself as an object of the will prior to the moral law is by that law itself which is the supreme condition of practical reason excluded from the determining principles of the will which we have called the unconditionally good and that the mere practical form which consists in the adaptation of the maxims to universal legislation first determines what is good in itself and absolutely and is the basis of the maxims of a pure will which alone is good in every respect however we find that our nature as sensible beings is such that the matter of desire objects of inclination whether of hope or fear first presents itself to us and our pathologically affected self although it is in its maxims quite unfit for universal legislation yet just as if it constituted our entire self strives to put its pretensions forward first and to have them acknowledged as the first and original this propensity to make ourselves in the subjective determining principles of our choice serve as the objective determining principle of the will generally may be called selflove and if this pretends to be legislative as an     unconditional practical principle it may be called selfconceit now the moral law which alone is truly objective namely in every respect entirely excludes the influence of selflove on the supreme practical principle and indefinitely checks the selfconceit that prescribes the subjective conditions of the former as laws     now whatever checks our selfconceit in our own judgment humiliates therefore the moral law inevitably humbles every man when he compares with it the physical propensities of his nature that the idea of which as a determining principle of our will humbles us in our selfconsciousness awakes respect for itself so far as it is itself positive and a determining principle therefore the moral law is even subjectively a cause of respect now since everything that enters into selflove belongs to inclination and all inclination rests on feelings and consequently whatever checks all the feelings together in selflove has necessarily by this very circumstance an influence on feeling hence we comprehend how it is possible to perceive à priori that the moral law can produce an effect on feeling in that it excludes the inclinations and the propensity to make them the supreme practical condition i e selflove from all participation in the supreme legislation this effect is on one side merely negative but on the other side relatively to the restricting principle of pure practical reason it is positive no special kind of feeling need be assumed for this under the name of a practical or moral feeling as antecedent to the moral law and serving as its foundation the negative effect on feeling unpleasantness is pathological like every influence on feeling and like every feeling generally but as an effect of the consciousness of the moral law and consequently in relation to a supersensible cause namely the subject of pure practical reason which is the supreme lawgiver this feeling of a rational being affected by inclinations is called humiliation intellectual selfdepreciation but with reference to the positive source of this humiliation the law it is respect for it there is indeed no feeling for this law  00 but inasmuch as it removes the resistance out of the way this removal of an obstacle is in the judgment of reason     esteemed equivalent to a positive help to its causality therefore this feeling may also be called a feeling of respect for the moral law and for both reasons together a moral feeling while the moral law therefore is a formal determining principle of action by practical pure reason and is moreover a material though only objective determining principle of the objects of action as called good and evil it is also a subjective determining principle that is a motive to this action inasmuch as it has influence on the morality of the subject and produces a feeling conducive to the influence of the law on the will there is here in the subject no antecedent feeling tending to morality for this is impossible since every feeling is sensible and the motive of moral intention must be free from all sensible conditions on the contrary while the sensible feeling which is at the bottom of all our inclinations is the condition of that impression which we call respect the cause that determines it lies in the pure practical reason and this impression therefore on account of its origin must be called not a pathological but a practical effect for by the fact that the conception of the moral law deprives selflove of its influence and selfconceit of its allusion it lessons the obstacle to pure practical reason and produces the conception of the superiority of its objective law to the impulses of the sensibility and thus by removing the counterpoise it gives relatively greater weight to the law in the judgment of reason in the case of a will affected by the aforesaid impulses thus the respect for the law is not a motive to morality but is morality itself subjectively considered as a motive inasmuch as pure practical reason  0  by rejecting all the rival pretensions of selflove gives authority to the law which now alone has influence now it is to be observed that as respect is an effect on feeling and therefore on the sensibility of a rational being it presupposes this sensibility and therefore also the finiteness of such beings on whom the moral law imposes respect and that respect for the law cannot be attributed to a supreme being or to any being free from all sensibility and in whom therefore this sensibility cannot be an obstacle to practical reason     this feeling sentiment which we call the moral feeling is therefore produced simply by reason it does not serve for the estimation of actions nor for the foundation of the objective moral law itself but merely as a motive to make this of itself a maxim but what name could we more suitably apply to this singular feeling which cannot be compared to any pathological feeling it is of such a peculiar kind that it seems to be at the disposal of reason only and that pure practical reason respect applies always to persons only—not to things the latter may arouse inclination and if they are animals e g horses dogs c even love or fear like the sea a volcano a beast of prey but never respect something that comes nearer to this feeling is admiration and this as an affection astonishment can apply to things also e g lofty mountains the magnitude number and distance of the heavenly bodies the strength and swiftness of many animals c but all this is not respect a man also may be an object to me of love fear or admiration even to astonishment and yet not be an object of respect his jocose humour his courage and strength his power from the rank he has amongst others  0  may inspire me with sentiments of this kind but still inner respect for him is wanting fontenelle says i bow before a great man but my mind does not bow i would add before an humble plain man in whom i perceive uprightness of character in a higher degree than i am conscious of in myself my mind bows whether i choose it or not and though i bear my head never so high that he may not forget my superior rank why is this because his example exhibits to me a law that humbles my selfconceit when i compare it with my conduct a law the practicability of obedience to which i see proved by fact before my eyes now i may even be conscious of a like degree of uprightness and yet the respect remains for since in man all good is defective the law made visible by an example still humbles my pride my standard being furnished by a man whose imperfections whatever they may be are not known to me as my own are and who therefore appears to me in a more favourable light respect is a tribute which we cannot refuse   0 to merit whether we will or not we may indeed outwardly withhold it but we cannot help feeling it inwardly respect is so far from being a feeling of pleasure that we only reluctantly give way to it as regards a man we try to find out something that may lighten the burden of it some fault to compensate us for the humiliation which such an example causes even the dead are not always secure from this criticism especially if their example appears inimitable even the moral law itself in its solemn majesty is exposed to this endeavour to save oneself from yielding it respect  0  can it be thought that it is for any other reason that we are so ready to reduce it to the level of our familiar inclination or that it is for any other reason that we all take such trouble to make it out to be the chosen precept of our own interest well understood but that we want to be free from the deterrent respect which shows us our own unworthiness with such severity nevertheless on the other hand so little is there pain in it that if once one has laid aside selfconceit and allowed practical influence to that respect he can never be satisfied with contemplating the majesty of this law and the soul believes itself elevated in proportion as it sees the holy law elevated above it and its frail nature no doubt great talents and activity proportioned to them may also occasion respect or an analogous feeling it is very proper to yield it to them and then it appears as if this sentiment were the same thing as admiration but if we look closer we shall observe that it is always uncertain how much of the ability is due to native talent and how much to diligence in cultivating it reason represents it to us as probably the fruit of cultivation and therefore as meritorious and this notably reduces our selfconceit and either casts a reproach on us or urges us to follow such an example in the way that is suitable to us this respect then which we show to such a person properly speaking to the law that his example exhibits is not mere admiration and this is confirmed also by the fact that when the common run of admirers think they have learned from any source the badness of such a mans character for instance voltaires they give up all respect for him whereas     the true scholar still feels it at least with regard to his talents because he is himself engaged in a business and a vocation  0  which make imitation of such a man in some degree a law respect for the moral law is therefore the only and the undoubted moral motive and this feeling is directed to no object except on the ground of this law the moral law first determines the will objectively and directly in the judgment of reason and freedom whose causality can be determined only by the law consists just in this that it restricts all inclinations and consequently selfesteem by the condition of obedience to its pure law this restriction now has an effect on feeling and produces the impression of displeasure which can be known à priori from the moral law since it is so far only a negative effect which arising from the influence of pure practical reason checks the activity of the subject so far as it is determined by inclinations and hence checks the opinion of his personal worth which in the absence of agreement with the moral law is reduced to nothing hence the effect of this law on feeling is merely humiliation we can therefore perceive this à priori but cannot know by it the force of the pure practical law as a motive but only the resistance to motives of the sensibility but since the same law is objectively that is in the conception of pure reason an immediate principle of determination of the will and consequently this humiliation takes place only relatively to the purity of the law hence the lowering of the pretensions of moral selfesteem that is humiliation on the sensible side is an elevation of the moral i e practical esteem for the law itself on the intellectual side in a word it is respect for the law and therefore as its cause is intellectual a positive feeling which can be known à priori for whatever diminishes the obstacles to an activity furthers this activity itself  0  now the recognition of the moral law is the consciousness of an activity of practical reason from objective principles which only fails to reveal its effect in actions because subjective pathological causes hinder it respect for the moral law then must be regarded as a positive though indirect effect of     it on feeling inasmuch as this respect   weakens the impeding influence of inclinations by humiliating selfesteem and hence also as a subjective principle of activity that is as a motive to obedience to the law and as a principle of the maxims of a life conformable to it from the notion of a motive arises that of an interest which can never be attributed to any being unless it possesses reason and which signifies a motive of the will in so far as it is conceived by the reason since in a morally good will the law itself must be the motive the moral interest is a pure interest of practical reason alone independent on sense on the notion of an interest is based that of a maxim this therefore is morally good only in case it rests simply on the interest taken in obedience to the law all three notions however that of a motive of an interest and of a maxim can be applied only to finite beings for they all suppose a limitation of the nature of the being in that the subjective character of his choice does not of itself agree with the objective law of a practical reason they suppose that the being requires to be impelled to action by something because an internal obstacle opposes itself therefore they cannot be applied to the divine will there is something so singular in the unbounded esteem for the pure moral law apart from all advantage as it is presented for our obedience by practical reason the voice of which makes even the boldest sinner tremble and compels him to hide himself from it  0  that we cannot wonder if we find this influence of a mere intellectual idea on the feelings quite incomprehensible to speculative reason and have to be satisfied with seeing so much of this à priori that such a feeling is inseparably connected with the conception of the moral law in every finite rational being if this feeling of respect were pathological and therefore were a feeling of pleasure based on the inner sense it would be in vain to try to discover a connexion of it     with any idea à priori but it    is a feeling that applies merely to what is practical and depends on the conception of a law simply as to its form not on account of any object and therefore cannot be reckoned either as pleasure or pain and yet produces an interest in obedience to the law which we call the moral interest just as the capacity of taking such an interest in the law or respect for the moral law itself is properly the moral feeling or sentiment the consciousness of a free submission of the will to the law yet combined with an inevitable constraint put upon all inclinations though only by our own reason is respect for the law the law that demands this respect and inspires it is clearly no other than the moral for no other precludes all inclinations from exercising any direct influence on the will an action which is objectively practical according to this law to the exclusion of every determining principle of inclination is duty and this by reason of that exclusion includes in its concept practical obligation that is a determination to actions however reluctantly they may be done the feeling that arises from the consciousness of this obligation is not pathological as would be a feeling produced by an object of the senses but practical only that is it is made possible by a preceding  0  objective determination of the will and a causality of the reason as submission to the law therefore that is as a command announcing constraint for the sensibly affected subject it contains in it no pleasure but on the contrary so far pain in the action on the other hand however as this constraint is exercised merely by the legislation of our own reason it also contains something elevating and this subjective effect on feeling inasmuch as pure practical reason is the sole cause of it may be called in this respect selfapprobation since we recognize ourselves as determined thereto solely by the law without any interest and are now conscious of a quite different interest subjectively produced thereby and which is purely practical and     free and our taking this interest in an action of duty is not suggested by any inclination but is commanded and actually brought about by reason through the practical law whence this feeling obtains a special name that of respect the notion of duty therefore requires in the action objectively agreement with the law and subjectively in its maxim that respect for the law shall be the sole mode in which the will is determined thereby and on this rests the distinction between the consciousness of having acted according to duty and from duty that is from respect for the law the former legality is possible even if inclinations have been the determining principles of the will but the latter morality moral worth can be placed only in this that the action is done from duty that is simply for the sake of the law    0  it is of the greatest importance to attend with the utmost exactness in all moral judgments to the subjective principle of all maxims that all the morality of actions may be placed in the necessity of acting from duty and from respect for the law not from love and inclination for that which the actions are to produce for men and all created rational beings moral necessity is constraint that is obligation and every action based on it is to be conceived as a duty not as a proceeding previously pleasing or likely to be pleasing to us of our own accord as if indeed we could ever bring it about that without respect for the law which implies fear or at least apprehension of transgression we of ourselves like the independent deity could ever come into possession of holiness of will by the coincidence of our will with the pure moral law becoming as it were part of our nature never to be shaken in which case the     law would cease to be a command for us as we could never be tempted to be untrue to it the moral law is in fact for the will of a perfect being a law of holiness but for the will of every finite rational being a law of duty of moral constraint and of the determination of its actions by respect for this law and reverence for its duty no other subjective principle must be assumed as a motive else while the action might chance to be such as the law prescribes yet as it does not proceed from duty the intention which is the thing properly in question in this legislation is not moral  0  it is a very beautiful thing to do good to men from love to them and from sympathetic good will or to be just from love of order but this is not yet the true moral maxim of our conduct which is suitable to our position amongst rational beings as men when we pretend with fanciful pride to set ourselves above the thought of duty like volunteers and as if we were independent on the command to want to do of our own good pleasure what we think we need no command to do we stand under a discipline of reason and in all our maxims must not forget our subjection to it nor withdraw anything therefrom or by an egotistic presumption diminish aught of the authority of the law although our own reason gives it so as to set the determining principle of our will even though the law be conformed to anywhere else but in the law itself and in respect for this law duty and obligation are the only names that we must give to our relation to the moral law we are indeed legislative members of a moral kingdom rendered possible by freedom and presented to us by reason as an object of respect but yet we are subjects in it not the sovereign and to mistake our inferior position as creatures and presumptuously to reject the authority of the moral law is already to revolt from it in spirit even though the letter of it is fulfilled with this agrees very well the possibility of such a command as love god above everything and thy neighbour as thyself    for as a command it requires respect for a law   0     which commands love and does not leave it to our own arbitrary choice to make this our principle love to god however considered as an inclination pathological love is impossible for he is not an object of the senses the same affection towards men is possible no doubt but cannot be commanded for it is not in the power of any man to love anyone at command therefore it is only practical love that is meant in that pith of all laws to love god means in this sense to like to do his commandments to love ones neighbour means to like to practise all duties towards him but the command that makes this a rule cannot command us to have this disposition in actions conformed to duty but only to endeavour after it for a command to like to do a thing is in itself contradictory because if we already know of ourselves what we are bound to do and if further we are conscious of liking to do it a command would be quite needless and if we do it not willingly but only out of respect for the law a command that makes this respect the motive of our maxim would directly counteract the disposition commanded that law of all laws therefore like all the moral precepts of the gospel exhibits the moral disposition in all its perfection in which viewed as an ideal of holiness it is not attainable by any creature but yet is the pattern which we should strive to approach and in an uninterrupted but infinite progress become like to in fact if a rational creature could ever reach this point that he thoroughly likes to do all moral laws this would mean that there does not exist in him even the possibility of a desire that would tempt him to deviate from them for to overcome such a desire always costs the subject some sacrifice and therefore requires selfcompulsion that is inward constraint to something that one does not quite like to do and no creature can ever reach this stage of moral disposition     for being a creature and therefore always dependent with respect to what he requires     for complete satisfaction he can never be quite free from desires and inclinations and as these rest on physical causes they can never of themselves coincide with the moral law   the sources of which are quite different and therefore they make it necessary to found the mental disposition of ones maxims on moral obligation not on ready inclination but on respect which demands obedience to the law even though one may not like it not on love which apprehends no inward reluctance of the will towards the law nevertheless this latter namely love to the law which would then cease to be a command and then morality which would have passed subjectively into holiness would cease to be virtue must be the constant though unattainable goal of his endeavours for in the case of what we highly esteem but yet on account of the consciousness of our weakness dread the increased facility of satisfying it changes the most reverential awe into inclination and respect into love at least this would be the perfection of a disposition devoted to the law if it were possible for a creature to attain it       this reflection is intended not so much to clear up the evangelical command just cited in order to prevent religious fanaticism in regard to love of god but to define accurately the moral disposition with regard directly to our duties towards men and to check or if possible prevent a merely moral fanaticism which infects many persons the stage of morality on which man and as far as we can see every rational creature stands is respect for the moral law the disposition that he ought to have in obeying this is to obey it from duty not from spontaneous     inclination or from an endeavour taken up from liking and unbidden and this proper moral condition in which he can always be is virtue that is moral disposition militant and not holiness in the fancied possession of a perfect purity of the disposition of the will it is nothing but moral fanaticism and exaggerated selfconceit that is infused into the mind by exhortation to actions as noble sublime and magnanimous by which men are led into the delusion that it is not duty that is respect for the law whose yoke an easy yoke indeed because reason itself imposes it on us they must bear whether they like it or not that constitutes the determining principle of their actions and which always humbles them while they obey it fancying that those actions are expected from them not from duty but as pure merit for not only would they in imitating such deeds from such a principle not have fulfilled the spirit of the law in the least which consists not in the legality of the action without regard to principle but in the subjection of the mind to the law not only do they make the motives pathological seated in sympathy or selflove not moral in the law but they produce in this way a vain highflying fantastic way of thinking flattering themselves with a spontaneous goodness of heart that needs neither spur nor bridle for which no command is needed and thereby forgetting their obligation which they ought to think of rather than merit indeed actions of others which are done with great sacrifice and merely for the sake of duty may be praised as noble and sublime but only so far as there are traces which suggest that they were done wholly out of respect for duty     and not from excited feelings     if these however are set before anyone as examples to be imitated respect for duty which is the only true moral feeling must be employed as the motive—this severe holy precept which never allows our vain selflove to dally with pathological impulses however analogous they may be to morality and to take a pride in meritorious worth now if we search we shall find for all actions that are worthy of praise a law of duty which commands and does not leave us to choose what may be agreeable to our inclinations this is the only way of representing things that can give a moral training to the soul because it alone is capable of solid and accurately defined principles if fanaticism in its most general sense is a deliberate overstepping of the limits of human reason then moral fanaticism is such an overstepping of the bounds that practical pure reason sets to mankind in that it forbids us to place the subjective determining principle of correct actions that is their moral motive in anything but the law itself or to place the disposition which is thereby brought into the maxims in anything but respect for this law and hence commands us to take as the supreme vital principle of all morality in men the thought of duty which strikes down all arrogance as well as vain selflove if this is so it is not only writers of romance or sentimental educators although they may be zealous opponents of sentimentalism but sometimes even philosophers nay even the severest of all the stoics that have brought in moral fanaticism instead of a sober but wise moral discipline although the fanaticism of the latter was more heroic that of the former of an insipid effeminate character and we may without hypocrisy say of the moral teaching of the gospel     that it first by the purity of its moral principle and at the same time by its suitability to the limitations of finite beings brought all the good conduct of men under the discipline of a duty plainly set before their eyes which does not permit them to indulge in dreams of imaginary moral perfections and that it also set the bounds of humility that is selfknowledge to selfconceit as well as to selflove both which are ready to mistake their limits   0 duty thou sublime and mighty name that dost embrace nothing charming or insinuating but requirest submission and yet seekest not to move the will by threatening aught that would arouse natural aversion or terror but merely holdest forth a law which of itself finds entrance into the mind and yet gains reluctant reverence though not always obedience a law before which all inclinations are dumb even though they secretly counterwork it what origin is there worthy of thee and where is to be found the root of thy noble descent which proudly rejects all kindred with the inclinations a root to be derived from which is the indispensable condition of the only worth which men can give themselves it can be nothing less than a power which elevates man above himself as a part of the world of sense a power which connects him with an order of things that only the understanding can conceive with a world which at the same time commands the whole sensible world and with it the empirically determinable existence of man in time as well as the sum total of all ends which totality alone suits such unconditional practical laws as the moral this power is nothing but personality that is freedom and independence on the mechanism of nature yet regarded also as a faculty of a being which is subject to special laws namely pure practical laws given by its own reason     so that the person as belonging to the sensible world is subject to his own personality as belonging to the intelligible supersensible world it is then not to be wondered at that man as belonging to both worlds must regard his own nature in reference to its second and highest characteristic only with reverence and its laws with the highest respect on this origin are founded many expressions which designate the worth of objects according to moral ideas the moral law is holy inviolable man is indeed unholy enough but he must regard humanity in his own person as holy in all creation every thing one chooses and over which one has any power may be used merely as means man alone and with him every rational creature is an end in himself by virtue of the autonomy of his freedom he is the subject of the moral law which     is holy just for this reason every will even every persons own individual will in relation to itself is restricted to the condition of agreement with the autonomy of the rational being that is to say that it is not to be subject to any purpose which cannot accord with a law which might arise from the will of the passive subject himself the latter is therefore never to be employed merely as means but as itself also concurrently an end we justly attribute this condition even to the divine will with regard to the rational beings in the world which are his creatures since it rests on their personality by which alone they are ends in themselves this respectinspiring idea of personality which sets before our eyes the sublimity of our nature in its higher aspect while at the same time it shows us the want of accord of our conduct with it and thereby strikes down selfconceit is even natural to the commonest reason and easily observed     has not every even moderately honourable man sometimes found that where by an otherwise inoffensive lie he might either have withdrawn himself from an unpleasant business or even have procured some advantages for a loved and welldeserving friend he has avoided it solely lest he should despise himself secretly in his own eyes when an upright man is in the greatest distress which he might have avoided if he could only have disregarded duty is he not sustained by the consciousness that he has maintained humanity in its proper dignity in his own person and honoured it that he has no reason to be ashamed of himself in his own sight or to dread the inward glance of selfexamination this consolation is not happiness it is not even the smallest part of it for no one would wish to have occasion for it or would perhaps even desire a life in such circumstances but he lives and he cannot endure that he should be in his own eyes unworthy of life this inward peace is therefore merely negative as regards what can make life pleasant it is in fact only the escaping the danger of sinking in personal worth after everything else that is valuable has been lost it is the effect of a respect for something quite different from life something in comparison and contrast with which life with all     its enjoyment has no value he still lives only because it is his duty not because he finds anything pleasant in life such is the nature of the true motive of pure practical reason it is no other than the pure moral law itself inasmuch as it makes us conscious of the sublimity of our own supersensible existence and subjectively     produces respect for their higher nature in men who are also conscious of their sensible existence and of the consequent dependence of their pathologically very susceptible nature now with this motive may be combined so many charms and satisfactions of life that even on this account alone the most prudent choice of a rational epicurean reflecting on the greatest advantage of life would declare itself on the side of moral conduct and it may even be advisable to join this prospect of a cheerful enjoyment of life with that supreme motive which is already sufficient of itself but only as a counterpoise to the attractions which vice does not fail to exhibit on the opposite side and not so as even in the smallest degree to place in this the proper moving power when duty is in question for that would be just the same as to wish to taint the purity of the moral disposition in its source the majesty of duty has nothing to do with enjoyment of life it has its special law and its special tribunal and though the two should be never so well shaken together to be given well mixed like medicine to the sick soul yet they will soon separate of themselves and if they do not the former will not act and although physical life might gain somewhat in force the moral life would fade away irrecoverably critical examination of the analytic of pure practical reason by the critical examination of a science or of a portion of it which constitutes a system by itself i understand the inquiry and proof why it must have this and no other systematic form     when we compare it with another system which is based on a similar faculty of knowledge now practical and speculative reason are based on the same faculty so far as both     are pure reason therefore the difference in their systematic form must be determined by the comparison of both and the ground of this must be assigned the analytic of pure theoretic reason had to do with the knowledge of such objects as may have been given to the understanding and was obliged therefore to begin from intuition and consequently as this is always sensible from sensibility and only after that could advance to concepts of the objects of this intuition and could only end with principles after both these had preceded on the contrary since practical reason has not to do with objects so as to know them but with its own faculty of realizing them in accordance with the knowledge of them that is with a will which is a causality inasmuch as reason contains its determining principle since consequently it has not to furnish an object of intuition but as practical reason has to furnish only a law because the notion of causality always implies the reference to a law which determines the existence of the many in relation to one another hence a critical examination of the analytic of reason if this is to be practical reason and this is properly the problem must begin with the possibility of practical principles à priori only after that can it proceed to concepts of the objects of a practical reason namely those of absolute good and evil in order to assign them in accordance with those principles for prior to those principles they cannot possibly be given as good and evil by any faculty of knowledge and only then could the section be concluded with the last chapter that namely which treats of the relation of the pure practical reason to the sensibility     and of its necessary influence thereon which is à priori cognisable that is of the moral sentiment thus the analytic of the practical pure reason has the whole extent of the conditions of its use in common with the theoretical but in reverse order the analytic of pure theoretic reason was divided into transcendental aesthetic and transcendental logic that of the practical reversely into logic and aesthetic of pure practical reason if i may for the sake of analogy merely use these designations which are not quite suitable this logic again was there     divided into the analytic of concepts and that of principles here into that of principles and concepts the aesthetic also had in the former case two parts on account of the two kinds of sensible intuition here the sensibility is not considered as a capacity of intuition at all but merely as feeling which can be a subjective ground of desire and in regard to it pure practical reason admits no further division it is also easy to see the reason why this division into two parts with its subdivision was not actually adopted here as one might have been induced to attempt by the example of the former critique for since it is pure reason that is here considered in its practical use and consequently as proceeding from à priori principles and not from empirical principles of determination hence the division of the analytic of pure practical reason must resemble that of a syllogism namely proceeding from the universal in the major premiss the moral principle through a minor premiss containing a subsumption of possible actions as good or evil under the former to the conclusion namely the subjective determination of the will an interest in the possible practical good and in the maxim founded on it he who has been able to convince himself of the truth of the positions occurring in the analytic   0 will take pleasure in such comparisons for they justly suggest the expectation that we may perhaps some day be able to discern the unity of the whole faculty of reason theoretical as well as practical and be able to derive all from one principle which is what human reason inevitably demands as it finds complete satisfaction only in a perfectly systematic unity of its knowledge if now we consider also the contents of the knowledge that we can have of a pure practical reason and by means of it as shown by the analytic we find along with a remarkable analogy between it and the theoretical no less remarkable differences as regards the theoretical the faculty of a pure rational cognition à priori could be easily and evidently proved by examples from sciences in which as they put their principles to the test in so many ways by methodical use there is not so much reason as in common knowledge to fear a secret     mixture of empirical principles of cognition but that pure reason without the admixture of any empirical principle is practical of itself this could only be shown from the commonest practical use of reason by verifying the fact that every mans natural reason acknowledges the supreme practical principle as the supreme law of his will a law completely à priori and not depending on any sensible data it was necessary first to establish and verify the purity of its origin even in the judgment of this common reason before science could take it in hand to make use of it as a fact that is prior to all disputation about its possibility and all the consequences that may be drawn from it but this circumstance may be readily explained from what has just been said     because practical pure reason must necessarily begin with principles which therefore must be the first data the foundation of all science and cannot be derived from it it was possible to effect this verification of moral principles as principles of a pure reason quite well and with sufficient certainty by a single appeal to the judgment of common sense for this reason that anything empirical which might slip into our maxims as a determining principle of the will can be detected at once by the feeling of pleasure or pain which necessarily attaches to it as exciting desire whereas pure practical reason positively refuses to admit this feeling into its principle as a condition the heterogeneity of the determining principles the empirical and rational is clearly detected by this resistance of a practically legislating reason against every admixture of inclination and by a peculiar kind of sentiment which however does not precede the legislation of the practical reason but on the contrary is produced by this as a constraint namely by the feeling of a respect such as no man has for inclinations of whatever kind but for the law only and it is detected in so marked and prominent a manner that even the most uninstructed cannot fail to see at once in an example presented to him that empirical principles of volition may indeed urge him to follow their attractions but that he can never be expected to obey anything but the pure practical law of reason alone the distinction between the doctrine of happiness and the     doctrine of morality ethics in the former of which empirical principles constitute the entire foundation while in the second they do not form the smallest part of it is the first and most important office of the analytic of pure practical reason and it must proceed in it with as much exactness     and so to speak scrupulousness as any geometer in his work the philosopher however has greater difficulties to contend with here as always in rational cognition by means of concepts merely without construction because he cannot take any intuition as a foundation for a pure noumenon he has however this advantage that like the chemist he can at any time make an experiment with every mans practical reason for the purpose of distinguishing the moral pure principle of determination from the empirical namely by adding the moral law as a determining principle to the empirically affected will eg that of the man who would be ready to lie because he can gain something thereby it is as if the analyst added alkali to a solution of lime in hydrochloric acid the acid at once forsakes the lime combines with the alkali and the lime is precipitated just in the same way if to a man who is otherwise honest or who for this occasion places himself only in thought in the position of an honest man we present the moral law by which he recognizes the worthlessness of the liar his practical reason in forming a judgment of what ought to be done at once forsakes the advantage combines with that which maintains in him respect for his own person truthfulness and the advantage after it has been separated and washed from every particle of reason which is altogether on the side of duty is easily weighed by everyone so that it can enter into combination with reason in other cases only not where it could be opposed to the moral law which reason never forsakes but most closely unites itself with but it does not follow that this distinction between the principle of happiness and that of morality is an opposition between them and pure practical reason does not require that we should renounce all claim to happiness but only that the moment duty is in question we should take no account of happiness     it may even in certain respects be a duty to provide for happiness     partly because including skill wealth riches it contains means for the fulfilment of our duty partly because the absence of it e g poverty implies temptations to transgress our duty but it can never be an immediate duty to promote our happiness still less can it be the principle of all duty now as all determining principles of the will except the law of pure practical reason alone the moral law are all empirical and therefore as such belong to the principle of happiness they must all be kept apart from the supreme principle of morality and never be incorporated with it as a condition since this would be to destroy all moral worth just as much as any empirical admixture with geometrical principles would destroy the certainty of mathematical evidence which in platos opinion is the most excellent thing in mathematics even surpassing their utility instead however of the deduction of the supreme principle of pure practical reason that is the explanation of the possibility of such a knowledge à priori the utmost we were able to do was to show that if we saw the possibility of the freedom of an efficient cause we should also see not merely the possibility but even the necessity of the moral law as the supreme practical law of rational beings to whom we attribute freedom of causality of their will because both concepts are so inseparably united that we might define practical freedom as independence of the will on anything but the moral law but we cannot perceive the possibility of the freedom of an efficient cause especially in the world of sense we are fortunate if only we can be sufficiently assured that there is no proof of its impossibility and are now by the moral law which postulates it compelled     and therefore authorized to assume it however there are still many who think that they can explain this freedom on empirical principles like any other physical faculty and treat it as a psychological property the explanation of which only requires a more exact study of the nature of the soul and of the motives of the will and not as a transcendental predicate of the causality of a being that belongs to the world of sense which is really the point they thus deprive us of the grand revelation which we obtain through practical reason by means of the     moral law the revelation namely of a supersensible world by the realization of the otherwise transcendent concept of freedom and by this deprive us also of the moral law itself which admits no empirical principle of determination therefore it will be necessary to add something here as a protection against this delusion and to exhibit empiricism in its naked superficiality the notion of causality as physical necessity in opposition to the same notion as freedom concerns only the existence of things so far as it is determinable in time and consequently as phenomena in opposition to their causality as things in themselves now if we take the attributes of existence of things in time for attributes of things in themselves which is the common view then it is impossible to reconcile the necessity of the causal relation with freedom they are contradictory for from the former it follows that every event and consequently every action that takes place at a certain point of time is a necessary result of what existed in time preceding now as time past is no longer in my power hence every action that i perform must be the necessary result of certain determining grounds which are not in my power that is at the moment in which i am acting i am never free     nay even if i assume that my whole existence is independent on any foreign cause for instance god so that the determining principles of my causality and even of my whole existence were not outside myself yet this would not in the least transform that physical necessity into freedom for at every moment of time i am still under the necessity of being determined to action by that which is not in my power and the series of events infinite a parte priori which i only continue according to a predetermined order and could never begin of myself would be a continuous physical chain and therefore my causality would never be freedom if then we would attribute freedom to a being whose existence is determined in time we cannot except him from the law of necessity as to all events in his existence and consequently as to his actions also for that would be to hand him over to blind chance now as this law inevitably applies to all the causality of things so far as their existence is determinable in time it     follows that if this were the mode in which we had also to conceive the existence of these things in themselves freedom must be rejected as a vain and impossible conception consequently if we would still save it no other way remains but to consider that the existence of a thing so far as it is determinable in time and therefore its causality according to the law of physical necessity belong to appearance and to attribute freedom to the same being as a thing in itself this is certainly inevitable if we would retain both these contradictory concepts together but in application when we try to explain their combination in one and the same action great difficulties present themselves which seem to render such a combination impracticable     when i say of a man who commits a theft that by the physical law of causality this deed is a necessary result of the determining causes in preceding time then it was impossible that it could not have happened how then can the judgment according to the moral law make any change and suppose that it could have been omitted because the law says that it ought to have been omitted that is how can a man be called quite free at the same moment and with respect to the same action in which he is subject to an inevitable physical necessity some try to evade this by saying that the causes that determine his causality are of such a kind as to agree with a comparative notion of freedom according to this that is sometimes called a free effect the determining physical cause of which lies within in the acting thing itself eg that which a projectile performs when it is in free motion in which case we use the word freedom because while it is in flight it is not urged by anything external or as we call the motion of a clock a free motion because it moves its hands itself which therefore do not require to be pushed by external force so although the actions of man are necessarily determined by causes which precede in time we yet call them free because these causes are ideas produced by our own faculties whereby desires are evoked on occasion of circumstances and hence actions are wrought according to our own pleasure this is a wretched subterfuge with which some persons still let themselves be put off and so think they have solved   0 with a petty word jugglery that difficult problem at the solution of which centuries have laboured in vain and which can therefore scarcely be found so completely on the surface in fact in the question about the freedom which must be the foundation of all moral laws and the consequent responsibility     it does not matter whether the principles which necessarily determine causality by a physical law reside within the subject or without him or in the former case whether these principles are instinctive or are conceived by reason if as is admitted by these men themselves these determining ideas have the ground of their existence in time and in the antecedent state and this again in an antecedent c then it matters not that these are internal it matters not that they have a psychological and not a mechanical causality that is produce actions by means of ideas and not by bodily movements they are still determining principles of the causality of a being whose existence is determinable in time and therefore under the necessitation of conditions of past time which therefore when the subject has to act are no longer in his power this may imply psychological freedom if we choose to apply this term to a merely internal chain of ideas in the mind but it involves physical necessity and therefore leaves no room for transcendental freedom which must be conceived as independence on everything empirical and consequently on nature generally whether it is an object of the internal sense considered in time only or of the external in time and space without this freedom in the latter and true sense which alone is practical à priori no moral law and no moral imputation are possible just for this reason the necessity of events in time according to the physical law of causality may be called the mechanism of nature although we do not mean by this that things which are subject to it must be really material machines we look here only to the necessity of the connexion of events in a timeseries as it is developed according to the physical law whether the subject in which     this development takes place is called automaton materiale when the mechanical being is moved by matter or with leibnitz spirituale when it is impelled by     ideas and if the freedom of our will were no other than the latter say the psychological and comparative not also transcendental that is absolute then it would at bottom be nothing better than the freedom of a turnspit which when once it is wound up accomplishes its motions of itself now in order to remove in the supposed case the apparent contradiction between freedom and the mechanism of nature in one and the same action we must remember what was said in the critique of pure reason or what follows therefrom viz that the necessity of nature which cannot coexist with the freedom of the subject appertains only to the attributes of the thing that is subject to timeconditions consequently only to those   of the acting subject as a phenomenon that therefore in this respect the determining principles of every action of the same reside in what belongs to past time and is no longer in his power in which must be included his own past actions and the character that these may determine for him in his own eyes as a phenomenon but the very same subject being on the other side conscious of himself as a thing in himself considers his existence also in so far as it is not subject to timeconditions and regards himself as only determinable by laws which he gives himself through reason and in this his existence nothing is antecedent to the determination of his will but every action and in general every modification of his existence varying according to his internal sense even the whole series of his existence as a sensible being is in the consciousness of his supersensible existence nothing but the result and never to be regarded as the determining principle of his causality as a noumenon in this view now the rational being can justly say of every unlawful action that he performs     that he could very well have left it undone although as appearance it is sufficiently determined in the past and in this respect is absolutely necessary for it with all the past which determines it belongs to the one single phenomenon of his character which he makes for himself in consequence of which he     imputes the causality of those appearances to himself as a cause independent on sensibility with this agree perfectly the judicial sentences of that wonderful faculty in us which we call conscience   a man may use as much art as he likes in order to paint to himself an unlawful act that he remembers as an unintentional error a mere oversight such as one can never altogether avoid and therefore as something in which he was carried away by the stream of physical necessity and thus to make himself out innocent yet he finds that the advocate who speaks in his favour can by no means silence the accuser within if only he is conscious that at the time when he did this wrong he was in his senses that is in possession of his freedom and nevertheless he accounts for his error from some bad habits which by gradual neglect of attention he has allowed to grow upon him to such a degree that he can regard his error as its natural consequence although this cannot protect him from the blame and reproach which he casts upon himself this is also the ground of repentance for a long past action at every recollection of it a painful feeling produced by the moral sentiment and which is practically void in so far as it cannot serve to undo what has been done hence priestley as a true and consistent fatalist declares it absurd and he deserves to be commended for this candour more than those who while they maintain the mechanism of the will in fact and its freedom in words only   0 yet wish it to be thought that they include it in their system of compromise although they do not explain the possibility of such moral imputation but the pain is quite legitimate because when the law of our intelligible supersensible existence the moral law is in question reason recognizes no distinction of time and only asks whether the event belongs to me as my act and then always morally connects the same feeling with it whether it has happened just now or long ago for in reference to the supersensible consciousness of its existence i e freedom the life of sense is     but a single phenomenon which inasmuch as it contains merely manifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral law i e of the character must be judged not according to the physical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon but according to the absolute spontaneity of freedom it may therefore be admitted that if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a mans mental character as shown by internal as well as external actions as to know all its motives even the smallest and likewise all the external occasions that can influence them we could calculate a mans conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or solar eclipse and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is free in fact if we were capable of a further glance namely an intellectual intuition of the same subject which indeed is not granted to us and instead of it we have only the rational concept then we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard to all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of the subject as a thing in itself of the determination of which no physical explanation can be given in default of this intuition the moral law assures us of this distinction between the relation of our actions     as appearances to our sensible nature and the relation of this sensible nature to the supersensible substratum in us in this view which is natural to our reason though inexplicable we can also justify some judgments which we passed with all conscientiousness and which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity there are cases in which men even with the same education which has been profitable to others yet show such early depravity and so continue to progress in it to years of manhood that they are thought to be born villains and their character altogether incapable of improvement and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or leave undone they are reproached for their faults as guilty nay they themselves the children regard these reproaches as well founded exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of mind ascribed to them they remained just as responsible as any other man this could not happen if we did not suppose that whatever springs from a     mans choice as every action intentionally performed undoubtedly does has as its foundation a free causality which from early youth expresses its character in its manifestations i e actions these on account of the uniformity of conduct exhibit a natural connexion which however does not make the vicious quality of the will necessary but on the contrary is the consequence of the evil principles voluntarily adopted and unchangeable which only make it so much the more culpable and deserving of punishment there still remains a difficulty in the combination of freedom with the mechanism of nature in a being belonging to the world of sense a difficulty which even after all the foregoing is admitted threatens freedom with complete destruction     but with this danger there is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still favourable to freedom namely that the same difficulty presses much more strongly in fact as we shall presently see presses only on the system that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be the existence of things in themselves it does not therefore oblige us to give up   our capital supposition of the ideality of time as a mere form of sensible intuition and consequently as a mere manner of representation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the world of sense and therefore it only requires that this view be reconciled with this idea of freedom the difficulty is as follows—even if it is admitted that the supersensible subject can be free with respect to a given action although as a subject also belonging to the world of sense he is under mechanical conditions with respect to the same action still as soon as we allow that god as universal first cause is also the cause of the existence of substance a proposition which can never be given up without at the same time giving up the notion of god as the being of all beings and therewith giving up his all sufficiency on which everything in theology depends it seems as if we must admit that a mans actions have their determining principle in something which is wholly out of his     power namely in the causality of a supreme being distinct from himself and on whom his own existence and the whole determination of his causality are absolutely dependent in point of fact if a mans actions as belonging to his modifications in time were not merely modifications of him as appearance but as a thing in itself freedom could not be saved man would be a marionette or an automaton like vaucansons   prepared and wound up by the supreme artist selfconsciousness would indeed make him a thinking automaton but the consciousness of his own spontaneity would be mere delusion if this were mistaken for freedom     and it would deserve this name only in a comparative sense since although the proximate determining causes of its motion and a long series of their determining causes are internal yet the last and highest is found in a foreign hand therefore i do not see how those who still insist on regarding time and space as attributes belonging to the existence of things in themselves can avoid admitting the fatality of actions or if like the otherwise acute mendelssohn   they allow them to be conditions necessarily belonging to the existence of finite and derived beings but not to that of the infinite supreme being i do not see on what ground they can justify such a distinction or indeed how they can avoid the contradiction that meets them when they hold that existence in time is an attribute necessarily belonging to finite things in themselves whereas god is the cause of this existence but cannot be the cause of time or space itself since this must on this hypothesis be presupposed as a necessary     à priori condition of the existence of things and consequently as regards the existence of these things his causality must be subject to conditions and even to the condition of time and this would inevitably bring in everything contradictory to the notions of his infinity and independence on the other hand it is quite easy for us to draw the distinction between the attribute of the divine existence of being independent on all timeconditions and that of a being of the world of sense the distinction being that between the existence of a being in itself and that of a thing in appearance hence if this ideality of time and space is not adopted nothing remains but spinozism in which space and time are essential attributes of the supreme being himself and the things dependent on him ourselves therefore included are not substances but merely accidents inhering in him since if these things as his effects     exist in time only this being the condition of their existence in themselves then the actions of these beings must be simply his actions which he performs in some place and time thus spinozism in spite of the absurdity of its fundamental idea argues more consistently than the creation theory can when beings assumed to be substances and beings in themselves existing in time are regarded as effects of a supreme cause and yet as not belonging to him and his action but as separate substances the abovementioned difficulty is resolved briefly and clearly as follows—if existence in time is a mere sensible mode of representation belonging to thinking beings in the world and consequently does not apply to them as things in themselves then the creation of these beings is a creation of things in themselves since the notion of creation does not belong to the sensible form of representation of existence or to causality but can only be referred to noumena consequently when i say of beings in the world of sense that they are created i so far regard them as noumena as it would be a contradiction therefore to say that god is a creator of appearances so also it is a contradiction to say that as creator he is the cause of actions in the world of sense and therefore as appearances although he     is the cause of the existence of the acting beings which are noumena if now it is possible to affirm freedom in spite of the natural mechanism of actions as appearances by regarding existence in time as something that belongs only to appearances not to things in themselves then the circumstance that the acting beings are creatures cannot make the slightest difference since creation concerns their supersensible and not their sensible existence and therefore cannot be regarded as the determining principle of the appearances it would be quite different if the beings in the world as things in themselves     existed in time since in that case the creator of substance would be at the same time the author of the whole mechanism of this substance of so great importance is the separation of time as well as space from the existence of things in themselves which was effected in the critique of the pure speculative reason it may be said that the solution here proposed involves great difficulty in itself and is scarcely susceptible of a lucid exposition but is any other solution that has been attempted or that may be attempted easier and more intelligible rather might we say that the dogmatic teachers of metaphysics have shown more shrewdness than candour in keeping this difficult point out of sight as much as possible in the hope that if they said nothing about it probably no one would think of it if science is to be advanced all difficulties must be laid open and we must even search for those that are hidden for every difficulty calls forth a remedy which cannot be discovered without science gaining either in extent or in exactness and thus even obstacles become means of increasing the thoroughness of science on the other hand if the difficulties are intentionally concealed or merely removed by palliatives then sooner or later they burst out into incurable mischiefs which bring science to ruin in an absolute scepticism since it is properly speaking the notion of freedom alone amongst all the ideas of pure speculative reason that so greatly enlarges our knowledge in the sphere of the supersensible     though only of our practical knowledge i ask myself why it     exclusively possesses so great fertility whereas the others only designate the vacant space for possible beings of the pure understanding but are unable by any means to define the concept of them i presently find that as i cannot think anything without a category i must first look for a category for the rational idea of freedom with which i am now concerned and this is the category of causality and although freedom a concept of the reason being a transcendent concept cannot have any intuition corresponding to it yet the concept of the understanding—for the synthesis of which the former   demands the unconditioned—namely the concept of causality must have a sensible intuition given by which first its objective reality is assured now the categories are all divided into two classes—the mathematical which concern the unity of synthesis in the conception of objects and the dynamical which refer to the unity of synthesis in the conception of the existence of objects the former those of magnitude and quality always contain a synthesis of the homogeneous and it is not possible to find in this the unconditioned antecedent to what is given in sensible intuition as conditioned in space and time as this would itself have to belong to space and time and therefore be again still conditioned   whence it resulted in the dialectic of pure theoretic reason that the opposite methods of attaining the unconditioned and the totality of the conditions were both wrong the categories of the second class those of causality and of the necessity of a thing did not require this homogeneity of the conditioned and the condition in synthesis since here what we have to explain is not how the intuition is compounded from a     manifold in it but only how the existence of the conditioned object corresponding to it is added to the existence of the condition     added namely in the understanding as connected therewith and in that case it was allowable to suppose in the supersensible world the unconditioned antecedent to the altogether conditioned in the world of sense both as regards the causal connexion and the contingent existence of things themselves although this unconditioned remained indeterminate and to make the synthesis transcendent hence it was found in the dialectic of the pure speculative reason that the two apparently opposite methods of obtaining for the conditioned the unconditioned were not really contradictory e g in the synthesis of causality to conceive for the conditioned in the series of causes and effects of the sensible world a causality which has no sensible condition and that the same action which as belonging to the world of sense is always sensibly conditioned that is mechanically necessary yet at the same time may be derived from a causality not sensibly conditioned—being the causality of the acting being as belonging to the supersensible world—and may consequently be conceived as free now the only point in question was to change this may be into is that is that we should be able to show in an actual case as it were by a fact that certain actions imply such a causality namely the intellectual sensibly unconditioned whether they are actual or only commanded that is objectively necessary in a practical sense we could not hope to find this connexion in actions actually given in experience as events of the sensible world since causality with freedom must always be sought outside the world of sense in the world of intelligence but things of sense are the only things offered to our perception and observation hence nothing remained but to find an inconstestable objective principle of causality which excludes all sensible conditions that is a principle in which reason does not appeal further to something else as a determining ground of its causality     but contains this determining ground itself by means of that principle and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical now this principle had not to be  00 searched for or discovered it had long been in the reason of all men and incorporated in their nature and is the principle of morality therefore that unconditioned causality with the faculty of it namely freedom is no longer merely indefinitely and problematically thought this speculative reason could prove to be feasible but is even as regards the law of its causality definitely and assertorially known and with it the fact that a being i myself belonging to the world of sense belongs also to the supersensible world this is also positively known and thus the reality of the supersensible world is established and in practical respects definitely given and this definiteness which for theoretical purposes would be transcendent is for practical purposes immanent we could not however make a similar step as regards the second dynamical idea namely that of a necessary being we could not rise to it from the sensible world without the aid of the first dynamical idea for if we attempted to do so we should have ventured to leave at a bound all that is given to us and to leap to that of which nothing is given us that can help us to effect the connexion of such a supersensible being with the world of sense since the necessary being would have to be known as given outside ourselves on the other hand it is now obvious that this connexion is quite possible in relation to our own subject inasmuch as i know myself to be on the one side as an intelligible supersensible being determined by the moral law by means of freedom and on the other side as acting in the world of sense it is the concept of freedom alone that enables us to find the unconditioned and intelligible supersensible for the conditioned and sensible without going out of ourselves     for it is our own reason that by means of the supreme and unconditional practical law knows that itself and the being that is conscious of this law our own person belongs to the pure world of understanding and moreover defines the manner in which as such it can be active in this way it can be understood why in the whole faculty of reason it is the practical reason only that can help us to pass beyond the world of sense and give us knowledge of a supersensible order and connexion which however  0  for this very reason cannot be extended further than is necessary for pure practical purposes let me be permitted on this occasion to make one more remark namely that every step that we make with pure reason even in the practical sphere where no attention is paid to subtile speculation nevertheless accords with all the material points of the critique of the theoretical reason as closely and directly as if each step had been thought out with deliberate purpose to establish this confirmation such a thorough agreement wholly unsought for and quite obvious as any one can convince himself if he will only carry moral inquiries up to their principles between the most important propositions of practical reason and the often seemingly too subtile and needless remarks of the critique of the speculative reason occasions surprise and astonishment and confirms the maxim already recognized and praised by others namely that in every scientific inquiry we should pursue our way steadily with all possible exactness and frankness without caring for any objections that may be raised from outside its sphere but as far as we can to carry out our inquiry truthfully and completely by itself frequent observation has convinced me that when such researches are concluded that which in one part of them appeared to me very questionable   0 considered in relation to other extraneous doctrines when i left this doubtfulness out of sight for a time and only attended to the business in hand until it was completed at last was unexpectedly found to agree perfectly with what had been discovered separately without the least regard to those doctrines and without any partiality or prejudice for them authors would save themselves many errors and much labour lost because spent on a delusion if they could only resolve to go to work with more frankness  0  book ii dialectic of pure practical reason     chapter i of a dialectic of pure practical reason generally pure reason always has its dialectic whether it is considered in its speculative or its practical employment for it requires the absolute totality of the conditions of what is given conditioned and this can only be found in things in themselves but as all conceptions of things in themselves must be referred to intuitions and with us men these can never be other than sensible and hence can never enable us to know objects as things in themselves but only as appearances and since the unconditioned can never be found in this chain of appearances which consists only of conditioned and conditions thus from applying this rational idea of the totality of the conditions in other words of the unconditioned to appearances there arises an inevitable illusion as if these latter were things in themselves     for in the absence of a warning critique they are always regarded as such this illusion would never be noticed as delusive if it did not betray itself by a conflict of reason with itself when it applies to appearances its fundamental principle of presupposing the unconditioned to everything conditioned by this however reason is compelled to trace this illusion to its source and search how it can be removed and this can only be done by a complete critical examination of the whole pure faculty of reason so that the  0  antinomy of the pure reason which is manifest in its dialectic is in fact the most beneficial error into which human reason could never have fallen since it at last drives us to search for the key to escape from this labyrinth and when this key is found it further discovers that which we did not seek but yet had need of namely a view into a higher and an immutable order of things in which we even now are and in which we are thereby enabled by definite precepts to continue to live according to the highest dictates of reason it may be seen in detail in the critique of pure reason how in its speculative employment this natural dialectic is to be solved and how the error which arises from a very natural illusion may be guarded against but reason in its practical use is not a whit better off as pure practical reason it likewise seeks to find the unconditioned for the practically conditioned which rests on inclinations and natural wants and this not as the determining principle of the will but even when this is given in the moral law it seeks the unconditioned totality of the object of pure practical reason under the name of the summum bonum to define this idea practically i e sufficiently for the maxims of our rational conduct     is the business of practical wisdom weisheitslehre and this again as a science is philosophy in the sense in which the word was understood by the ancients with whom it meant instruction in the conception in which the summum bonum was to be placed and the conduct by which it was to be obtained it would be well to leave this word in its ancient signification as a doctrine of the summum bonum so far as reason endeavours to make this into a science for on the one hand the restriction annexed would suit the greek expression which signifies the love of wisdom and yet at the same time would be sufficient to embrace under the name of philosophy the love of science that is to say of all speculative rational knowledge so far as it is serviceable to reason both for that conception and also for the practical principle determining our conduct without letting out of sight the main end on account of which alone it can be called a doctrine of practical  0  wisdom on the other hand it would be no harm to deter the selfconceit of one who ventures to claim the title of philosopher by holding before him in the very definition a standard of selfestimation which would very much lower his pretensions for a teacher of wisdom would mean something more than a scholar who has not come so far as to guide himself much less to guide others with certain expectation of attaining so high an end it would mean a master in the knowledge of wisdom which implies more than a modest man would claim for himself thus philosophy as well as wisdom would always remain an ideal which objectively is presented complete in reason alone while subjectively for the person it is only the goal of his unceasing endeavours and no one would be justified in professing to be in possession of it so as to assume the name of philosopher who could not also show its infallible effects in his own person as an example     in his selfmastery and the unquestioned interest that he takes preeminently in the general good and this the ancients also required as a condition of deserving that honourable title we have another preliminary remark to make respecting the dialectic of the pure practical reason on the point of the definition of the summum bonum a successful solution of which dialectic would lead us to expect as in case of that of the theoretical reason the most beneficial effects inasmuch as the selfcontradictions of pure practical reason honestly stated and not concealed force us to undertake a complete critique of this faculty the moral law is the sole determining principle of a pure will but since this is merely formal viz as prescribing only the form of the maxim as universally legislative it abstracts as a determining principle from all matter—that is to say from every object of volition hence though the summum bonum may be the whole object of a pure practical reason i e a pure will yet it is not on that account to be regarded as its determining principle and the moral law alone must be regarded as the principle on which that and its realization or promotion are aimed at this remark is important in so delicate a case as the  0  determination of moral principles where the slightest misinterpretation perverts mens minds for it will have been seen from the analytic that if we assume any object under the name of a good as a determining principle of the will prior to the moral law and then deduce from it the supreme practical principle this would always introduce heteronomy and crush out the moral principle it is however evident that if the notion of the summum bonum includes that of the moral law     as its supreme condition then the summum bonum would not merely be an object but the notion of it and the conception of its existence as possible by our own practical reason would likewise be the determining principle of the will since in that case the will is in fact determined by the moral law which is already included in this conception and by no other object as the principle of autonomy requires this order of the conceptions of determination of the will must not be lost sight of as otherwise we should misunderstand ourselves and think we had fallen into a contradiction while everything remains in perfect harmony  0  chapter ii of the dialectic of pure reason in defining the conception of the summum bonum     the conception of the summum itself contains an ambiguity which might occasion needless disputes if we did not attend to it the summum may mean either the supreme supremum or the perfect consummatum the former is that condition which is itself unconditioned i e is not subordinate to any other originarium the second is that whole which is not a part of a greater whole of the same kind perfectissimum it has been shown in the analytic that virtue as worthiness to be happy is the supreme condition of all that can appear to us desirable and consequently of all our pursuit of happiness and is therefore the supreme good but it does not follow that it is the whole and perfect good as the object of the desires of rational finite beings for this requires happiness also and that not merely in the partial eyes of the person who makes himself an end but even in the judgment of an impartial reason which regards persons in general as ends in themselves for to need happiness to deserve it     and yet at the same time not to participate in it cannot be consistent with the perfect volition of a rational being possessed at the same time of all power if for the sake of experiment we conceive such a being now inasmuch as virtue and happiness together constitute the possession of the summum bonum in a person and the distribution of happiness in exact proportion to morality which is the worth of the person and his worthiness to be happy constitutes the summum bonum of a possible world hence this summum bonum expresses the whole the perfect good in which however virtue as the condition is always the supreme good since it has no condition above it whereas happiness while it is pleasant to the possessor of it is not of itself absolutely and in all respects  0  good but always presupposes morally right behaviour as its condition when two elements are necessarily united in one concept they must be connected as reason and consequence and this either so that their unity is considered as analytical logical connexion or as synthetical real connexion—the former following the law of identity the latter that of causality the connexion of virtue and happiness may therefore be understood in two ways either the endeavour to be virtuous and the rational pursuit of happiness are not two distinct actions but absolutely identical in which case no maxim need be made the principle of the former other than what serves for the latter or the connexion consists in this that virtue produces happiness as something distinct from the consciousness of virtue as a cause produces an effect the ancient greek schools were properly speaking only two and in determining the conception of the summum bonum these followed in fact one and the same method inasmuch as they did not allow virtue and happiness to be regarded as two distinct elements of the summum bonum and consequently sought     the unity of the principle by the rule of identity but they differed as to which of the two was to be taken as the fundamental notion the epicurean said to be conscious that ones maxims lead to happiness is virtue the stoic said to be conscious of ones virtue is happiness with the former prudence was equivalent to morality with the latter who chose a higher designation for virtue morality alone was true wisdom while we must admire the men who in such early times tried all imaginable ways of extending the domain of philosophy we must at the same time lament that their acuteness was unfortunately misapplied in trying to trace out identity between two extremely heterogeneous notions those of happiness and virtue but it agreed with the dialectical spirit of their times and subtle minds are even now sometimes misled in the same way to get rid of irreconcilable differences in principle by seeking to change them into a mere contest about  0  words and thus apparently working out the identity of the notion under different names and this usually occurs in cases where the combination of heterogeneous principles lies so deep or so high or would require so complete a transformation of the doctrines assumed in the rest of the philosophical system that men are afraid to penetrate deeply into the real difference and prefer treating it as a difference in matters of form while both schools sought to trace out the identity of the practical principles of virtue and happiness they were not agreed as to the way in which they tried to force this identity but were separated infinitely from one another the one placing its principle on the side of sense the other on that of reason the one in the consciousness of sensible wants the other in the independence of practical reason     on all sensible grounds of determination according to the epicurean the notion of virtue was already involved in the maxim to promote ones own happiness according to the stoics on the other hand the feeling of happiness was already contained in the consciousness of virtue now whatever is contained in another notion is identical with part of the containing notion but not with the whole and moreover two wholes may be specifically distinct although they consist of the same parts namely if the parts are united into a whole in totally different ways the stoic maintained that virtue was the whole summum bonum and happiness only the consciousness of possessing it as making part of the state of the subject the epicurean maintained that happiness was the whole summum bonum and virtue only the form of the maxim for its pursuit viz the rational use of the means for attaining it now it is clear from the analytic that the maxims of virtue and those of private happiness are quite heterogeneous as to their supreme practical principle and although they belong to one summum bonum which together they make possible yet they are so far from coinciding that they restrict and check one another very much in the same subject thus the question how is the summum bonum practically possible still remains an unsolved problem notwithstanding all the attempts at coalition  0  that have hitherto been made the analytic has however shown what it is that makes the problem difficult to solve namely that happiness and morality are two specifically distinct elements of the summum bonum and therefore their combination cannot be analytically cognised as if the man that seeks his own happiness should find by mere analysis of his conception that in so acting he is virtuous or as if the man that follows virtue should in the consciousness of such conduct find that he is already happy ipso facto   0 but must be a synthesis of concepts now since this combination is recognised as à priori and therefore as practically necessary and consequently not as derived from experience so that the possibility of the summum bonum does not rest on any empirical principle it follows that the deduction legitimation of this concept must be transcendental it is à priori morally necessary to produce the summum bonum by freedom of will therefore the condition of its possibility must rest solely on à priori principles of cognition i —the antinomy of practical reason in the summum bonum which is practical for us i e to be realised by our will virtue and happiness are thought as necessarily combined so that the one cannot be assumed by pure practical reason without the other also being attached to it now this combination like every other is either analytical or synthetical it has been shown that it cannot be analytical it must then be synthetical and more particularly must be conceived as the connexion of cause and effect since it concerns a practical good i e one that is possible by means of action consequently either the desire of happiness must be the motive to maxims of virtue or the maxim of virtue must be the efficient cause of happiness the first is absolutely impossible because as was proved in the analytic maxims which place the determining principle     of the will in the desire of personal happiness are not moral at all and no virtue can be founded on them but the second is also impossible because the practical connexion of causes and effects in the world as the result of the determination of the will does not   0 depend upon the moral dispositions of the will but on the knowledge of the laws of nature and the physical power to use them for ones purposes consequently we cannot expect in the world by the most punctilious observance of the moral laws any necessary connexion of happiness with virtue adequate to the summum bonum now as the promotion of this summum bonum the conception of which contains this connexion is à priori a necessary object of our will and inseparably attached to the moral law the impossibility of the former must prove the falsity of the latter if then the supreme good is not possible by practical rules then the moral law also which commands us to promote it is directed to vain imaginary ends and must consequently be false ii —critical solution of the antinomy of practical reason the antinomy of pure speculative reason exhibits a similar conflict between freedom and physical necessity in the causality of events in the world it was solved by showing that there is no real contradiction when the events and even the world in which they occur are regarded as they ought to be merely as appearances since one and the same acting being as an appearance even to his own inner sense     has a causality in the world of sense that always conforms to the mechanism of nature but with respect to the same events so far as the acting person regards himself at the same time as a noumenon as pure intelligence in an existence not dependent on the condition of time he can contain a principle by which that causality acting according to laws of nature is determined but which is itself free from all laws of nature it is just the same with the foregoing antinomy of pure practical reason the first of the two propositions—that the endeavour after happiness produces a virtuous mind is absolutely false but the second that a virtuous mind necessarily produces happiness is not absolutely false but only in so far as virtue is considered as a form of causality in the sensible world and consequently only if i suppose existence in it to be the only     sort of existence of a rational being it is then only conditionally false but as i am not only justified in thinking that i exist also as a noumenon in a world of the understanding but even have in the moral law a purely intellectual determining principle of my causality in the sensible world it is not impossible that morality of mind should have a connexion as cause with happiness as an effect in the sensible world if not immediate yet mediate viz through an intelligent author of nature and moreover necessary while in a system of nature which is merely an object of the senses this combination could never occur except contingently and therefore could not suffice for the summum bonum thus notwithstanding this seeming conflict of practical reason with itself the summum bonum which is the necessary supreme end of a will morally determined is a true object thereof for it is practically possible and the maxims of the will which as regards their matter refer to it have objective reality which at first was threatened by the antinomy that appeared in the connexion     of morality with happiness by a general law but this was merely from a misconception because the relation between appearances was taken for a relation of the things in themselves to these appearances when we find ourselves obliged to go so far namely to the connexion with an intelligible world to find the possibility of the summum bonum which reason points out to all rational beings as the goal of all their moral wishes it must seem strange that nevertheless the philosophers both of ancient and modern times have been able to find happiness in accurate proportion to virtue even in this life in the sensible world or have persuaded themselves that they were conscious thereof for epicurus as well as the stoics extolled above everything the happiness that springs from the consciousness of living virtuously and the former was not so base in his practical precepts as one might infer from the principles of his theory which he used for explanation and not for action or as they were interpreted by many who were misled by his using the term pleasure for contentment on the contrary he reckoned the most disinterested     practice of good amongst the ways of enjoying the most intimate delight and his scheme of pleasure by which he meant constant cheerfulness of mind included the moderation and control of the inclinations such as the strictest moral philosopher might require he differed from the stoics chiefly in making this pleasure the motive which they very rightly refused to do for on the one hand the virtuous epicurus like many wellintentioned men of this day who do not reflect deeply enough on their principles fell into the error of presupposing the virtuous disposition in the persons for whom he wished to provide the springs to virtue and indeed the upright man cannot be happy     if he is not first conscious of his uprightness since with such a character the reproach that his habit of thought would oblige him to make against himself in case of transgression and his moral selfcondemnation would rob him of all enjoyment of the pleasantness which his condition might otherwise contain but the question is how is such a disposition possible in the first instance and such a habit of thought in estimating the worth of ones existence since prior to it there can be in the subject no feeling at all for moral worth if a man is virtuous without being conscious of his integrity in every action he will certainly not enjoy life however favourable fortune may be to him in its physical circumstances but can we make him virtuous in the first instance in other words before he esteems the moral worth of his existence so highly by praising to him the peace of mind that would result from the consciousness of an integrity for which he has no sense on the other hand however there is here an occasion of a vitium subreptionis and as it were of an optical illusion in the selfconsciousness of what one does as distinguished from what one feels an illusion which even the most experienced cannot altogether avoid the moral disposition of mind is necessarily combined with a consciousness that the will is determined directly by the law now the consciousness of a determination of the faculty of desire is always the source of a satisfaction in the resulting action but this pleasure this satisfaction in oneself is not the determining principle of the action on the contrary     the determination of the will directly by reason is the source of the feeling of pleasure and this remains a pure practical not sensible determination of the faculty of desire now as this determination has exactly the same effect within     in impelling to activity that a feeling of the pleasure to be expected from the desired action would have had we easily look on what we ourselves do as something which we merely passively feel and take the moral spring for a sensible impulse just as it happens in the socalled illusion of the senses in this case the inner sense it is a sublime thing in human nature to be determined to actions immediately by a purely rational law sublime even is the illusion that regards the subjective side of this capacity of intellectual determination as something sensible and the effect of a special sensible feeling for an intellectual feeling would be a contradiction it is also of great importance to attend to this property of our personality and as much as possible to cultivate the effect of reason on this feeling but we must beware lest by falsely extolling this moral determining principle as a spring making its source lie in particular feelings of pleasure which are in fact only results we degrade and disfigure the true genuine spring the law itself by putting as it were a false foil upon it respect not pleasure or enjoyment of happiness is something for which it is not possible that reason should have any antecedent feeling as its foundation for this would always be sensible and pathological and   consciousness of immediate obligation of the will by the law is by no means analogous to the feeling of pleasure although in relation to the faculty of desire it produces the same effect but from different sources it is only by this mode of conception however that we can attain what we are seeking namely that actions be done not merely in accordance with duty as a result of pleasant feelings but from duty which must be the true end of all moral cultivation     have we not however a word which does not express enjoyment as happiness does     but indicates a satisfaction in ones existence an analogue of the happiness which must necessarily accompany the consciousness of virtue yes this word is selfcontentment which in its proper signification always designates only a negative satisfaction in ones existence in which one is conscious of needing nothing freedom and the consciousness of it as a faculty of following the moral law with unyielding resolution is independence on inclinations at least as motives determining though not as affecting our desire and so far as i am conscious of this freedom in following my moral maxims it is the only source of an unaltered contentment which is necessarily connected with it and rests on no special feeling this may be called intellectual contentment the sensible contentment improperly socalled which rests on the satisfaction of the inclinations however delicate they may be imagined to be can never be adequate to the conception of it for the inclinations change they grow with the indulgence shown them and always leave behind a still greater void than we had thought to fill hence they are always burdensome to a rational being and although he cannot lay them aside they wrest from him the wish to be rid of them even an inclination to what is right e g to beneficence though it may much facilitate the efficacy of the moral maxims cannot produce any for in these all must be directed to the conception of the law as a determining principle if the action is to contain morality and not merely legality inclination is blind and slavish whether it be of a good sort or not and when morality is in question reason must not play the part merely of guardian to inclination but disregarding it altogether must attend simply to its own interest as pure practical reason     this very feeling of compassion and tender sympathy if it precedes the deliberation on the question of duty and becomes a determining principle is even annoying to rightthinking persons brings their deliberate maxims into confusion and makes them wish to be delivered from it and to be subject to lawgiving reason alone from this we can understand how the consciousness of this     faculty of a pure practical reason produces by action virtue a consciousness of mastery over ones inclinations and therefore of independence on them and consequently also on the discontent that always accompanies them and thus a negative satisfaction with ones state i e contentment which is primarily contentment with ones own person freedom itself becomes in this way namely indirectly capable of an enjoyment which cannot be called happiness because it does not depend on the positive concurrence of a feeling nor is it strictly speaking bliss since it does not include complete independence on inclinations and wants but it resembles bliss in so far as the determination of ones will at least can hold itself free from their influence and thus at least in its origin this enjoyment is analogous to the selfsufficiency which we can ascribe only to the supreme being from this solution of the antinomy of pure practical reason it follows that in practical principles we may at least conceive as possible a natural and necessary connexion between the consciousness of morality and the expectation of a proportionate happiness as its result though it does not follow that we can know or perceive this connexion that on the other hand principles of the pursuit of happiness cannot possibly produce morality that therefore morality is the supreme good as the first condition of the summum bonum while happiness constitutes its second element but only in such a way that it is the morally conditioned but necessary consequence of the former     only with this subordination is the summum bonum the whole object of pure practical reason which must necessarily conceive it as possible since it commands us to contribute to the utmost of our power to its realization but since the possibility of such connexion of the conditioned with its condition belongs wholly to the supersensual relation of things and cannot be given according to the laws of the world of sense although the practical consequences of the idea belong to the world of sense namely the actions that aim at realizing the summum bonum we will therefore endeavour to set forth the grounds of that possibility first in respect of what is immediately     in our power and then secondly in that which is not in our power but which reason presents to us as the supplement of our impotence for the realization of the summum bonum which by practical principles is necessary iii —of the primacy of pure practical reason in its union with the speculative reason by primacy between two or more things connected by reason i understand the prerogative belonging to one of being the first determining principle in the connexion with all the rest in a narrower practical sense it means the prerogative of the interest of one in so far as the interest of the other is subordinated to it while it is not postponed to any other to every faculty of the mind we can attribute an interest that is a principle that contains the condition on which alone the former is called into exercise reason as the faculty of principles determines   0 the interest of all the powers of the mind and is determined by its own the interest of its speculative employment consists in the cognition of the object pushed to the highest à priori principles that of its practical employment in the determination of the will in respect of the final and complete end as to what is necessary for the possibility of any employment of reason at all namely that its principles and affirmations should not contradict one another this constitutes no part of its interest but is the condition of having reason at all it is only its development not mere consistency with itself that is reckoned as its interest if practical reason could not assume or think as given anything further than what speculative reason of itself could offer it from its own insight the latter would have the primacy but supposing that it had of itself original à priori principles with which certain theoretical positions were inseparably connected while these were withdrawn from any possible insight of speculative reason which however they must not contradict then the question is which interest is the superior not which must give way for they are not necessarily conflicting     whether speculative reason which knows nothing of all that the practical offers for its acceptance should take up these propositions and although they transcend it try to unite them with its own concepts as a foreign possession handed over to it or whether it is justified in obstinately following its own separate interest and according to the canonic of epicurus rejecting as vain subtlety everything that cannot accredit its objective reality by manifest examples to be shown in experience even though it should be never so much interwoven with the interest of the practical pure use of reason and in itself not contradictory to the theoretical merely because it infringes on the interest of the speculative reason to this extent     that it removes the bounds which this latter had set to itself and gives it up to every nonsense or delusion of imagination in fact so far as practical reason is taken as dependent on pathological conditions that is as merely regulating the inclinations under the sensible principle of happiness we could not require speculative reason to take its principles from such a source mohammeds paradise or the absorption into the deity of the theosophists and mystics would press their monstrosities on the reason according to the taste of each and one might as well have no reason as surrender it in such fashion to all sorts of dreams but if pure reason of itself can be practical and is actually so as the consciousness of the moral law proves then it is still only one and the same reason which whether in a theoretical or a practical point of view judges according to à priori principles and then it is clear that although it is in the first point of view incompetent to establish certain propositions positively which however do not contradict it then as soon as these propositions are inseparably attached to the practical interest of pure reason then it must accept them though it be as something offered to it from a foreign source something that has not grown on its own ground but yet is sufficiently authenticated and it must try to compare and connect them with everything that it has in its power as speculative reason it must remember however that these are not additions to its insight but yet are extensions of its employment in another     namely a practical aspect and this is not in the least opposed to its interest which consists in the restriction of wild speculation thus when pure speculative and pure practical reason are combined in one cognition the latter has the primacy provided namely that this combination is not contingent and arbitrary but founded à priori on reason itself and therefore necessary     for without this subordination there would arise a conflict of reason with itself since if they were merely coordinate the former would close its boundaries strictly and admit nothing from the latter into its domain while the latter would extend its bounds over everything and when its needs required would seek to embrace the former within them nor could we reverse the order and require pure practical reason to be subordinate to the speculative since all interest is ultimately practical and even that of speculative reason is conditional and it is only in the practical employment of reason that it is complete iv —the immortality of the soul as a postulate of pure practical reason the realization of the summum bonum in the world is the necessary object of a will determinable by the moral law but in this will the perfect accordance of the mind with the moral law is the supreme condition of the summum bonum this then must be possible as well as its object since it is contained in the command to promote the latter now the perfect accordance of the will with the moral law is holiness a perfection of which no rational being of the sensible world is capable at any moment of his existence since nevertheless it is required as practically necessary it can only be found in a progress in infinitum towards that perfect accordance and on the principles of pure practical reason it is necessary     to assume such a practical progress as the real object of our will now this endless progress is only possible on the supposition of an endless duration of the existence and personality of the same rational being which is called the immortality of the     soul the summum bonum then practically is only possible on the supposition of the immortality of the soul consequently this immortality being inseparably connected with the moral law is a postulate of pure practical reason by which i mean a theoretical proposition not demonstrable as such but which is an inseparable result of an unconditional à priori practical law   this principle of the moral destination of our nature namely that it is only in an endless progress that we can attain perfect accordance with the moral law is of the greatest use not merely for the present purpose of supplementing the impotence of speculative reason but also with respect to religion in default of it either the moral law is quite degraded from its holiness being made out to be indulgent and conformable to our convenience or else men strain their notions of their vocation and their expectation to an unattainable goal hoping to acquire complete holiness of will and so they lose themselves in fanatical theosophic dreams which wholly contradict selfknowledge in both cases the unceasing effort to obey punctually and thoroughly a strict and inflexible command of reason which yet is not ideal but real is only hindered for a rational but finite being the only thing possible is an endless progress from the lower to higher degrees of moral perfection the infinite being to whom the condition of time is nothing     sees in this to us endless succession a whole of accordance with the moral law and the holiness which his command inexorably requires in order to be true to his justice in the share which he assigns to each in the summum bonum is to be found in a single intellectual intuition of the whole existence of rational beings all that can be expected of the creature in respect of the hope of this participation would be the consciousness of his tried character by which from the progress he has hitherto made from the worse to the morally better and the immutability of purpose which has thus become known to him he may hope for a further unbroken continuance of the   0 same however long his existence may last even beyond this life   and thus he may hope not indeed here nor at any imaginable point of his future existence but only in the endlessness of his duration which god alone can survey     to be perfectly adequate to his will without indulgence or excuse which do not harmonize with justice v —the existence of god as a postulate of pure practical reason in the foregoing analysis the moral law led to a practical problem which is prescribed by pure reason alone without the aid of any sensible motives namely that of the necessary completeness of the first and principal element of the summum bonum viz morality and as this can be perfectly solved only in eternity to the postulate of immortality the same law must also lead us to affirm the possibility of the second element of the summum bonum viz happiness proportioned to that morality and this on grounds as disinterested as before and     solely from impartial reason that is it must lead to the supposition of the existence of a cause adequate to this effect in other words it must postulate the existence of god as the necessary condition of the possibility of the summum bonum an object of the will which is necessarily connected with the moral legislation of pure reason we proceed to exhibit this connexion in a convincing manner happiness is the condition of a rational being in the world with whom everything goes according to his wish and will it rests therefore on the harmony of physical nature with his whole end and likewise with the essential determining principle of his will now the moral law as a law of freedom commands by determining principles     which ought to be quite independent on nature and on its harmony with our faculty of desire as springs but the acting rational being in the world is not the cause of the world and of nature itself there is not the least ground therefore in the moral law for a necessary connexion between morality and proportionate happiness in a being that belongs to the world as part of it and therefore dependent on it and which for that reason cannot by his will be a cause of this nature nor by his own power make it thoroughly harmonize as far as his happiness is concerned with his practical principles nevertheless in the practical problem of pure reason ie the necessary pursuit of the summum bonum such a connexion is postulated as necessary we ought to endeavour to promote the summum bonum which therefore must be possible accordingly the existence of a cause of all nature distinct from nature itself and containing the principle of this connexion namely of the exact harmony of happiness with morality is also postulated now this supreme cause must contain the principle of the harmony of nature not merely with a law of the will of rational beings but with the conception of this law in so far as they make it the supreme determining principle of the will and consequently not merely with the form of morals but with their morality as their motive that is with their moral character therefore the summum bonum is possible     in the world only on the supposition of a supreme being   having a causality corresponding to moral character now a being that is capable of acting on the conception of laws is an intelligence a rational being and the causality of such a being according to this conception of laws is his will therefore the supreme cause of nature which must be presupposed as a condition of the summum bonum     is a being which is the cause of nature by intelligence and will consequently its author that is god it follows that the postulate of the possibility of the highest derived good the best world is likewise the postulate of the reality of a highest original good that is to say of the existence of god now it was seen to be a duty for us to promote the summum bonum consequently it is not merely allowable but it is a necessity connected with duty as a requisite that we should presuppose the possibility of this summum bonum and as this is possible only on condition of the existence of god it inseparably connects the supposition of this with duty that is it is morally necessary to assume the existence of god it must be remarked here that this moral necessity is subjective that is it is a want and not objective that is itself a duty for there cannot be a duty to suppose the existence of anything since this concerns only the theoretical employment of reason moreover it is not meant by this that it is necessary to suppose the existence of god as a basis of all obligation in general for this rests as has been sufficiently proved simply on the autonomy of reason itself what belongs to duty here is only the endeavour to realize and promote the summum bonum in the world the possibility of which can therefore be postulated and as our reason finds it not conceivable except on the supposition of a supreme intelligence the admission of this existence is therefore connected with the consciousness of our     duty although the admission itself belongs to the domain of speculative reason considered in respect of this alone as a principle of explanation it may be called a hypothesis but in reference to the intelligibility of an object given us by the moral law the summum bonum and consequently of a requirement for practical purposes it may be called faith that is to say a pure rational faith since pure reason     both in its theoretical and its practical use is the sole source from which it springs from this deduction it is now intelligible why the greek schools could never attain the solution of their problem of the practical possibility of the summum bonum because they made the rule of the use which the will of man makes of his freedom the sole and sufficient ground of this possibility thinking that they had no need for that purpose of the existence of god no doubt they were so far right that they established the principle of morals of itself independently on this postulate from the relation of reason only to the will and consequently made it the supreme practical condition of the summum bonum but it was not therefore the whole condition of its possibility the epicureans had indeed assumed as the supreme principle of morality a wholly false one namely that of happiness and had substituted for a law a maxim of arbitrary choice according to every mans inclination they proceeded however consistently enough in this that they degraded their summum bonum likewise just in proportion to the meanness of their fundamental principle and looked for no greater happiness than can be attained by human prudence including temperance and moderation of the inclinations and this as we know would be scanty enough and would be very different according to circumstances not to mention the exceptions that their maxims must perpetually admit and which make them incapable of being laws the stoics on the contrary had chosen their supreme practical principle quite rightly making virtue the condition of the summum bonum but when they represented the degree of virtue required by its pure law as fully attainable in this life they not only strained the moral powers of the man whom they called the wise     beyond all the limits of his nature and assumed     a thing that contradicts all our knowledge of men but also and principally they would not allow the second element of the summum bonum namely happiness to be properly a special object of human desire but made their wise man like a divinity in his consciousness of the excellence of his person wholly independent on nature as regards his own contentment they exposed him indeed to the evils of life but made him not subject to them at the same time representing him also as free from moral evil they thus in fact left out the second element of the summum bonum namely personal happiness placing it solely in action and satisfaction with ones own personal worth thus including it in the consciousness of being morally minded in which they might have been sufficiently refuted by the voice of their own nature the doctrine of christianity   even if we do not yet consider it as a religious doctrine gives touching this point     a conception of the summum bonum the kingdom of god which alone satisfies the strictest demand of practical reason the moral law is holy unyielding and demands holiness of morals     although all the moral perfection to which man can attain is still only virtue that is a rightful disposition arising from respect for the law implying consciousness of a constant propensity to transgression or at least a want of purity that is a mixture of many spurious not moral motives of obedience to the law consequently a selfesteem combined with humility in respect then of the holiness which the christian law requires this leaves the creature nothing but a progress in infinitum but for that very reason it justifies him in hoping for an endless duration of his existence the worth of a character perfectly accordant with the moral law is infinite since   0 the only restriction on all possible happiness in the judgment of a wise and allpowerful distributor of it is the absence of conformity of rational beings to their duty but the moral law of itself does not promise any happiness for according to our conceptions of an order of nature in general this is not necessarily connected with obedience to the law now christian morality supplies this defect of the second indispensable element of the summum bonum by representing the world in which rational beings devote themselves with all their soul to the moral law as a kingdom of god in which nature and morality are brought into     a harmony foreign to each of itself by a holy author who makes the derived summum bonum possible holiness of life is prescribed to them as a rule even in this life while the welfare proportioned to it namely bliss is represented as attainable only in an eternity because the former must always be the pattern of their conduct in every state and progress towards it is already possible and necessary in this life while the latter under the name of happiness cannot be attained at all in this world so far as our own power is concerned and therefore is made simply an object of hope nevertheless the christian principle of morality itself is not theological so as to be heteronomy but is autonomy of pure practical reason since it does not make the knowledge of god and his will the foundation of these laws but only of the attainment of the summum bonum on condition of following these laws and it does not even place the proper spring of this obedience in the desired results but solely in the conception of duty as that of which the faithful observance alone constitutes the worthiness to obtain those happy consequences in this manner the moral laws lead through the conception of the summum bonum as the object and final end of pure practical reason to religion     that is to the recognition of all duties as divine commands not as sanctions   that is to say arbitrary ordinances of a foreign will and contingent in themselves but as essential laws of every free will in itself which nevertheless must be regarded as commands of the supreme being because it is only from a morally perfect holy and good and at the same time allpowerful will and consequently only through harmony with this will that we can hope to attain the summum bonum which the moral law makes it our duty to take as the object of our endeavours here again then all remains disinterested and founded merely on duty neither fear nor hope being made the fundamental springs which if taken as principles     would destroy the whole moral worth of actions the moral law commands me to make the highest possible good in a world the ultimate object of all my conduct but i cannot hope to effect this otherwise than by the harmony of my will with that of a holy and good author of the world and although the conception of the summum bonum as a whole in which the greatest happiness is conceived as combined in the most exact proportion with the highest degree of moral perfection possible in creatures includes my own happiness yet it is not this that is the determining principle of the will which is enjoined to promote the summum bonum but the moral law which on the contrary limits by strict conditions my unbounded desire of happiness hence also morality is not properly the doctrine how we should make ourselves happy but how we should become worthy of happiness it is only when religion is added that there also comes in the hope of participating some day in happiness in proportion as we have endeavoured to be not unworthy of it     a man is worthy to possess a thing or a state when his possession of it is in harmony with the summum bonum we can now easily see that all worthiness depends on moral conduct since in the conception of the summum bonum this constitutes the condition of the rest which belongs to ones state namely the participation of happiness now it follows from this that morality should never be treated as a doctrine of happiness that is an instruction how to become happy for it has to do simply with the rational condition conditio sine qua non of happiness not with the means of attaining it but when morality has been completely expounded which merely imposes duties instead of providing rules for selfish desires then first after the moral desire to promote the summum bonum to bring the kingdom of god to us has been awakened a desire founded on a law and which could not previously arise in any selfish mind and when for the behoof of this desire the step to religion has been taken then this ethical doctrine may be also called a doctrine of happiness because the hope of happiness first begins with religion only     we can also see from this that when we ask what is gods ultimate end in creating the world we must not name the happiness of the rational beings in it but the summum bonum which adds a further condition to that wish of such beings namely the condition of being worthy of happiness that is the morality of these same rational beings a condition which alone contains the rule by which only they can hope to share in the former at the hand of a wise author for as wisdom theoretically considered signifies the knowledge of the summum bonum and practically the accordance of the will with the summum bonum we cannot attribute to a supreme independent wisdom an end based merely on goodness     for we cannot conceive the action of this goodness in respect of the happiness of rational beings as suitable to the highest original good except under the restrictive conditions of harmony with the holiness   of his will therefore those who placed the end of creation in the glory of god provided that this is not conceived anthropomorphically as a desire to be praised have perhaps hit upon the best expression for nothing glorifies god more than that which is the most estimable thing in the world respect for his command the observance of the holy duty that his law imposes on us when there is added thereto his glorious plan of crowning such a beautiful order of things with corresponding happiness if the latter to speak humanly makes him worthy of     love by the former he is an object of adoration even men can never acquire respect by benevolence alone though they may gain love so that the greatest beneficence only procures them honour when it is regulated by worthiness that in the order of ends man and with him every rational being is an end in himself that is that he can never be used merely as a means by any     not even by god without being at the same time an end also himself that therefore humanity in our person must be holy to ourselves this follows now of itself because he is the subject   of the moral law in other words of that which is holy in itself and on account of which and in agreement with which alone can anything be termed holy for this moral law is founded on the autonomy of his will as a free will which by its universal laws must necessarily be able to agree with that to which it is to submit itself vi —of the postulates of pure practical reason in general they all proceed from the principle of morality which is not a postulate but a law by which reason determines the will directly which will because it is so determined as a pure will requires these necessary conditions of obedience to its precept these postulates are not theoretical dogmas but suppositions practically necessary while then they do not   extend our speculative knowledge they give objective reality to the ideas of speculative reason in general by means of their reference to what is practical and give it a right to concepts the possibility even of which it could not otherwise venture to affirm these postulates are those of immortality freedom positively considered as the causality of a being so far as he belongs to   0 the intelligible world and the existence of god the first results from the practically necessary condition of a duration     adequate to the complete fulfilment of the moral law the second from the necessary supposition of independence on the sensible world and of the faculty of determining ones will according to the law of an intelligible world that is of freedom the third from the necessary condition of the existence of the summum bonum in such an intelligible world by the supposition of the supreme independent good that is the existence of god thus the fact that respect for the moral law necessarily makes the summum bonum an object of our endeavours and the supposition thence resulting of its objective reality lead through the postulates of practical reason to conceptions which speculative reason might indeed present as problems but could never solve thus it leads—  to that one in the solution of which the latter could do nothing but commit paralogisms namely that of immortality because it could not lay hold of the character of permanence by which to complete the psychological conception of an ultimate subject necessarily ascribed to the soul in selfconsciousness so as to make it the real conception of a substance a character which practical reason furnishes by the postulate of a duration required for accordance with the moral law in the summum bonum which is the whole end of practical reason   it leads to that of which speculative reason contained nothing but antinomy the solution of which it could only found on a notion problematically conceivable indeed but whose objective reality it could not prove or determine namely the cosmological idea of an intelligible world and the consciousness of our existence in it by means of the postulate of freedom the reality of which it lays down by virtue of the moral law and with it likewise the law of an intelligible world to which speculative reason could only point but could not define its conception   what speculative reason was able to think but was obliged to leave undetermined as a mere transcendental ideal     viz the theological conception of the first being to this it gives significance in a practical view that is as a condition     of the possibility of the object of a will determined by that law namely as the supreme principle of the summum bonum in an intelligible world by means of moral legislation in it invested with sovereign power is our knowledge however actually extended in this way by pure practical reason and is that immanent in practical reason which for the speculative was only transcendent certainly but only in a practical point of view for we do not thereby take knowledge of the nature of our souls nor of the intelligible world nor of the supreme being with respect to what they are in themselves but we have merely combined the conceptions of them in the practical concept of the summum bonum as the object of our will and this altogether à priori but only by means of the moral law and merely in reference to it in respect of the object which it commands but how freedom is possible and how we are to conceive this kind of causality theoretically and positively is not thereby discovered but only that there is such a causality is postulated by the moral law and in its behoof it is the same with the remaining ideas the possibility of which no human intelligence will ever fathom but the truth of which on the other hand no sophistry will ever wrest from the conviction even of the commonest man vii —how is it possible to conceive an extension of pure reason in a practical point of view without its knowledge as speculative being enlarged at the same time     in order not to be too abstract we will answer this question at once in its application to the present case in order to extend a pure cognition practically there must be an à priori purpose given that is an end as object of the will which independently on all theological principle is presented as practically necessary by an imperative which determines the will directly a categorical imperative and in this case that is the summum bonum this however is not possible without presupposing three theoretical conceptions for which because they are mere conceptions of pure reason no corresponding intuition     can be found nor consequently by the path of theory any objective reality namely freedom immortality and god thus by the practical law which commands the existence of the highest good possible in a world the possibility of those objects of pure speculative reason is postulated and the objective reality which the latter could not assure them by this the theoretical knowledge of pure reason does indeed obtain an accession but it consists only in this that those concepts which otherwise it had to look upon as problematical merely thinkable concepts are now shown assertorially to be such as actually have objects because practical reason indispensably requires their existence for the possibility of its object the summum bonum which practically is absolutely necessary and this justifies theoretical reason in assuming them but this extension of theoretical reason     is no extension of speculative that is we cannot make any positive use of it in a theoretical point of view for as nothing is accomplished in this by practical reason further than that these concepts are real and actually have their possible objects and nothing in the way of intuition of them is given thereby which indeed could not be demanded hence the admission of this reality does not render any synthetical proposition possible consequently this discovery does not in the least help us to extend this knowledge of ours in a speculative point of view although it does in respect of the practical employment of pure reason the above three ideas of speculative reason are still in themselves not cognitions they are however transcendent thoughts in which there is nothing impossible now by help of an apodictic practical law being necessary conditions of that which it commands to be made an object they acquire objective reality that is we learn from it that they have objects without being able to point out how the conception of them is related to an object and this too is still not a cognition of these objects for we cannot thereby form any synthetical judgment about them nor determine their application theoretically consequently we can make no theoretical rational use of them at all in which use all speculative knowledge of reason consists nevertheless the     theoretical knowledge not indeed of these objects but of reason generally is so far enlarged by this that by the practical postulates objects were given to those ideas a merely problematical thought having by this means first acquired objective reality there is therefore no extension of the knowledge of given supersensible objects but an extension of theoretical reason and of its knowledge in respect of the supersensible generally inasmuch as it is compelled to admit that there are such objects     although it is not able to define them more closely so as itself to extend this knowledge of the objects which have now been given it on practical grounds and only for practical use for this accession then pure theoretical reason for which all those ideas are transcendent and without object has simply to thank its practical faculty in this they become immanent and constitutive being the source of the possibility of realizing the necessary object of pure practical reason the summum bonum whereas apart from this they are transcendent and merely regulative principles of speculative reason which do not require it to assume a new object beyond experience but only to bring its use in experience nearer to completeness but when once reason is in possession of this accession it will go to work with these ideas as speculative reason properly only to assure the certainty of its practical use in a negative manner that is not extending but clearing up its knowledge so as on one side to keep off anthropomorphism as the source of superstition or seeming extension of these conceptions by supposed experience and on the other side fanaticism which promises the same by means of supersensible intuition or feelings of the like kind all these are hindrances to the practical use of pure reason so that the removal of them may certainly be considered an extension of our knowledge in a practical point of view without contradicting the admission that for speculative purposes reason has not in the least gained by this every employment of reason in respect of an object requires pure concepts of the understanding categories without which no object can be conceived these can be applied to the theoretical employment of reason i e to that kind of knowledge     only in case an intuition which is always sensible is taken as a basis and therefore merely in order   0 to conceive by means of them an object of possible experience now here what have to be thought by means of the categories in order to be known are ideas of reason which cannot be given in any experience only we are not here concerned with the theoretical knowledge of the objects of these ideas but only with this whether they have objects at all this reality is supplied by pure practical reason and theoretical reason has nothing further to do in this but to think those objects by means of categories this as we have elsewhere clearly shown can be done well enough without needing any intuition either sensible or supersensible because the categories have their seat and origin in the pure understanding simply as the faculty of thought before and independently on any intuition and they always only signify an object in general no matter in what way it may be given to us now when the categories are to be applied to these ideas it is not possible to give them any object in intuition but that such an object actually exists and consequently that the category as a mere form of thought is here not empty but has significance this is sufficiently assured them by an object which practical reason presents beyond doubt in the concept of the summum bonum namely the reality of the conceptions which are required for the possibility of the summum bonum without however effecting by this accession the least extension of our knowledge on theoretical principles when these ideas of god of an intelligible world the kingdom of god and of immortality are further determined by predicates taken from our own nature we must not regard this determination as a sensualizing of those pure rational ideas     anthropomorphism nor as a transcendent knowledge of supersensible objects for these predicates are no others than understanding and will considered too in the relation to each other in which they must be conceived in the moral law and therefore only so far as a pure practical use is made of them as to all the rest that belongs to these conceptions psychologically     that is so far as we observe these faculties of ours empirically in their exercise eg that the understanding of man is discursive and its notions therefore not intuitions but thoughts that these follow one another in time that his will has its satisfaction always dependent on the existence of its object c which cannot be the case in the supreme being from all this we abstract in that case and then there remains of the notions by which we conceive a pure intelligence nothing more than just what is required for the possibility of conceiving a moral law there is then a knowledge of god indeed but only for practical purposes and if we attempt to extend it to a theoretical knowledge we find an understanding that has intuitions not thoughts a will that is directed to objects on the existence of which its satisfaction does not in the least depend not to mention the transcendental predicates as for example a magnitude of existence that is duration which however is not in time the only possible means we have of conceiving existence as magnitude now these are all attributes of which we can form no conception that would help to the knowledge of the object and we learn from this that they can never be used for a theory of supersensible beings so that on this side they are quite incapable of being the foundation of a speculative knowledge and their use is limited simply to the practice of the moral law     this last is so obvious and can be proved so clearly by fact that we may confidently challenge all pretended natural theologians a singular name   to specify over and above the     merely ontological predicates one single attribute whether of the understanding or of the will determining this object of theirs of which we could not show incontrovertibly that if we abstract from it everything anthropomorphic nothing would remain to us but the mere word without our being able to connect with it the smallest notion by which we could hope for an extension of theoretical knowledge but as to the practical there still remains to us of the attributes of understanding and will the conception of a relation to which objective reality is given by the practical law which determines à priori precisely this relation of the understanding to the will when once this is done then reality is given to the conception of the object of a will morally determined the conception of the summum bonum and with it to the conditions of its possibility the ideas of god freedom and immortality but always only relatively to the practice of the moral law and not for any speculative purpose according to these remarks it is now easy to find the answer to the weighty question whether the notion of god is one belonging to physics and therefore also to metaphysics     which contains the pure à priori principles of the former in their universal import or to morals if we have recourse to god as the author of all things in order to explain the arrangements of nature or its changes this is at least not a physical explanation and is a complete confession that our philosophy has come to an end since we are obliged to assume something of which in itself we have otherwise no conception in order to be able to frame a conception of the possibility of what we see before our eyes metaphysics however cannot enable us to attain by certain inference from the knowledge of this world to the conception of god and to the proof of his existence for this reason that in order to say that this world could be produced only by a god according to the conception implied by this word we should know this world as the most perfect whole possible and for this purpose should also know all possible worlds in order to be able to compare them with this in other words we should be omniscient it is absolutely impossible however to know the existence     of this being from mere concepts because every existential proposition that is every proposition that affirms the existence of a being of which i frame a concept is a synthetic proposition that is one by which i go beyond that conception and affirm of it more than was thought in the conception itself namely that this concept in the understanding has an object corresponding to it outside the understanding and this it is obviously impossible to elicit by any reasoning there remains therefore only one single process possible for reason to attain this knowledge namely to start from the supreme principle of its pure practical use which in every case is directed simply to the existence of something as a consequence of reason and thus determine its object then its inevitable problem namely the necessary direction of the will to the summum bonum discovers to us not only the necessity of assuming such a first being     in reference to the possibility of this good in the world but what is most remarkable something which reason in its progress on the path of physical nature altogether failed to find namely an accurately defined conception of this first being as we can know only a small part of this world and can still less compare it with all possible worlds we may indeed from its order design and greatness infer a wise good powerful c author of it but not that he is allwise allgood allpowerful c it may indeed very well be granted that we should be justified in supplying this inevitable defect by a legitimate and reasonable hypothesis namely that when wisdom goodness c are displayed in all the parts that offer themselves to our nearer knowledge it is just the same in all the rest and that it would therefore be reasonable to ascribe all possible perfections to the author of the world but these are not strict logical inferences in which we can pride ourselves on our insight but only permitted conclusions in which we may be indulged and which require further recommendation before we can make use of them on the path of empirical inquiry then physics the conception of god remains always a conception of the perfection of the first being not accurately enough determined to be held adequate to the conception of deity with metaphysic     in its transcendental part nothing whatever can be accomplished when i now try to test this conception by reference to the object of practical reason i find that the moral principle admits as possible only the conception of an author of the world possessed of the highest perfection he must be omniscient in order to know my conduct up to the inmost root of my mental state in all possible cases and into all future time omnipotent in order to allot to it its fitting consequences similarly he must be omnipresent eternal c thus the moral law by means of the conception of the summum bonum     as the object of a pure practical reason determines the concept of the first being as the supreme being a thing which the physical and in its higher development the metaphysical in other words the whole speculative course of reason was unable to effect the conception of god then is one that belongs originally not to physics i e to speculative reason but to morals the same may be said of the other conceptions of reason of which we have treated above as postulates of it in its practical use in the history of grecian philosophy we find no distinct traces of a pure rational theology earlier than anaxagoras but this is not because the older philosophers had not intelligence or penetration enough to raise themselves to it by the path of speculation at least with the aid of a thoroughly reasonable hypothesis what could have been easier what more natural than the thought which of itself occurs to every one to assume instead of several causes of the world instead of an indeterminate degree of perfection a single rational cause having all perfection but the evils in the world seemed to them to be much too serious objections to allow them to feel themselves justified in such a hypothesis they showed intelligence and penetration then in this very point that they did not allow themselves to adopt it but on the contrary looked about amongst natural causes to see if they could not find in them the qualities and power required for a first being but when this acute people had advanced so far in their investigations of nature as to treat even moral questions philosophically on which other nations had never     done anything but talk then first they found a new and practical want which did not fail to give definiteness to their conception of the first being and in this the speculative reason played the part of spectator or at best had the merit of embellishing a conception that had not grown on its own ground and of applying a series of confirmations     from the study of nature now brought forward for the first time not indeed to strengthen the authority of this conception which was already established but rather to make a show with a supposed discovery of theoretical reason from these remarks the reader of the critique of pure speculative reason will be thoroughly convinced how highly necessary that laborious deduction of the categories was and how fruitful for theology and morals for if on the one hand we place them in the pure understanding it is by this deduction alone that we can be prevented from regarding them with plato as innate and founding on them extravagant pretensions to theories of the supersensible to which we can see no end and by which we should make theology a magic lantern of chimera on the other hand if we regard them as acquired this deduction saves us from restricting with epicurus all and every use of them even for practical purposes to the objects and motives of the senses but now that the critique has shown by that deduction first that they are not of empirical origin but have their seat and source à priori in the pure understanding secondly that as they refer to objects in general independently on the intuition of them hence although they cannot effect theoretical knowledge except in application to empirical objects yet when applied to an object given by pure practical reason they enable us to conceive the supersensible definitely only so far however as it is defined by such predicates as are necessarily connected with the pure practical purpose given à priori and with its possibility the speculative restriction of pure reason and its practical extension bring it into that     relation of equality in which reason in general can be employed suitably to its end and this example proves better than any other that the path to wisdom   0 if it is to be made sure and not to be impassable or misleading must with us men inevitably pass through science but it is not till this is completed that we can be convinced that it leads to this goal viii —of belief from a requirement of pure reason a want or requirement of pure reason in its speculative use leads only to a hypothesis that of pure practical reason to a postulate for in the former case i ascend from the result as high as i please in the series of causes not in order to give objective reality to the result e g the causal connexion of things and changes in the world but in order thoroughly to satisfy my inquiring reason in respect of it thus i see before me order and design in nature and need not resort to speculation to assure myself of their reality but to explain them i have to presuppose a deity as their cause and then since the inference from an effect to a definite cause is always uncertain and doubtful especially to a cause so precise and so perfectly defined as we have to conceive in god hence the highest degree of certainty to which this presupposition can be brought is that it is the most rational opinion for us men       on the other hand a requirement of pure practical reason is based on a duty that of making something the summum bonum the object of my will so as to promote it with all my powers in which case i must suppose its possibility and consequently also the conditions necessary     thereto namely god freedom and immortality since i cannot prove these by my speculative reason although neither can i refute them this duty is founded on something that is indeed quite independent on these suppositions and is of itself apodictically certain namely the moral law and so far it needs no further support by theoretical views as to the inner constitution of things the secret final aim of the order of the world or a presiding ruler thereof in order to bind me in the most perfect manner to act in unconditional conformity to the law but the subjective effect of this law namely the mental disposition conformed to it and made necessary by it to promote the practically possible summum bonum this presupposes at least that the latter is possible for it would be practically impossible to strive after the object of a conception which at bottom was empty and had no object now the abovementioned postulates concern only the physical or metaphysical conditions of the possibility of the summum bonum     in a word those which lie in the nature of things not however for the sake of an arbitrary speculative purpose but of a practically necessary end of a pure rational will which in this case does not choose but obeys an inexorable command of reason the foundation of which is objective in the constitution of things as they must be universally judged by pure reason and is not based on inclination for we are in nowise justified in assuming on account of what we wish on merely subjective grounds that the means thereto are possible or that its object is real this then is an absolutely necessary requirement and what it presupposes is not merely justified as an allowable hypothesis but as a postulate in a practical point of view and admitting that the pure moral law inexorably binds every man as a command not as a rule of prudence the righteous man may say i will that there be a god that my existence in this world be also an existence outside the chain of physical causes and in a pure world of the understanding and lastly that my duration be endless i firmly abide by this and will not let this faith be taken from me for in this instance alone my interest because i must not relax anything of it inevitably determines my judgment without regarding sophistries however unable i     may be to answer them or to oppose them with others more plausible     0 in order to prevent misconception in the use of a notion as yet so unusual as that of a faith of pure practical reason let me be permitted to add one more remark it might almost seem as if this rational faith were here announced as itself a command namely that we should assume the summum bonum as possible but a faith that is commanded is nonsense let the preceding analysis however be remembered of what is required to be supposed in the conception of the summum bonum and it will be seen that it cannot be commanded to assume this possibility and no practical disposition of mind is required to admit it but that speculative reason must concede it without being asked for no one can affirm that it is impossible in itself that rational beings in the world should at the same time be worthy of happiness in conformity with the moral law and also possess this happiness proportionately now in respect of the first element of the summum bonum namely that which concerns morality the     moral law gives merely a command and to doubt the possibility of that element would be the same as to call in question the moral law itself     but as regards the second element of that object namely happiness perfectly proportioned to that worthiness it is true that there is no need of a command to admit its possibility in general for theoretical reason has nothing to say against it but the manner in which we have to conceive this harmony of the laws of nature with those of freedom has in it something in respect of which we have a choice because theoretical reason decides nothing with apodictic certainty about it and in respect of this there may be a moral interest which turns the scale i had said above that in a mere course of nature in the world an accurate correspondence between happiness and moral worth is not to be expected and must be regarded as impossible and that therefore the possibility of the summum bonum cannot be admitted from this side except on the supposition of a moral author of the world i purposely reserved the restriction of this judgment to the subjective conditions of our reason in order not to make use of it until the manner of this belief should be defined more precisely the fact is that the impossibility referred to is merely subjective that is our reason finds it impossible for it to render conceivable in the way of a mere course of nature a connexion so exactly proportioned and so thoroughly adapted to an end between two sets of events happening according to such distinct laws although as with everything else in nature that is adapted to an end it cannot prove that is show by sufficient objective reasons that it is not possible by universal laws of nature now however a deciding principle of a different kind comes into play to turn the scale in this uncertainty of speculative reason the command to promote the summum bonum is established on an objective basis in practical reason the possibility of the same in general is likewise established on an objective basis     in theoretical reason which has nothing to say against it but reason cannot decide objectively in what way we are to conceive this possibility whether by universal     laws of nature without a wise author presiding over nature or only on supposition of such an author now here there comes in a subjective condition of reason the only way theoretically possible for it of conceiving the exact harmony of the kingdom of nature with the kingdom of morals which is the condition of the possibility of the summum bonum and at the same time the only one conducive to morality which depends on an objective law of reason now since the promotion of this summum bonum and therefore the supposition of its possibility are objectively necessary though only as a result of practical reason while at the same time the manner in which we would conceive it rests with our own choice and in this choice a free interest of pure practical reason decides for the assumption of a wise author of the world it is clear that the principle that herein determines our judgment though as a want it is subjective yet at the same time being the means of promoting what is objectively practically necessary is the foundation of a maxim of belief in a moral point of view that is a faith of pure practical reason this then is not commanded but being a voluntary determination of our judgment conducive to the moral commanded purpose and moreover harmonizing with the theoretical requirement of reason to assume that existence and to make it the foundation of our further employment of reason it has itself sprung from the moral disposition of mind it may therefore at times waver even in the welldisposed but can never be reduced to unbelief ix —of the wise adaptation of mans cognitive faculties to his practical destination     if human nature is destined to endeavour after the summum bonum we must suppose also that the measure of its cognitive faculties and particularly their relation to one another is suitable to this end now the critique of pure speculative reason proves that this is incapable of solving satisfactorily the most weighty problems that are proposed to it although it does not ignore the natural and important hints received from the same reason nor the great steps that it can make to approach to this great goal     that is set before it which however it can never reach of itself even with the help of the greatest knowledge of nature nature then seems here to have provided us only in a stepmotherly fashion with the faculty required for our end suppose now that in this matter nature had conformed to our wish and had given us that capacity of discernment or that enlightenment which we would gladly possess or which some imagine they actually possess what would in all probability be the consequence unless our whole nature were at the same time changed our inclinations which always have the first word would first of all demand their own satisfaction and joined with rational reflection the greatest possible and most lasting satisfaction under the name of happiness the moral law     would afterwards speak in order to keep them within their proper bounds and even to subject them all to a higher end which has no regard to inclination but instead of the conflict that the moral disposition has now to carry on with the inclinations in which though after some defeats moral strength of mind may be gradually acquired god and eternity with their awful majesty would stand unceasingly before our eyes for what we can prove perfectly is to us as certain as that of which we are assured by the sight of our eyes transgression of the law would no doubt be avoided what is commanded would be done but the mental disposition from which actions ought to proceed cannot be infused by any command and in this case the spur of action is ever active and external so that reason has no need to exert itself in order to gather strength to resist the inclinations by a lively representation of the dignity of the law hence most of the actions that conformed to the law would be done from fear a few only from hope and none at all from duty and the moral worth of actions on which alone in the eyes of supreme wisdom the worth of the person and even that of the world depends would cease to exist as long as the nature of man remains what it is his conduct would thus be changed into mere mechanism in which as in a puppet show everything would gesticulate well but there would be no life in the figures now when it is quite otherwise with     us when with all the effort of our reason we have only a very obscure and doubtful view into the future when the governor of the world allows us only to conjecture his existence and his majesty not to behold them or prove them clearly and on the other hand the moral law within us without promising or threatening anything with certainty demands of us disinterested respect and only when this respect has become active     and dominant does it allow us by means of it a prospect into the world of the supersensible and then only with weak glances all this being so there is room for true moral disposition immediately devoted to the law and a rational creature can become worthy of sharing in the summum bonum that corresponds to the worth of his person and not merely to his actions thus what the study of nature and of man teaches us sufficiently elsewhere may well be true here also that the unsearchable wisdom by which we exist is not less worthy of admiration in what it has denied than in what it has granted     part second methodology of pure practical reason         methodology of pure practical reason by the methodology of pure practical reason we are not to understand the mode of proceeding with pure practical principles whether in study or in exposition with a view to a scientific knowledge of them which alone is what is properly called method elsewhere in theoretical philosophy for popular knowledge requires a manner science a method i e a process according to principles of reason by which alone the manifold of any branch of knowledge can become a system on the contrary by this methodology is understood the mode in which   we can give the laws of pure practical reason access to the human mind and influence on its maxims that is by which we can make the objectively practical reason subjectively practical also now it is clear enough that those determining principles of the will which alone make maxims properly moral and give them a moral worth namely the direct conception of the law and the objective necessity of obeying it as our duty must be regarded as the proper springs of actions since otherwise legality of actions might be produced but not morality of character but it is not so clear on the contrary it must at first sight seem to everyone very improbable that even subjectively that exhibition of pure virtue can have more power over the human mind   0 and supply a far stronger spring even for effecting that legality of actions and can produce more powerful resolutions  00 to prefer the law from pure respect for it to every other consideration than all the deceptive allurements of pleasure or of all that may be reckoned as happiness or even than all threatenings of pain and misfortune nevertheless this is actually the case and if human nature were not so constituted no mode of presenting the law by roundabout ways and indirect recommendations would ever produce morality of character all would be simple hypocrisy the law would be hated or at least despised while it was followed for the sake of ones own advantage the letter of the law legality would be found in our actions but not the spirit of it in our minds morality and as with all our efforts we could not quite free ourselves from reason in our judgment we must inevitably appear in our own eyes worthless depraved men even though we should seek to compensate ourselves for this mortification before the inner tribunal by enjoying the pleasure that a supposed natural or divine law might be imagined to have connected with a sort of police machinery regulating its operations by what was done without troubling itself about the motives for doing it it cannot indeed be denied that in order to bring an uncultivated or degraded mind into the track of moral goodness some preparatory guidance is necessary to attract it by a view of its own advantage or to alarm it by fear of loss but as soon as this mechanical work these leadingstrings have produced some effect then we must bring before the mind the pure moral motive which not only because it is the only one that can be the foundation of a character a practically consistent habit of mind with unchangeable maxims  0  but also because it teaches a man to feel his own dignity gives the mind a power unexpected even by himself to tear himself from all sensible attachments so far as they would fain have the rule and to find a rich compensation for the sacrifice he offers in the independence of his rational nature and the greatness of soul to which he sees that he is destined we will therefore show by such observations as every one can make that this property of our minds this receptivity     for a pure moral interest and consequently the moving force of the pure conception of virtue when it is properly applied to the human heart is the most powerful spring and when a continued and punctual observance of moral maxims is in question the only spring of good conduct it must however be remembered that if these observations only prove the reality of such a feeling but do not show any moral improvement brought about by it this is no argument against the only method that exists of making the objectively practical laws of pure reason subjectively practical through the mere force of the conception of duty nor does it prove that this method is a vain delusion for as it has never yet come into vogue experience can say nothing of its results one can only ask for proofs of the receptivity for such springs and these i will now briefly present and then sketch the method of founding and cultivating genuine moral dispositions when we attend to the course of conversation in mixed companies consisting not merely of learned persons and subtle reasoners but also of men of business or of women we observe that besides storytelling and jesting another kind of entertainment finds a place in them namely argument for stories if they are to have novelty and interest are soon exhausted and jesting is likely to become insipid  0  now of all argument there is none in which persons are more ready to join who find any other subtle discussion tedious none that brings more liveliness into the company than that which concerns the moral worth of this or that action by which the character of some person is to be made out persons to whom in other cases anything subtle and speculative in theoretical questions is dry and irksome presently join in when the question is to make out the moral import of a good or bad action that has been related and they display an exactness a refinement a subtlety in excogitating everything that can lessen the purity of purpose and consequently the degree of virtue in it which we do not expect from them in any other kind of speculation in these criticisms persons who are passing judgment on others often reveal their own character some in exercising their judicial office especially     upon the dead seem inclined chiefly to defend the goodness that is related of this or that deed against all injurious charges of insincerity and ultimately to defend the whole moral worth of the person against the reproach of dissimulation and secret wickedness others on the contrary turn their thoughts more upon attacking this worth by accusation and faultfinding we cannot always however attribute to these latter the intention of arguing away virtue altogether out of all human examples in order to make it an empty name often on the contrary it is only wellmeant strictness in determining the true moral import of actions according to an uncompromising law comparison with such a law instead of with examples lowers selfconceit in moral matters very much and not merely teaches humility but makes everyone feel it when he examines himself closely nevertheless we can for the most part observe in those who defend the purity of purpose in giving examples that where there is the presumption of uprightness  0  they are anxious to remove even the least spot lest if all examples had their truthfulness disputed and if the purity of all human virtue were denied it might in the end be regarded as a mere phantom and so all effort to attain it be made light of as vain affectation and delusive conceit i do not know why the educators of youth have not long since made use of this propensity of reason to enter with pleasure upon the most subtle examination of the practical questions that are thrown up and why they have not after first laying the foundation of a purely moral catechism searched through the biographies of ancient and modern times with the view of having at hand instances of the duties laid down in which especially by comparison of similar actions under different circumstances they might exercise the critical judgment of their scholars in remarking their greater or less moral significance this is a thing in which they would find that even early youth which is still unripe for speculation of other kinds would soon become very acute and not a little interested because it feels the progress of its faculty of judgment and what is most important they could hope with confidence that the frequent practice of knowing and approving     good conduct in all its purity and on the other hand of remarking with regret or contempt the least deviation from it although it may be pursued only as a sport in which children may compete with one another yet will leave a lasting impression of esteem on the one hand and disgust on the other and so by the mere habit of looking on such actions as deserving approval or blame a good foundation would be laid for uprightness in the future course of life  0  only i wish they would spare them the example of socalled noble supermeritorious actions in which our sentimental books so much abound and would refer all to duty merely and to the worth that a man can and must give himself in his own eyes by the consciousness of not having transgressed it since whatever runs up into empty wishes and longings after inaccessible perfection produces mere heroes of romance who while they pique themselves on their feeling for transcendent greatness release themselves in return from the observance of common and everyday obligations which then seem to them petty and insignificant   but if it is asked what then is really pure morality by which as a touchstone we must test the moral significance of every action then i must admit that it is only philosophers that can make the decision of this question doubtful for to common sense it has been decided long ago not indeed by abstract general formulæ but by habitual use like the distinction between the right and left hand we will then point out the criterion of pure virtue in an example first and imagining that it is set     before a boy of say ten years old for his judgment we will see whether  0  he would necessarily judge so of himself without being guided by his teacher tell him the history of an honest man whom men want to persuade to join the calumniators of an innocent and powerless person say anne boleyn accused by henry viii of england he is offered advantages great gifts or high rank he rejects them this will excite mere approbation and applause in the mind of the hearer now begins the threatening of loss amongst these traducers are his best friends who now renounce his friendship near kinsfolk who threaten to disinherit him he being without fortune powerful persons who can persecute and harass him in all places and circumstances a prince who threatens him with loss of freedom yea loss of life then to fill the measure of suffering and that he may feel the pain that only the morally good heart can feel very deeply let us conceive his family threatened with extreme distress and want entreating him to yield conceive himself though upright yet with feelings not hard or insensible either to compassion or to his own distress conceive him i say at the moment when he wishes that he had never lived to see the day that exposed him to such unutterable anguish yet remaining true to his uprightness of purpose without wavering or even doubting then will my youthful hearer be raised gradually from mere approval to admiration from that to amazement and finally to the greatest veneration and a lively wish that he himself could be such a man though certainly not in such circumstances yet virtue is here worth so much only because it costs so much not because it brings any profit all the admiration and even the endeavour to resemble this character rest wholly on the purity of the moral principle which can only be strikingly shown  0  by removing from the springs of action everything that men may regard as part of happiness morality then must have the more power over the human heart the more purely it is exhibited whence it follows that if the law of morality and the image of holiness and virtue are to exercise any influence at all on our souls they can do so only so far as they are laid to heart in their purity as motives     unmixed with any view to prosperity for it is in suffering that they display themselves most nobly now that whose removal strengthens the effect of a moving force must have been a hindrance consequently every admixture of motives taken from our own happiness is a hindrance to the influence of the moral law on the heart i affirm further that even in that admired action if the motive from which it was done was a high regard for duty then it is just this respect for the law that has the greatest influence on the mind of the spectator not any pretension to a supposed inward greatness of mind or noble meritorious sentiments consequently duty not merit must have not only the most definite but when it is represented in the true light of its inviolability the most penetrating influence on the mind it is more necessary than ever to direct attention to this method in our times when men hope to produce more effect on the mind with soft tender feelings or highflown puffingup pretensions which rather wither the heart than strengthen it than by a plain and earnest representation of duty which is more suited to human imperfection and to progress in goodness to set before children as a pattern actions that are called noble magnanimous meritorious with the notion of captivating them by infusing an enthusiam for such actions is to defeat our end  0  for as they are still so backward in the observance of the commonest duty and even in the correct estimation of it this means simply to make them fantastical romancers betimes but even with the instructed and experienced part of mankind this supposed spring has if not an injurious at least no genuine moral effect on the heart which however is what it was desired to produce all feelings especially those that are to produce unwonted exertions must accomplish their effect at the moment they are at their height and before they calm down otherwise they effect nothing for as there was nothing to strengthen the heart but only to excite it it naturally returns to its normal moderate tone and thus falls back into its previous languor principles must be built on conceptions on any other basis there can only be paroxysms which can give the person no moral worth nay     not even confidence in himself without which the highest good in man consciousness of the morality of his mind and character cannot exist now if these conceptions are to become subjectively practical we must not rest satisfied with admiring the objective law of morality and esteeming it highly in reference to humanity but we must consider the conception of it in relation to man as an individual and then this law appears in a form indeed that is highly deserving of respect but not so pleasant as if it belonged to the element to which he is naturally accustomed but on the contrary as often compelling him to quit this element not without selfdenial and to betake himself to a higher in which he can only maintain himself with trouble and with unceasing apprehension of a relapse in a word the moral law demands  0  obedience from duty not from predilection which cannot and ought not to be presupposed at all let us now see in an example whether the conception of an action as a noble and magnanimous one has more subjective moving power than if the action is conceived merely as duty in relation to the solemn law of morality the action by which a man endeavours at the greatest peril of life to rescue people from shipwreck at last losing his life in the attempt is reckoned on one side as duty but on the other and for the most part as a meritorious action but our esteem for it is much weakened by the notion of duty to himself which seems in this case to be somewhat infringed more decisive is the magnanimous sacrifice of life for the safety of ones country and yet there still remains some scruple whether it is a perfect duty to devote ones self to this purpose spontaneously and unbidden and the action has not in itself the full force of a pattern and impulse to imitation but if an indispensable duty be in question the transgression of which violates the moral law itself and without regard to the welfare of mankind and as it were tramples on its holiness such as are usually called duties to god because in him we conceive the ideal of holiness in substance then we give our most perfect esteem to the pursuit of it at the sacrifice of all that can have any value for the dearest inclinations and we find our soul strengthened and elevated by such an example when we convince     ourselves by contemplation of it that human nature is capable of so great an elevation above every motive that nature can oppose to it juvenal describes such an example in a climax which makes the reader feel vividly the force of the spring that is contained in the pure law of duty as duty    0  esto bonus miles tutor bonus arbiter idem   integer ambiguae si quando citabere testis   incertaeque rei phalaris licet imperet ut sis   falsus et admoto dictet periuria tauro   summum crede nefas animam præferre pudori   et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas when we can bring any flattering thought of merit into our action then the motive is already somewhat alloyed with selflove and has therefore some assistance from the side of the sensibility but to postpone everything to the holiness of duty alone and to be conscious that we can because our own reason recognises this as its command and says that we ought to do it this is as it were to raise ourselves altogether above the world of sense and there is inseparably involved in the same a consciousness of the law as a spring of a faculty that controls the sensibility and although this is not always attended with effect yet frequent engagement with this spring and the at first minor attempts at using it give hope that this effect may be wrought and that by degrees the greatest and that a purely moral interest in it may be produced in us the method then takes the following course at first we are only concerned to make the judging of actions by moral laws a natural employment accompanying all our own free actions as well as the observation of those of others and to make it as it were a habit and to sharpen this judgment asking first whether the action conforms objectively to the moral law and to what law and we distinguish the law that merely furnishes a principle of obligation from that which is really obligatory leges obligandi a legibus obligantibus as for instance the law of what mens wants require from me as contrasted with that which their rights demand the latter of which prescribes       0 essential the former only nonessential duties and thus we teach how to distinguish different kinds of duties which meet in the same action the other point to which attention must be directed is the question whether the action was also subjectively done for the sake of the moral law so that it not only is morally correct as a deed but also by the maxim from which it is done has moral worth as a disposition now there is no doubt that this practice and the resulting culture of our reason in judging merely of the practical must gradually produce a certain interest even in the law of reason and consequently in morally good actions for we ultimately take a liking for a thing the contemplation of which makes us feel that the use of our cognitive faculties is extended and this extension is especially furthered by that in which we find moral correctness since it is only in such an order of things that reason with its faculty of determining à priori on principle what ought to be done can find satisfaction an observer of nature takes liking at last to objects that at first offended his senses when he discovers in them the great adaptation of their organization to design so that his reason finds food in its contemplation so leibnitz spared an insect that he had carefully examined with the microscope and replaced it on its leaf because he had found himself instructed by the view of it and had as it were received a benefit from it but this employment of the faculty of judgment which makes us feel our own cognitive powers is not yet the interest in actions and in their morality itself it merely causes us to take pleasure in engaging in such criticism and it gives to virtue or the disposition that conforms to moral laws a form of beauty which is admired but not on that account sought after laudatur et alget as everything the contemplation of which produces a consciousness of the harmony     of our powers of conception and in which we feel the whole of our faculty of knowledge understanding and imagination strengthened produces a satisfaction which may also be communicated to others while nevertheless the existence of the object remains indifferent to us being only regarded as the occasion of our becoming aware     of the capacities in us which are elevated above mere animal nature now however the second exercise comes in the living exhibition of morality of character by examples in which attention is directed to purity of will first only as a negative perfection in so far as in an action done from duty no motives of inclination have any influence in determining it by this the pupils attention is fixed upon the consciousness of his freedom and although this renunciation at first excites a feeling of pain nevertheless by its withdrawing the pupil from the constraint of even real wants there is proclaimed to him at the same time a deliverance from the manifold dissatisfaction in which all these wants entangle him and the mind is made capable of receiving the sensation of satisfaction from other sources the heart is freed and lightened of a burden that always secretly presses on it when instances of pure moral resolutions reveal to the man an inner faculty of which otherwise he has no right knowledge the inward freedom to release himself from the boisterous importunity of inclinations to such a degree that none of them not even the dearest shall have any influence on a resolution for which we are now to employ our reason suppose a case where i alone know that the wrong is on my side and although a free confession of it and the offer of satisfaction are so strongly opposed by vanity selfishness and even an otherwise not illegitimate antipathy to the man whose rights are impaired by me i am nevertheless able to discard all these considerations     in this there is implied a consciousness of independence on inclinations and circumstances and of the possibility of being sufficient for myself which is salutary to me in general for other purposes also and now the law of duty in consequence of the positive worth which obedience to it makes us feel finds easier access through the respect for ourselves in the consciousness of our freedom when this is well established when a man dreads nothing more than to find himself on selfexamination worthless and contemptible in his own eyes then every good moral disposition can be grafted on it because this is the best nay the only guard that can keep off from the mind the pressure of ignoble and corrupting motives   0 i have only intended to point out the most general maxims of the methodology of moral cultivation and exercise as the manifold variety of duties requires special rules for each kind and this would be a prolix affair i shall be readily excused if in a work like this which is only preliminary i content myself with these outlines conclusion two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe the oftener and the more steadily we reflect on them the starry heavens above and the moral law within i have not to search for them and conjecture them as though they were veiled in darkness or were in the transcendent region beyond my horizon i see them before me and connect them directly with the consciousness of my existence the former begins from the place i occupy in the external world of sense and enlarges     my connexion therein to an unbounded extent with worlds upon worlds and systems of systems and moreover into limitless times of their periodic motion its beginning and continuance the second begins from my invisible self my personality and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which is traceable only by the understanding and with which i discern that i am not in a merely contingent but in a universal and necessary connexion as i am also thereby with all those visible worlds the former view of a countless multitude of worlds annihilates as it were my importance as an animal creature which after it has been for a short time provided with vital power one knows not how must again give back the matter of which it was formed to the planet it inhabits a mere speck in the universe the second on the contrary infinitely elevates my worth as an intelligence by my personality in which the moral law reveals to me a life independent on animality and even on the whole sensible world—at least so far as may be inferred from the destination assigned to my existence by this law a destination not restricted to conditions and limits of this life but reaching into the infinite     but though admiration and respect may excite to inquiry they cannot supply the want of it what then is to be done in order to enter on this in a useful manner and one adapted to the loftiness of the subject examples may serve in this as a warning and also for imitation the contemplation of the world began from the noblest spectacle that the human senses present to us and that our understanding can bear to follow in their vast reach and it ended—in astrology morality began with the noblest attribute of human nature the development and cultivation of which give a prospect of infinite utility and ended—in fanaticism or superstition     so it is with all crude attempts where the principal part of the business depends on the use of reason a use which does not come of itself like the use of the feet by frequent exercise especially when attributes are in question which cannot be directly exhibited in common experience but after the maxim had come into vogue though late to examine carefully beforehand all the steps that reason purposes to take and not to let it proceed otherwise than in the track of a previously wellconsidered method then the study of the structure of the universe took quite a different direction and thereby attained an incomparably happier result the fall of a stone the motion of a sling resolved into their elements and the forces that are manifested in them and treated mathematically produced at last that clear and henceforward unchangeable insight into the system of the world which as observation is continued may hope always to extend itself but need never fear to be compelled to retreat this example may suggest to us to enter on the same path in treating of the moral capacities of our nature and may give us hope of a like good result we have at hand the instances of the moral judgment of reason by analysing these into their elementary conceptions and in default of mathematics adopting a process similar to that of chemistry the separation of the empirical from the rational elements that may be found in them by repeated experiments on common sense we may exhibit both pure and learn with certainty what each part can accomplish of itself so as to prevent on the one hand the errors of a     still crude untrained judgment and on the other hand what is far more necessary the extravagances of genius by which as by the adepts of the philosophers stone without any methodical study or knowledge of nature visionary treasures are promised     and the true are thrown away in one word science critically undertaken and methodically directed is the narrow gate that leads to the true doctrine of practical wisdom   if we understand by this not merely what one ought to do but what ought to serve teachers as a guide to construct well and clearly the road to wisdom which everyone should travel and to secure others from going astray philosophy must always continue to be the guardian of this science and although the public does not take any interest in its subtle investigations it must take an interest in the resulting doctrines which such an examination first puts in a clear light     introduction to the metaphysic of morals and preface to the metaphysical elements of ethics         introduction to the metaphysic of morals i of the relation of the faculties of the human mind to the moral laws the appetitive faculty is the faculty of being by means of ones ideas the cause of the objects of these ideas   the faculty which a being has of acting according to its ideas is life firstly—desire or aversion has always connected with it pleasure or displeasure the susceptibility to which is called     feeling but the converse does not always hold for a pleasure may exist which is not connected with any desire of the object but with the mere idea which one frames to ones self of an object no matter whether its object exists or not secondly—the pleasure or displeasure in the object of the desire does not always precede the desire and cannot always be regarded as its cause but must sometimes be looked on as the effect thereof now the capability of having pleasure or displeasure in an idea is called feeling because both contain what is merely subjective in relation to our idea  0 and have no relation to an object so as to contribute to the possible cognition of it   not even the cognition of our own state whereas in other cases sensations apart from the quality which belongs to them in consequence of the nature of the subject ex gr red sweet etc may yet have relation to an object and constitute part of our knowledge but pleasure or displeasure in the red or sweet expresses absolutely nothing in the object but simply a relation to the subject pleasure and displeasure cannot be more closely defined for the reason just given we can only specify what consequences they have in certain circumstances so as to make them cognizable in practice the pleasure which is necessarily connected with the desire of the object whose idea affects feeling may be called practical pleasure whether it is cause or effect of the desire on the contrary the pleasure which is not necessarily     connected with the desire of the object and which therefore is at bottom not a pleasure in the existence of the object of the idea but clings to the idea only may be called mere contemplative pleasure or passive satisfaction    the feeling of the latter kind of pleasure we call taste accordingly in a practical philosophy we can treat this only episodically not as a notion properly belonging to that philosophy but as regards the practical pleasure the determination of the appetitive faculty which is caused and therefore necessarily preceded by this pleasure is called appetite in the strict sense and habitual appetite is called inclination the connexion of pleasure with the appetitive faculty in so far as this connexion is judged by the understanding to hold good by a general rule though only for the subject is called interest and hence in this case the practical pleasure is an interest of inclination on the other hand if the pleasure can only follow an antecedent determination of the appetitive faculty it is an intellectual pleasure and the interest in the object must be called an interest of reason for if the interest were one of sense and not merely founded on pure principles of reason sensation must be joined with pleasure and thus be able to determine the appetitive faculty although where a merely pure interest of reason must be assumed no interest of inclination can be substituted for it yet in order to accommodate ourselves to common speech we may admit an inclination even to that which can only be the object of an intellectual pleasure—that is to say a habitual desire from a pure interest of reason this however would not be the cause but the effect of the latter interest and we might call it the sensefree inclination propensio intellectualis further concupiscence is to be distinguished from the desire itself as being the stimulus to its determination it is always a sensible state of mind but one which has not yet arrived at an act of the appetitive faculty the appetitive faculty which depends on concepts in so far as the ground of its determination to action is found in itself    not in the object is called a faculty of doing or forbearing as we please in so far as it is combined with the consciousness of     the power of its action to produce its object it is called elective will willkühr  arbitrium if not so combined its act is called a wish   the appetitive faculty whose inner determining principle and consequently even its good pleasure belieben is found in the reason of the subject is called the rational will wille accordingly the rational will is the appetitive faculty not like the elective will in relation to the action but rather in relation to what determines the elective will willkühr to the action and it has properly itself no determining ground but in so far as it can determine the elective will it is practical reason itself under the will may be included the elective will willkühr and even mere wish inasmuch as reason can determine the appetitive faculty and the elective will which can be determined by pure reason is called free elective will that which is determinable only by inclination would be animal elective will arbitrium brutum human elective will on the contrary is one which is affected but not determined by impulses it is accordingly in itself apart from acquired practice of reason not pure but it can be determined to actions by the pure will freedom of the elective will is just that independence of its determination on sensible impulses this is the negative concept of it the positive is the power of pure reason to be     of itself practical now this is possible only by the subordination of the maxim of every action to the condition of fitness for universal law for being pure reason it is directed to the elective will irrespective of the object of this will now it is the faculty of principles in this case practical principles so that it is a legislative faculty    and since it is not provided with the matter of the law there is nothing which it can make the supreme law and determining ground of the elective will except the form consisting in the fitness of the maxim of the elective will to be a universal law and since from subjective causes the maxims of men do not of themselves coincide with those objective maxims it can only prescribe this law as an imperative of command or prohibition these laws of freedom are called in contradistinction to physical laws moral laws in so far as they are directed to mere external actions and their lawfulness they are called judicial but when they demand that these laws themselves shall be the determining ground of the actions they are ethical and in this case we say—the agreement with the former constitutes the legality agreement with the latter the morality of the action the freedom to which the former laws relate can only be freedom in its external exercise but the freedom to which the latter refer is freedom both in the internal and external exercise of the elective will in as far namely as this elective will is determined by laws of reason similarly in theoretic philosophy we say that only the objects of the outer senses are in space while the objects both of the external and of the internal sense are in time because the ideas of both are still ideas and for this reason all belong to the inner sense just so whether we regard freedom in the external or the internal exercise of the elective will in either case its laws being pure practical laws of reason governing free elective will generally must be also its internal grounds of determination although they need not always be considered in this point of view   0 ii of the conception and the necessity of a metaphysic of ethics    it has been shown elsewhere that for physical science which has to do with the objects of the external senses we must have à priori principles and that it is possible—nay even necessary—to prefix a system of these principles under the name of metaphysical principles of natural philosophy to physics which is natural philosophy applied to special phenomena of experience the latter however at least when the question is to guard its propositions from error may assume many principles as universal on the testimony of experience although the former if it is to be in the strict sense universal must be deduced from à priori grounds just as newton adopted the principle of the equality of action and reaction as based on experience and yet extended it to all material nature the chemists go still further and base their most universal laws of combination and dissociation of substances by their own forces entirely on experience and yet they have such confidence in their universality and necessity that in the experiments they make with them they have no apprehension of error it is otherwise with the moral laws these are valid as laws only so far as they have an à priori basis and can be seen to be necessary nay the concepts and judgments about ourselves and our actions and omissions have no moral significance at all if they contain only what can be learned from experience and should one be so misled as to make into a moral principle anything derived from this source he would be in danger of the grossest and most pernicious errors if the science of morals were nothing but the science of happiness it would be unsuitable to look out for à priori principles on which to rest it for however plausible it may sound to say that reason could discern even before experience by what means one might attain a lasting enjoyment of the true pleasures of life yet everything which is taught on this subject     à priori is either tautological or assumed without any foundation it is experience alone that can teach us what gives us pleasure    the natural impulses to nutrition to the propagation of the species the desire of rest of motion and in the development of our natural capacities the desire of honour of knowledge c can alone teach and moreover teach each individual in his own special way in what to place those pleasures and it is these also that can teach him the means by which he must seek them all plausible à priori reasoning is here at bottom nothing but experience raised to generality by induction a generality too so meagre that everyone must be allowed many exceptions in order to make the choice of his mode of life suitable to his special inclination and his susceptibility for pleasure so that after all he must become wise only by his own or others loss it is not so with the doctrines of morality they are imperative for everyone without regard to his inclinations solely because and so far as he is free and has practical reason instruction in its laws is not drawn from observation of himself and his animal part not from perception of the course of the world from that which happens and from the way in which men act although the german word sitten like the latin mores signifies only manners and mode of life but reason commands how men should act even although no instance of such action could be found moreover it pays no regard to the advantage which we may hereby attain which certainly can only be learned by experience for although it allows us to seek our advantage in every way that we can and in addition pointing to the testimony of experience can promise us probably and on the whole greater advantages from following its commands than from transgression of them especially if obedience is accompanied by prudence yet the authority of its precepts as commands does not rest on this    reason uses such facts only by way of counsel as a counterpoise to the temptations to the opposite in order first of all to compensate the error of an unfair balance so that it may then assure a due preponderance to the à priori grounds of a pure practical reason     if therefore we give the name metaphysic to a system of à priori knowledge derived from mere concepts then a practical philosophy which has for its object not nature but freedom of choice will presuppose and require a metaphysic of morals that is to have it is itself a duty and moreover every man has it in himself though commonly only in an obscure way for without à priori principles how could he believe that he has in him a universal lawgiving moreover just as in the metaphysic of natural philosophy there must be principles touching the application to objects of experience of those supreme universal laws of a physical system generally so also a metaphysic of morals cannot dispense with similar principles and we shall often have to take the special nature of man which can only be known by experience as our object in order to exhibit in it the consequences of the universal moral principles but this will not detract from the purity of the latter nor cast any doubt on their à priori origin—that is to say a metaphysic of morals cannot be founded on anthropology but may be applied to it the counterpart of a metaphysic of morals namely the second subdivision of practical philosophy generally would be moral anthropology which would contain the subjective conditions favourable and unfavourable to carrying out the laws of the power in human nature it would treat of the production the propagation and strengthening of moral principles in education school and popular instruction    and other like doctrines and precepts based on experience which cannot be dispensed with but which must not come before the metaphysic nor be mixed with it for to do so would be to run the risk of eliciting false or at least indulgent moral laws which would represent that as unattainable which has only not been attained because the law has not been discerned and proclaimed in its purity the very thing in which its strength consists or else because men make use of spurious or mixed motives to what is itself good and dutiful and these allow no certain moral principles to remain but this anthropology is not to be used as a standard of judgment nor as a discipline of the mind in its     obedience to duty for the precept of duty must be given solely by pure reason à priori now with respect to the division to which that just mentioned is subordinate namely the division of philosophy into theoretical and practical i have explained myself sufficiently elsewhere in the critical examination of the faculty of judgment   and have shown that the latter branch can be nothing else than moral philosophy everything practical which concerns what is possible according to physical laws the proper business of art depends for its precept on the theory of physical nature that only which is practical in accordance with laws of freedom can have principles that do not depend on any theory for there can be no theory of that which transcends the properties of physical nature hence by the practical part of     philosophy coordinate with its theoretical part we are to understand not any technical doctrine but a morally practical doctrine and if the habit of choice according to laws of freedom in contrast to physical laws is here also to be called art we must understand thereby such an art as would make a system of freedom like a system of nature possible truly a divine art were we in a condition to fulfil by means of reason the precepts of reason and to carry its ideal into actuality iii of the subdivision of a metaphysic of morals      all legislation whether it prescribes internal or external actions and these either à priori by pure reason or by the will of another involves two things first a law which objectively presents the action that is to be done as necessary i e makes it a duty secondly a spring which subjectively connects with the idea of the law the motive determining the elective will to this action hence the second element is this that the law makes duty the spring by the former the action is presented as duty and this is a mere theoretical knowledge of the possible determination of the elective will i e of practical rules by the latter the obligation so to act is connected with a motive which determines the elective will generally in the agent accordingly all legislation may be divided into two classes in respect of the springs employed and this whether the     actions prescribed are the same or not as for instance the actions might be in all cases external    that legislation which at once makes an action a duty and makes this duty the spring is ethical that which does not include the latter in the law and therefore admits a spring different from the idea of duty itself is juridical as regards the latter it is easily seen that this spring which is distinct from the idea of duty must be derived from the pathological motives of choice namely the inclinations and aversions and amongst these from the latter since it is a legislation which must be constraining not an invitation which is persuasive the mere agreement or disagreement of an action with the law without regard to the motive from which the action springs is called legality but when the idea of duty arising from the law is also the motive of the action the agreement is called the morality of the action duties arising from forensic legislation can only be external duties because this legislation does not require that the idea of this duty which is internal shall be of itself the motive of the elective will of the agent and as it nevertheless requires a suitable spring it can only connect external springs with the law on the other hand ethical legislation while it makes internal actions duties does not exclude external actions but applies generally to everything that is duty but just because ethical legislation includes in its law the inner spring of the action the idea of duty a property which cannot belong to the external legislation hence ethical legislation cannot be external not even that of a divine will although it may adopt duties which rest on external legislation and take them regarded as duties into its own legislation as springs of action  0 from hence we may see that all duties belong to ethics simply because they are duties but it does not follow that their legislation is always included in ethics in the case of many duties it is quite outside ethics thus ethics requires that i should fulfil my pledged word even though the other party could not compel me to do so but the law pacta sunt servanda and the corresponding duty are taken by ethics from     jurisprudence accordingly it is not in ethics but in jus that the legislation is contained which enjoins that promises be kept ethics teaches only that even if the spring were absent which is connected by forensic legislation with that duty namely external compulsion yet the idea of duty would alone be sufficient as a spring for if this were not so and if the legislation itself were not forensic and the duty arising from it not properly a legal duty in contrast to a moral duty then faithfulness to ones engagements would be put in the same class as actions of benevolence and the obligation to them which cannot be admitted it is not an ethical duty to keep ones promise but a legal duty one that we can be compelled to perform nevertheless it is a virtuous action a proof of virtue to do so even where no compulsion is to be apprehended law and morals therefore are distinguished not so much by the diversity of their duties but rather by the diversity of the legislation which connects this or that motive with the law ethical legislation is that which cannot be external although the duties may be external forensic legislation is that which can be external thus to keep ones contract is an external duty but the command    to do this merely because it is a duty without regard to any other motive belongs only to the internal legislation accordingly the obligation is reckoned as belonging to ethics not as being a special kind of duty a special kind of actions to which one is bound—for in ethics as well as in law we have external duties—but because in the supposed case the legislation is an internal one and can have no external lawgiver for the same reason duties of benevolence although they are external duties obligations to external actions are yet reckoned as belonging to ethics because the legislation imposing them can only be internal no doubt ethics has also duties peculiar to itself ex gr duties to ourselves but it also has duties in common with law only the kind of obligation is different for it is the peculiarity of ethical legislation to perform actions solely because they are duties and to make the principle of duty itself the adequate spring of the will no matter whence the duty may be derived     hence while there are many directly ethical duties the internal legislation makes all others indirectly ethical iv preliminary notions belonging to the metaphysic of morals philosophia practica universalis the concept of freedom is a pure concept of the reason and on this account it is as regards theoretical philosophy transcendent that is a concept for which there is no corresponding example in any possible experience which therefore forms no object of any theoretic knowledge possible to us and is valid not as a constitutive but simply as a regulative principle of pure speculative reason and that a negative one but in the practical exercise of reason it proves its reality by practical principles    which being laws of a causality of pure reason determine the elective will independently on all empirical conditions sensible conditions generally and prove the existence of a pure will in us in which the moral concepts and laws have their origin on this concept of freedom which in a practical aspect is positive are founded unconditional practical laws which are called moral and these in respect of us whose elective will is sensibly affected and therefore does not of itself correspond with the pure will but often opposes it are imperatives commands or prohibitions and moreover are categorical unconditional imperatives by which they are distinguished from technical imperatives precepts of art which always give only conditional commands by these imperatives certain actions are permitted or not permitted that is are morally possible or impossible some however or their opposites are morally necessary that is obligatory hence arises the notion of a duty the obeying or transgressing of which is indeed connected with a pleasure or displeasure of a peculiar kind that     of a moral feeling of which however we can take no account in the practical laws of reason since they do not concern the foundation of the practical laws but only the subjective effect in the mind when our elective will is determined by these and they may be very different in different persons without adding to or taking from the validity or influence of these laws objectively that is in the judgment of the reason the following notions are common to both parts of the metaphysic of morals— obligation is the necessity of a free action under a categorical imperative of reason the imperative is a practical rule by which an action in itself contingent is made necessary it is distinguished from a practical law by this    that while the latter exhibits the necessity of the action it takes no account of the consideration whether this already inheres by an internal necessity in the agent say a holy being or whether as in man it is contingent for where the former is the case there is no imperative accordingly the imperative is a rule the conception of which makes necessary an action that is subjectively contingent and hence represents the subject as one who must be constrained necessitated to agreement with this rule the categorical unconditional imperative is one that does not command indirectly through the idea of an end that can be attained by the action but immediately through the mere conception of this action itself its form thinks it as objectively necessary and makes it necessary no example of an imperative of this kind can be supplied by any other practical doctrine but that which prescribes obligation the doctrine of morals all other imperatives are technical and conditioned the ground of the possibility of categorical imperatives lies in this that they refer to no other property of the elective will by which any purpose could be ascribed to it but only to its freedom an action is allowed licitum which is not contrary to obligation and this freedom which is not limited by any opposed imperative is called right of action facultas moralis befugniss hence it is obvious what is meant by disallowed illicitum     duty is the action to which a person is bound it is therefore the matter of obligation and it may be one and the same duty as to the action although the obligation to it may be of different kinds the categorical imperative since it expresses an obligation in respect of certain actions is a moral practical law but since obligation contains not only practical necessity    which law in general expresses but also constraint the imperative mentioned is either a law of command or of prohibition according as the performance or omission is represented as duty an action which is neither commanded nor forbidden is merely allowed because in respect of it there is no law limiting freedom right of action and therefore also no duty such an action is called morally indifferent indifferens adiaphoron res meræ facultatis it may be asked are there any such and if there are then in order that one may be free to do or forbear a thing as he pleases must there be besides the law of command lex præceptiva lex mandati and the law of prohibition lex prohibitiva lex vetiti also a law of permission lex permissiva if this is the case then the right of action would not be concerned with an indifferent action adiaphoron for if such an action is considered according to moral laws it could not require any special law an action is called a deed in so far as it comes under laws of obligation and consequently in so far as the subject is regarded in it according to the freedom of his elective will the agent is regarded as by such an act the author of the effect and this along with the action itself may be imputed to him if he is previously acquainted with the law by virtue of which an obligation rests on him a person is the subject whose actions are capable of imputation hence moral personality is nothing but the freedom of a rational being under moral laws whereas psychological personality is merely the power of being conscious to oneself of the identity of ones existence in different circumstances hence it follows that a person is subject to no other laws than those which he either alone or jointly with others gives to himself   0    that which is not capable of any imputation is called a thing every object of free elective will which is not itself possessed of freedom is therefore called a thing res corporalis a deed is right or wrong in general rectum aut minus rectum according as it is consistent or inconsistent with duty factum licitum aut illicitum no matter what the content or the origin of the duty may be a deed inconsistent with duty is called transgression reatus an unintentional transgression which however may be imputed is called mere fault culpa an intentional transgression that is one which is accompanied by the consciousness that it is transgression is called crime dolus that which is right according to external laws is called just justum what is not so is unjust injustum a conflict of duties collisio officiorum seu obligationum would be such a relation between them that one would wholly or partially abolish the other now as duty and obligation are notions which express the objective practical necessity of certain actions and as two opposite rules cannot be necessary at the same time but if it is a duty to act according to one of them it is then not only not a duty but inconsistent with duty to act according to the other it follows that a conflict of duties and obligations is inconceivable obligationes non colliduntur it may however very well happen that in the same subject and the rule which he prescribes to himself there are conjoined two grounds of obligation rationes obligandi of which however one or the other is inadequate to oblige rationes obligandi non obligantes and then one of them is not a duty when two such grounds are in conflict practical philosophy does not say that the stronger obligation prevails fortior obligatio vincit but the stronger ground of obligation prevails fortior obligandi ratio vincit    binding laws for which an external lawgiving is possible are called in general external laws leges externæ amongst these the laws the obligation to which can be recognized by reason à priori even without external legislation are natural though external laws those on the contrary which     without actual external legislation would not bind at all and therefore would not be laws are called positive laws it is possible therefore to conceive an external legislation which would only contain positive   laws but then a natural law must precede which should supply the ground of the authority of the lawgiver that is his right to bind others by his mere will the principle which makes certain actions a duty is a practical law the rule which the agent adopts from subjective grounds as his principle is called his maxim hence with the same laws the maxims of the agents may be very different the categorical imperative which only expresses in general what obligation is is this act according to a maxim which can at the same time hold good as a universal law you must therefore examine your actions in the first place as to their subjective principle but whether this principle is also objectively valid can only be recognized by this that when your reason puts it to the test of conceiving yourself as giving therein a universal law it is found to be adapted to this universal legislation the simplicity of this law compared with the great and manifold requirements which can be drawn from it must at first appear surprising as must also the authoritative dignity it presents without carrying with it perceptibly any motive    but when in this astonishment at the power of our reason to determine choice by the mere idea of the fitness of a maxim for the universality of a practical law we learn that it is just these practical moral laws that first make known a property of the will which speculative reason could never have arrived at either from à priori grounds or from experience—and if it did arrive at it could by no means prove its possibility whereas those practical laws incontestably prove this property namely freedom—then we shall be less surprised to find these laws like mathematical axioms undemonstrable and yet apodictic and at the same time to see a whole field of practical cognitions     opened before us in which reason in its theoretic exercise with the same idea of freedom nay with any other of its supersensible ideas must find everything absolutely closed to it the agreement of an action with the law of duty is its legality legalitas that of the maxim with the law is its morality moralitas maxim is the subjective principle of action which the subject makes a rule to itself namely how he chooses to act on the contrary the principle of duty is that which reason commands him absolutely and therefore objectively how he ought to act the supreme principle of the order is therefore act on a maxim which can also hold good as a universal law every maxim which is not capable of being so is contrary to morality laws proceed from the rational will maxims from the elective will the latter is in man a free elective will the rational will which is directed to nothing but the law only cannot be called either free or unfree because it is not directed to actions but immediately to the legislation for the maxims of actions and is therefore practical reason itself consequently it is absolutely necessary and is even incapable of constraint    it is therefore only the elective will that can be called free freedom of elective will however cannot be defined as the power of choosing to act for or against the law libertas indifferentiæ as some have attempted to define it although the elective will as a phenomenon gives many examples of this in experience for freedom as it becomes known to us first through the moral law is known to us only as a negative property in us namely the property of not being constrained to action by any sensible motives considered as a noumenon however that is as to the faculty of man merely as an intelligence we are quite unable to explain theoretically how it has a constraining power in respect of the sensible elective will—that is we cannot explain it in its positive character only this we can very readily understand that although experience tells us that man as an object in the sensible world shows a power of choosing not only according to the law but also in opposition to it nevertheless his freedom as a being in the intelligible world cannot be thus defined since phenomena     can never enable us to comprehend any supersensible object such as free elective will is we can see also that freedom can never be placed in this that the rational subject is able to choose in opposition to his legislative reason even though experience proves often enough that this does happen a thing however the possibility of which we cannot comprehend for it is one thing to admit a fact of experience it is another to make it the principle of a definition in the present case of the concept of free elective will and the universal criterion between this and arbitrium brutum seu servum since in the former case we do not assert that the mark necessarily belongs to the concept which we must do in the latter case freedom in relation to the inner legislation of the reason is alone properly a power the possibility of deviating from this is an impotence how then can the former be defined from the latter    a definition which over and above the practical concept adds the exercise of it as learned from experience is a bastard definition definitio hybrida which puts the notion in a false light a law a moral practical law is a proposition which contains a categorical imperative a command he who gives commands by a law imperans is the lawgiver legislator he is the author auctor of the obligation imposed by the law but not always author of the law if he were so the law would be positive contingent and arbitrary the law which binds us à priori and unconditionally by our own reason may also be expressed as proceeding from the will of a supreme lawgiver that is of one who has only rights and no duties namely from the divine will but this only involves the idea of a moral being whose will is law for all without his being conceived as the author of it imputation imputatio in the moral sense is the judgment by which any one is regarded as the author causa libera of an action which is then called a deed factum and to which laws are applicable and if this judgment brings with it the legal consequences of this deed it is a judicial imputation imputatio judiciaria s valida otherwise it is only discriminating imputation     imputatio dijudicatoria the person whether physical or moral who has right to exercise judicial imputation is called the judge or the court judex s forum what anyone does in accordance with duty beyond what he can be compelled to by the law is meritorious meritum what he does only just in accordance with the law is duty owed debitum lastly what he does less than the law demands is moral demerit demeritum the legal effect of demerit is punishment pæna that of a meritorious act reward præmium  0 provided that this promised in the law was the motive conduct which agrees with duty owed has no legal effect fair recompense remuneratio s repensio benefica stands in no legal relation to the deed the good or bad consequences of an obligatory action or the consequences of omitting a meritorious action cannot be imputed to the agent modus imputationis tollens the good consequences of a meritorious action and the bad consequences of an unlawful action can be imputed modus imputationis ponens subjectively considered the degree of imputability imputabilitas of actions must be estimated by the greatness of the hindrances which have to be overcome the greater the natural hindrances of sensibility and the less the moral hindrance of duty the higher the imputation of merit in a good deed for example if at a considerable sacrifice i rescue from great necessity one who is a complete stranger to myself on the other hand the less the natural hindrance and the greater the hindrance from reasons of duty so much the more is transgression imputed as ill desert hence the state of mind of the agent whether he acted in the excitement of passion or with cool deliberation makes an important difference in imputation     preface to the metaphysical elements of ethics     if there exists on any subject a philosophy that is a system of rational knowledge based on concepts then there must also be for this philosophy a system of pure rational concepts independent on any condition of intuition—in other words a metaphysic it may be asked whether metaphysical elements are required also for every practical philosophy which is the doctrine of duties deontology and therefore also for ethics in order to be able to present it as a true science systematically not merely as an aggregate of separate doctrines fragmentarily as regards pure jurisprudence no one will question this requirement for it concerns only what is formal in the elective will which has to be limited in its external relations according to laws of freedom without regarding any end which is the matter of this will here therefore deontology is a mere scientific doctrine doctrina scientiæ           now in this philosophy of ethics it seems contrary to the idea of it that we should go back to metaphysical elements in order to make the notion of duty purified from everything empirical from every feeling a motive of action for what sort of notion can we form of the mighty power and herculean strength which would be sufficient to overcome the vicebreeding inclinations if virtue is to borrow her arms from the armoury of metaphysics which is a matter of speculation that only few men can handle hence all ethical teaching in lecturerooms pulpits and popular books when it is decked out with fragments of metaphysics becomes ridiculous but it is not therefore useless much less ridiculous to trace in metaphysics the first principles of ethics for it is only as a philosopher than any one can reach the first principles of this conception of duty otherwise we could not look for either certainty or purity in the ethical teaching to rely for this reason on a certain feeling or sense which on account of the effect expected from it is called moral may perhaps even satisfy the popular teacher provided he desires as the criterion of a moral duty to consider the problem if everyone in every case made your maxim the universal law how could this law be consistent with itself     but if it were merely feeling that made it our duty to take this principle as a criterion then this would not be dictated by reason but only adopted instinctively and therefore blindly but in fact whatever men imagine no moral principle is based on any feeling but such a principle is really nothing else than an obscurely conceived metaphysic which inheres in every mans reasoning faculty as the teacher will easily find who tries to catechize his pupil in the socratic method about the     imperative of duty and its application to the moral judgment of his actions the mode of stating it need not be always metaphysical and the language need not necessarily be scholastic unless the pupil is to be trained to be a philosopher but the thought must go back to the elements of metaphysics without which we cannot expect any certainty or purity or even motive power in ethics if we deviate from this principle and begin from pathological or purely sensitive or even moral feeling from what is subjectively practical instead of what is objective that is from the matter of the will the end not from its form that is the law in order from thence to determine duties then certainly there are no metaphysical elements of ethics for feeling by whatever it may be excited is always physical but then ethical teaching whether in schools or lecturerooms c is corrupted in its source for it is not a matter of indifference by what motives or means one is led to a good purpose the obedience to duty however disgusting then metaphysics may appear to those pretended philosophers who dogmatize oracularly or even brilliantly about the doctrine of duty it is nevertheless an indispensable duty for those who oppose it to go back to its principles even in ethics and to begin by going to school on its benches   0 we may fairly wonder how after all previous explanations of the principles of duty so far as it is derived from pure reason it was still possible to reduce it again to a doctrine of happiness—in such a way however that a certain moral happiness not resting on empirical causes was ultimately arrived at a selfcontradictory nonentity in fact when the thinking man has conquered the temptations to vice and is conscious of having done his often hard duty he finds himself in a state of peace and satisfaction which may well be called happiness in which virtue is her own reward now says the eudaemonist this delight this happiness is the real motive of his acting virtuously the notion of duty says he does not immediately determine his will it is only by means of the happiness in prospect     that he is moved to do his duty now on the other hand since he can promise himself this reward of virtue only from the consciousness of having done his duty it is clear that the latter must have preceded that is he must feel himself bound to do his duty before he thinks and without thinking that happiness will be the consequence of obedience to duty he is thus involved in a circle in his assignment of cause and effect he can only hope to be happy if he is conscious of his obedience to duty   and he can only be moved to obedience to duty if he foresees that he will thereby become happy but in this reasoning there is also a contradiction for on the one side he must obey his duty without asking what effect this will have on his happiness consequently from a moral principle     on the other side he can only recognize something as his duty when he can reckon on happiness which will accrue to him thereby and consequently on a pathological principle which is the direct opposite of the former i have in another place the berlin monatsschrift        reduced as i believe to the simplest expressions the distinction between pathological and moral pleasure the pleasure namely which must precede the obedience to the law in order that one may act according to the law is pathological and the process follows the physical order of nature that which must be preceded by the law in order that it may be felt is in the moral order if this distinction is not observed if eudaemonism the principle of happiness is adopted as the principle instead of eleutheronomy the principle of freedom of the inner legislation the consequence is the euthanasia quiet death of all morality the cause of these mistakes is no other than the following those who are accustomed only to physiological explanations will not admit into their heads the categorical imperative from which these laws dictatorially proceed notwithstanding that they feel themselves irresistibly forced by it dissatisfied at not being able to explain what lies wholly beyond that sphere namely freedom of the elective will elevating as is this privilege that man has of being capable of such an idea they are stirred up by the proud claims of speculative reason which feels its power so strongly in other fields just as if they were allies leagued in defence of the omnipotence of theoretical reason and roused by a general call to arms to resist that idea and thus at present and perhaps for a long time to come though ultimately in vain to attack the moral concept of freedom and if possible render it doubtful introduction to ethics     ethics in ancient times signified moral philosophy philosophia moralis sittenlehre generally which was also called the doctrine of duties deontology subsequently it was found advisable to confine this name to a part of moral philosophy namely to the doctrine of duties which are not subject to external laws for which in german the name tugendlehre was found suitable thus the system of general deontology is divided into that of jurisprudence jurisprudentia which is capable of external laws and of ethics which is not thus capable and we may let this division stand   0 i —exposition of the conception of ethics the notion of duty is in itself already the notion of a constraint of the free elective will by the law whether this constraint be an external one or be selfconstraint the moral imperative by its categorical the unconditional ought announces this constraint which therefore does not apply to all rational beings for there may also be holy beings but applies to men as rational physical beings     who are unholy enough to be seduced by pleasure to the transgression of the moral law although they themselves recognize its authority and when they do obey it to obey it unwillingly with resistance of their inclination and it is in this that the constraint properly consists   now as man is a free moral being the notion of duty can contain only selfconstraint by the idea of the law itself when we look to the internal determination of the will the spring for thus only is it possible to combine that constraint even if it were external with the freedom of the elective will the notion of duty then must be an ethical one the impulses of nature then contain hindrances to the fulfilment of duty in the mind of man and resisting forces some of them powerful and he must judge himself able to combat these and to conquer them by means of reason not in the future but in the present simultaneously with the thought he must judge that he can do what the law unconditionally commands that he ought     now the power and resolved purpose to resist a strong but unjust opponent is called fortitude fortitudo     and when concerned with the opponent of the moral character within us it is virtue virtus fortitudo moralis accordingly general deontology in that part which brings not external but internal freedom under laws is the doctrine of virtue ethics jurisprudence had to do only with the formal condition of external freedom the condition of consistency with itself if its maxim became a universal law that is with law ethics on the contrary supplies us with a matter an object of the free elective will an end of pure reason which is at the same time conceived as an objectively necessary end i e as duty for all men for as the sensible inclinations mislead us to ends which are the matter of the elective will that may contradict duty the legislating reason cannot otherwise guard against their influence than by an opposite moral end which therefore must be given à priori independently on inclination an end is an object of the elective will of a rational being by the idea of which this will is determined to an action for the production of this object now i may be forced by others to actions which are directed to an end as means but i cannot be forced to have an end i can only make something an end to myself if however i am also bound to make something which lies in the notions of practical reason an end to myself and therefore besides the formal determining principle of the elective will as contained in law to have also a material principle an end which can be opposed to the end derived from sensible impulses then this gives the notion of an end which is in itself a duty the doctrine of this cannot belong to jurisprudence but to ethics since this alone includes in its conception selfconstraint according to moral laws     for this reason ethics may also be defined as the system of the ends of the pure practical reason the two parts of moral philosophy are distinguished as treating respectively of ends and of duties of constraint that ethics contains duties to the observance of which one cannot be physically forced by others is merely the consequence of this that it is a doctrine of     ends since to be forced to have ends or to set them before ones self is a contradiction now that ethics is a doctrine of virtue doctrina officiorum virtutis follows from the definition of virtue given above compared with the obligation the peculiarity of which has just been shown there is in fact no other determination of the elective will except that to an end which in the very notion of it implies that i cannot even physically be forced to it by the elective will of others another may indeed force me to do something which is not my end but only means to the end of another but he cannot force me to make it my own end and yet i can have no end except of my own making the latter supposition would be a contradiction—an act of freedom which yet at the same time would not be free but there is no contradiction in setting before ones self an end which is also a duty for in this case i constrain myself and this is quite consistent with freedom   but how is such an end possible that is now the question     for the possibility of the notion of the thing viz that it is not selfcontradictory is not enough to prove the possibility of the thing itself the objective reality of the notion ii —exposition of the notion of an end which is also a duty we can conceive the relation of end to duty in two ways either starting from the end to find the maxim of the dutiful actions or conversely setting out from this to find the end which is also duty jurisprudence proceeds in the former way it is left to every ones free elective will what end he will choose for his action but its maxim is determined à priori namely that the freedom of the agent must be consistent with the freedom of every other according to a universal law     ethics however proceeds in the opposite way it cannot start from the ends which the man may propose to himself and hence give directions as to the maxims he should adopt that is as to his duty for that would be to take empirical principles of maxims and these could not give any notion of duty since this the categorical ought has its root in pure reason alone indeed if the maxims were to be adopted in accordance with those ends which are all selfish we could not properly speak of the notion of duty at all hence in ethics the notion of duty must lead to ends and must on moral principles give the foundation of maxims with respect to the ends which we ought to propose to ourselves setting aside the question what sort of end that is which is in itself a duty and how such an end is possible     it is here only necessary to show that a duty of this kind is called a duty of virtue and why it is so called to every duty corresponds a right of action facultas moralis generatim but all duties do not imply a corresponding right facultas juridica of another to compel any one but only the duties called legal duties similarly to all ethical obligation corresponds the notion of virtue but it does not follow that all ethical duties are duties of virtue those in fact are not so which do not concern so much a certain end matter object of the elective will but merely that which is formal in the moral determination of the will ex gr that the dutiful action must also be done from duty it is only an end which is also duty that can be called a duty of virtue hence there are several of the latter kind and thus there are distinct virtues on the contrary there is only one duty of the former kind but it is one which is valid for all actions only one virtuous disposition the duty of virtue is essentially distinguished from the duty of justice in this respect that it is morally possible to be externally compelled to the latter whereas the former rests on free selfconstraint only for finite holy beings which cannot even be tempted to the violation of duty there is no doctrine of virtue but only moral philosophy the latter being an autonomy of practical reason whereas the former is also an autocracy of it     that is it includes a consciousness—not indeed immediately perceived but rightly concluded from the moral categorical imperative—of the power to become master of ones inclinations which resist the law so that human morality in its highest stage can yet be nothing more than virtue even if it were quite pure perfectly free from the influence of a spring foreign to duty     a state which is poetically personified under the name of the wise man as an ideal to which one should continually approximate virtue however is not to be defined and esteemed merely as habit and as it is expressed in the prize essay of cochius   as a long custom acquired by practice of morally good actions for if this is not an effect of well resolved and firm principles ever more and more purified then like any other mechanical arrangement brought about by technical practical reason it is neither armed for all circumstances nor adequately secured against the change that may be wrought by new allurements remark to virtue   a is opposed as its logical contradictory contradictorie oppositum the negative lack of virtue moral weakness  0 but vice   a is its contrary contrarie s realiter oppositum and it is not merely a needless question but an offensive one to ask whether great crimes do not perhaps demand more strength of mind than great virtues for by strength of mind we understand the strength of purpose of a man as a being endowed with freedom and consequently so far as he is master of himself in his senses and therefore in a healthy condition of mind but great crimes are paroxysms the very sight of which makes the man of healthy mind shudder the question would therefore be something like this whether a man in a fit of madness can have more physical strength than if he is in his senses and we may admit this without on that account ascribing to him more strength of mind if by mind we understand the vital     principle of man in the free use of his powers for since those crimes have their ground merely in the power of the inclinations that weaken reason which does not prove strength of mind this question would be nearly the same as the question whether a man     in a fit of illness can show more strength than in a healthy condition and this may be directly denied since the want of health which consists in the proper balance of all the bodily forces of the man is a weakness in the system of these forces by which system alone we can estimate absolute health iii —of the reason for conceiving an end which is also a duty an end is an object of the free elective will the idea of which determines this will to an action by which the object is produced accordingly every action has its end and as no one can have an end without himself making the object of his elective will his end hence to have some end of actions is an act of the freedom of the agent not an effect of physical nature now since this act which determines an end is a practical principle which commands not the means therefore not conditionally but the end itself therefore unconditionally hence it is a categorical imperative of pure practical reason and one therefore which combines a concept of duty with that of an end in general now there must be such an end and a categorical imperative corresponding to it for since there are free actions there must also be ends to which as an object those actions are directed amongst these ends there must also be some which are at the same time that is by their very notion duties for if there were none such then since no actions can be without an end all ends which practical reason might have would be valid only as means to other ends and a categorical imperative would be impossible a supposition which destroys all moral philosophy   0 here therefore we treat not of ends which man actually makes to himself in accordance with the sensible impulses of his nature but of objects of the free elective will under its own laws objects which he ought to make his end we may call the former technical subjective properly pragmatical including     the rules of prudence in the choice of its ends but the latter we must call the moral objective doctrine of ends this distinction is however superfluous here since moral philosophy already by its very notion is clearly separated from the doctrine of physical nature in the present instance anthropology the latter resting on empirical principles whereas the moral doctrine of ends which treats of duties rests on principles given à priori in pure practical reason iv —what are the ends which are also duties they are—our own perfection the happiness of others we cannot invert these and make on one side our own happiness and on the other the perfection of others ends which should be in themselves duties for the same person for ones own happiness is no doubt an end that all men have by virtue of the impulse of their nature but this end cannot without contradiction be regarded as a duty what a man of himself inevitably wills does not come under the notion of duty for this is a constraint to an end reluctantly adopted it is therefore a contradiction to say that a man is in duty bound to advance his own happiness with all his power it is likewise a contradiction to make the perfection of another my end and to regard myself as in duty bound to promote it     for it is just in this that the perfection of another man as a person consists namely that he is able of himself to set before him his own end according to his own notions of duty and it is a contradiction to require to make it a duty for me that i should do something which no other but himself can do v —explanation of these two notions a —our own perfection the word perfection is liable to many misconceptions it is sometimes understood as a notion belonging to transcendental philosophy viz the notion of the totality of the manifold     which taken together constitutes a thing sometimes again it is understood as belonging to teleology so that it signifies the correspondence of the properties of a thing to an end perfection in the former sense might be called quantitative material in the latter qualitative formal perfection the former can be one only for the whole of what belongs to the one thing is one but of the latter there may be several in one thing and it is of the latter property that we here treat when it is said of the perfection that belongs to man generally properly speaking to humanity that it is in itself a duty to make this our end it must be placed in that which may be the effect of ones deed not in that which is merely an endowment for which we have to thank nature for otherwise it would not be duty consequently it can be nothing else than the cultivation of ones power or natural capacity and also of ones will wille moral disposition to satisfy the requirement of duty in general the supreme element in the former the power is the understanding it being the faculty of concepts and therefore also of those concepts which refer to duty     first it is his duty to labour to raise himself out of the rudeness of his nature out of his animal nature more and more to humanity by which alone he is capable of setting before him ends to supply the defects of his ignorance by instruction and to correct his errors he is not merely counselled to do this by reason as technically practical with a view to his purposes of other kinds as art but reason as morally practical absolutely commands him to do it and makes this end his duty in order that he may be worthy of the humanity that dwells in him secondly to carry the cultivation of his will up to the purest virtuous disposition that namely in which the law is also the spring of his dutiful actions and to obey it from duty for this is internal morally practical perfection this is called the moral sense as it were a special sense sensus moralis because it is a feeling of the effect which the legislative will within himself exercises on the faculty of acting accordingly this is indeed often misused fanatically as though like the genius of socrates it preceded reason or even could dispense with     judgment of reason but still it is a moral perfection making every special end which is also a duty ones own end   b —happiness of others it is inevitable for human nature that a man should wish and seek for happiness that is satisfaction with his condition with certainty of the continuance of this satisfaction but for this very reason it is not an end that is also a duty some writers still make a distinction between moral and physical happiness the former consisting in satisfaction with ones person     and moral behaviour that is with what one does the other in satisfaction with that which nature confers consequently with what one enjoys as a foreign gift without at present censuring the misuse of the word which even involves a contradiction it must be observed that the feeling of the former belongs solely to the preceding head namely perfection for he who is to feel himself happy in the mere consciousness of his uprightness already possesses that perfection which in the previous section was defined as that end which is also duty if happiness then is in question which it is to be my duty to promote as my end it must be the happiness of other men whose permitted end i hereby make also mine it still remains left to themselves to decide what they shall reckon as belonging to their happiness only that it is in my power to decline many things which they so reckon but which i do not so regard supposing that they have no right to demand it from me as their own a plausible objection often advanced against the division of duties above adopted consists in setting over against that end a supposed obligation to study my own physical happiness and thus making this which is my natural and merely subjective end my duty and objective end this requires to be cleared up adversity pain and want are great temptations to transgression of ones duty accordingly it would seem that strength     health a competence and welfare generally which are opposed to that influence may also be regarded as ends that are also duties that is that it is a duty to promote our own happiness not merely to make that of others our end but in that case the end is not happiness but the morality of the agent and happiness is only the means of removing the hindrances to morality permitted means     since no one has a right to demand from me the sacrifice of my not immoral ends it is not directly a duty to seek a competence for ones self but indirectly it may be so namely in order to guard against poverty which is a great temptation to vice but then it is not my happiness but my morality to maintain which in its integrity is at once my aim and my duty vi —ethics does not supply laws for actions which is done by jurisprudence but only for the maxims of action the notion of duty stands in immediate relation to a law even though i abstract from every end which is the matter of the law as is shown by the formal principle of duty in the categorical imperative act so that the maxims of thy action might become a universal law but in ethics this is conceived as the law of thy own will not of will in general which might be that of others for in the latter case it would give rise to a judicial duty which does not belong to the domain of ethics in ethics maxims are regarded as those subjective laws which merely have the specific character of universal legislation which is only a negative principle not to contradict a law in general how then can there be further a law for the maxims of actions it is the notion of an end which is also a duty a notion peculiar to ethics that alone is the foundation of a law for the maxims of actions by making the subjective end that which every one has subordinate to the objective end that which every one ought to make his own the imperative thou shalt make this or that thy end ex gr the happiness of others     applies to the matter of the elective will an object now since no free action is possible without the agent having in view in it some  00 end as matter of his elective will it follows that if there is an end which is also a duty the maxims of actions which are means to ends must contain only the condition of fitness for a possible universal legislation on the other hand the end which is also a duty can make it a law that we should have such a maxim whilst for the maxim itself the possibility of agreeing with a universal legislation is sufficient for maxims of actions may be arbitrary and are only limited by the condition of fitness for a universal legislation which is the formal principle of actions but a law abolishes the arbitrary character of actions and is by this distinguished from recommendation in which one only desires to know the best means to an end vii —ethical duties are of indeterminate juridical duties of strict obligation this proposition is a consequence of the foregoing for if the law can only command the maxim of the actions not the actions themselves this is a sign that it leaves in the observance of it a latitude latitudo for the elective will that is it cannot definitely assign how and how much we should do by the action towards the end which is also duty but by an indeterminate duty is not meant a permission to make exceptions from the maxim of the actions but only the permission to limit one maxim of duty by another     ex gr the general love of our neighbour by the love of parents and this in fact enlarges the field for the practice of virtue the more indeterminate the duty and the more imperfect accordingly the obligation of the man to the action and the closer he nevertheless brings this maxim of obedience thereto in his own mind to the strict duty of justice des rechts so much the more perfect is his virtuous action hence it is only imperfect duties that are duties of virtue the fulfilment of them is merit meritum   a but their transgression is not necessarily demerit demeritum   a but only moral unworth  0 unless the agent made it a principle not to conform to those duties the strength of purpose in the former case is alone properly called virtue tugend virtus the weakness  0  in the latter case is not vice vitium but rather only lack of virtue untugend a want of moral strength defectus moralis as the word tugend is derived from taugen to be good for something untugend by its etymology signifies good for nothing   every action contrary to duty is called transgression peccatum deliberate transgression which has become a principle is what properly constitutes what is called vice vitium although the conformity of actions to justice recht i e to be an upright rechtlicher man is nothing meritorious yet the conformity of the maxim of such actions regarded as duties that is reverence for justice is meritorious for by this the man makes the right of humanity or of men his own end and thereby enlarges his notion of duty beyond that of indebtedness officium debiti since although another man by virtue of his rights can demand that my actions shall conform to the law he cannot demand that the law shall also contain the spring of these actions the same thing is true of the general ethical command act dutifully from a sense of duty to fix this disposition firmly in ones mind and to quicken it is as in the former case meritorious     because it goes beyond the law of duty in actions and makes the law in itself the spring but just for this reason those duties also must be reckoned as of indeterminate obligation in respect of which there exists a subjective principle which ethically rewards them or to bring them as near as possible to the notion of a strict obligation a principle of susceptibility of this reward according to the law of virtue namely a moral pleasure which goes beyond mere satisfaction with ones self which may be merely negative and of which it is proudly said that in this consciousness virtue is its own reward when this merit is a merit of the man in respect of other men of promoting their natural ends which are recognized as such by all men making their happiness his own we might call it the sweet merit the consciousness of which creates a moral  0  enjoyment in which men are by sympathy inclined to rerel whereas the bitter merit of promoting the true welfare of other men even though they should not recognize it as such in the case of the unthankful and ungrateful has commonly no such reaction but only produces a satisfaction with ones self although in the latter case this would be even greater viii —exposition of the duties of virtue as indeterminate duties   our own perfection as an end which is also a duty a physical perfection that is cultivation of all our faculties generally for the promotion of the ends set before us by reason that this is a duty and therefore an end in itself and that the effort to effect this even without regard     to the advantage that it secures us is based not on a conditional pragmatic but an unconditional moral imperative may be seen from the following consideration the power of proposing to ourselves an end is the characteristic of humanity as distinguished from the brutes with the end of humanity in our own person is therefore combined the rational will vernunftwille and consequently the duty of deserving well of humanity by culture generally by acquiring or advancing the power to carry out all sorts of possible ends so far as this power is to be found in man that is it is a duty to cultivate the crude capacities of our nature since it is by that cultivation that the animal is raised to man therefore it is a duty in itself this duty however is merely ethical that is of indeterminate obligation no principle of reason prescribes how far one must go in this effort in enlarging or correcting his faculty of understanding that is in acquisition of knowledge or technical capacity and besides the difference in the circumstances into which men may come makes the choice of the kind of employment for which he should cultivate his talent very arbitrary here therefore there is no law of reason for actions but only for the maxim of actions viz cultivate thy faculties of mind and body so as to be effective for all ends that may come in thy way uncertain which of them may become thy own  0  b cultivation of morality in ourselves the greatest moral perfection of man is to do his duty and that from duty that the law be not only the rule but also the spring of his actions now at first sight this seems to be a strict obligation and as if the principle of duty commanded not merely the legality of every action but also the morality i e the mental disposition with the exactness and strictness of a law but in fact the law commands even here only the maxim of the action     namely that we should seek the ground of obligation not in the sensible impulses advantage or disadvantage but wholly in the law so that the action itself is not commanded for it is not possible to man to see so far into the depth of his own heart that he could ever be thoroughly certain of the purity of his moral purpose and the sincerity of his mind even in one single action although he has no doubt about the legality of it nay often the weakness which deters a man from the risk of a crime is regarded by him as virtue which gives the notion of strength and how many there are who may have led a long blameless life who are only fortunate in having escaped so many temptations how much of the element of pure morality in their mental disposition may have belonged to each deed remains hidden even from themselves accordingly this duty to estimate the worth of ones actions not merely by their legality but also by their morality mental disposition is only of indeterminate obligation the law does not command this internal action in the human mind itself but only the maxim of the action namely that we should strive with all our power that for all dutiful actions the thought of duty should be of itself an adequate spring   happiness of others as an end which is also a duty a physical welfare—benevolent wishes may be unlimited for they do not imply doing anything but the case is more difficult with benevolent action especially when this is to be done not from friendly inclination love to others but from duty at the expense of the sacrifice and mortification of many of our appetites that this beneficence is a duty results from  0  this that since our selflove cannot be separated from the need to be loved by others to obtain help from them in case of necessity   0 we therefore make ourselves an end for others and this maxim can never be obligatory except by having the specific character of a universal law and consequently by means of a will that we should also make others our ends hence the happiness of others is an end that is also a duty   i am only bound then to sacrifice to others a part of my welfare without hope of recompense because it is my duty and it is impossible to assign definite limits how far that may go much depends on what would be the true want of each according to his own feelings and it must be left to each to determine this for himself for that one should sacrifice his own happiness his true wants in order to promote that of others would be a selfcontradictory maxim if made a universal law this duty therefore is only indeterminate it has a certain latitude within which one may do more or less without our being able to assign its limits definitely the law holds only for the maxims not for definite actions b moral wellbeing of others salus moralis also belongs to the happiness of others which it is our duty to promote but only a negative duty the pain that a man feels from remorse of conscience although its origin is moral is yet in its operation physical like grief fear and every other diseased condition to take care that he should not be deservedly smitten by this inward reproach is not indeed my duty but his business nevertheless it is my duty to do nothing which by the nature of man might seduce him to that for which his conscience may hereafter torment him that is it is my duty not to give him occasion of stumbling skandal but there are no definite limits within which this care for the moral satisfaction of others must be kept therefore it involves only an indeterminate obligation  0  ix —what is a duty of virtue     virtue is the strength of the mans maxim in his obedience to duty all strength is known only by the obstacles that it can overcome and in the case of virtue the obstacles are the natural inclinations which may come into conflict with the moral purpose and as it is the man who himself puts these obstacles in the way of his maxims hence virtue is not merely a selfconstraint for that might be an effort of one inclination to constrain another but is also a constraint according to a principle of inward freedom and therefore by the mere idea of duty according to its formal law   all duties involve a notion of necessitation by the law and ethical duties involve a necessitation for which only an internal legislation is possible juridical duties on the other hand one for which external legislation also is possible both therefore include the notion of constraint either selfconstraint or constraint by others the moral power of the former is virtue and the action springing from such a disposition from reverence for the law may be called a virtuous action ethical although the law expresses a juridical duty for it is the doctrine of virtue that commands us to regard the rights of men as holy but it does not follow that everything the doing of which is virtue is properly speaking a duty of virtue the former may concern merely the form of the maxims the latter applies to the matter of them namely to an end which is also conceived as duty now as the ethical obligation to ends of which there may be many is only indeterminate because it contains only a law for the maxim of actions     and the end is the matter object of elective will hence there are many duties differing  0  according to the difference of lawful ends which may be called duties of virtue officia honestatis just because they are subject only to free selfconstraint not to the constraint of other men and determine the end which is also a duty virtue being a coincidence of the rational will with every duty firmly settled in the character is like everything formal only one and the same but as regards the end of actions which is also duty that is as regards the matter which one ought to make an end there may be several virtues and as the obligation to its maxim is called a duty of virtue it follows that there are also several duties of virtue the supreme principle of ethics the doctrine of virtue is act on a maxim the ends of which are such as it might be a universal law for everyone to have on this principle a man is an end to himself as well as others and it is not enough that he is not permitted to use either himself or others merely as means which would imply that he might be indifferent to them but it is in itself a duty of every man to make mankind in general his end this principle of ethics being a categorical imperative does not admit of proof but it admits of a justification deduction   from principles of pure practical reason whatever in relation to mankind to ones self and others can be an end that is an end for pure practical reason for this is a faculty of assigning ends in general and to be indifferent to them that is to take no interest in them is a contradiction since in that case it would not determine the maxims of actions which always involve an end and consequently would cease to be practical reason     pure reason however cannot command any ends à priori except so far as it declares the same to be also a duty which duty is then called a duty of virtue  0  x —the supreme principle of jurisprudence was analytical that of ethics is synthetical that external constraint so far as it withstands that which hinders the external freedom that agrees with general laws is an obstacle of the obstacle thereto can be consistent with ends generally is clear on the principle of contradiction and i need not go beyond the notion of freedom in order to see it let the end which each may be what he will accordingly the supreme principle of jurisprudence is an analytical principle   on the contrary the principle of ethics goes beyond the notion of external freedom and by general laws connects further with it an end which it makes a duty this principle therefore is synthetic the possibility of it is contained in the deduction § ix this enlargement of the notion of duty beyond that of external freedom and of its limitation by the merely formal condition of its constant harmony this i say in which instead of constraint from without there is set up freedom within the power of selfconstraint and that not by the help of other inclinations but by pure practical reason which scorns all such help consists in this fact which raises it above juridical duty that by it ends are proposed from which jurisprudence altogether abstracts in the case of the moral imperative and the supposition of freedom which it necessarily involves the law the power to fulfil it     and the rational will that determines the maxim constitute all the elements that form the notion of juridical duty but in the imperative which commands the duty of virtue there is added besides the notion of selfconstraint that of an end not one that we have but that we ought to have which therefore pure practical reason has in itself whose highest unconditional end which however continues to be duty consists in this that virtue is its own end and by deserving well of men is also its own reward herein it shines so brightly as an  0  ideal that to human perceptions it seems to cast in the shade even holiness itself which is never tempted to transgression   this however is an illusion arising from the fact that as we have no measure for the degree of strength except the greatness of the obstacles which might have been overcome which in our case are the inclinations we are led to mistake the subjective conditions of estimation of a magnitude for the objective conditions of the magnitude in itself but when compared with human ends all of which have their obstacles to be overcome it is true that the worth of virtue itself which is its own end far outweighs the worth of all the utility and all the empirical ends and advantages which it may have as consequences we may indeed say that man is obliged to virtue as a moral strength for although the power facultas to overcome all opposing sensible impulses by virtue of his freedom can and must be presupposed yet this power regarded as strength robur is something that must be acquired by the moral spring     the idea of the law being elevated by contemplation of the dignity of the pure law of reason in us and at the same time also by exercise  0  xi —according to the preceding principles the scheme of duties of virtue may be thus exhibited  the material element of the duty of virtue external duty of virtue the formal element of the duty of virtue internal duty of virtue xii —preliminary notions of the susceptibility of the mind for notions of duty generally     these are such moral qualities as when a man does not possess them he is not bound to acquire them they are the moral feeling conscience love of ones neighbour and respect for ourselves selfesteem there is no obligation to have these since they are subjective conditions of susceptibility for the notion of duty not objective conditions of morality they are all sensitive and antecedent but natural capacities of mind prædisposito to be affected by notions of duty capacities which it cannot be   0 regarded as a duty to have but which every man has and by virtue of which he can be brought under obligation the consciousness of them is not of empirical origin but can only follow on that of a moral law as an effect of the same on the mind a —the moral feeling this is the susceptibility for pleasure or displeasure merely from the consciousness of the agreement or disagreement of our action with the law of duty now every determination of the elective will proceeds from the idea of the possible action through the feeling of pleasure or displeasure in taking an interest in it or its effect to the deed and here the sensitive state the affection of the internal sense is either a pathological or a moral feeling the former is the feeling that precedes the idea of the law the latter that which may follow it     now it cannot be a duty to have a moral feeling or to acquire it for all consciousness of obligation supposes this feeling in order that one may become conscious of the necessitation that lies in the notion of duty but every man as a moral being has it originally in himself the obligation then can only extend to the cultivation of it and the strengthening of it even by admiration of its inscrutable origin and this is effected by showing how it is just by the mere conception of reason that it is excited most strongly in its own purity and apart from every pathological stimulus and it is improper to call this feeling a moral sense for the word sense generally means a theoretical power of perception directed to an object whereas the moral feeling like pleasure and displeasure in general is something merely subjective which supplies no knowledge no man is wholly destitute of moral feeling for if he were totally unsusceptible of this sensation he would be morally dead and to speak in the language of physicians if the moral vital force could no longer produce any effect on this feeling then his humanity would be dissolved as it were by chemical laws into mere animality and be irrevocably confounded with the mass of other physical beings but we have no special sense for moral good and evil any more     than for truth although such expressions are often used but we have a susceptibility of the free elective will for being moved by pure practical reason and its law and it is this that we call the moral feeling b —of conscience similarly conscience is not a thing to be acquired and it is not a duty to acquire it     but every man as a moral being has it originally within him to be bound to have a conscience would be as much as to say to be under a duty to recognise duties for conscience is practical reason which in every case of law holds before a man his duty for acquittal or condemnation consequently it does not refer to an object but only to the subject affecting the moral feeling by its own act so that it is an inevitable fact not an obligation and duty when therefore it is said this man has no conscience what is meant is that he pays no heed to its dictates for if he really had none he would not take credit to himself for anything done according to duty nor reproach himself with violation of duty and therefore he would be unable even to conceive the duty of having a conscience i pass by the manifold subdivisions of conscience and only observe what follows from what has just been said namely that there is no such thing as an erring conscience no doubt it is possible sometimes to err in the objective judgment whether something is a duty or not but i cannot err in the subjective whether i have compared it with my practical here judicially acting reason for the purpose of that judgment for if i erred i would not have exercised practical judgment at all and in that case there is neither truth nor error unconscientiousness is not want of conscience but the propensity not to heed its judgment but when a man is conscious of having acted according to his conscience then as far as regards guilt or innocence nothing more can be required of him only he is bound to enlighten his understanding as to what is duty or not but when it comes or has come to action then conscience speaks     involuntarily and inevitably to act conscientiously can therefore not be a duty since otherwise it would be necessary to have a second conscience in order to be conscious of the act of the first     the duty here is only to cultivate our conscience to quicken our attention to the voice of the internal judge and to use all means to secure obedience to it and is thus our indirect duty   c —of love to men love is a matter of feeling not of will or volition and i cannot love because i will to do so still less because i ought i cannot be necessitated to love hence there is no such thing as a duty to love benevolence however amor benevolentiæ as a mode of action may be subject to a law of duty disinterested benevolence is often called though very improperly love even where the happiness of the other is not concerned but the complete and free surrender of all ones own ends to the ends of another even a superhuman being love is spoken of as being also our duty but all duty is necessitation or constraint although it may be selfconstraint according to a law but what is done from constraint is not done from love it is a duty to do good to other men according to our power whether we love them or not and this duty loses nothing of its weight although we must make the sad remark that our species alas is not such as to be found particularly worthy of love when we know it more closely hatred of men however is always hateful even though without any active hostility it consists only in complete aversion from mankind the solitary misanthropy for benevolence still remains a duty even towards the manhater whom one cannot love but to whom we can show kindness to hate vice in men is neither duty nor against duty but a mere feeling of horror of vice the will having no influence on the feeling   0 nor the feeling on the will beneficence is a     duty he who often practises this and sees his beneficent purpose succeed comes at last really to love him whom he has benefited when therefore it is said thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself this does not mean thou shalt first of all love and by means of this love in the next place do him good but do good to thy neighbour and this beneficence will produce in thee the love of men as a settled habit of inclination to beneficence the love of complacency amor complacentiæ would therefore alone be direct this is a pleasure immediately connected with the idea of the existence of an object and to have a duty to this that is to be necessitated to find pleasure in a thing is a contradiction d —of respect respect reverentia is likewise something merely subjective a feeling of a peculiar kind not a judgment about an object which it would be a duty to effect or to advance for if considered as duty it could only be conceived as such by means of the respect which we have for it to have a duty to this therefore would be as much as to say to be bound in duty to have a duty when therefore it is said man has a duty of selfesteem this is improperly stated and we ought rather to say the law within him inevitably forces from him respect for his own being and this feeling which is of a peculiar kind is a basis of certain duties that is of certain actions which may be consistent with his duty to himself but we cannot say that he has a duty of respect for himself for he must have respect for the law within himself in order to be able to conceive duty at all xiii —general principles of the metaphysic of morals in the treatment of pure ethics     first a duty can have only a single ground of obligation and if two or more proofs of it are adduced this is a certain mark that either no valid proof has yet been given or that     there are several distinct duties which have been regarded as one for all moral proofs being philosophical can only be drawn by means of rational knowledge from concepts not like mathematics through the construction of concepts the latter science admits a variety of proofs of one and the same theorem because in intuition à priori there may be several properties of an object all of which lead back to the very same principle if for instance to prove the duty of veracity an argument is drawn first from the harm that a lie causes to other men another from the worthlessness of a liar and the violation of his own selfrespect what is proved in the former argument is a duty of benevolence not of veracity that is to say not the duty which required to be proved but a different one now if in giving a variety of proofs for one and the same theorem we flatter ourselves that the multitude of reasons will compensate the lack of weight in each taken separately this is a very unphilosophical resource since it betrays trickery and dishonesty for several insufficient proofs placed beside one another do not produce certainty nor even probability     they should advance as reason and consequence in a series up to the sufficient reason and it is only in this way that they can have the force of proof yet the former is the usual device of the rhetorician secondly the difference between virtue and vice cannot be sought in the degree in which certain maxims are followed but only in the specific quality of the maxims their relation to the law in other words the vaunted principle of aristotle that virtue is the mean between two vices is false   for instance     suppose that good management is given as the mean between two vices prodigality and avarice then its origin as a virtue can neither be defined as the gradual diminution of the former vice by saving nor as the increase of the expenses of the miserly these vices in fact cannot be viewed as if they proceeding as it were in opposite directions met together in good management but each of them has its own maxim which necessarily contradicts that of the other     for the same reason no vice can be defined as an excess in the practice of certain actions beyond what is proper e g prodigalitas est excessus in consumendis opibus or as a less exercise of them than is fitting avaritia est defectus c for since in this way the degree is left quite undefined and the question whether conduct accords with duty or not turns wholly on this such an account is of no use as a definition   thirdly ethical virtue must not be estimated by the power we attribute to man of fulfilling the law but conversely the     moral power must be estimated by the law which commands categorically not therefore by the empirical knowledge that we have of men as they are but by the rational knowledge how according to the idea of humanity they ought to be these three maxims of the scientific treatment of ethics are opposed to the older apophthegms—     there is only one virtue and only one vice     virtue is the observance of the mean path between two opposite vices     virtue like prudence must be learned from experience xiv —of virtue in general virtue signifies a moral strength of will wille but this does not exhaust the notion for such strength might also belong to a holy superhuman being in whom no opposing impulse counteracts the law of his rational will who therefore willingly does everything in accordance with the law virtue then is the moral strength of a mans will wille in his obedience to duty and this is a moral necessitation by his own law giving reason     inasmuch as this constitutes itself a power executing the law it is not itself a duty nor is it a duty to possess it otherwise we should be in duty bound to have a duty but it commands and accompanies its command with a moral constraint one possible by laws of internal freedom     but since this should be irresistible strength is requisite and the degree of this strength can be estimated only by the magnitude of the hindrances which man creates for himself by his inclinations vices the brood of unlawful dispositions are the monsters that he has to combat wherefore this moral strength as fortitude fortitudo moralis constitutes the greatest and only true martial glory of man it is also called the true wisdom namely the practical because it makes the ultimate end  final cause of the existence of man on earth its own end its possession alone makes man free healthy rich a king c nor can either chance or fate deprive him of this since he possesses himself and the virtuous cannot lose his virtue all the enconiums bestowed on the ideal of humanity in its moral perfection can lose nothing of their practical reality by the examples of what men now are have been or will probably be hereafter anthropology which proceeds from mere empirical knowledge cannot impair anthroponomy which is erected by the unconditionally legislating reason and although virtue may now and then be called meritorious in relation to men not to the law and be worthy of reward yet in itself as it is its own end so also it must be regarded as its own reward virtue considered in its complete perfection is therefore regarded not as if man possessed virtue but as if virtue possessed the man     since in the former case it would appear as though he had still had the choice for which he would then require another virtue in order to select virtue from all other wares offered to him to conceive a plurality of virtues as we unavoidably must is nothing else but to conceive various moral objects to which the rational will is led by the single principle of virtue and it is the same with the opposite vices the expression which personifies both is a contrivance for affecting the sensibility pointing however to a moral sense hence it follows that an aesthetic of morals is not a part but a subjective exposition of the metaphysic of morals in which the emotions that accompany the necessitating force of the moral law make the efficiency of that force to be felt for example disgust horror c which give a sensible form to the moral     aversion in order to gain the precedence from the merely sensible incitement xv —of the principle on which ethics is separated from jurisprudence this separation on which the subdivision of moral philosophy in general rests is founded on this that the notion of freedom which is common to both makes it necessary to divide duties into those of external and those of internal freedom the latter of which alone are ethical hence this internal freedom which is the condition of all ethical duty must be discussed as a preliminary discursus præliminaris just as above the doctrine of conscience was discussed as the condition of all duty remarks of the doctrine of virtue on the principle of internal freedom     habit habitus is a facility of action and a subjective perfection of the elective will but not every such facility is a free habit habitus libertatis for if it is custom assuetudo that is a uniformity of action which by frequent repetition has become a necessity then it is not a habit proceeding from freedom and therefore not a moral habit virtue therefore cannot be defined as a habit of free lawabiding actions unless indeed we add determining itself in its action by the idea of the law and then this habit is not a property of the elective will but of the rational will which is a faculty that in adopting a rule also declares it to be a universal law and it is only such a habit that can be reckoned as virtue two things are required for internal freedom to be master of ones self in a given case animus sui compos and to have command over ones self imperium in semetipsum that is to subdue his emotions and to govern his passions with these conditions the character indoles is noble erecta in the opposite case it is ignoble indoles abjecta serva     xvi —virtue requires first of all command over ones self emotions and passions are essentially distinct the former belong to feeling in so far as this coming before reflection makes it more difficult or even impossible hence emotion is called hasty jäh animus præceps     and reason declares through the notion of virtue that a man should collect himself but this weakness in the life of ones understanding joined with the strength of a mental excitement is only a lack of virtue untugend and as it were a weak and childish thing which may very well consist with the best will and has further this one good thing in it that this storm soon subsides a propensity to emotion ex gr resentment is therefore not so closely related to vice as passion is passion on the other hand is the sensible appetite grown into a permanent inclination ex gr hatred in contrast to resentment the calmness with which one indulges it leaves room for reflection and allows the mind to frame principles thereon for itself and thus when the inclination falls upon what contradicts the law to brood on it to allow it to root itself deeply and thereby to take up evil as of set purpose into ones maxim and this is then specifically evil that is it is a true vice virtue therefore in so far as it is based on internal freedom contains a positive command for man namely that he should bring all his powers and inclinations under his rule that of reason and this is a positive precept of command over himself which is additional to the prohibition namely that he should not allow himself to be governed by his feelings and inclinations the duty of apathy since unless reason takes the reins of government into its own hands the feelings and inclinations play the master over the man xvii —virtue necessarily presupposes apathy considered as strength this word apathy has come into bad repute just as if it meant want of feeling and therefore subjective indifference with respect to the objects of the elective will     it is supposed   0 to be a weakness this misconception may be avoided by giving the name moral apathy to that want of emotion which is to be distinguished from indifference in the former the feelings arising from sensible impressions lose their influence on the moral feeling only because the respect for the law is more powerful than all of them together it is only the apparent strength of a fever patient that makes even the lively sympathy with good rise to an emotion or rather degenerate into it such an emotion is called enthusiasm and it is with reference to this that we are to explain the moderation which is usually recommended in virtuous practices—   insani sapiens nomen ferat æquus iniqui   ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam   —hor   for otherwise it is absurd to imagine that one could be too wise or too virtuous the emotion always belongs to the sensibility no matter by what sort of object it may be excited the true strength of virtue is the mind at rest with a firm deliberate resolution to bring its law into practice that is the state of health in the moral life on the contrary the emotion even when it is excited by the idea of the good is a momentary glitter which leaves exhaustion after it we may apply the term fantastically virtuous to the man who will admit nothing to be indifferent in respect of morality adiaphora and who strews all his steps with duties as with traps and will not allow it to be indifferent whether a man eat fish or flesh drink beer or wine when both agree with him—a micrology which if adopted into the doctrine of virtue would make its rule a tyranny remark     virtue is always in progress and yet always begins from the beginning the former follows from the fact that objectively considered it is an ideal and unattainable and yet it is a duty constantly to approximate to it the second characteristic is founded subjectively on the nature of man which is affected by inclinations under the influence of which virtue with its     maxims adopted once for all can never settle in a position of rest but if it is not rising inevitably falls because moral maxims cannot like technical be based on custom for this belongs to the physical character of the determination of will but even if the practice of them become a custom the agent would thereby lose the freedom in the choice of his maxims which freedom is the character of an action done from duty the two remaining sections discuss the proper division of ethics and have no interest apart from the treatise to which they are introductory they are therefore not translated i add some remarks on conscience taken from the tugendlehre itself on conscience the consciousness of an internal tribunal in man before which his thoughts accuse or excuse one another is conscience every man has a conscience and finds himself observed by an inward judge which threatens and keeps him in awe reverence combined with fear and this power which watches over the laws within him is not something which he himself arbitrarily makes but it is incorporated in his being it follows him like his shadow when he thinks to escape he may indeed stupefy himself with pleasures and distractions but cannot avoid now and then coming to himself or awaking and then he at once perceives its awful voice in his utmost depravity he may indeed pay no attention to it but he cannot avoid hearing it now this original intellectual and as a conception of duty moral capacity called conscience has this peculiarity in it that although its business is a business of man with himself yet he finds himself compelled by his reason to transact it as if at the command of another person for the transaction here is the conduct of a trial causa before a tribunal but that he who is accused by his conscience should be conceived as one and the same person with the judge is an absurd conception of a judicial court for then the complainant would always lose his     case therefore in all duties the conscience of the man must regard another than himself as the judge of his actions if it is to avoid selfcontradiction now this other may be an actual or a merely ideal person which reason frames to itself   such an idealized person the authorized judge of conscience must be one who knows the heart for the tribunal is set up in the inward part of man at the same time he must also be allobliging that is must be or be conceived as a person in respect of whom all duties are to be regarded as his commands since conscience is the inward judge of all free actions now since such a moral being must at the same time possess all power in heaven and earth since otherwise he could not give his commands their proper effect which the office of judge necessarily requires and since such a moral being possessing power over all is called god hence conscience must be conceived as the subjective principle of a responsibility for ones deeds before god nay this latter concept is contained though it be only obscurely in every moral selfconsciousness—tugendlehre p     ff     first part of the philosophical theory of religion         of the indwelling of the bad principle along with the good or on the radical evil in human nature    0 that the world lieth in wickedness is a complaint as old as history even as what is still older poetry indeed as old as the oldest of all poems sacerdotal religion all alike nevertheless make the world begin from good with the golden age with life in paradise or one still more happy in communion with heavenly beings but they represent this happy state as soon vanishing like a dream and then they fall into badness moral badness which is always accompanied by physical as hastening to worse and worse with accelerated steps   so that we are now living this now being however as old as history in the last times the last day and the destruction of the world are at the door and in some parts of hindostan  0 the judge and destroyer of the world rudra otherwise called siva is already worshipped as the god that is at present in power the preserver of the world namely vishnu having centuries ago laid down his office of which he was weary and which he had received from the creator of the world brahma     later but much less general is the opposite heroic opinion which has perhaps obtained currency only amongst philosophers and in our times chiefly amongst instructors of youth that the world is constantly advancing in precisely the reverse direction namely from worse to better though almost insensibly at least that the capacity for such advance exists in human nature this opinion however is certainly not founded on experience if what is meant is moral good or evil not civilization for the history of all times speaks too powerfully against it but it is probably a goodnatured hypothesis of moralists from seneca to rousseau so as to urge man to the unwearied cultivation of the germ of good that perhaps lies in us if one can reckon on such a natural foundation in man   there is also the consideration that as we must assume that     man is by nature that is as he is usually born sound in body there is thought to be no reason why we should not assume that he is also by nature sound in soul so that nature itself helps us to develop this moral capacity for good within us sanabilibus ægrotamus malis nosque in rectum genitos natura si sanari velimus adjuvat says seneca but since it may well be that there is error in the supposed experience on both sides the question is whether a mean is not at least possible namely that man as a species may be neither good nor bad or at all events that he is as much one as the other partly good partly bad    we call a man bad however not because he performs actions that are bad violating law but because these are of such a kind that we may infer from them bad maxims in him now although we can in experience observe that actions violate laws and even at least in ourselves that they do so consciously yet we cannot observe the maxims themselves not even always in ourselves consequently the judgment that the doer of them is a bad man cannot with certainty be founded on experience in order then to call a man bad it should be possible to argue à priori from some actions or from a single consciously bad action to a bad maxim as its foundation and from this to a general source in the actor of all particular morally bad maxims this source again being itself a maxim lest any difficulty should be found in the expression nature which if it meant as usual the opposite of the source of actions from freedom would be directly contradictory to the predicates morally good or evil it is to be observed that by the nature of man we mean here only the subjective ground of the use of his freedom in general under objective moral laws which precedes every act that falls under the senses wherever this ground lies this subjective ground however must itself again be always an act of freedom else the use or abuse of mans elective will in respect of the moral law could not be imputed to him nor the good or bad in him be called moral consequently the source of the bad cannot lie in any object that determines the elective will through inclination or in any natural impulse but     only in a rule that the elective will makes for itself for the use of its freedom that is in a maxim now we cannot go on to ask concerning this what is the subjective ground why it is adopted and not the opposite maxim    for if this ground were ultimately not now a maxim but a mere natural impulse then the use of freedom would be reduced to determination by natural causes which is contradictory to its conception when we say then man is by nature good or he is by nature bad this only means that he contains a primary source to us inscrutable   of the adoption of good or of the adoption of bad law violating maxims and this generally as man and consequently so that by this he expresses the character of his species we shall say then of one of these characters which distinguishes man from other possible rational beings it is innate and yet we must always remember that nature is not to bear the blame of it if it is bad or the credit if it is good but that the man himself is the author of it but since the primary source of the adoption of our maxims which itself must again always lie in the free elective will cannot be a fact of experience hence the good or bad in man as the subjective primary source of the adoption of this or that maxim in respect of the moral law is innate merely in this sense that it is in force before any use of freedom is experienced    in the earliest childhood back to birth so that it is conceived as being present in man at birth not that birth is the cause of it     remark the conflict between the two abovementioned hypotheses rests on a disjunctive proposition man is by nature either morally good or morally bad but it readily occurs to every one to ask whether this disjunction is correct and whether one might not affirm that man is by nature neither or another that he is both at once namely in some parts good in others bad experience seems even to confirm this mean between the two extremes it is in general however important for ethics to admit as far as possible no intermediates either in actions adiaphora or in human characters since with such ambiguity all maxims would run the risk of losing all definiteness and firmness those who are attached to this strict view are commonly called rigourists a name that is meant as a reproach but which is really praise and their antipodes may be called latitudinarians the latter are either latitudinarians of neutrality who may be called indifferentists or of compromise who may be called syncretists     0    the answer given to the above question by the rigourists   is founded on the important consideration    that freedom of elective will has the peculiar characteristic that it cannot be determined to action by any spring except only so far as the man has taken it up into his maxim has made it the universal rule of his conduct only in his way can a spring whatever it may be coexist with the absolute spontaneity of the elective will freedom only the moral law is of itself in the judgment of reason a spring and whoever makes it his maxim is morally good now if the law does not determine a mans elective will in respect of an action which has reference to it an opposite spring must have influence on his elective will and since by hypothesis this can only occur by the man taking it and consequently deviation from the moral law into his maxim in which case he is a bad man it follows that his disposition     in respect of the moral law is never indifferent is always one of the two good or bad    nor can he be partly good and partly bad at the same time for if he is in part good he has taken the moral law into his maxim if then he were at the same time in another part bad then since the moral law of obedience to duty is one and universal the maxim referring to it would be universal and at the same time only particular which is a contradiction   when it is said that a man has the one or the other disposition as an innate natural quality it is not meant that it is not acquired by him that is that he is not the author of it but only that it is not acquired in time that from youth up he has been always the one or the other the disposition that is the primary subjective source of the adoption of maxims can be but one and applies generally to the whole use of freedom but it must     have been itself adopted by free elective will for otherwise it could not be imputed now the subjective ground or cause of its adoption cannot be further known although we cannot help asking for it since otherwise another maxim would have to be adduced into which this disposition has been adopted and this again must have its reason    since then we cannot deduce this disposition or rather its ultimate source from any first act of the elective will in time we call it a characteristic of the elective will attaching to it by nature although in fact it is founded in freedom now that when we say of a man that he is by nature good or bad we are justified in applying this not to the individual in which case one might be assumed to be by nature good another bad but to the whole race this can only be proved when it has been shown in the anthropological inquiry that the reasons which justify us in ascribing one of the two characters to a man as innate are such that there is no reason to except any man from them and that therefore it holds of the race i of the original incapacity for good in human nature we may conveniently regard this capacity anlage under three heads divided in reference to their end as elements in the purpose for which man exists—     the capacities belonging to the animal nature of man as a living being     to his humanity as a living and at the same time rational being     to his personality as a rational and at the same time responsible being capable of imputation            the capacities belonging to the animal nature of man may be brought under the general title of physical and merely mechanical selflove that is such as does not require reason it is threefold—first for the maintenance of himself secondly for the propagation of his kind and the maintenance of his offspring thirdly for communion with other men that is the impulse to society all sorts of vices may be grafted on it but they do not proceed from that capacity itself as a root they may be called vices of coarseness of nature and in their extreme deviation from the end of nature become brutal vices intemperance sensuality and wild lawlessness in relation to other men   the capacities belonging to his humanity may be brought under the general title of comparative though physical selflove which requires reason namely estimating ones self as happy or unhappy only in comparison with others from this is derived the inclination to obtain a worth in the opinion of others and primarily only that of equality to allow no one a superiority over ones self joined with a constant apprehension    that others might strive to attain it and from this there ultimately arises an unjust desire to gain superiority for ourselves over others on this namely jealousy and rivalry the greatest vices may be grafted secret and open hostilities against all whom we look upon as not belonging to us these however do not properly spring of themselves from nature as their root but apprehending that others endeavour to gain a hated superiority over us     these are inclinations to secure this superiority for ourselves as a defensive measure whereas nature would use the idea of such competition which in itself does not exclude mutual love only as a motive to culture the vices that are grafted on this inclination may therefore be called vices of culture and in their highest degree of malignancy in which they are merely the idea of a maximum of badness surpassing humanity ex gr in envy in ingratitude malice c are called devilish vices   the capacity belonging to personality is the capability of respect for the moral law as a spring of the elective will adequate in itself the capability of mere respect for the moral law in us would be moral feeling which does not of itself constitute an end of the natural capacity but only so far as it is a spring of the elective will now as this is only possible by free will adopting it into its maxim hence the character of such an elective will is the good character which like every character of free elective will is something that can only be acquired the possibility of which however requires the presence of a capacity in our nature on which absolutely nothing bad can be grafted the idea of the moral law alone with the respect inseparable from it cannot properly be called a capacity belonging to personality  0 it is personality itself the idea of humanity considered altogether intellectually but that we adopt this respect into our maxims as a spring this seems to have a subjective ground additional to personality and so this ground seems therefore to deserve the name of a capacity belonging to personality if we consider these three capacities according to the conditions of their possibility we find that the first requires no reason the second is based on reason which though practical is at the service of other motives the third has as its root reason which is practical of itself that is unconditionally legislative all these capacities in man are not only negatively good not resisting the moral law but are also capacities for good promoting obedience to it they are original for they appertain to the possibility of human nature man can use the two former contrary to their end but cannot destory them     by the capacities of a being we understand both its constituent elements and also the forms of their combination which make it such and such a being they are original if they are essentially necessary to the possibility of such a being contingent if the being would be in itself possible without them it is further to be observed that we are speaking here only of those capacities which have immediate reference to the faculty of desire and to the use of the elective will ii of the propensity to evil in human nature by propensity propensio i understand the subjective source of possibility of an inclination habitual desire concupiscentia so far as this latter is as regards man generally contingent      it is distinguished from a capacity by this that although it may be innate it need not be conceived as such but may be regarded as acquired when it is good or when it is bad as drawn by the person on himself here however we are speaking only of the propensity to what is properly ie morally bad which as it is possible only as a determination of free elective will and this can be adjudged to be good or bad only by its maxims must consist in the subjective ground of the possibility of a deviation     of the maxims from the moral law and if this propensity may be assumed as belonging to man universally and therefore to the characteristics of his race will be called a natural propensity of man to evil we may add further that the capability or incapability of the elective will to adopt the moral law into its maxims or not arising from natural propensity is called a good or bad heart we may conceive three distinct degrees of this—first it is the weakness of the human heart in following adopted maxims generally    or the frailty of human nature secondly the propensity to mingle nonmoral motives with the moral even when it is done with a good purpose and under maxims of good that is impurity thirdly the propensity to adopt bad maxims that is the depravity of human nature or of the human heart first the frailty fragilitas of human nature is expressed even in the complaint of an apostle to will is present with me but how to perform i find not that is i adopt the good the law into the maxim of my elective will but this which objectively in its ideal conception in thesi is an irresistible spring is subjectively in hypothesi when the maxim is to be carried out weaker than inclination secondly the impurity impuritas improbitas of the human heart consists in this that although the maxim is good in its object the intended obedience to the law and perhaps also powerful enough for practice yet it is not purely moral that is does not as ought to be the case involve the law alone as its sufficient spring but frequently perhaps always has need of other springs beside it to determine the elective will to what duty demands in other words that dutiful actions are not done purely from duty thirdly the depravity vitiositas pravitas or if it is preferred the corruption corruptio of the human heart is the propensity of the elective will to maxims which prefer other not moral springs to that which arises from the moral law it may also be called the perversity perversitas of the human heart because it reverses the moral order in respect of the springs of a free elective will and although legally good actions may be consistent     with this the moral disposition is thereby corrupted in its root and the man is therefore designated bad    it will be remarked that the propensity to evil in man is here ascribed even to the best best in action which must be the case if it is to be proved that the propensity to evil amongst men is universal or what here signifies the same thing that it is interwoven with human nature however a man of good morals bene moratus and a morally good man moraliter bonus do not differ or at least ought not to differ as regards the agreement of their actions with the law only that in the one these actions have not always the law for their sole and supreme spring in the other it is invariably so we may say of the former that he obeys the law in the letter that is as far as the act is concerned which the law commands but of the latter that he observes it in the spirit the spirit of the moral law consists in this that it is alone an adequate spring whatever is not done from this faith is sin in the disposition of mind for if other springs beside the law itself are necessary to determine the elective will to actions conforming to the law ex gr desire of esteem selflove in general or even goodnatured instinct such as compassion then it is a mere accident that they agree with the law for they might just as well urge to its transgression the maxim then the goodness of which is the measure of all moral worth in the person is in this case opposed to the law and while the mans acts are all good he is nevertheless bad the following explanation is necessary in order to define the conception of this propensity every propensity is either physical that is it appertains to mans will as a physical being or it is moral that is appertaining to his elective will as a moral being in the first sense there is no propensity to moral evil for this must spring from freedom    and a physical propensity founded on sensible impulses to any particular use of freedom whether for good or evil is a contradiction a propensity to evil then can only attach to the elective will as a moral faculty now nothing is morally bad that is capable of being imputed but what is our own act on the other hand by     the notion of a propensity we understand a subjective ground of determination of the elective will antecedent to any act and which is consequently not itself an act hence there would be a contradiction in the notion of a mere propensity to evil unless indeed this word act could be taken in two distinct senses both reconcilable with the notion of freedom now the term act in general applies to that use of freedom by which the supreme maxim is adopted into ones elective will conformably or contrary to the law as well as to that in which actions themselves as to their matter that is the objects of the elective will are performed in accordance with that maxim the propensity to evil is an act in the former sense peccatum originarium and is at the same time the formal source of every act in the second sense which in its matter violates the law and is called vice peccatum derivativum and the first fault remains even though the second may be often avoided from motives other than the law itself the former is an intelligible act only cognizable by reason apart from any condition of time the latter sensible empirical given in time factum phœnomenon the former is especially called in comparison with the second a mere propensity and innate because it cannot be extirpated since this would require that the supreme maxim should be good whereas by virtue of that propensity itself it is supposed to be bad    and especially because although the corruption of our supreme maxim is our own act we cannot assign any further cause for it any more than for any fundamental attribute of our nature what has just been said will show the reason why we have at the beginning of this section sought the three sources of moral evil simply in that which by laws of freedom affects the ultimate ground of our adopting or obeying this or that maxim not in what affects the sensibility as receptivity     iii man is by nature bad vitiis nemo sine nascitur —horat according to what has been said above the proposition man is bad can only mean he is conscious of the moral law and yet has adopted into his maxim occasional deviation therefrom he is by nature bad is equivalent to saying this holds of him considered as a species not as if such a quality could be inferred from the specific conception of man that of man in general for then it would be necessary but by what is known of him through experience he cannot be otherwise judged or it may be presupposed as subjectively necessary in every man even the best now this propensity itself must be considered as morally bad and consequently not as a natural property but as something that can be imputed to the man and consequently must consist in maxims of the elective will which are opposed to the law but on account of freedom these must be looked upon as in themselves contingent which is inconsistent with the universality of this badness unless the ultimate subjective ground of all maxims is by whatever means interwoven with humanity and as it were rooted in it hence we call this a natural propensity to evil and as the man must nevertheless always incur the blame of it    it may be called even a radical badness in human nature innate but not the less drawn upon us by ourselves now that there must be such a corrupt propensity rooted in men need not be formally proved in the face of the multitude of crying examples which experience sets before ones eyes in the acts of man if examples are desired from that state in which many philosophers hoped to find preeminently the natural goodness of human nature namely the socalled state of nature we need only look at the instances of unprovoked cruelty in the scenes of murder in tofoa new zealand the navigator   0 islands and the neverceasing instances in the wide wastes of northwest america mentioned by captain hearne   where no one has even the least advantage from it   and comparing these with that hypothesis we have vices of savage life more than enough to make us abandon that opinion on the other hand if one is disposed to think that human nature can be better known in a civilized condition in which its characteristic properties can be more perfectly developed then one must listen to a long melancholy litany of complaints of humanity    of secret falsehood even in the most intimate friendship so that it is reckoned a general maxim of prudence that even the best friends should restrain their confidence in their mutual intercourse of a propensity to hate the man to whom one is under an obligation for which a benefactor must always be prepared of a hearty goodwill which nevertheless admits the remark that in the misfortunes of our best friends there is something which is not altogether displeasing to us   and of many other vices concealed under the appearance of virtue not to mention the vices of those who do not conceal them because we are satisfied to call a man good who is a bad man of the average class this will give one enough of the vices of culture and civilization the most mortifying of all to make him turn away his eye from the     conduct of men lest he should fall into another vice namely misanthropy if he is not yet satisfied however he need only take into consideration a condition strangely compounded of both namely the external condition of nations—for the relation of civilized nations to one another is that of a rude state of nature a state of perpetual preparation for war and they are also firmly resolved never to abandon it—and he will become aware of principles adopted by the great societies called states      which directly contradict the public profession and yet are never to be laid aside principles which no philsopher has yet been able to bring into agreement with morals nor sad to say can they propose any better which would be reconcilable with human nature so that the philosophical millennium which hopes for a state of perpetual peace founded on a union of nations as a republic of the world is generally ridiculed as visionary just as much as the theological which looks for the complete moral improvement of the whole human race now the source of this badness   cannot as is usually done be placed in the sensibility of man and the natural inclinations     springing therefrom for not only have these no direct reference to badness on the contrary they afford the occasion for the moral character to show its power occasion for virtue but further we are not responsible for their existence we cannot be for being implanted in us they have not us for their authors whereas we are accountable for the propensity to evil for as this concerns the morality of the subject and is consequently found in him as a freely acting being it must be imputed to him as his own fault notwithstanding its being so deeply rooted in the elective will that it must be said to be found in man by nature the source of this evil   cannot be placed in a corruption of reason which gives the moral law    as if reason could abolish the authority of the law in itself and disown its obligation for this is absolutely impossible to conceive ones self as a freely acting being and yet released from the law which is appropriate to such a being the moral law would be the same as to conceive a cause operating without any law for determination by natural laws is excluded by freedom and this would be a contradiction for the purpose then of assigning a source of the moral evil in man sensibility contains too little for in taking away the motives which arise from freedom it makes him a mere animal being on the other hand a reason releasing from the moral law a malignant reason as it were a simply bad rational will wille involves too much for by this antagonism to the law would itself be made a spring of action for the elective will cannot be determined without some spring so that the subject would be made a devilish being neither of these views however is applicable to man now although the existence of this propensity to evil in human nature can be shown by experience from the actual antagonism in time between human will and the law yet this proof does not teach us its proper nature and the source of this antagonism this propensity concerns a relation of the free elective will an elective will therefore the conception of which is not empirical to the moral law as a spring the conception of which is likewise purely intellectual its nature then must be     cognized à priori from the concept of the bad so far as the laws of freedom obligation and accountability bear upon it the following is the development of the concept— man even the worst does not in any maxim as it were rebelliously abandon the moral law and renounce obedience to it  0 on the contrary this forces itself upon him irresistibly by virtue of his moral nature and if no other spring opposed it he would also adopt it into his ultimate maxim as the adequate determining principle of his elective will that is he would be morally good but by reason of his physical nature which is likewise blameless he also depends on sensible springs of action and adopts them also into his maxim by the subjective principle of selflove if however he adopted them into his maxim as adequate of themselves alone to determine his will without regarding the moral law which he has within then he would be morally bad now as he naturally adopts both into his maxim and as he would find each if it were alone sufficient to determine his will it follows that if the distinction of the maxims depended merely on the distinction of the springs the matter of the maxims namely according as they were furnished by the law or by an impulse of sense he would be morally good and bad at once which as we saw in the introduction is a contradiction hence the distinction whether the man is good or bad must lie not in the distinction of the springs that he adopts into his maxim but in the subordination i e which of the two he makes the condition of the other that is not in the matter of the maxim but in its form consequently a man even the best is bad only by this that he reverses the moral order of the springs in adopting them into his maxims he adopts indeed the moral law along with that of selflove but perceiving that they cannot subsist together on equal terms but that one must be subordinate to the other as its supreme condition he makes the spring of selflove and its inclinations the condition of obedience to the moral law whereas on the contrary the latter ought to be adopted into the general maxims of the elective will as the sole spring being the supreme condition of the satisfaction of the former        the springs being thus reversed by his maxim contrary to the moral order his actions may nevertheless conform to the law just as though they had sprung from genuine principles provided reason employs the unity of maxims in general which is proper to the moral law merely for the purpose of introducing into the springs of inclination a unity that does not belong to them under the name of happiness ex gr that truthfulness if adopted as a principle relieves us of the anxiety to maintain consistency in our lies and to escape being entangled in their serpent coils in which case the empirical character is good but the intelligible character bad now if there is in human nature a propensity to this then there is in man a natural propensity to evil and since this propensity itself must ultimately be sought in a free elective will and therefore can be imputed it is morally bad this badness is radical because it corrupts the source of all maxims and at the same time being a natural propensity it cannot be destroyed by human powers since this could only be done by good maxims and when by hypothesis the ultimate subjective source of all maxims is corrupt these cannot exist nevertheless it must be possible to overcome it since it is found in man as a freely acting being the depravity of human nature then is not so much to be called badness if this word is taken in its strict sense namely as a disposition subjective principle of maxims to adopt the bad as bad into ones maxims as a spring for that is devilish but rather perversity of heart which on account of the result is also called a bad heart    this may coexist with a will wille good in general and arises from the frailty of human nature which is not strong enough to follow its adopted principles combined with its impurity in not distinguishing the springs even of wellintentioned actions from one another by moral rule so that ultimately it looks at best only to the conformity of its actions with the law not to their derivation from it that is to the law itself as the only spring now although this does not always give rise to wrong actions and a propensity thereto that is to vice yet the habit of regarding     the absence of vice as a conformity of the mind to the law of duty as virtue must itself be designated a radical perversity of the human heart since in this case the spring in the maxims is not regarded at all but only the obedience to the letter of the law this is called innate guilt reatus because it can be perceived as soon as ever the use of freedom manifests itself in man and nevertheless must have arisen from freedom and therefore may be imputed it may in its two first degrees of frailty and impurity be viewed as unintentional guilt culpa but in the third as intentional dolus and it is characterized by a certain malignancy of the human heart dolus malus deceiving itself as to its own good or bad dispositions and provided only its actions have not the bad result which by their maxims they might well have then not disquieting itself about its dispositions but on the contrary holding itself to be justified before the law hence comes the peace of conscience of so many in their own opinion conscientious men when amidst actions in which the law was not taken into counsel    or at least was not the most important consideration they have merely had the good fortune to escape bad consequences perhaps they even imagine they have merit not feeling themselves guilty of any of the transgressions in which they see others involved without inquiring whether fortune is not to be thanked for this and whether the disposition which if they would they could discover within would not have led them to the practice of the like vices had they not been kept away from them by want of power by temperament education circumstances of time and place which lead into temptation all things that cannot be imputed to us this dishonesty in imposing on ourselves which hinders the establishment of genuine moral principle in us extends itself then outwardly also to falsehood and deception of others which if it is not to be called badness at least deserves to be called worthlessness and has its root in the radical badness of human nature which inasmuch as it perverts the moral judgment in respect of the estimation to be formed of a man and renders     imputation quite uncertain both internally and externally constitutes the corrupt spot in our nature which as long as we do not extirpate it hinders the source of good from developing itself as it otherwise would a member of the english parliament uttered in the heat of debate the declaration every man has his price   if this is true which every one may decide for himself—if there is no virtue for which a degree of temptation cannot be found which is capable of overthrowing it—if the question whether the good or the bad spirit shall gain us to its side only depends on which bids highest and offers most prompt payment—then what the apostle says might well be true of men universally there is no difference they are altogether sinners there is none that doeth good according to the spirit of the law no not one       iv on the origin of the evil in human nature    origin primary is the derivation of an effect from its primary cause that is one which is not in its turn an effect of another cause of the same kind it may be considered either as a rational or a temporal origin in the former signification it is only the existence of the effect that is considered in the latter its occurrence so that it is referred as an event to its cause in time when the effect is referred to a cause which is connected with it by laws of freedom as is the case with moral evil then the determination of the elective will to the production of it is not regarded as connected with its determining principle in time but merely in the conception of the reason    and cannot be deduced as from any antecedent state which on the other hand must be done when the bad action considered as an event in the world is referred to its physical cause it is a contradiction then to seek for the timeorigin of free actions as such as we do with physical effects or of the moral character of man so far as it is regarded as contingent because this is the principle of the use of freedom and this as well as the determining principle of free will generally must be sought for simply in conceptions of reason but whatever may be the origin of the moral evil in man the most unsuitable of all views that can be taken of its spread and continuance through all the members of our race and in all generations is to represent it as coming to us by inheritance from our first parents for we can say of moral evil what the poet says of good    genus et proavos et quæ non fecimus ipsi vix ea nostro puto             it is to be observed further that when we inquire into the origin of evil we do not at first take into account the propensity to it as peccatum in potentia but only consider the actual evil of given actions in its inner possibility and in what must concur to determine the will to the doing of them every bad action when we inquire into its rational origin must be viewed as if the man had fallen into it directly from the state of innocence for whatever may have been his previous conduct and of whatever kind the natural causes influencing him may be whether moreover they are internal or external his action is still free and not determined by any causes and therefore it both can and must be always judged as an original exercise of his elective will he ought to have left it undone in whatever circumstances he may have been for by no cause in the world can he cease to be a freely acting being it is said indeed and justly that the man is accountable for the consequences of his previous free but wrong actions but by this is only meant that one need not have recourse to the subterfuge of deciding whether the later actions are free or not because there is sufficient ground for the accountability in the admittedly free action which was their cause but if a man had been never so bad up to the very moment of an impending free action even so that custom had become second nature yet not only has it been his duty to be better but it is now still his duty to improve himself    he must then be also able to do so and if he does not he is just as accountable at the moment of acting as if endowed with the natural capacity for good which is inseparable from freedom he had stepped into evil     from the state of innocence we must not inquire then what is the origin in time of this act but what is its origin in reason in order to define thereby the propensity that is to say the general subjective principle by which a transgression is adopted into our maxim if there is such a propensity and if possible to explain it with this agrees very well the mode of representation which the scriptures employ in depicting the origin of evil as a beginning of it in the human race inasmuch as they exhibit it in a history in which that which must be conceived as first in the nature of the thing without regard to the condition of time appears as first in time according to the scriptures evil does not begin from a fundamental propensity to it—otherwise its beginning would not spring from freedom—but from sin by which is understood the transgression of the moral law as a divine command while the state of man before all propensity to evil is called the state of innocence the moral law preceded as a prohibition as must be the case with man as a being not pure but tempted by inclinations gen ii       instead now of following this law directly as an adequate spring one which alone is unconditionally good and in respect of which no scruple can occur the man looked about for other springs iii   which could only be conditionally good namely so far as the law is not prejudiced thereby and made it his maxim—if we conceive the action as consciously arising from freedom—to obey the law of duty not from duty but from regard to other considerations    hence he began with questioning the strictness of the law which excludes the influence of every other spring then he reasoned down   obedience to it to the   0 mere conditional conformity to means subject to the principle of selflove whence finally the predominance of sensible motives above the spring of the law was adopted into the maxim of action and so sin was committed iii   mutato nomine de te fabula narratur that we all do just the same consequently have all sinned in adam    and still sin is clear from what has preceded only that in us an innate propensity to sin is presupposed in time but in the first man on the contrary innocence so that in him the transgression is called a fall whereas in us it is conceived as following from the innate depravity of our nature what is meant however by this propensity is no more than this that if we wish to apply ourselves to the explanation of evil as to its beginning in time we must in the case of every intentional transgression pursue its causes in a previous period of our life going backwards till we reach a time when the use of reason was not yet developed in other words we must trace the source of evil to a propensity towards it as a foundation in nature which on this account is called innate in the case of the first man who is represented as already possessing the full power of using his reason this is not necessary nor indeed possible    since otherwise that natural foundation the evil propensity must have been created in him therefore his sin is represented as produced directly from a state of innocence but we must not seek for an origin in time of a moral character for which we are to be accountable however inevitable this is when we try to explain its contingent existence hence scripture may have so represented it to us in accommodation to this our weakness     the rational origin however of this perversion of our elective will in respect of the way in which it adopts subordinate springs into its maxims as supreme i e the origin of this propensity to evil remains inscrutable to us for it must itself be imputed to us and consequently that ultimate ground of all maxims would again require the assumption of a bad maxim   what is bad could only have sprung from what is morally bad not the mere limits of our nature and yet the original constitution is adapted to good nor could it be corrupted by any other than man himself if he is to be accountable for this corruption there is not then any source conceivable to us from which moral evil could have first come into us scripture   in its historical narrative expresses this inconceivability at the same time that it defines the depravity of our race more precisely  0 by representing evil as preexisting at the beginning of the world not however in man but in a spirit originally destined for a lofty condition the first beginning of all evil in general is thus represented as inconceivable to us for whence came the evil in that spirit and man as having fallen into evil only by seduction and therefore as not fundamentally corrupt i e even in his primary capacity for good but as still capable of an improvement in contrast to a seducing spirit that is a being in whom the temptation of the flesh cannot be reckoned     as alleviating his guilt so that the former who notwithstanding his corrupt heart continues to have a good rational will wille has still left the hope of a return to the good from which he has gone astray general remark   on the restoration of the original capacity for good to its full power what man is or ought to be in a moral sense he must make or must have made himself both must be the effect of his free elective will otherwise it could not be imputed to him and consequently he would be morally neither good nor bad when it is said he is created good that can only mean that he is created for good and the original constitution in man is good    but this does not yet make the man himself good but according as he does or does not adopt into his maxim the springs which this constitution contains which must be left altogether to his own free choice he makes himself become good or bad supposing that a supernatural cooperation is also necessary to make a man good or better whether this consists only in the diminution of the obstacles or in a positive assistance the man     must previously make himself worthy to receive it and to accept this aid which is no small thing that is to adopt into his maxim the positive increase of power in which way alone it is possible that the good should be imputed to him and that he should be recognised as a good man now how it is possible that a man naturally bad should make himself a good man transcends all our conceptions for how can a bad tree bring forth good fruit but since it is already admitted that a tree originally good as to its capacities has brought forth bad fruit   and the fall from good to bad when it is considered that it arises from freedom is not more conceivable than a rising again from bad to good the possibility of the latter cannot be disputed for notwithstanding that fall the command we ought to become better men resounds with undiminished force in our soul consequently we must be able to do so even though what we ourselves can do should be insufficient of itself and though we should thereby only make ourselves susceptible of an inscrutable higher assistance it must however be presupposed that a germ of good has remained in its complete purity which could not be destroyed or corrupted—    a germ that certainly cannot be selflove   which when taken as the principle of all our maxims is in fact the source of all evil    the restoration of the original capacity for good in us is then not the acquisition of a lost spring towards good for this     which consists in respect for the moral law we could never lose and were it possible to do so we could never recover it it is then only the restoration of its purity as the supreme principle of all our maxims by which it is adopted into these not merely in combination with other springs or as subordinate to these the inclinations as conditions but in its entire purity as a spring sufficient of itself to determine the elective will the original good is holiness of maxims in following ones duty by which the man who adopts this purity into his maxims although he is not himself as yet on that account holy for there is still a long interval between maxim and act nevertheless is on the way to approximate to holiness by an endless progress firmness of purpose in following duty when it has become a habit is called also virtue as far as legality is concerned which is its empirical character virtus phenomenon it has then the steady maxim of conformity of actions to the law whatever may be the source of the spring required for this    hence virtue in this sense is gradually acquired and is described by some as a long practice in observing the law by which a man has passed from the propensity to vice by gradual reform of his conduct and     strengthening of his maxims into an opposite propensity this does not require any change of heart but only a change of morals a man regards himself as virtuous when he feels himself confirmed in the maxims of observance of duty although this be not from the supreme principle of all maxims but the intemperate man for instance returns to temperance for the sake of health the liar to truth for the sake of reputation the unjust man to common fairness for the sake of peace or of gain c all on the muchlauded principle of happiness but that a man should become not merely a legally but a morally good godpleasing man that is virtuous in his intelligible character virtus noumenon a man who when he recognises a thing as his duty needs no other spring than this conception of duty itself this is not to be effected by gradual reform as long as the principle of his maxims remains impure but requires a revolution in the mind a transition to the maxim of holiness of mind and he can only become a new man by a kind of new birth as it were by a new creation gospel of john iii   compared with gen i   and a change of heart but if a man is corrupt in the very foundation of his     maxims how is it possible that he should effect this revolution by his own power and become a good man of himself and yet duty commands it and duty commands nothing that is not practicable for us the only way this difficulty can be got over is that a revolution is necessary for the mental disposition but a gradual reform for the sensible temperament which opposes obstacles to the former and being necessary must therefore be possible that is when a man reverses the ultimate principle of his maxims by which he is a bad man by a single immutable resolution    and in so doing puts on a new man then so far he is in principle and disposition a subject susceptible of good but it is only in continued effort and growth that he is a good man that is he may hope with such purity of the principle that he has taken as the supreme maxim of his elective will and by its stability that he is on the good though narrow road of a constant progress from bad to better in the eyes of one who penetrates the intelligible principle of the heart of all maxims of elective will and to whom therefore this endless progress is a unity that is in the eyes of god this comes to the same as being actually a good man pleasing to him and in so far this change may be considered as a revolution but in the judgment of men who can estimate themselves and the strength of their maxims only by the superiority which they gain over sensibility in time it is only to be viewed as an ever continuing struggle for improvement in other words as a gradual reform of the perverse disposition the propensity to evil hence it follows that the moral culture of man must begin not with improvement in morals but with a transformation of the mind and the foundation of a character although men usually proceed otherwise and contend against vices singly leaving the general root of them untouched now even a man of the most limited intellect is capable of the impression of an increased respect for an action conformable to duty in proportion as he withdraws from it in thought all other springs which could have influenced the maxim of the action by means of selflove and even children are capable of finding out even the     least trace of a mixture of spurious springs of action in which case the action instantly loses all moral worth in their eyes this capacity for good is admirably cultivated by adducing the example of even good men good as regards their conformity to law and allowing ones moral pupils to estimate the impurity of many maxims from the actual springs of their actions    and it gradually passes over into the character so that duty simply of itself commences to acquire considerable weight in their hearts but to teach them to admire virtuous actions however great the sacrifice they may cost is not the right way to maintain the feeling of the pupil for moral good for however virtuous anyone may be all the good he can ever do is only duty and to do his duty is no more than to do what is in the common moral order and therefore does not deserve to be admired on the contrary this admiration is a lowering of our feeling for duty as if obedience to it were something extraordinary and meritorious there is however one thing in our soul which when we take a right view of it we cannot cease to regard with the highest astonishment and in regard to which admiration is right or even elevating and that is the original moral capacity in us generally what is that in us we may ask ourselves by which we who are constantly dependent on nature by so many wants are yet raised so far above it in the idea of an original capacity in us that we regard them all as nothing and ourselves as unworthy of existence if we were to indulge in their satisfaction in opposition to a law which our reason authoritatively prescribes although it is this enjoyment alone that can make life desirable while reason neither promises anything nor threatens the importance of this question must be deeply felt by every man of the most ordinary ability who has been previously instructed as to the holiness that lies in the idea of duty but who has not yet ascended to the investigation of the notion of freedom which first arises from this law      and even the incomprehensibility of this capacity a capacity which proclaims a     divine origin must rouse his spirit to enthusiasm and strengthen it for any sacrifices which respect for this duty may impose on him the frequent excitement of this feeling of the sublimity of a mans moral constitution is especially to be recommended as a means of awaking moral sentiments since it operates in direct opposition to the innate propensity to pervert the springs in the maxims of our elective will    and tends to make unconditional respect for the law the ultimate condition of the admission of all maxims and so restores the original moral subordination of the springs of action and the capacity for good in the human heart in its primitive purity but is not this restoration by ones own strength directly opposed to the thesis of the innate corruption of man for everything good undoubtedly as far as conceivability is concerned that is to say our discernment of its possibility just as with everything which has to be regarded as an event in time change and as such necessarily determined by laws of nature whilst its opposite must yet be regarded as possible by freedom in accordance with moral laws but it is not opposed to the possibility of this restoration itself for if the moral law commands that we shall now be better men it follows inevitably that we also can be better the thesis of innate evil has no application in dogmatic morality for its precepts contain the very same duties and continue in the same force whether there is in us an innate propensity     to transgression or not in the culture of morality this thesis has more significance but still it means no more than this that in the moral cultivation of the moral capacity for good created in us we cannot begin from a natural state of innocence but must start from the supposition of a depravity of the elective will in assuming maxims that are contrary to the original moral capacity and since the propensity thereto is ineradicable with an unceasing effort against it now as this only leads to a progress in infinitum from bad to better it follows that the transformation of the disposition of a bad into that of a good man is to be placed in the change of the supreme inner principle of all his maxims in accordance with the moral law provided that this new principle the new heart be itself immutable a man cannot however naturally attain the conviction that it is immutable either by immediate consciousness    or by the proof derived from the course of life he has hitherto pursued for the bottom of his heart the subjective first principle of his maxims is inscrutable to himself but unto the path that leads to it and which is pointed out to him by a fundamentally improved disposition he must be able to hope to arrive by his own efforts since he ought to become a good man and can only be esteemed morally good by virtue of that which can be imputed to him as done by himself now reason which is naturally disinclined to moral effort   0 opposes to this expectation of selfimprovement all sorts of corrupt ideas of religion under the pretext of natural impotence among which is to be reckoned attributing to god himself the adoption of the principle of happiness as the supreme condition of his commands now we may divide all religions into two classes—favourseeking religion mere worship and moral religion that is the religion of a good life by the former a man either flatters himself that god can make him eternally happy by remission of his demerits without his having any need to become a better man or if this does not seem possible to him that god can make him a better man without his having to do anything in the matter himself except to ask for it which as before an allseeing being asking is no more than wishing would in fact be doing nothing for if the mere wish were sufficient every man would be good but in the moral religion and amongst all the public religions that have ever existed the christian alone is moral it is a fundamental principle that everyone must do as much as lies in his power to become a better man and that it is only when he has not buried his innate talent luke xix      when he has used the original capacity for good so as to become a better man that he can hope that what is not in his power will be supplied by a higher cooperation but it is not absolutely necessary that man should know in what this cooperation consists  0 perhaps it is even inevitable that if the way in which it happens had been revealed at a certain time different men at another time should form different conceptions of it and that with all honesty but then the principle holds good it is not essential and therefore not necessary for everyone to know what god does or has done for his salvation but it is essential to know what he himself has to do in order to be worthy of this assistance       appendix i —on a supposed right to tell lies from benevolent motives   in the work called france for the year      part vi no   on political reactions by benjamin constant the following passage occurs p    — the moral principle that it is ones duty to speak the truth if it were taken singly and unconditionally would make all society impossible we have the proof of this in the very direct consequences which have been drawn from this principle by a german philosopher who goes so far as to affirm that to tell a falsehood to a murderer who asked us whether our friend of whom he was in pursuit had not taken refuge in our house would be a crime   the french philosopher opposes this principle in the following manner p    —it is a duty to tell the truth the notion of duty is inseparable from the notion of right a duty is what in one being corresponds to the right of another where there are no rights there are no duties to tell the truth then is a duty but only towards him who has a right to the truth but no man has a right to a truth that injures others the πρωˆτον ψενˆδος here lies in the statement that to tell the truth is a duty but only towards him who has a right to the truth it is to be remarked first that the expression to have a right to the truth is unmeaning we should rather say a man has a right     to his own truthfulness veracitas that is to subjective truth in his own person for to have a right objectively to truth would mean that as in meum and tuum generally it depends on his will whether a given statement shall be true or false which would produce a singular logic now the first question is whether a man—in cases where he cannot avoid answering yes or no—has the right to be untruthful the second question is whether in order to prevent a misdeed that threatens him or some one else he is not actually bound to be untruthful in a certain statement to which an unjust compulsion forces him truth in utterances that cannot be avoided is the formal duty of a man to everyone   however great the disadvantage that may arise from it to him or any other and although by making a false statement i do no wrong to him who unjustly compels me to speak yet i do wrong to men in general in the most essential point of duty so that it may be called a lie though not in the jurists sense that is so far as in me lies i cause that declarations in general find no credit and hence that all rights founded on contract should lose their force and this is a wrong which is done to mankind if then we define a lie merely as an intentionally false declaration towards another man we need not add that it must injure another as the jurists think proper to put in their definition mendacium est falsiloquium in præjudicium alterius for it always injures another if not another individual yet mankind generally since it vitiates the source of justice this benevolent lie may however by accident casus become punishable even by civil laws and that which escapes liability to punishment only by accident may be condemned as a wrong even by external laws for instance if you have by a lie hindered a man who is even now planning a murder you are legally responsible for all the consequences but if you have strictly adhered to the truth public justice can find no fault with you be the unforeseen consequence what it may it is possible that whilst you have honestly answered yes to the murderers question whether his intended victim is in the house the latter may have gone out unobserved     and so not have come in the way of the murderer and the deed therefore have not been done whereas if you lied and said he was not in the house and he had really gone out though unknown to you so that the murderer met him as he went and executed his purpose on him then you might with justice be accused as the cause of his death for if you had spoken the truth as well as you knew it perhaps the murderer while seeking for his enemy in the house might have been caught by neighbours coming up and the deed been prevented whoever then tells a lie however good his intentions may be must answer for the consequences of it even before the civil tribunal and must pay the penalty for them however unforeseen they may have been because truthfulness is a duty that must be regarded as the basis of all duties founded on contract the laws of which would be rendered uncertain and useless if even the least exception to them were admitted to be truthful honest in all declarations is therefore a sacred unconditional command of reason and not to be limited by any expediency m constant makes a thoughtful and sound remark on the decrying of such strict principles which it is alleged lose themselves in impracticable ideas and are therefore to be rejected p    —in every case in which a principle proved to be true seems to be inapplicable it is because we do not know the middle principle which contains the medium of its application he adduces p     the doctrine of equality as the first link forming the social chain p     namely that no man can be bound by any laws except those to the formation of which he has contributed in a very contracted society this principle may be directly applied and become the ordinary rule without requiring any middle principle but in a very numerous society we must add a new principle to that which we here state this middle principle is that the individuals may contribute to the formation of the laws either in their own person or by representatives whoever would try to apply the first principle to a numerous society without taking in the middle principle would infallibly bring about its destruction but this circumstance which would only show the ignorance or incompetence of the lawgiver would prove nothing against the principle itself he concludes p     thus a principle recognised as truth must therefore never be abandoned however obviously danger may seem to be involved in it and yet the good man himself abandoned the unconditional principle of veracity on account of the danger to society because he could not discover any middle     principle would serve to prevent this danger and in fact no such principle is to be interpolated here retaining the names of the persons as they have been here brought forward the french philosopher confounds the action by which one does harm nocet to another by telling the truth the admission of which he cannot avoid with the action by which he does him wrong lædit it was merely an accident casus that the truth of the statement did harm to the inhabitant of the house it was not a free deed in the juridicial sense for to admit his right to require another to tell a lie for his benefit would be to admit a claim opposed to all law every man has not only a right but the strictest duty to truthfulness in statements which he cannot avoid whether they do harm to himself or others he himself properly speaking does not do harm to him who suffers thereby but this harm is caused by accident for the man is not free to choose since if he must speak at all veracity is an unconditional duty the german philosopher will therefore not adopt as his principle the proposition p     it is a duty to speak the truth but only to him who has a right to the truth first on account of the obscurity of the expression for truth is not a possession the right to which can be granted to one and refused to another and next and chiefly because the duty of veracity of which alone we are speaking here makes no distinction between persons towards whom we have this duty and towards whom we may be free from it but is an unconditional duty which holds in all circumstances now in order to proceed from a metaphysic of right which abstracts from all conditions of experience to a principle of politics which implies these notions to cases of experience and by means of this to the solution of a problem of the latter in accordance with the general principle of right the philosopher will enunciate—  an axiom that is an apodictically certain proposition which follows directly from the definition of external right harmony of the freedom of each with the freedom of all by a universal law   a postulate of external public law as the united will of all on the principle of equality without which there could not exist the freedom of all   a problem how it is to be arranged that harmony may be maintained in a society however large on principles of freedom and equality namely by means of a representative system and this will then become a principle of the political system the establishment and arrangement of which will contain enactments which drawn from practical knowledge     of men have in view only the mechanism of administration of justice and how this is to be suitably carried out justice must never be accommodated to the political system but always the political system to justice a principle recognised as true i add recognised à priori and therefore apodictic must never be abandoned however obviously danger may seem to be involved in it says the author only here we must not understand the danger of doing harm accidentally but of doing wrong and this would happen if the duty of veracity which is quite unconditional and constitutes the supreme condition of justice in utterances were made conditional and subordinate to other considerations and although by a certain lie i in fact do no wrong to any person yet i infringe the principle of justice in regard to all indispensably necessary statements generally i do wrong formally though not materially and this is much worse than to commit an injustice to any individual because such a deed does not presuppose any principle leading to it in the subject the man who when asked whether in the statement he is about to make he intends to speak truth or not does not receive the question with indignation at the suspicion thus expressed towards him that he might be a liar but who asks permission first to consider possible exceptions is already a liar in potentia since he shows that he does not recognize veracity as a duty in itself but reserves exceptions from a rule which in its nature does not admit of exceptions since to do so would be selfcontradictory all practical principles of justice must contain strict truths and the principles here called middle principles can only contain the closer definition of their application to actual cases according to the rules of politics and never exceptions from them since exceptions destroy the universality an account of which alone they bear the name of principles ii —on the saying necessity has no law there is no casus necessitatis except in the case where an unconditional duty conflicts with a duty which though perhaps great is yet conditional e g if the question is about preserving the state from disaster by betraying a person who stands towards another in a relation such as for example that of father and son to save the     state from harm is an unconditional duty to save an individual is only a conditional duty namely provided he has not been guilty of a crime against the state the information given to the authorities may be given with the greatest reluctance but it is given under pressure namely moral necessity but if a shipwrecked man thrusts another from his plank in order to save his own life and it is said that he had the right of necessity i e physical necessity to do so this is wholly false for to maintain my own life is only a conditional duty viz if it can be done without crime but it is an unconditional duty not to take the life of another who does not injure me nay does not even bring me into peril of losing it however the teachers of general civil right proceed quite consistently in admitting this right of necessity for the sovereign power could not connect any punishment with the prohibition for this punishment would necessarily be death but it would be an absurd law that would threaten death to a man if when in danger he did not voluntarily submit to death—from das mag in der theorie richtig seyn u s w rosenkr vii p     the two cases here considered were probably suggested by cicero who quotes them from hecato a disciple of panætius—de off iii

kans first edition   the circumstances are worth recording here this friend had fallen into a fever in consequence of being abandoned by her betrothed lover to whom she was deeply attached she could not be induced to swallow the nauseous draughts prescribed for her and kants mother who nursed her having failed in her attempt at persuasion thought to succeed by setting the example of taking the medicine herself when she had done so she was seized with nausea and shivering and at the same time observing spots on her friends body which she took for feverspots or petechiæ her imagination was excited thinking that she had caught the infection she was seized with fever the same day and died a few days after   see an essay by the present writer on the theory of the tides in the philosophical magazine january    0 february      and january      and in the quarterly journal of mathematics march      and on the amount of the retardation hermathena      these essays have now been published in a volume kant subsequently thought of another cause which might operate in the opposite direction viz the condensation of the interior parts of the earth he did not however publish the suggestion   i do not suppose it likely that laplace should have seen kants anonymous book but it must be remembered that kant mentioned his theory in several publications and probably referred to it in his lectures   kant assumed too hastily that keplers third law applies to the particles of the ring which amounts to supposing that their mutual disturbances are negligible yet considering the form of the rings this is not a violent hypothesis   phys geogr p       wrights work was entitled an original theory or a new hypothesis of the universe founded on the laws of nature by thomas wright of durham london    0 it is singular that the speculations of this ingenious and original writer have been saved from oblivion in his own country by kant who was indebted for his knowledge of them to a german periodical prof de morgan has described wrights work at some length in the philosophical magazine for april      but de morgans attention was drawn to it by aragos notice in the annuaire for      and arago who had not seen the book only knew it through kants reference there is an account of wright in the gentlemans magazine p      vol      this suggestion of kants anticipated lamberts similar suggestion by six years   this conception is alluded to in the critique of practical reason p     humboldt erroneously identifies kants view of the nebulæ with that of lambert and halley cosmos sabines transl vol iii p       compare bishop butlers second sermon on the love of god where he speaks of viewing the scheme of the universe in the mind that projected it   quoted by kant from a german translation   this suggestion also has been lately developed in a popular manner as a novelty   in      he repeated the substance of it in the treatise der einsig mogliche beweisgrund zu einer demonstration des daseyns gottes he there mentions that the former work was comparatively little known as it had been published anonymously in      he caused an extract from it containing what he thought worth preserving to be appended to sommers translation of herschel on the structure of the heavens   this conjecture also has been confirmed   philos trans vol xvi a short time previously one dr lister propounded the singular theory that the trade winds were caused by the breath of the marine plant sargasso—ibid vol xiv   kant himself says that as far as he knew no previous writer had stated this principle and he was well read in such subjects at that time it had however been stated by geo hadley not sextant hadley in      phil trans vol xxxix pub      but hadleys paper attracted no attention and dalembert in his reflections on the causes of the winds      which obtained the prize offered by the berlin academy rejects the heat of the sun as a cause and makes all the phenomena depend on the attraction of the sun and moon in the french encyclopédie      nine years after kants paper thirty after hadleys this is combined with halleys theory and it is suggested further that the monsoons may be due to the melting of snow the exhalations from mountains c   not of mathematics as is sometimes stated the chair of mathematics was offered to kant but buck the professor of logic and metaphysics desired it and kant himself preferred the latter chair buck therefore became professor of mathematics and kant took his place   it may perhaps be interesting to note that both berkeley and hume produced their greatest philosophical works before the age of thirty fichte wrote his wissenschaftslehre at thirtythree on the other hand locke and reid whose object was like kants to raise a barrier against scepticism and to ascertain the extent and limits of the powers of the mind both published their first philosophical treatises after fifty   translated by mr bax in bohns library        before reading this work of kants i had made a remark to the same effect in sight and touch p    with reference to the statement of hamilton and others that sight is a modification of touch contact is usually understood to mean the approach of two bodies so that no space intervenes between them but in this sense there is probably no such thing as contact in nature physically speaking bodies in contact are only at such a distance that there is a sensible resistance to nearer approach sensation by contact then is sensation by resistance to say then that sight is a modification of touch is to say that the antecedent of vision is the exercise or feeling of the same repulsive force which is a physical hypothesis and considered as such is in fact absurd between ponderable substances and light contact in the sense just specified is either impossible or is the normal condition   translated by mr semple edinburgh      reissued        luthers translation   an interesting account of the last

of ethics page      rd ed page  0  in his third edition mr sidgwick appeals in defence of his view to kants statements in pp      of the present book the passage on p     was he remarks written ten years later but i think it will be found that in each of his hypothetical cases he does not deduce the maxim from the imperative what he does is to test the maxim by the imperative just as he might test an argument by the rules of syllogism   discourse on the attributes c ed      p  00   sidgwick method of ethics page   0  rd ed page     mr sidgwicks argument involves the assumption that the sum of human happiness is certainly known to exceed that of human misery even on his own statement a man who doubted or disbelieved this would be justified in adopting celibacy nay in the latter case he might regard it as a duty   kant appears to recognise this in the passage quoted p       for instance cicero de legibus argues that there is communio juris inter deos et homines dr adams in his celebrated sermon on the obligation of virtue like kant remarks that to found the obligation of virtue on any good affections or on a moral sense as this is generally understood is to make its nature wholly precarious to suppose that men might have been intelligent beings without such sentiments or with the very reverse so clarke had insisted that the eternal relations of things with their consequent fitnesses must appear the same to the understandings of all intelligent beings in fact this is a commonplace of english moralists   religion p  0   this has been recognised by philosophers of all periods who have not begun with a particular theory as to the origin of the idea and the principle thus to take only nonmetaphysical writers sir j herschel says it is our own immediate consciousness of effort which we exert to put matter in motion or to oppose and neutralize force which gives us this internal conviction of power and causation so far as it refers to the material world and compels us to believe that whenever we see material objects put in motion    it is in consequence of such an effort somehow exerted though not accompanied with our consciousness astronomy  0th ed sec     dubois reymond makes a similar statement deriving the principle from an irresistible tendency to personify it is somewhat singular that the philosophers who most strenuously deny that the principle of causality has any basis other than our observation of the phenomena of passive matter yet insist most strongly on extending it to those of active will   the word law is here used in two different senses on which see whatelys logic appendix art law   johann christian von wolf          was the author of treatises on philosophy mathematics c which were for a long time the standard textbooks in the german universities his philosophy was founded on that of leibnitz   the first proposition was that to have moral worth an action must be done from duty   a maxim is the subjective principle of volition the objective principle ie that which would also serve subjectively as a practical principle to all rational beings if reason had full power over the faculty of desire is the practical law   it might be here objected to me that i take refuge behind the word respect in an obscure feeling instead of giving a distinct solution of the question by a concept of the reason but although respect is a feeling it is not a feeling received through influence but is selfwrought by a rational concept and therefore is specifically distinct from all feelings of the former kind which may be referred either to inclination or fear what i recognise immediately as a law for me i recognise with respect this merely signifies the consciousness that my will is subordinate to a law without the intervention of other influences on my sense the immediate determination of the will by the law and the consciousness of this is called respect so that this is regarded as an effect of the law on the subject and not as the cause of it respect is properly the    conception of a worth which thwarts my selflove accordingly it is something which is considered neither as an object of inclination nor of fear although it has something analogous to both the object of respect is the law only and that the law which we impose on ourselves and yet recognise as necessary in itself as a law we are subjected to it without consulting selflove as imposed by us on ourselves it is a result of our will in the former aspect it has an analogy to fear in the latter to inclination respect for a person is properly only respect for the law of honesty c of which he gives us an example since we also look on the improvement of our talents as a duty we consider that we see in a person of talents as it were the example of a law viz to become like him in this by exercise and this constitutes our respect all socalled moral interest consists simply in respect for the law   compare the note to the preface to the critique of the practical reason p     a specimen of kants proposed application of the socratic method may be found in mr semples translation of the metaphysic of ethics p   0   just as pure mathematics are distinguished from applied pure logic from applied so if we choose we may also distinguish pure philosophy of morals metaphysic from applied viz applied to human nature by this designation we are also at once reminded that moral principles are not based on properties of human nature but must subsist à priori of themselves while from such principles practical rules must be capable of being deduced for every rational nature and accordingly for that of man   i have a letter from the late excellent sulzer in which he asks me what can be the reason that moral instruction although containing much that is convincing for the reason yet accomplishes so little my answer was postponed in order that i might make it complete but it is simply this that the teachers themselves have not got their own notions clear and when they endeavour to make up for this by raking up motives of moral goodness from every quarter trying to make their physic right strong they spoil it for the commonest understanding shows that if we imagine on the one hand an act of honesty done with steadfast mind apart from every view to advantage of any kind in this world or another and even under the greatest temptations of necessity or allurement and on the other hand a similar act which was affected in however low a degree by a foreign motive the former leaves far behind and eclipses the second it elevates the soul and inspires the wish to be able to act in like manner oneself even moderately young children feel this impression and one should never represent duties to them in any other light   the dependence of the desires on sensations is called inclination and this accordingly always indicates a want the dependence of a contingently determinable will on principles of reason is called an interest this therefore is found only in the case of a dependent will which does not always of itself conform to reason in the divine will we cannot conceive any interest but the human will can also take an interest in a thing without therefore acting from interest the former signifies the practical interest in the action the latter the pathological in the object of the action the former indicates only dependence of the will on principles of reason in themselves the second dependence on principles of reason for the sake of inclination reason supplying only the practical rules how the requirement of the inclination may be satisfied in the first case the action interests me in the second the object of the action because it is pleasant to me we have seen in the first section that in an action done from duty we must look not to the interest in the object but only to that in the action itself and in its rational principle viz the law   the word prudence is taken in two senses in the one it may bear the name of knowledge of the world in the other that of private prudence the former is a mans ability to influence others so as to use them for his own purposes the latter is the sagacity to combine all these purposes for his own lasting benefit this latter is properly that to which the value even of the former is reduced and when a man is prudent in the former sense but not in the latter we might better say of him that he is clever and cunning but on the whole imprudent compare on the difference between klug and gescheu here alluded to anthropologie §    ed schubert p   0   it seems to me that the proper signification of the word pragmatic may be most accurately defined in this way for sanctions see cr of pract reas p     are called pragmatic which flow properly not from the law of the states as necessary enactments but from precaution for the general welfare a history is composed pragmatically when it teaches prudence i e instructs the world how it can provide for its interests better or at least as well as the men of former time   i connect the act with the will without presupposing any condition resulting from any inclination but à priori and therefore necessarily though only objectively i e assuming the idea of a reason possessing full power over all subjective motives this is accordingly a practical proposition which does not deduce the willing of an action by mere analysis from another already presupposed for we have not such a perfect will but connects it immediately with the conception of the will of a rational being as something not contained in it   a maxim is a subjective principle of action and must be distinguished from the objective principle namely practical law the former contains the practical rule set by reason according to the conditions of the subject often its ignorance or its inclinations so that it is the principle on which the subject acts but the law is the objective principle valid for every rational being and is the principle on which it ought to act that is an imperative   i have no doubt that den in the original before imperativ is a misprint for der and have translated accordingly mr semple has done the same the editions that i have seen agree in reading den and m barni so translates with this reading it is the conformity that presents the imperative as necessary   it must be noted here that i reserve the division of duties for a future metaphysic of morals so that i give it here only as an arbitrary one in order to arrange my examples for the rest i understand by a perfect duty one that admits no exception in favour of inclination and then i have not merely external but also internal perfect duties this is contrary to the use of the word adopted in the schools but i do not intend to justify it here as it is all one for my purpose whether it is admitted or not perfect duties are usually understood to be those which can be enforced by external law imperfect those which cannot be enforced they are also called respectively determinate and indeterminate officia juris and officia virtutis   on suicide cf further metaphysik der sitten p       kant distinguishes hang propensio from neigung inclinatio as follows—hang is a predisposition to the desire of some enjoyment in other words it is the subjective possibility of excitement of a certain desire which precedes the conception of its object when the enjoyment has been experienced it produces a neigung inclination to it which accordingly is defined habitual sensible desire—anthropologie §§       religion p      to behold virtue in her proper form is nothing else but to contemplate morality stripped of all admixture of sensible things    and of every spurious ornament of reward or selflove how much she then eclipses everything else that appears charming to the affections every one may readily perceive with the least exertion of his reason if it be not wholly spoiled for abstraction   this proposition is here stated as a postulate the grounds of it will be found in the concluding section   let it not be thought that the common quod tibi non vis fieri c could serve here as the rule or principle for it is only a deduction from the former though with several limitations it cannot be a universal law for it does not contain the principle of duties to oneself nor of the duties of benevolence to others for many a one would gladly consent that others should not benefit him provided only that he might be excused from showing benevolence to them nor finally that of duties of strict obligation to one another for on this principle the criminal might argue against the judge who punishes him and so on   i may be excused from adducing examples to elucidate this principle as those which have already been used to elucidate the categorical imperative and its formula would all serve for the like purpose here   cp critical examination of practical reason p       the reading maxime which is that both of rosenkranz and hartenstein is obviously an error for materie   teleology considers nature as a kingdom of ends ethics regards a possible kingdom of ends as a kingdom of nature in the first case the kingdom of ends is a theoretical idea adopted to explain what actually is in the latter it is a practical idea adopted to bring about that which is not yet but which can be realised by our conduct namely if it conforms to this idea   i read allgemeines instead of allgemeinem   i class the principle of moral feeling under that of happiness because every empirical interest promises to contribute to our wellbeing by the agreeableness that a thing affords whether it be immediately and without a view to profit or whether profit be regarded we must likewise with hutcheson class the principle of sympathy with the happiness of others under his assumed moral sense   gesetzt—there is in the original a play on the etymology of gesetz which does not admit of reproduction in english it must be confessed that without it the statement is not selfevident   i adopt this method of assuming freedom merely as an idea which rational beings suppose in their actions in order to avoid the necessity of proving it in its theoretical aspect also the former is sufficient for my purpose for even though the speculative proof should not be made out yet a being that cannot act except with the idea of freedom is bound by the same laws that would oblige a being who was actually free thus we can escape here from the onus which presses on the theory compare butlers treatment of the question of liberty in his analogy part i ch vi   interest means a spring of the will in so far as this spring is presented by reason see note p  0   the common understanding being here spoken of i use the word idea in its popular sense   the verb is wanting in the original   the punctuation of the original gives the following sense submits his causality as regards its external determination to laws of nature i have ventured to make what appears to be a necessary correction by simply removing a comma   m barni translates as if he read desselben instead of derselben the causality of this will so also mr semple   interest is that by which reason becomes practical ie a cause determining the will hence we say of rational beings only that they take an interest in a thing irrational beings only feel sensual appetites reason takes a direct interest in action then only when the universal validity of its maxims is alone sufficient to determine the will such an interest alone is pure but if it can determine the will only by means of another object of desire or on the suggestion of a particular feeling of the subject then reason takes only an indirect interest in the action and as reason by itself without experience cannot discover either objects of the will or a special feeling actuating it this latter interest would only be empirical and not a pure rational interest the logical interest of reason namely to extend its insight is never direct but presupposes purposes for which reason is employed   reading einer for seiner   lest any one should imagine that he finds an inconsistency here when i call freedom the condition of the moral law and hereafter maintain in the treatise itself that the moral law is the condition under which we can first become conscious of freedom i will merely remark that freedom is the ratio essendi of the moral law while the moral law is the ratio cognoscendi of freedom for had not the moral law been previously distinctly thought in our reason we should never consider ourselves justified in assuming such a thing as freedom although it be not contradictory but were there no freedom it would be impossible to trace the moral law in ourselves at all   the union of causality as freedom with causality as rational mechanism the former established by the moral law the latter by the law of nature in the same subject namely man is impossible unless we conceive him with reference to the former as a being in himself and with reference to the latter as a phenomenon—the former in pure consciousness the latter in empirical consciousness otherwise reason inevitably contradicts itself   a reviewer who wanted to find some fault with this work has hit the truth better perhaps than he thought when he says that no new principle of morality is set forth in it but only a new formula but who would think of introducing a new principle of all morality and making himself as it were the first discoverer of it just as if all the world before him were ignorant what duty was or had been in thoroughgoing error but whoever knows of what importance to a mathematician a formula is which defines accurately what is to be done to work a problem will not think that a formula is insignificant and useless which does the same for all duty in general   probably professor garve see kants das mag in der theorie richtig seyn etc werke vol vii p       it might also have been objected to me that i have not first defined the notion of the faculty of desire or of the feeling of pleasure although this reproach would be unfair because this definition might reasonably be presupposed as given in psychology however the definition there given might be such as to found the determination of the faculty of desire on the feeling of pleasure as is commonly done and thus the supreme principle of practical philosophy would be necessarily made empirical which however remains to be proved and in this critique is altogether refuted i will therefore give this definition here in such a manner as it ought to be given in order to leave this contested point open at the beginning as it should be life is the faculty a being has of acting according to laws of the faculty of desire the faculty of desire is the beings faculty of becoming by means of its ideas the cause of the actual existence of the objects of these ideas pleasure is the idea of the agreement of the object or the action with the subjective conditions of life ie with the faculty of causality of an idea in respect of the actuality of its object or with the determination of the forces of the subject to the action which produces it     i have no further need for the purposes of this critique of notions borrowed from psychology the critique itself supplies the rest it is easily seen that the question whether the faculty of desire is always based on pleasure or whether under certain conditions pleasure only follows the determination of desire is by this definition left undecided for it is composed only of terms belonging to the pure understanding ie of categories which contain nothing empirical such precaution is very desirable in all philosophy and yet is often neglected namely not to prejudge questions by adventuring definitions before the notion has been completely analysed which is often very late it may be observed through the whole course of the critical philosophy of the theoretical as well as the practical reason that frequent opportunity offers of supplying defects in the old dogmatic method of philosophy and of correcting errors which are not observed until we make such rational use of these notions viewing them as a whole   i am more afraid in the present treatise of occasional misconception in respect of some expressions which i have chosen with the greatest care     in order that the notion to which they point may not be missed thus in the table of categories of the practical reason under the title of modality the permitted and forbidden in a practical objective point of view possible and impossible have almost the same meaning in common language as the next category duty and contrary to duty here however the former means what coincides with or contradicts a merely possible practical precept for example the solution of all problems of geometry and mechanics the latter what is similarly related to a law actually present in the reason and this distinction is not quite foreign even to common language although somewhat unusual for example it is forbidden to an orator as such to forge new words or constructions in a certain degree this is permitted to a poet in neither case is there any question of duty for if anyone chooses to forfeit his reputation as an orator no one can prevent him we have here only to do with the distinction of imperatives into problematical assertorial and apodictic similarly in the note in which i have compared the moral ideas of practical perfection in different philosophical schools i have distinguished the idea of wisdom from that of holiness although i have stated that essentially and objectively they are the same but in that place i understand by the former only that wisdom to which man the stoic lays claim therefore i take it subjectively as an attribute alleged to belong to man perhaps the expression virtue with which also the stoic made great show would better mark the characteristic of his school the expression of a postulate of pure practical reason might give most occasion to misapprehension in case the reader confounded it with the signification of the postulates in pure mathematics which carry apodictic certainty with them these however postulate the possibility of an action the object of which has been previously recognised à priori in theory as possible and that with perfect certainty but the former postulates the possibility of an object itself god and the immortality of the soul from apodictic practical laws and therefore only for the purposes of a practical reason this certainty of the postulated possibility then is not at all theoretic and consequently not apodictic that is to say it is not a known necessity as regards the object but a necessary supposition as regards the subject necessary for the obedience to its objective but practical laws it is therefore merely a necessary hypothesis i could find no better expression for this rational necessity which is subjective but yet true and unconditional   names that designate the followers of a sect have always been accompanied with much injustice just as if one said n is an idealist for although he not only admits but even insists that our ideas of external things have actual objects of external things corresponding to them yet he holds that the form of the intuition does not depend on them but on the human mind n is clearly kant himself   the original has pure an obvious error   literally to have a firm seat in any saddle it may be noted that kants father was a saddler   not in the original text   propositions which in mathematics or physics are called practical ought properly to be called technical for they have nothing to do with the determination of the will they only point out how a certain effect is to be produced and are therefore just as theoretical as any propositions which express the connexion of a cause with an effect now whoever chooses the effect must also choose the cause   the

result   the original has objects objecte which makes no sense i have therefore ventured to correct it   besides this the expression sub ratione boni is also ambiguous for it may mean we represent something to ourselves as good when and because we desire will it or we desire something because we represent it to ourselves as good so that either the desire determines the notion of the object as a good or the notion of good determines the desire the will so that in the first case sub ratione boni would mean we will something under the idea of the good in the second in consequence of this idea which as determining the volition must precede it   the english language marks the distinction in question though not perfectly evil is not absolutely restricted to moral evil we speak also of physical evils but certainly when not so qualified it applies usually as an adjective perhaps exclusively to moral evil bad is more general but when used with a word connoting moral qualities it expresses moral evil for example a bad man a bad scholar these words are etymologically the same as the german übel and böse respectively good is ambiguous being opposed to bad as well as to evil but the corresponding german word is equally ambiguous   rosenkranz text has law—certainly an error gesetz for gefühl hartenstein corrects it   for the meaning of this expression see the critique of pure

hartenstein adopts jenes   the original sentence is incomplete i have completed it in what seems the simplest way   if we examine accurately the notion of respect for persons as it has been already laid down we shall perceive that it always rests on the consciousness of a duty which an example shows us and that respect therefore can never have any but a moral ground and that it is very good and even in a psychological point of view very useful for the knowledge of mankind that whenever we use this expression we should attend to this secret and marvellous yet often recurring regard which men in their judgment pay to the moral law   this law is in striking contrast with the principle of private happiness which some make the supreme principle of morality this would be expressed thus love thyself above everything and god and thy neighbour for thine own sake   compare butler—though we should suppose it impossible for particular affections to be absolutely coincident with the moral principle and consequently should allow that such creatures    would for ever remain defectible yet their danger of actually deviating from right may be almost infinitely lessened and they fully fortified against what remains of it—if that may be called danger against which there is an adequate effectual security—analogy fitzgeralds ed p  00   what renders this discussion not irrelevant is the fact that the german language like the english possesses but oneword to express ϕιλεɩ̂ν ἀγαπα̂ν and ἐρα̂ν the first ϕιλεɩ̂ν expresses the love of affection the general goodwill due from man to man had no name in classical greek it is described in one aspect of it by aristotle as ϕιλία ἄνεν πἀτους καὶ τονˆ στέργειν eth nic iv     elsewhere however he calls it simply ϕιλία viii      the verb ἀγαπάω was used by the lxx in the precept quoted in the text though elsewhere they employed it as  ἐρα̂ν but in the new test the verb and with it the noun ἀγάπη which is not found in classical writers were appropriated to this state of mind aristotle it may be observed uses ἀγαπάω of love to ones own better part ix     ἐρα̂ν does not occur in the new test at all butlers sermons on love of our

unconditioned meiklejohn p       rosenkranz erroneously reads unbedingt unconditioned and musste for müsste   the original has not und but als which does not give any satisfactory sense i have therefore adopted hartensteins emendation which seems at least to give the meaning intended   see preface p     note   it seems nevertheless impossible for a creature to have the conviction of his unwavering firmness of mind in the progress towards goodness on this account the christian religion makes it come only from the same spirit that works sanctification that is this firm purpose and with it the consciousness of steadfastness  in the moral progress but naturally one who is conscious that he has persevered through a long portion of his life up to the end in the progress to the better and this from genuine moral motives may well have the comforting hope though not the certainty that even in an existence prolonged beyond this life he will continue steadfast in these principles and although he is never justified here in his own eyes nor can ever hope to be so in the increased perfection of his nature to which he looks forward together with an increase of duties nevertheless in this progress which though it is directed to a goal infinitely remote yet is in gods sight regarded as equivalent to possession he may have a prospect of a blessed future for this is the word that reason employs to designate perfect wellbeing independent on all contingent causes of the world and which like holiness is an idea that can be contained only in an endless progress and its totality and consequently is never fully attained by a creature  the ὐπομονή of the n t   the original has a supreme nature natur however almost invariably means physical nature therefore hartenstein supplies the words cause of before nature more probably natur is a slip for ursache cause   it is commonly held that the christian precept of morality has no advantage in respect of purity over the moral conceptions of the stoics the distinction between them is however very obvious the stoic system made the consciousness of strength of mind the pivot on which all moral dispositions should turn and although its disciples spoke of duties and even defined them very well yet they placed the spring and proper determining principle of the will in an elevation of the mind above the lower springs of the senses which owe their power only to weakness of mind with them therefore virtue was a sort of heroism in the wise man who raising himself above the animal nature of man is sufficient for himself and while he prescribes duties to others is himself raised above them and is not subject to any temptation to transgress the moral law all this however they could not have done if they had conceived this law in all its purity and strictness as the precept of the gospel does when i give the name idea to a perfection to which nothing adequate can be given in experience it does not follow that the moral ideas are something transcendent that is something of which we could not even determine the concept adequately or of which it is uncertain whether there is any object corresponding to it at all   0 as is the case with the ideas of speculative reason on the contrary being types of practical perfection they serve as the indispensable rule of conduct and likewise as the standard of comparison now if i consider christian morals on their philosophical side then compared with the ideas of the greek schools they would appear as follows the ideas of the cynics the epicureans the stoics and the christians are simplicity of nature prudence wisdom and holiness in respect of the way of attaining them the greek schools were distinguished from one another thus that the cynics only required common sense the others the path of science but both found the mere use of natural powers sufficient for the purpose christian morality because its precept is framed as a moral precept must be so pure and unyielding takes from man all confidence that he can be fully adequate to it at least in this life but again sets it up by enabling us to hope that if we act as well as it is in our power to do then what is not in our power will come in to our aid from another source whether we know how this may be or not aristotle and plato differed only as to the origin of our moral conceptions see preface p     note   the word sanction is here used in the technical german sense which is familiar to students of history in connexion with the pragmatic sanction   in order to make these characteristics of these conceptions clear i add the remark that whilst we ascribe to god various attributes the quality of which we also find applicable to creatures only that in him they are raised to the highest degree eg power knowledge presence goodness c under the designations of omnipotence omniscience omnipresence c there are three that are ascribed to god exclusively and yet without the addition of greatness and which are all moral he is the only holy the only blessed the only wise because these conceptions already imply the absence of limitation in the order of these attributes he is also the holy lawgiver and creator the good governor and preserver and the just judge three attributes which include everything by which god is the object of religion and in conformity with which the metaphysical perfections are added of themselves in the reason   that the ambiguity of the word subject may not mislead the reader it may be remarked that it is here used in the psychological sense subjectum legis not subjectus legi   absent from the original text   this remarks as well as the following note applies to the etymological form of the german word which is godlearned learning is properly only the whole content of the historical sciences consequently it is only the teacher of revealed theology that can be called a learned theologian godlearned if however we choose to call a man learned who is in possession of the rational sciences mathematics and philosophy although even this would be contrary to the signification of the word which always counts as learning only that which one must be learned taught and which therefore he cannot discover of himself by reason even in that case the philosopher would make too poor a figure with his knowledge of god as a positive science to let himself be called on that account a learned man   but even here we should not be able to allege a requirement of reason if we had not before our eyes a problematical but yet inevitable conception of reason namely that of an absolutely necessary being this conception now seeks to be defined and this in addition to the tendency to extend itself is the objective ground of a requirement of speculative reason namely to have a more precise definition of the conception of a necessary being which is to serve as the first cause of other beings so as to make these  latter knowable by some means without such antecedent necessary problems there are no requirements—at least not of pure reason—the rest are requirements of inclination  i read diese with the ed of      rosenkranz and hartenstein both read dieses this being   in the deutsches museum february      there is a dissertation by a very subtle and clearheaded man the late wizenmann whose early death is to be lamented in which he disputes the right to argue from a want to the objective reality of its object and illustrates the point by the example of a man in love who having fooled himself into an idea of beauty which is merely a chimera of his own brain would fain conclude that such an object really exists somewhere   0 i quite agree with him in this in all cases where the want is founded on inclination which cannot necessarily postulate the existence of its object even for the man that is affected by it much less can it contain a demand valid for everyone and therefore it is merely a subjective ground of the wish but in the present case we have a want of reason springing from an objective determining principle of the will namely the moral law which necessarily binds every rational being and therefore justifies him in assuming à priori in nature the conditions proper for it and makes the latter inseparable from the complete practical use of reason it is a duty to realize the summum bonum to the utmost of our power therefore it must be possible consequently it is unavoidable for every rational being in the world to assume what is necessary for its objective possibility the assumption is as necessary as the moral law in connexion with which alone it is valid   read wie for die   it is quite proper to extol actions that display a great unselfish sympathizing mind or humanity but in this case we must fix attention not so much on the elevation of soul which is very fleeting and transitory as on the subjection of the heart to duty from which a more enduring impression may be expected because this implies principle whereas the former only implies ebullitions one need only reflect a little and he will always find a debt that he has by some means incurred towards the human race even if it were only this that by the inequality of men in the civil constitution he enjoys advantages on account of which others must be the more in want which will prevent the thought of duty from being repressed by the selfcomplacent imagination of merit   weisheitslehre vernacular german for philosophy see p  0    to this definition it has been objected that it comes to nothing as soon as we abstract from external conditions of the result of the desire yet even to the idealist the appetitive faculty is something although to him the external world is nothing answer is there not such a thing as an earnest longing which yet we are conscious is in vain ex gr would to god that man were still living and which though it leads to no deed is yet not without results and has a powerful effect not indeed on outward things but within the subject himself making him ill a desire being an effort nisus to be by means of ones ideas a cause still even though the subject perceives the inadequacy of these to produce the desired effect is always a causality at least within the subject what causes the mistake here is this that since the consciousness of our power generally in the given case is at the same time a consciousness of our powerlessness in respect to the outer world the definition is not applicable to the idealist although as here we are speaking only of the relation of a cause the idea to the effect feeling the causality of the idea in respect of its object whether that causality be internal or external must inevitably be included in the conception of the appetitive faculty—rechtslehre anhang to second edition p   0   we might define sensibility as the subjective element in our ideas for it is the understanding that first refers the ideas to an object i e it alone thinks somewhat by means thereof now the subjective element of our idea may be of such a kind that it can also be referred to an object as contributory to the knowledge of it either as to the form or the matter being called in the former case intuition in the latter sensation in this case sensibility which is the susceptibility to the idea in question is sense or again the subjective element of the idea may be such that it cannot become a piece of knowledge inasmuch as it contains merely the relation of this idea to the subject and nothing that is useful for the knowledge of the object and in this case this susceptibility to the idea is called feeling which contains the effect of the idea whether sensible or intellectual on the subject and this belongs to the sensibility even though the idea itself may belong to the understanding or the reason   this important distinction is here explicitly made for the first time in the earlier treatises the word wille covers both significations in writing the kritik kant saw that much confusion of thought was traceable to the use of the same word for two very different things and in that treatise he sometimes uses willkühr his use of the term is of course his own in the last treatise in the present volume the word wille occurs only once or twice in default of an english word suitable to be appropriated to the signification of kants willkühr i have adopted the compound term elective will reserving rational will for wille although the distinction has not been fixed in appropriate terms it has been felt and more or less obscurely indicated by many moralists indeed it is implied in s pauls epistle to the romans ch vii where for instance in v    the subject of θέλω is i as wille while that of ποιωˆ is i as willkühr compare the words of kant on the corrupt heart coexisting with the good wille p       when philosophy as containing principles of the rational knowledge of things through concepts not merely as logic does principles of the form of thought in general without distinction of its objects is divided into theoretical and practical this is quite right but then the concepts which assign to the principles of this rational knowledge their object must be specifically distinct otherwise they would not justify a division which always presupposes a contrast of the principles of the rational knowledge belonging to the different parts of a science now there are only two kinds of concepts and these admit as many distinct principles of possibility of their object namely physical concepts and the concept of freedom now as the former make possible a theoretical knowledge on à priori principles whereas in respect of these the latter only conveys in its concept a negative principle that of mere contrast while on the other hand it establishes principles for the determination of the will which therefore are called practical hence philosophy is rightly divided into two parts with quite distinct principles—the theoretical which is natural philosophy and the practical which is moral philosophy for so we name the practical legislation of reason according to the concept of freedom hitherto however there has prevailed a gross misuse of these expressions in the division of the different principles and consequently also of philosophy inasmuch as what is practical according to physical concepts has been assumed to be of the same kind as what is practical according to the concept of freedom and thus with the same denominations of theoretical and practical philosophy a division is made by which nothing is really divided since both parts might have principles of the same kind—kritik der urtheilskraft einl p     the deduction of the division of a system that is the proof of its completeness as well as of its continuity namely that the transition from the notion divided to each member of the division in the whole series of subdivisions does not take place per saltum is one of the most difficult tasks of the constructor of a system it is even difficult to say what is the ultimate notion of which right and wrong fas aut nefas are divisions it is the act of free choice in general so teachers of ontology begin with the notions of something and nothing without being aware that these are already members of a division of a higher notion which is not given but which in fact can only be the notion of an object in general   the original has natural the emendation which is clearly necessary was suggested to me by mr philip sandford   one who is acquainted with practical philosophy is not therefore a practical philosopher the latter is he who makes the rational end the principle of his actions while at the same time he joins with this the necessary knowledge which as it aims at action must not be spun out into the most subtle threads of metaphysic unless a legal duty is in question in which case meum and tuum must be accurately determined in the balance of justice     on the principle of equality of action and reaction which requires something like mathematical proportion but not in the case of a mere ethical duty for in this case the question is not only to know what it is a duty to do a thing which on account of the ends that all men naturally have can be easily decided but the chief point is the inner principle of the will namely that the consciousness of this duty be also the spring of action in order that we may be able to say of the man who joins to his knowledge this principle of wisdom that he is a practical philosopher   compare the remarks of dr adams the pleasures of selfapprobation and esteem which follow virtue certainly arise from a conscious sense of having made virtue and not pleasure our choice not from preferring one interest or pleasure to another but from acting according to right without any other consideration whatsoever it seems essential to this pleasure that no motive of interest have any part in the choice or intention of the agent and   to make this pleasure an object to the mind the virtue whose principle we are seeking after must be already formed for let it be observed that the pleasures we are speaking of are themselves virtuous pleasures such as none but virtuous minds are capable of proposing to themselves or of enjoying to the sensual or voluptuous the pleasures that arise from denying our appetites or passions have no existence these cannot therefore be the motive to that virtue which is already presupposed    it is the same love of virtue which makes it first the object of our pursuit and when acquired the subject of our triumph and joy to do a virtuous action for the sake of these virtuous pleasures is to choose virtue for the sake of being virtuous which is to rest in it as an end or to pursue it without regard to any other object or interest—sermon on the obligation of virtue      note     the essay referred to is that on the radical evil in human nature   man however as at the same time a moral being when he considers himself objectively which he is qualified to do by his pure practical reason ie according to humanity in his own person finds himself holy enough to transgress the law only unwillingly for there is no man so depraved who in this transgression would not feel a resistance and an abhorrence of himself so that he must put a force on himself it is impossible to explain the phenomenon that at this parting of the ways where the beautiful fable places hercules between virtue and sensuality man shows more propensity to obey inclination than the law for we can only explain what happens by tracing it to a cause according to physical laws but then we should not be able to conceive the elective will as free now this mutually opposed selfconstraint and the inevitability of it makes us recognize the incomprehensible property of freedom   the less a man can be physically forced and the more he can be morally forced by the mere idea of duty so much the freer he is the man for example who is of sufficiently firm resolution and strong mind not to give up an enjoyment which he has resolved on however much loss is shown as resulting therefrom and who yet desists from his purpose unhesitatingly though very reluctantly when he finds that it would cause him to neglect an official duty or a sick father this man proves his freedom in the highest degree by this very thing that he cannot resist the voice of duty   leonhard cochius court preacher who obtained the prize of the berlin academy for his essay über die neigungen berlin        object first ed   usage gives it a

for him—clarkes discourse etc p editor illegible number ed        this agrees with dr adams definition of virtue which he says implies trial and conflict he defines it the conformity of imperfect beings to the dictates of reason other english moralists use virtue in the sense of aristotles ἀρετή hence a difference more verbal than real as to the relation of virtue to selfdenial   kant here and elsewhere uses deduction in a technical legal sense there is deductio facti and deductio juris kants deduction is exclusively the latter   the supreme principle of jurisprudence is act externally so that the free use of thy elective will may not interfere with the freedom of any man so far as it agrees with universal law—rechtslehre p      so that one might vary two wellknown lines of haller

vitium est modus in rebus c medium tenuere beati virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum—contain a poor sort of wisdom which has no definite principles for this mean between two extremes who will assign it for me avarice as a vice is not distinguished from frugality as a virtue by merely being the latter pushed too far but has a quite different principle maxim namely placing the end of economy not in the enjoyment of ones means but in the mere possession of them renouncing enjoyment just as the vice of prodigality is not to be sought in the excessive enjoyment of ones means but in the bad maxim which makes the use of them without regard to their maintenance the sole end   the assertion that we should do nothing either too little or too much means nothing for it is tautological what is it to do too much answer—more than is right what is it to do too little answer—to do less than is right what is the meaning of i ought to do something or leave it undone answer—it is not right against duty to do more or less than is right if that is the wisdom for which we must go back to the ancients to aristotle as if they were nearer the source we have chosen ill in turning to their oracle between truth and falsehood which are contradictories there is no mean there may be however between frankness and reserve which are contraries in the case of the man who declares his opinion all that he says is true but he does not say all the truth now it is very natural to ask the moral teacher to point out to me this mean this however he cannot do for both duties have a certain latitude in their application and the right thing to do can only be decided by the judgment according to rules of prudence pragmatical rules not those of morality moral rules that is to say not as strict duty officium strictum but as indeterminate officium latum hence the man who follows the principles of virtue may indeed commit a fault peccatum in his practice in doing more or less than prudence prescribes but adhering strictly to these principles he does not commit a vice vitium and the verse of horace—   insani sapiens nomen ferat æquus iniqui   ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam— literally understood is fundamentally false but perhaps sapiens here means only a prudent man who does not form a chimerical notion of virtuous perfection this perfection being an ideal demands approximation to this end but not the complete attainment of it which surpasses human powers and introduces absurdity chimerical imagination into its principle for to be quite too virtuous that is to be quite too devoted to duty would be about the same as to speak of making a circle quite too round or a straight line quite too straight—tugendlehre p     note   in a footnote kant

pejor avis tulit   nos nequiores mox daturos   progeniem vitiosiorem   horatius     one of rousseaus earliest literary efforts was on this subject which had been proposed for discussion by the academy of dijon he defended the thesis that the advance in science and arts was not favourable to morals kants own view is stated thus in the treatise das mag in der theorie u s w publ in      he is commenting on mendelssohn who had treated lessings hypothesis of a divine education of mankind as a delusion saying that the human race never made a few steps forward without presently after slipping back with redoubled velocity into its former position this says kant is like the stone of sisyphus and this view makes the earth a sort of purgatory for old and forgotten sins he proceeds thus i shall venture to assume that as the human race is constantly advancing in respect of culture as it is designed to do so also as regards the moral end of its existence it is constantly progressing and this progress is never broken off although it may be sometimes interrupted it is not necessary for me to prove this it is for those who take the opposite view to prove their case viz because it is my duty to strive to promote this improvement p     many proofs too may be given that the human race on the whole especially in our own as compared with all preceding times has made considerable advances morally for the better temporary checks do not prove anything against this and that the cry of the continuallyincreasing degradation of the race arises just from this that when one stands on a higher step of morality he sees further before him and his judgment on what men are as compared with what they ought to be is more strict our selfblame is consequently more severe the more steps of morality we have already ascended in the whole course of the worlds history as known to us p       that the primary subjective source of the adoption of moral maxims is inscrutable may be seen even from this that as this adoption is free its source the reason why ex gr i have adopted a bad and not rather a good maxim must not be looked for in any natural impulse but always again in a maxim and as this also must have its ground and maxims are the only determining principles of the free elective will that can or ought to be adduced we are always driven further back ad infinitum in the series of subjective determining principles without being able to reach the primary source   if good  a its contradictory is the notgood this is the result either of the mere absence of a principle of good  0 or of a positive principle of the opposite   a in the latter case the notgood may be called the positively bad in respect of pleasure and pain there is a mean of this kind so that pleasure  a pain   a

latter would be merely the result of the absence of a moral spring  a  0 but the law is in us as a spring  a therefore the want of harmony of the elective will with it  0 is only possible as a result of a really opposite determination of elective will that is a resistance to it   a that is to say only by a bad elective will there is therefore no mean between a bad and a good disposition inner principle of maxims by which the morality of the action must be determined a morally indifferent action adiaphoron morale would be an action resulting merely from natural laws and standing therefore in no relation to the moral law which is a law of freedom inasmuch as it is not a deed and in respect of it neither command nor prohibition nor even legal permission has any place or is necessary   professor schiller in his masterly treatise thalia      pt   on pleasantness grace and dignity in morals finds fault with this way of presenting obligation as if it implied a carthusian spirit but as we are agreed in the most important principles i cannot admit that there is any disagreement in this if we could only come to a mutual understanding i admit that i cannot associate any pleasantness with the conception of duty just because of its dignity for it involves unconditional obligation which is directly contrary to pleasantness the majesty of the law like that on sinai inspires not dread which repels nor yet a charm which invites to familiarity but awe which awakes respect of the subject for his lawgiver and in the present case the latter being within ourselves a feeling of the sublimity of our own destiny which attracts us more than any beauty but virtue i e the firmlyrooted disposition to fulfil our duty punctually is in its results beneficent also more than anything in the world that can be done by nature or art and the noble picture of humanity exhibited in this form admits very well the accompaniments of the graces but as long as duty alone is in question they keep at a respectful distance if however we regard the pleasant results which virtue would spread in the world if it found access everywhere then morallydirected reason draws the sensibility into play by means of the imagination    it is only after vanquishing monsters that hercules becomes musagetes before which labour those good sisters draw back these companions of venus urania are lewd followers of venus dione as soon as they interfere in the business of the determination of duty and want to supply the springs thereof if it is now asked of what sort is the emotional characteristic the temperament as it were of virtue is it spirited and cheerful or anxiously depressed and dejected an answer is hardly necessary the latter slavish spirit can never exist without a secret hatred of the law and cheerfulness of heart in the performance of ones duty not complacency in the recognition of it is a mark of the genuineness of the virtuous disposition even in devoutness which does not consist in the selftormenting of the penitent sinner which is very ambiguous and commonly is only an inward reproach for having offended against the rules of prudence but in the firm purpose to do better in the future which animated by good progress must produce a cheerful spirit without which one is never certain that he has taken a liking to good that is to say adopted it into his maxim   the ancient moral philosophers who nearly exhausted all that can be said about virtue have not omitted to consider the two questions above mentioned the first they expressed thus whether virtue must be learned so that man is by nature indifferent to it and vice the second was whether there is more than one virtue in other words whether it is possible that a man should be partly virtuous and partly vicious to both they replied with rigorous decision in the negative and justly for they contemplated virtue in itself as an idea of the reason as man ought to be but if we are to form a moral judgment of this moral being man in appearance that is as we learn to know him by experience then we may answer both questions in the affirmative for then he is estimated not by the balance of pure reason before a divine tribunal but by an empirical standard before a human judge we shall treat further of this in the sequel   this must not be considered as contained in the conception of the preceding but must necessarily be regarded as a special capacity for it does not follow that because a being has reason this includes a faculty of determining the elective will unconditionally by the mere conception of the qualification of its maxims to be universal laws so as to be of itself practical at least so far as we can see    the most rational being in the world might still have need of certain springs coming to him from objects of inclination to determine his elective will and might apply to these the most rational calculation both as regards the greatest sum of the springs and also as to the means of attaining the object determined thereby without every suspecting the possibility of anything like the moral law issuing its commands absolutely and which announces itself as a spring and that the highest were this law not given in us we should not be able to find it out as such by reason or to talk the elective will into it and yet this law is the only one that makes us conscious of the independence of our elective will on determination by any other springs our freedom and at the same time of the imputability of our actions   propensity hang is properly only the predisposition to the desire of an enjoyment which when the subject has had experience of it produces an inclination to it thus all uncivilized men have a propensity to intoxicating things for although many of them are not acquainted with intoxication so that they cannot have any desire for things that produce it one need only let them once try such things to produce an almost inextinguishable desire for them between propensity and inclination which presupposes acquaintance with the object is instinct which is a felt want to do or enjoy something of which one has as yet no conception such as the mechanical instinct in animals or the sexual impulse there is a still further step in the faculty of desire beyond inclination namely passions not affections for these belong to the feeling of pleasure and displeasure which are inclinations that exclude selfcontrol   hearnes journey from prince of wales fort in hudsons bay to the northern ocean in        london        as the perpetual war between the athapescaw and the dog rib indians which has no other object than slaughter bravery in war is the highest virtue of savages in their opinion even in a state of civilization it is an object of admiration and a ground of the peculiar respect demanded by that profession in which this is the only merit and this not altogether without good reason for that a man can have something that he values more than life and which he can make his object namely honour renouncing all selfinterest proves a certain sublimity in his nature but we see by the complacency with which conquerors extol their achievements massacre unsparing butchery c that it is only their own superiority and the destruction they can effect without any other object in which they properly take satisfaction   compare stewart active and moral powers bk i ch iii sec   who gives an optimist explanation of this saying   if we look at the history of these merely as a phenomenon of the inner nature of man which is in great part concealed from us we may become aware of a certain mechanical process of nature directed to ends which are not those of the nations but of nature as long as any state has another near it which it can hope to subdue it endeavours to aggrandize itself by the conquest striving thus to attain universal monarchy—a constitution in which all freedom would be extinguished and with it virtue taste and sciences which are its consequences    but this monster in which all laws gradually lose their force after it has swallowed up its neighbours finally dissolves of itself and by rebellion and discord is divided into several smaller states which instead of endeavouring to form a statesunion a republic of free united nations begin the same game over again each for itself so that war that scourge of the human race may not be allowed to cease war indeed is not so incurably bad as the deadness of a universal monarchy or even a union of nations to ensure that despotism shall not be discontinued in any state yet as an ancient observed it makes more bad men than it takes away compare on this subject kants essay zum ewigen frieden werke vii thl

adding that he knew the price of each   the proper proof of this condemnation pronounced by the morally judging reason is not contained in this section but in the preceding this contains only the confirmation of it by experience which however could never discover the root of the evil in the supreme maxim of free elective will in relation to the law this being an intelligible act which is antecedent to all experience from this that is from the unity of the supreme maxim the law to which it refers being one it may also be seen why in forming a purely intellectual judgment of men the principle of exclusion of a mean between good and bad must be assumed whereas in forming the empirical judgment from sensible acts actual conduct the principle may be assumed that there is a mean between these extremes on one side a negative mean of indifference previous to all cultivation and on the other side a positive mean of mixture so as to be partly good and partly bad but the latter is only an estimation of the morality of man in appearance and is in the final judgment subject to the former   the three socalled higher faculties would explain this inheritance each in its own way namely as a hereditary malady or hereditary guilt or hereditary sin   the medical faculty would regard hereditary evil as something like the tapeworm respecting which some naturalists are actually of opinion that as it is not found in any element outside us nor of the same kind in any other animal it must have been present in our first parents   the legal faculty would regard it as the legitimate consequence of entering on an inheritance left to us by them but burdened with a heavy crime for to be born is nothing else but to obtain the use of the goods of earth so far as they are indispensable to our subsistence we must therefore pay the debt expiate and shall in the end be dispossessed by death right legally   the theological faculty would view this evil as a personal participation of our first parents in the revolt of a reprobate rebel either that we though now unconscious of it did then cooperate in it ourselves    or that now being born under his dominion as prince of this world we prefer its goods to the command of the heavenly ruler and have not loyalty enough to tear ourselves from them for which we must hereafter share his lot with him   as long as the moral law is not allowed the predominance in ones maxims above all other determining principles of the elective will as the spring sufficient of itself all profession of respect for it is feigned and the propensity to this is inward falsehood that is a propensity to deceive ones self to the prejudice of the moral law in interpreting it iii   on which account the bible christian part calls the author of evil residing in ourselves the liar from the beginning and thus characterizes man in respect of what appears to be the main principle of evil in him   rom v    vulgate luthers version is correct jerome also gives the correct interpretation although he retains the in quo of the old version probably this was meant by the original translator as a literal rendering of the greek ἐϕ editor illegible character in that   it is a very common supposition of moral philosophy that it is very easy to explain the existence of moral evil in man namely that it arises from the strength of the sensible springs of action on the one hand and the feebleness of the rational spring respect for the law on the other that is from weakness but in that case it should be still easier to explain the moral good in man in his moral capacity for one cannot be conceived to be comprehensible without the other but the faculty of reason to become master over all opposing springs of action by the mere idea of the law is absolutely inexplicable it is then equally incomprehensible how the sensible springs can become masters of a reason which commands with such authority for if all the world acted according to the precept of the law it would be said that everything was going on in the natural order and it would not occur to anyone to inquire the cause—religion c pp       note   these remarks must not be regarded as intended to be an interpretation of scripture—a thing that lies outside the province of mere reason we explain the manner in which a moral use may be made of a historical statement without deciding whether this was the meaning of the writer or whether we only introduce it provided only that it is true in itself without needing any historical proof and that it is at the same time the only way in which we can derive something for our own improvement from a passage of scripture which would otherwise be only an unprofitable addition to our historical knowledge we must not without necessity contend about the historical authority of a matter which whether it be understood in this way or in that does not help us to become better men  0 when what does help can and must be known without historical proof historical knowledge which has no such inner reference that can hold good for every man belongs to the adiaphora with respect to which everyone may judge as he finds most edifying for himself   in the first edition this appears simply as no v   the tree that is good as to its capacities is not yet so in fact for if it were so it certainly could not bring forth bad fruit it is only when the man has adopted into his maxim the spring which is placed in him for the moral law that he is called a good man the tree is then absolutely a good tree   words that admit of two totally different senses often retard conviction for a long time when the principles are perfectly clear love in general and selflove in particular may be divided into that of good will and that of complacency benevolentiœ et complacentiœ and both as is evident must be rational it is natural to adopt the former into ones maxim for who would not wish that it should always fare well with himself it is rational inasmuch as in the first place in respect of the end only that is chosen which is consistent with the greatest and most lasting welfare and in the next as the most fitting means are chosen for each of these elements of happiness reason here occupies the place of a minister to natural inclination and the maxim which is assumed on that account has no reference whatever to morality if however it is made the unconditional principle of choice then it is the source of an immeasurably great conflict with morality now a rational love of complacency in ones self may either be understood thus that we have complacency in the abovementioned maxims directed to the satisfaction of natural inclinations so far as that end is attained by following them and then it is the same thing as complacency towards ones self one is pleased with ones self as a merchant whose trading speculations succeed and who congratulates himself on his insight in respect of the maxims he has adopted but the maxim of selflove of unconditional complacency in ones self not depending on gain or loss as the results of the action would be the inward principle of a satisfaction which is only possible to us on condition of the subordination of our maxims to the moral law no man to whom morality is not indifferent can have complacency in himself or indeed can be free from a bitter dissatisfaction with himself who is conscious of maxims that do not agree with the moral law within we might call this rational selflove which prevents him from mixing with the springs of his will any other causes of satisfaction drawn from the consequences of his actions under the name of happiness to be procured thereby now as the latter indicates unconditional respect for the law why should a difficulty be put in the way of the clear understanding of the principle by using the expression a rational selflove which is moral only on the condition just mentioned whereby we are involved in a circle    for a man can love himself in a moral way only so far as he is conscious that his maxim is to make respect for the law the supreme spring of his will for us as beings dependent on objects of the sensibility happiness is by our physical nature the first and unconditional object of our desire but if we give the name of nature in general to all that is innate in us then as beings endowed with reason and freedom happiness is by our nature far from being the first or unconditional object of our maxims this character belongs to worthiness of happiness that is the coincidence of all our maxims with the moral law herein consists the whole precept of morality that this is the objective condition under which alone the wish for the former can coincide with the legislation of reason and the moral character consists in the state of mind which admits only such a conditional wish   that the conception of freedom of the elective will does not precede the consciousness of the moral law in us but is only inferred from the determinability of our will by this law as an unconditional command anyone may readily be convinced    by asking himself whether he is immediately certain of a faculty enabling him by firmness of purpose to overcome every motive to transgression however powerful phalaris licet imperet ut sis falsus et admoto dictet perjuria tauro everyone must confess that he does not know whether in such a case he would not be shaken in his purpose nevertheless duty commands him unconditionally thou shalt remain true to it and hence he justly concludes that he must also be able and that accordingly his will is free those who fullaciously represent this inscrutable property as quite comprehensible create an illusion by the word determinism the thesis that the elective will is determined by internal sufficient reasons as if the difficulty consisted in reconciling this with freedom which no one supposes the difficulty is how predeterminism by which voluntary actions as events have their determining causes in preceding time which with what it contains is no longer in our power can be consistent with freedom by which both the action itself and its opposite must be in the power of the subject at the moment of its taking place this is what men want to discern and never will be able to discern there is no difficulty in reconciling the conception of freedom with the idea of god as a necessary being for freedom does not consist in the contingency of the action that it is not determined by reasons at all that is not in indeterminism that it must be equally possible for god to do good or evil if his action is to be called free but in absolute spontaneity which alone is endangered by predeterminism which places the determining principle of the action in preceding time so that the action is now no longer in my power but in the hands of nature and i am irresistibly determined and since succession in time is not to be conceived in god this difficulty disappears   there is appended in the original a long note first added in the second edition on the relation between the preceding general remark and the corresponding remarks appended to the other
