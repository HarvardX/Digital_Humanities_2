the nature of the kingdom or church of christ  a sermon preached before the king at the royal chapel at st jamess on sunday march          by the right reverend father in god benjamin lord bishop of bangor  published by his majestys special command  london printed for james knapton at the crown and timothy child at the white heart in st pauls churchyard mdccxvii  st john xviii    jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world one of those great effects which length of time is seen to bring along with it is the alteration of the meaning annexed to certain sounds the signification of a word well known and understood by those who first made use of it is very insensibly varied by passing through many mouths and by being taken and given by multitudes in common discourse till it often comes to stand for a complication of notions as distant from the original intention of it nay as contradictory to it as darkness is to light the ignorance and weakness of some and the passions and bad designs of others are the great instruments of this evil which even when it seems to affect only indifferent matters ought in reason to be opposed as it tends in it is nature to confound mens notions in weightier points but when it has once invaded the most sacred and important subjects ought in duty to be resisted with a more open and undisguised zeal as what touches the very vitals of all that is good and is just going to take from mens eyes the boundaries of right and wrong  the only cure for this evil in cases of so great concern is to have recourse to the originals of things to the law of reason in those points which can be traced back thither and to the declarations of jesus christ and his immediate followers in such matters as took their rise solely from those declarations for the case is plainly this that words and sounds have had such an effect not upon the nature of things which is unmovable but upon the minds of men in thinking of them that the very same word remaining which at first truly represented one certain thing by having multitudes of new inconsistent ideas in every age and every year added to it becomes it self the greatest hindrance to the true understanding of the nature of the thing first intended by it  for instance religion in st jamess days was virtue and integrity as to our selves and charity and beneficence to others before god even the father ja i    by degrees it is come to signify in most of the countries throughout the whole world the performance of every thing almost except virtue and charity and particularly a punctual exactness in a regard to particular times places forms and modes diversified according to the various humors of men recommended and practiced under the avowed name of external religion two words which in the sense fixed upon them by many christians god has put asunder and which therefore no man should join together and accordingly the notion of a religious man differs in every country just as much as times places ceremonies imaginary austerities and all other outward circumstances are different and various whereas in truth tho a man truly religious in other respects may make use of such things yet they cannot be the least part of his religion properly so called any more than his food or his raiment or any other circumstance of his life  thus likewise the worship of god to be paid by christians was in our saviors time and in his own plain words the worship of the father in spirit and truth and this declared to be one great end proposed in the christian dispensation the hour comes and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeks such to worship him john iv    but the notion of it is become quite another thing and in many christian countries that which still retains the name of the worship of god is indeed the neglect and the diminution of the father and the worship of other beings besides and more than the father and this performed in such a manner as that any indifferent spectator would conclude that neither the consciences nor understandings of men neither spirit nor truth were at all concerned in the matter or rather that they had been banished from it by an express command in the mean time the word or sound still remains the same in discourse the whole lump of indigested and inconsistent notions and practices every thing that is solemnly said or done when the worship of god is professed is equally covered under that general name and by the help of using the same original word passes easily for the thing it self again  prayer in all our lords directions about it and particularly in that form which he himself taught his followers was a calm undisturbed address to god under the notion of a father expressing those sentiments and wishes before him which every sincere mind ought to have but the same word by the help of men and voluminous rules of art is come to signify heat and flame in such a manner and to such a degree that a man may be in the best disposition in the world and yet not be devout enough to pray and many an honest person hat been perplexed by this means with doubts and fears of being incapable of praying for want of an intenseness of heat which has no more relation to the duty than a mans being in a fever has to the sincerity of his professions or addresses to any earthly prince  once more the love of god and of our savior was at first in his own words and those of st john many times repeated the keeping his commandments or doing his will joh             chapter     0 i joh     chapter     ii joh   but the notion of it was it seems left very jejune and so has been improved by his later followers till the same name still kept up in the language of christians is far removed from the thing principally and first intended and is come by degrees to signify a violent passion commotion and ecstasy venting it self in such sort of expressions and disorders as other passions do and this regulated and defined by such a variety of imaginations that an ordinary christian with the utmost sincerity in his heart is filled with nothing but eternal suspicions doubts and perplexities whether he has any thing of the true love of god or not  i have mentioned these particulars not only to show the evil it self and to how great a degree the nature of things has suffered in the opinions of men by the alteration of the sense of the same words and sounds but to give you occasion to observe that there can be no cure for it in christians but to go back to the new testament it self because there alone we shall find the original intention of such words or the nature of the things designed to be signified by them declared and fixed by our lord or his apostles from him by some such marks as may if we will attend to them guide and guard us in our notions of those matters in which we are most of all concerned  it is with this view that i have chosen those words in which our lord himself declared the nature of his own kingdom this kingdom of christ is the same with the church of christ and the notion of the church of christ which at first was only the number small or great of those who believed him to be the messiah or of those who subjected themselves to him as their king in the affair of religion having since that time been so diversified by the various alterations it has undergone that it is almost impossible so much as to number up the many inconsistent images that have come by daily additions to be united together in it nothing i think can be more useful than to consider the same thing under some other image which has not been so much used nor consequently so much defaced and since the image of his kingdom is that under which our lord himself chose to represent it we may be sure that if we sincerely examine our notion of his church by what he says of his kingdom that it is not of this world we shall exclude out of it every thing that he would have excluded and then what remains will be true pure and uncorrupted and what i have to say in order to this will be comprehended under two general heads  i as the church of christ is the kingdom of christ he himself is king and in this it is implied that he is himself the sole lawgiver to his subjects and himself the sole judge of their behavior in the affairs of conscience and eternal salvation and in this sense therefore his kingdom is not of this world that he has in those points left behind him no visible humane authority no vicegerents who can be said properly to supply his place no interpreters upon whom his subjects are absolutely to depend no judges over the consciences or religion of his people for if this were so that any such absolute vicegerent authority either for the making new laws or interpreting old ones or judging his subjects in religious matters were lodged in any men upon earth the consequence would be that what still retains the name of the church of christ would not be the kingdom of christ but the kingdom of those men vested with such authority for whoever has such an authority of making laws is so far a king and whoever can add new laws to those of christ equally obligatory is as truly a king as christ himself is nay whoever has an absolute authority to interpret any written or spoken laws it is he who is truly the lawgiver to all intents and purposes and not the person who first wrote or spoke them  in humane society the interpretation of laws may of necessity be lodged in some cases in the hands of those who were not originally the legislators but this is not absolute nor of bad consequence to society because the legislators can resume the interpretation into their own hands as they are witnesses to what passes in the world and as they can and will sensibly interpose in all those cases in which their interposition becomes necessary and therefore they are still properly the legislators but it is otherwise in religion or the kingdom of christ he himself never interposeth since his first promulgation of his law either to convey infallibility to such as pretend to handle it over again or to assert the true interpretation of it amidst the various and contradictory opinions of men about it if he did certainly thus interpose he himself would still be the legislator but as he does not if such an absolute authority be once lodged with men under the notion of interpreters they then become the legislators and not christ and they rule in their own kingdom and not in his  it is the same thing as to rewards and punishments to carry forward the great end of his kingdom if any men upon earth have a right to add to the sanctions of his laws that is to increase the number or alter the nature of the rewards and punishments of his subjects in matters of conscience or salvation they are so far kings in his stead and reign in their own kingdom and not in his so it is whenever they erect tribunals and exercise a judgment over the consciences of men and assume to themselves the determination of such points as cannot be determined but by one who knows the hearts or when they make any of their own declarations or decisions to concern and affect the state of christs subjects with regard to the favor of god this is so far the taking christs kingdom out of his hands and placing it in their own  nor is this matter at all made better by their declaring themselves to be vicegerents or lawmakers or judges under christ in order to carry on the ends of his kingdom for it comes to this at last since it does not seem fit to christ himself to interpose so as to prevent or remedy all their mistakes and contradictions that if they have this power of interpreting or adding laws and judging men in such a sense that christians shall be indispensably and absolutely obliged to obey those laws and to submit to those decisions i say if they have this power lodged with them then the kingdom in which they rule is not the kingdom of christ but of themselves he does not rule in it but they and whether they happen to agree with him or to differ from him as long as they are the lawgivers and judges without any interposition from christ either to guide or correct their decisions they are kings of this kingdom and not christ jesus  if therefore the church of christ be the kingdom of christ it is essential to it that christ himself be the sole lawgiver and sole judge of his subjects in all points relating to the favor or displeasure of almighty god and that all his subjects in what station soever they may be are equally subjects to him and that no one of them any more than another has authority either to make new laws for christs subjects or to impose a sense upon the old ones which is the same thing or to judge censure or punish the servants of another master in matters relating purely to conscience or salvation if any person has any other notion either through a long use of words with inconsistent meanings or through a negligence of thought let him but ask himself whether the church of christ be the kingdom of christ or not and if it be whether this notion of it does not absolutely exclude all other legislators and judges in matters relating to conscience or the favor of god or whether it can be his kingdom if any mortal men have such a power of legislation and judgment in it this enquiry will bring us back to the first which is the only true account of the church of christ or the kingdom of christ in the mouth of a christain that it is the number of men whether small or great whether dispersed or united who truly and sincerely are subjects to jesus christ alone as their lawgiver and judge in matters relating to the favor of god and their eternal salvation  ii the next principal point is that if the church be the kingdom of christ and this kingdom be not of this world this must appear from the nature and end of the laws of christ and of those rewards and punishments which are the sanctions of his laws now his laws are declarations relating to the favor of god in another state after this they are declarations of those conditions to be performed in this world on our part without which god will not make us happy in that to come and they are almost all general appeals to the will of that god to his nature known by the common reason of mankind and to the imitation of that nature which must be our perfection the keeping his commandments is declared the way to life and the doing his will the entrance into the kingdom of heaven the being subjects to christ is to this very end that we may the better and more effectually perform the will of god the laws of this kingdom therefore as christ left them have nothing of this world in their view no tendency either to the exaltation of some in worldly pomp and dignity or to their absolute dominion over the faith and religious conduct of others of his subjects or to the erecting of any sort of temporal kingdom under the covert and name of a spiritual one  the sanctions of christs law are rewards and punishments but of what sort not the rewards of this world not the offices or glories of this state not the pains of prisons banishments fines or any lesser and more moderate penalties nay not the much lesser negative discouragements that belong to humane society he was far from thinking that these could be the instruments of such a persuasion as he thought acceptable to god but as the great end of his kingdom was to guide men to happiness after the short images of it were over here below so he took his motives from that place where his kingdom first began and where it was at last to end from those rewards and punishments in a future state which had no relation to this world and to show that his kingdom was not of this world all the sanctions which he thought fit to give to his laws were not of this world at all  st paul understood this so well that he gives an account of his own conduct and that of others in the same station in these words knowing the terrors of the lord we persuade men whereas in too many christian countries since his days if some who profess to succeed him were to give an account of their own conduct it must be in a quite contrary strain knowing the terrors of this world and having them in our power we do not persuade men but force their outward profession against their inward persuasion  now wherever this is practiced whether in a great degree or a small in that place there is so far a change from a kingdom which is not of this world to a kingdom which is of this world as soon as ever you hear of any of the engines of this world whether of the greater or the lesser sort you must immediately think that then and so far the kingdom of this world takes place for if the very essence of gods worship be spirit and truth if religion be virtue and charity under the belief of a supreme governor and judge if true real faith cannot be the effect of force and if there can be no reward where there is no willing choice then in all or any of these cases to apply force or flattery worldly pleasure or pain is to act contrary to the interests of true religion as it is plainly opposite to the maxims upon which christ founded his kingdom who chose the motives which are not of this world to support a kingdom which is not of this world and indeed it is too visible to be hid that wherever the rewards and punishments are changed from future to present from the world to come to the world now in possession there the kingdom founded by our savior is in the nature of it so far changed that it is become in such a degree what he professed his kingdom was not that is of this world of the same sort with other common earthly kingdoms in which the rewards are worldly honors posts offices pomp attendance dominion and the punishments are prisons fines banishments galleys and racks or something less of the same sort  if these can be the true supports of a kingdom which is not of this world then sincerity and hypocrisy religion and no religion force and persuasion a willing choice and a terrified heart are become the same things truth and falsehood stand in need of the same methods to propagate and support them and our savior himself was little acquainted with the right way of increasing the number of such subjects as he wished for if he had but at first enlightened the powers of this world as he did st paul and employed the sword which they bore and the favors they had in their hands to bring subjects into his kingdom this had been an expeditious and an effectual way according to the conduct of some of his professed followers to have had a glorious and extensive kingdom or church but this was not his design unless it could be compassed in quite a different way  and therefore when you see our lord in his methods so far removed from those of many of his disciples when you read nothing in his doctrine about his own kingdom of taking in the concerns of this world and mixing them with those of eternity no commands that the frowns and discouragements of this present state should in any case attend upon conscience and religion no rules against the enquiry of all his subjects into his original message from heaven no orders for the kind and charitable force of penalties or capital punishments to make men think and choose aright no calling upon the secular arm whenever the magistrate should become christian to enforce his doctrines or to back his spiritual authority but on the contrary as plain a declaration as a few words can make that his kingdom is not of this world i say when you see this from the whole tenor of the gospel so vastly opposite to many who take his name into their mouths the question with you ought to be whether he did not know the nature of his own kingdom or church better than any since his time whether you can suppose he left any such matters to be decided against himself and his own express professions and whether if an angel from heaven should give you any account of his kingdom contrary to what he himself has done it can be of any weight or authority with christians  i have now made some such observations drawn from the church being the kingdom of christ and not of any men in that kingdom from the nature of his laws and from those rewards and punishments which are the sanctions of those laws as lead us naturally into the true notion of the church or kingdom of christ by excluding out of it every thing inconsistent with his being king lawgiver and judge as well as with the nature of his laws and of his promises and threatenings i will only make two or three observations grounded upon this and so conclude and    from what has been said it is very plain in general that the grossest mistakes in judgment about the nature of christ s kingdom or church have arisen from hence that men have argued from other visible societies and other visible kingdoms of this world to what ought to be visible and sensible in his kingdom constantly leaving out of their notion the most essential part of it that christ is king in his own kingdom forgetting this king himself because he is not now seen by mortal eyes and substituting others in his place as lawgivers and judges in the same points in which he must either alone or not at all be lawgiver and judge not contented with such a kingdom as he established and desires to reign in but urging and contending that his kingdom must be like other kingdoms whereas he has positively warned them against any such arguings by assuring them that this kingdom is his kingdom and that it is not of this world and therefore that no one of his subjects is lawgiver and judge over others of them in matters relating to salvation but he alone and that we must not frame our ideas from the kingdoms of this world of what ought to be in a visible and sensible manner in his kingdom    from what has been said it appears that the kingdom of christ which is the church of christ is the number of persons who are sincerely and willingly subjects to him as lawgiver and judge in all matters truly relating to conscience or eternal salvation and the more close and immediate this regard to him is the more certainly and the more evidently true it is that they are of his kingdom this may appear fully to their own satisfaction if they have recourse to him himself in the gospel if they think it a sufficient authority that he has declared the conditions of their salvation and that no man upon earth has any authority to declare any other or to add one tittle to them if they resolve to perform what they see he laith a stress upon and if they trust no mortal with the absolute direction of their consciences the pardon of their sins or the determining of their interest in gods favor but wait for their judge who alone can bring to light the hidden things of darkness  if they feel themselves disposed and resolved to receive the words of eternal life from himself to take their faith from what he himself once delivered who knew better than all the rest of the world what he required of his own subjects to direct their worship by his rule and their whole practice by the general law which he laid down if they feel themselves in this disposition they may be very certain that they are truly his subjects and members of his kingdom nor need they envy the happiness of others who may think it a much more evident mark of their belonging to the kingdom of christ that they have other lawgivers and judges in christs religion besides jesus christ that they have recourse not to his own words but the words of others who profess to interpret them that they are ready to submit to this interpretation let it be what it will that they have set up to themselves the idol of an unintelligible authority both in belief and worship and practice in words under jesus christ but in deed and in truth over him as it removes the minds of his subjects from himself to weak and passionate men and as it claims the same rule and power in his kingdom which he himself alone can have but    this will be another observation that it evidently destroys the rule and authority of jesus christ as king to set up any other authority in his kingdom to which his subjects are indispensably and absolutely obliged to submit their consciences or their conduct in what is properly called religion there are some professed christians who contend openly for such an authority as indispensably obliges all around them to unity of profession that is to profess even what they do not what they cannot believe to be true this sounds so grossly that others who think they act a glorious part in opposing such an enormity are very willing for their own sakes to retain such an authority as shall oblige men whatever they themselves think though not to profess what they do not believe yet to forbear the profession and publication of what they do believe let them believe it of never so great importance  both these pretensions are founded upon the mistaken notion of the peace as well as authority of the kingdom that is the church of christ which of them is the most insupportable to an honest and a christian mind i am not able to say because they both equally found the authority of the church of christ upon the ruins of sincerity and common honesty and mistake stupidity and sleep for peace because they would both equally have prevented all reformation where it has been and will for ever prevent it where it is not already and in a word because both equally divest jesus christ of his empire in his own kingdom set the obedience of his subjects loose from himself and teach them to prostitute their consciences at the feet of others who have no right in such a manner to trample upon them  the peace of christs kingdom is a manly and reasonable peace built upon charity and love and mutual forbearance and receiving one another as god receives us as for any other peace founded upon a submission of our honesty as well as our understandings it is falsely so called it is not the peace of the kingdom of christ but the lethargy of it and a sleep unto death when his subjects shall throw off their relation to him fix their subjection to others and even in cases where they have a right to see and where they think they see his will otherwise shall shut their eyes and go blindfold at the command of others because those others are not pleased with their enquiries into the will of their great lord and judge  to conclude the church of christ is the kingdom of christ he is king in his own kingdom he is sole lawgiver to his subjects and sole judge in matters relating to salvation his laws and sanctions are plainly fixed and relate to the favor of god and not at all to the rewards or penalties of this world all his subjects are equally his subjects and as such equally without authority to alter to add to or to interpret his laws so as to claim the absolute submission of others to such interpretation and all are his subjects and in his kingdom who are ruled and governed by him their faith was once delivered by him the conditions of their happiness were once laid down by him the nature of gods worship was once declared by him and it is easy to judge whether of the two is most becoming a subject of the kingdom of christ that is a member of his church to seek all these particulars in those plain and short declarations of their king and lawgiver himself or to hunt after them through the infinite contradictions the numberless perplexities the endless disputes of weak men in several ages till the enquirer himself is lost in the labyrinth and perhaps sits down in despair or infidelity if christ be our king let us show our selves subjects to him alone in the great affair of conscience and eternal salvation and without fear of mans judgment live and act as becomes those who wait for the appearance of an allknowing and impartial judge even that king whose kingdom is not of this world  finis
