thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  hoc vero occultum intestinum domesticum malum non modo non existit verum etiam opprimit antequam perspicere atque explorare potueris cic london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxx  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents it is an undertaking of some degree of delicacy to examine into the cause of public disorders if a man happens not to succeed in such an enquiry he will be thought weak and visionary if he touches the true grievance there is a danger that he may come near to persons of weight and consequence who will rather be exasperated at the discovery of their errors than thankful for the occasion of correcting them if he should be obliged to blame the favorites of the people he will be considered as the tool of power if he censures those in power he will be looked on as an instrument of faction but in all exertions of duty something is to be hazarded in cases of tumult and disorder our law has invested every man in some sort with the authority of a magistrate when the affairs of the nation are distracted private people are by the spirit of that law justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere they enjoy a privilege of somewhat more dignity and effect than that of idle lamentation over the calamities of their country they may look into them narrowly they may reason upon them liberally and if they should be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the mischief and to suggest any probable method of removing it though they may displease the rulers for the day they are certainly of service to the cause of government government is deeply interested in every thing which even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness may tend finally to compose the minds of the subject and to conciliate their affections i have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people but as long as reputation the most precious possession of every individual and as long as opinion the great support of the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to government nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation the operation of both is in truth merely instrumental nations are governed by the same methods and on the same principles by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are his equals or his superiors by a knowledge of their temper and by a judicious management of it i mean when ever public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted not when government is nothing but a continued scussle between the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one and some times the other is uppermost in which they alternately yield and prevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous submissions the temper of the people amongst whom he presides ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman and the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impossible for him to attain if he has not an interest in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn  to complain of the age we live in to murmur at the present possessors of power to lament the past to conceive extravagant hopes of the future are the common dispositions of the greatest part of mankind indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar such complaints and humors have existed in all times yet as all times have not been alike true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint which only characterizes the general infirmity of human nature from those which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and season  nobody i believe will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment if i say that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture there is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language that government is at once dreaded and contemned that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors that their inaction is a subject of ridicule and their exertion of abhorrence that rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world have lost their reverence and effect that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy that our dependencies are slackened in their affection and loosened from their obedience that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce that hardly any thing above or below abroad or at home is sound and entire but that disconnection and confusion in offices in parties in families in parliament in the nation prevail beyond the disorders of any former time these are facts universally admitted and lamented  this state of things is the more extraordinary because the great parties which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a manner entirely dissolved no great external calamity has visited the nation no pestilence or famine we do not labor at present under any scheme of taxation new or oppressive in the quantity or in the mode nor are we engaged in unsuccessful war in which our misfortunes might easily pervert our judgment and our minds sore from the loss of national glory might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government  it is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should not sometimes become a subject of discourse it is a compliment due and which i willingly pay to those who administer our affairs to take notice in the first place of their speculation our ministers are of opinion that the increase of our trade and manufactures that our growth by colonization and by conquest have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some individuals and this again being dispersed amongst the the people has rendered them universally proud ferocious and ungovernable that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth and the boldness of others from a guilty poverty have rendered them capable of the most atrocious attempts so that they have trampled upon all subordination and violently born down the unarmed laws of a free government barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierce and licentious as ours they contend that no adequate provocation has been given for so spreading a discontent our affairs having been conducted throughout with remarkable temper and consummate wisdom the wicked industry of some libellers joined to the intrigues of a few disappointed politicians have in their opinion been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation  nothing indeed can be more unnatural than the present convulsions of this country if the above account be a true one i confess i shall assent to it with great reluctance and only on the compulsion of the clearest and firmest proofs because their account resolves itself into this short but discouraging proposition that we have a very good ministry but that we are a very bad people that we set ourselves to bite the hand that feeds us that with a malignant insanity we oppose the measures and ungratefully vilify the pergratefully vilify the persons of those whose sole object is our own peace and prosperity if a few puny libellers acting under a knot of factions politicians without virtue parts or character such they are constantly represented by these gentlemen are sufficient to excite this disturbance very perverse must be the disposition of that people amongst whom such a disturbance can be excited by such means it is besides no small aggravation of the public misfortune that the disease on this hypothesis appears to be without remedy if the wealth of the nation be the cause of its turbulence i imagine it is not proposed to introduce poverty as a constable to keep the peace if our dominions abroad are the roots which feed all this rank luxuriance of sedition it is not intended to cut them off in order to famish the fruit if ourliberty has enfeebled the executive power there is no design i hope to call in the aid of despotism to fill up the deficiencies of law whatever may be intended these things are not yet professed we seem therefore to be driven to absolute despair for we have no other materials to work upon but those out of which god has been pleased to form the inhabitants of this island if these be radically and essentially vicious all that can be said is that those men are very unhappy to whose fortune or duty it falls to administer the affairs of this untoward people i hear it indeed sometimes asserted that a steady perseverance in the present measures and a rigorous punishment of those who oppose them will in course of time infallibly put an end to these disorders but this in my opinion is said without much observation of our present disposition and without any knowledge at all of the general nature of mankind if the matter of which this nation is composed be so very fermentable as these gentlemen describe it leaven never will be wanting to work it up as long as discontent revenge and ambition have existence in the world particular punishments are the cure for accidental distempers in the state they inflame rather than allay those heats which arise from the settled mismanagement of the government or from a natural ill disposition in the people it is of the utmost moment not to make mistakes in the use of strong measures and firmness is then only a virtue when it accompanies the most perfect wisdom in truth inconstancy is a sort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance  i am not one of those who think that the people are never in the wrong they have been so frequently and outrageously both in other countries and in this but i do say that in all disputes between them and their rulers the presumption is at least upon a par in favor of the people experience may perhaps justify me in going further where popular discontents have been very prevalent it may well be affirmed and supported that there has been generally something found amiss in the constitution or in the conduct of government the people have no interest in disorder when they do wrong it is their error and not their crime but with the governing part of the state it is far otherwise they certainly may act ill by design as well as by mistake  les revolutions qui arrivent dans les grands etats ne sont point un effect du hazard ni du caprice des peuples rien ne revolte les grands dun royaume comme un gouvernement foible et derange pour la populace ce nest jamais par envy dattaquer quelle se souleve mais par impatience de souffrir mem de sully vol i p      these are the words of a great man of a minister of state and a zealous assertor of monarchy they are applied to the system of favouritism which was adopted by henry the third of france and to the dreadful consequences it produced what he says of revolutions is equally true of all great disturbances if this presumption in favor of the subjects against the trustees of power be not the more probable i am sure it is the more comfortable speculation because it is more easy to change an administration than to reform a people  upon a supposition therefore that in the opening of the cause the presumptions stand equally balanced between the parties there seems sufficient ground to entitle any person to a fair hearing who attempts some other scheme besides that easy one which is fashionable in some fashionable companies to account for the present discontents it is not to be argued that we endure no grievance because our grievances are not of the same sort with those under which we labored formerly not precisely those which we bore from the tudors or vindicated on the stuarts a great change has taken place in the affairs of this country for in the silent lapse of events as material alterations have been insensibly brought about in the policy and character of governments and nations as those which have been marked by the tumult of public revolutions  it is very rare indeed for men to be wrong in their feelings concerning public misconduct as rare to be right in their speculation upon the cause of it i have constantly observed that the generality of people are fifty years at least behindhand in their politics there are but very few who are capable of comparing and digesting what passes before their eyes at different times and occasions so as to form the whole into a distinct system but in books every thing is settled for them without the exertion of any considerable diligence or sagacity for which reason men are wise with but little reflection and good with little selfdenial in the business of all times except their own we are very incorrupt and tolerably enlightened judges of the transactions of past ages where no passions deceive and where the whole train of circumstances from the trifling cause to the tragical event is set in an orderly series before us few are the partisans of departed tyranny and to be a whig on the business of an hundred years ago is very consistent with every advantage of present servility this retrospective wisdom and historical patriotism are things of wonderful conventence and serve admirably to reconcile the old quarrel between speculation and practice many a stern republican after gorging himself with a full feast of admiration of the grecian commonwealths and of our true saxon constitution and discharging all the splendid bile of his virtuous indignation on king john and king james sits down perfectly satisfied to the coarsest work and homeliest job of the day he lives in i believe there was no professed admirer of henry the eighth among the instruments of the last king james nor in the court of henry the eighth was there i dare say to be sound a single advocate for the favorites of richard the second  no complaisance to our court or to our age can make me believe nature to be so changed but that public liberty will be among us as among our ancestors obnoxious to some person or other and that opportunities will be furnished for attempting at least some alteration to the prejudice of our constitution these attempts will naturally vary in their mode according to times and circumstances for ambition though it has ever the same general views has not at all times the same means nor the same particular objects a great deal of the furniture of ancient tyranny is worn to rags the rest is entirely out of fashion besides there are few statesmen so very clumsy and awkward in their business as to fall into the identical snare which has proved fatal to their predecessors when an arbitrary imposition is attempted upon the subject undoubtedly it will not bear on its forehead the name of shipmoncy there is no danger that an extension of the forest laws should be the chosen mode of oppression in this age and when we hear any instance of ministerial rapacity to the prejudice of the rights of private life it will certainly not be the exaction of two hundred pullets from a woman of fashion for leave to lie with her own husband uxor hugonis de nevill dat domino regi ducentas gallinas eo quod possit jacere una nocte cum domino suo hugone de nevill maddox hist exch c xiii p       every age has its own manners and its politics dependent upon them and the same attempts will not be made against a constitution fully formed and matured that were used to destroy it in the cradle or to resist its growth during its infancy  against the being of parliament i am satisfied no designs have ever been entertained since the revolution every one must perceive that it is strongly the interest of the court to have some second cause interposed between the ministers and the people the gentlemen of the house of commons have an interest equally strong in sustaining the part of that intermediate cause however they may hire out the usufruct of their voices they never will part with the fee and inheritance accordingly those who have been of the most known devotion to the will and pleasure of a court have at the same time been most forward in asserting an high authority in the house of commons when they knew who were to use that authority and how it was to be employed they thought it never could be carried too far it must be always the wish of an unconstitutional statesman that an house of commons who are entirely dependent upon him should have every right of the people entirely dependent upon their pleasure it was soon discovered that the forms of a free and the ends of an arbitrary government were things not altogether incompatible  the power of the crown almost dead and rotten as prerogative has grown up anew with much more strength and far less odium under the name of influence an influence which operated without noise and without violence an influence which converted the very antagonist into the instrument of power which contained in itself a perpetual principle of growth and renovation and which the distresses and the prosperity of the country equally tended to augment was an admirable substitute for a prerogative that being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices had molded in its original stamina irresistible principles of decay and dissolution the ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporary system the interest of active men in the state is a foundation perpetual and infallible however some circumstances arising it must be confessed in a great degree from accident prevented the effects of this influence for a long time from breaking out in a manner capable of exciting any serious apprehensions although government was strong and flourished exceedingly the court had drawn far less advantage than one would imagine from this great source of power  at the revolution the crown deprived for the ends of the revolution itself of many prerogatives was found too weak to struggle against all the difficulties which pressed so new and unsettled a government the court was obliged therefore to delegate a part of its powers to men of such interest as could support and of such fidelity as would adhere to its establishment such men were able to draw in a greater number to a concurrence in the common defense this connection necessary at first continued long after conventent and properly conducted might indeed in all situations be an useful instrument of government at the same time through the intervention of men of popular weight and character the people possessed a security for their just portion of importance in the state but as the title to the crown grew stronger by long possession and by the constant increase of its influence these helps have of late seemed to certain persons no better than encumbrances the powerful managers for government were not sufficiently submissive to the pleasure of the possessors of immediate and personal favor sometimes from a confidence in their own strength natural and acquired sometimes from a fear of offending their friends and weakening that lead in the country which gave them a consideration independent of the court men acted as if the court could receive as well as confer an obligation the influence of government thus divided in appearance between the court and the leaders of parties became in many cases an accession rather to the popular than to the royal scale and some part of that influence which would otherwise have been possessed as in a sort of mortmain and unalienable domain returned again to the great occan from whence it arose and circulated among the people this method therefore of governing by men of great natural interest or great acquired consideration was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers of absolute monarchy it is the nature of despotism to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary pleasure and to annihilate all intermediate situations between boundless strength on its own part and total debility on the part of the people  to get rid of all this intermediate and independent importance and to secure to the court the unlimited and uncontrolled use of its own vast influence under the sole direction of its own private favor has for some years past been the great object of policy if this were compassed the influence of the crown must of course produce all the effects which the most sanguine partisans of the court could possibly desire government might then be carried on without any concurrence on the part of the people without any attention to the dignity of the greater or to the affections of the lower sorts a new project was therefore devised by a certain set of intriguing men totatly different from the system of administration which had prevailed since the accession of the house of brunswick this project i have heard was first conceived by some persons in the court of frederick prince of wales  the carliest attempt in the execution of this design was to set up for minister a person in rank indeed respectable and very ample in fortune but who to the moment of this vast and sudden clevation was little known or considered in the kingdom to him the whole nation was to yield an immediate and implicit submission but whether it was for want of sirmness to bear up against the first opposition or that things were not yet fully ripened or that this method was not found the most eligible that idea was soon abandoned the instrumental part of the project was a little altered to accommodate it to the time and to bring things more gradually and more surely to the one great end proposed  the first part of the reformed plan was to draw a line which should separate the court from the ministry hitherto these names had been looked upon as synonymous but for the future court and administration were to be considered as things totally distinct by this operation two systems of administration were to be formed one which should be in the real secret and confidence the other merely ostensible to perform the official and executory duties of government the latter were alone to be responsible whilst the real advisers who enjoyed all the power were effectually removed from all the danger  secondly a party under these leaders was to be formed in favor of the court against the ministry this party was to have a large share in the emoluments of government and to hold it totally separate from and independent of ostensible administration  the third point and that on which the success of the whole scheme ultimately depended was to bring parliament to an acquiescence in this project parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a total indifference to the persons rank influence abilities connexions and character of the ministers of the crown by means of a discipline on which i shall say more hereafter that body was to be habituated to the most opposite interests and the most discordant politics all connexions and dependencies among subjects were to be entirely dissolved as hitherto business had gone through the hands of leaders of whigs or tories men of talents to conciliate the people and to engage their confidence now the method was to be altered and the lead was to be given to men of no sort of consideration or credit in the country this want of natural importance was to be their very title to delegated power members of parliament were to be hardened into an insensibility to pride as well to duty those high and haughty sentiments which are the great support of independence were to be let down gradually point of honor and precedence were no more to be regarded in parliamentary decorum than in a turkish army it was to be avowed as a constitutional maxim that the king might appoint one of his footmen or one of your footmen for minister and that he ought to be and that he would be as well followed as the first name for rank or wisdom in the nation thus parliament was to look on as if perfectly unconcerned while a cabal of the closet and backstairs was substituted in the place of a national administration  with such a degree of acquiescence any measure of any court might well be deemed thoroughly secure the capital objects and by much the most flattering characteristicks of arbitrary power would be obtained every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the personal favor and inclination of the prince this favor would be the sole introduction to power and the only tenure by which it was to be held so that no person looking toward another and all looking toward the court it was impossible but that the motive which solely influenced every mans hopes must come in time to govern every mans conduct till at last the servility became universal in spite of the dead letter of any laws or institutions whatsoever  how it should happen that any man could be tempted to venture upon such a project of government may at first view appear surprising but the fact is that opportunities very inviting to such an attempt have offered and the scheme itself was not destitute of some arguments not wholly unplausible to recommend it these opportunities and these arguments the use that has been made of both the plan for carrying this new scheme of government into execution and the effects which it has produced are in my opinion worthy of our serious consideration  his majesty came to the throne of these kingdoms with more advantages than any of his predecessors since the revolution fourth in descent and third in succession of his royal family even the zealots of hereditary right in him saw something to flatter their favorite prejudices and to justify a transfer of their attachments without a change in their principles the person and cause of the pretender were become contemptible his title disowned throughout europe his party disbanded in england his majesty came indeed to the inheritance of a mighty war but victorious in every part of the globe peace was always in his power not to negociate but to dictate no foreign habitudes or attachments withdrew him from the cultivation of his power at home his revenue for the civil establishment fixed as it was then thought at a large but definite sum was ample without being invidious his influence by additions from conquests by an augmentation of debt by an increase of military and naval establishment much strengthened and extended and coming to the throne in the prime and full vigor of youth as from affection there was a strong dislike so from dread there seemed to be a general averseness from giving any thing like offense to a monarch against whose resentment opposition could not look for a refuge in any sort of reversionary hope  these singular advantages inspired his majesty only with a more ardent desire to preserve unimpaired the spirit of that national freedom to which he owed a situation so full of glory but to others it suggested sentiments of a very different nature they thought they now beheld an opportunity by a certain sort of statesmen never long undiscovered or unemployed of drawing to themselves by the aggrandisement of a court faction a degree of power which they could never hope to derive from natural influence or from honorable service and which it was impossible they could hold with the least security whilst the system of administration rested upon its former bottom in order to facilitate the execution of their design it was necessary to make many alterations in political arrangement and a signal change in the opinions habits and connexions of the greatest part of those who acted then in public  in the first place they proceeded gradually but not slowly to destroy every thing of strength which did not derive its principal nourishment from the immediate pleasure of the court the greatest weight of popular opinion and party connection were then with the duke of newcastle and mr pit neither of these held their importance by the new tenure of the court they were not therefore thought to be so proper as others for the services which were required by that tenure it happened very favorably for the new system that under a forced coalition there rankled an incurable alienation and disgust between the parties which composed the administration mr pit was first attacked not satisfied with removing him from power they endeavored by various artifices to ruin his character the other party seemed rather pleased to get rid of so oppressive a support not perceiving that their own fall was prepared by his and involved in it many other reasons prevented them from daring to look their true situation in the face to the great whig families it was extremely disagreeable and seemed almost unnatural to oppose the administration of a prince of the house of brunswick day after day they hesitated and doubted and lingered expecting that other counsels would take place and were slow to be persuaded that all which had been done by the cabal was the effect not of humor but of system it was more strongly and evidently the interest of the new court faction to get rid of the great whig connexions than to destroy mr pit the power of that gentleman was vast indeed and merited but it was in a great degree personal and therefore transient theirs was rooted in the country for with a good deal less of popularity they possessed a far more natural and fixed influence long possession of government vast property obligations of favors given and received connection of office ties of blood of alliance of friendship things at that time supposed of some force the name of whig dear to the majority of the people the zeal early begun and steadily continued to the royal family all these together formed a body of power in the nation which was criminal and devoted the great ruling principle of the cabal and that which animated and harmonized all their proceedings how various soever they may have been was to signify to the world that the court would proceed upon its own proper forces only and that the pretense of bringing any other into its service was an affront to it and not a support therefore when the chiefs were removed in order to go to the root the whole party was put under a proscription so general and severe as to take their hardearned bread from the lowest officers in a manner which had never been known before even in general revolutions but it was thought necessary effectually to destroy all dependencies but one and to show an example of the firmness and rigor with which the new system was to be supported  thus for the time were pulled down in the persons of the whig leaders and of mr pit in spite of the services of the one at the accession of the royal family and the recent services of the other in the war the two only securities for the importance of the people power arising from popularity and power arising from connection here and there indeed a few individuals were left standing who gave security for their total estrangement from the odious principles of party connection and personal attachment and it must be confessed that most of them have religiously kept their faith such a change could not however be made without a mighty shock to government  to reconcile the minds of the people to all these movements principles correspondent to them had been preached up with great zeal every one must remember that the cabal set out with the most astonishing prudery both moral and political those who in a few months after soused over head and ears into the deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption cried out violently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments which had formerly prevailed this mavelous abhorrence which the court had suddenly taken to all influence was not only circulated in conversation through the kingdom but pompously announced to the public with many other extraordinary things in a pamphlet sentiments of an honest man which had all the appearance of a manifesto preparatory to some considerable enterprise throughout it was a satire though in terms managed and decent enough on the politics of the former reign it was indeed written with no small art and address  in this piece appeared the first dawning of the new system there first appeared the idea then only in speculation of separating the court from the administration of carrying every thing from national connection to personal regards and of forming a regular party for that purpose under the name of kings men  to recommend this system to the people a perspective view of the court gorgeously painted and finely illuminated from within was exhibited to the gaping multitude party was to be totally done away with all its evil works corruption was to be cast down from court as ate was from heaven power was thenceforward to be the chosen residence of public spirit and no one was to be supposed under any sinister influence except those who had the misfortune to be in disgrance at court which was to stand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions a scheme of perfection to be realized in a monarchy far beyond the visionary republic of plato the whole scenery was exactly disposed to captivate those good souls whose credulous morality is so invaluable a treasure to crafty politicians indeed there was wherewithal to charm every body except those few who are not much pleased with professions of supernatural virtue who know of what stuff such professions are made for what purposes they are designed and in what they are sure constantly to end many innocent gentlemen who had been talking prose all their lives without knowing any thing of the matter began at last to open their eyes upon their own merits and to attribute their not having been lords of the treasury and lords of trade many years before merely to the prevalence of party and to the ministerial power which had frustrated the good intentions of the court in favor of their abilities now was the time to unlock the sealed fountain of royal bounty which had been infamously monopolized and huckstered and to let it flow at large upon the whole people the time was come to restore royalty to its original splendor mettre le roy horse de page became a sort of watchword and it was constantly in the mouths of all the runners of the court that nothing could preserve the balance of the constitution from being overturned by the rabble or by a faction of the nobility but to free the sovereign effectually from that ministerial tyranny under which the royal dignity had been oppressed in the person of his majestys grandfather  these were some of the many artifices used to reconcile the people to the great change which was made in the persons who composed the ministry and the still greater which was made and avowed in its constitution as to individuals other methods were employed with them in order so thoroughly to disunite every party and even every family that no concert order or effect might appear in any future opposition and in this manner an administration without connection with the people or with one another was first put in possession of government what good effects followed from it we have all seen whether with regard to virtue public or private to the ease and happiness of the sovereign or to the real strength of government but as so much stress was then laid on the necessity of this new project it will not be amiss to take a view of the effects of this royal servitude and vile durance which was so deplored in the reign of the late monarch and was so carefully to be avoided in the reign of his successor the effects were these  in times full of doubt and danger to his person and family george the second maintained the dignity of his crown connected with the liberty of his people not only unimpaired but improved for the space of thirty three years he overcame a dangerous rebellion abetted by foreign force and raging in the heart of his kingdoms and thereby destroyed the seeds of all future rebellion that could arise upon the same principle he carried the glory the power the commerce of england to an height unknown even to this renowned nation in the times of its greatest prosperity and he left his succession resting on the true and only true foundations of all national and all regal greatness affection at home reputation abroad trust in allies terror in rival nations the most ardent lover of his country cannot wish for great britain an happier fate than to continue as she was then left a people emulous as we are in affection to our present sovereign know not how to form a prayer to heaven for a greater blessing upon his virtues or an higher state of felicity and glory than that that he should live and should reign and when providence ordains it should die exactly like his illustrious predecesser  a great prince may be obliged though such a thing cannot happen very often to sacrifice his private inclination to his public interest a wise prince will not think that such a restraint implies a condition of servility and truly if such was the condition of the last reign and the effects were also such as we have described we ought no less for the sake of the sovereign whom we love than for our own to hear arguments convincing indeed before we depart from the maxims of that reign or fly in the face of this great body of strong and recent experience  one of the principal topics which was then and has been since much employed by that political see the political writings of the late dr brown and many others school is an affected terror of the growth of an aristocratic power prejudicial to the rights of the crown and the balance of the constitution any new powers exercised in the house of lords or in the house of commons or by the crown ought certainly to excite the vigilant and anxious jealousy of a free people even a new and unprecedented course of action in the whole legislature without great and evident reason may be a subject of just uneasiness i will not affirm that there may not have lately appeared in the house of lords a disposition to some attempts derogatory to the legal rights of the subject if any such have really appeared they have arisen not from a power properly aristocratic but from the same influence which is charged with having excited attempts of a similar nature in the house of commons which house if it should have been betrayed into an unfortunate quarrel with its constituents and involved in a charge of the very same nature could have neither power nor inclination to repel such attempts in others those attempts in the house of lords can no more be called aristocratic proceedings than the proceedings with regard to the county of middlesex in the house of commons can with any sense be called democratical  it is true that the peers have a great influence in the kingdom and in every part of the public concerns while they are men of property it is impossible to prevent it except by such means as must prevent all property from its natural operation an event not easily to be compassed while property is power or by any means to be wished while the least notion exists of the method by which the spirit of liberty acts and of the means by which it is preserved if any particular peers by their uniform upright constitutional conduct by their public and their private virtues have acquired an influence in the country the people on whose favor that influence depends and from whom it arose will never be duped into an opinion that such greatness in a peer is the despotism of an aristocracy when they know and feel it to be the effect and pledge of their own importance  i am no friend to aristocracy in the sense at least in which that word is usually understood if it were not a bad habit to moot cases on the supposed ruin of the constitution i should be free to declare that if it must perish i would rather by far see it resolved into any other form than lost in that austere and insolent domination but whatever my dislikes may be my fears are not upon that quarter the question on the influence of a court and of a peerage is not which of the two dangers is the most eligible but which is the most imminent he is but a poor observer who has not seen that the generality of peers far from supporting themselves in a state of independent greatness are but too apt to fall into an oblivion of their proper dignity and to run headlong into an abject servitude would to god it were true that the fault of our peers were too much spirit it is worthy of some observation that these gentlemen so jealous of aristocracy make no complaints of the power of those peers neither few nor inconsiderable who are always in the train of a court and whose whole weight must be considered as a portion of the settled influence of the crown this is all safe and right but if some peers i am very sorry they are not as many as they ought to be set themselves in the great concern of peers and commons against a backstairs influence and clandestine government then the alarm begins then the constitution is in danger of being forced into an aristocracy  i rest a little the longer on this court topic because it was much insisted upon at the time of the great change and has been since frequently revived by many of the agents of that party for whilst they are terrifying the great and opulent with the horrors of mobgovernment they are by other managers attempting though hitherto with little success to alarm the people with the phantom of the tyranny of the nobles all this is done upon their favorite principle of disunion of sowing jealousies amongst the different orders of the state and of disjointing the natural strength of the kingdom that it may be rendered incapable of resisting the sinister designs of wicked men who have engrossed the royal power  thus much of the topics chosen by the courtiers to recommend their system it will be necessary to open a little more at large the nature of that party which was formed for its support without this the whole would have been no better than a visionary amusement like the scheme of harringtons political club and not a business in which the nation had a real concern as a powerful party and a party constructed on a new principle it is a very inviting object of curiosity  it must be remembered that since the revolution until the period we are speaking of the influence of the crown had been always employed in supporting the ministers of state and in carrying on the public business according to their opinions but the party now in question is formed upon a very different idea it is to intercept the favor protection and confidence of the crown in the passage to its ministers it is to come between them and their importance in parliament it is to separate them from all their natural and acquired dependencies it is intended as the control not the support of administration the machinery of this system is perplexed in its movements and false in its principle it is formed on a supposition that the king is something external to his government and that he may be honored and aggrandized even by its debility and disgrace the plan proceeds expressly on the idea of enfeebling the regular executory power it proceeds on the idea of weakening the state in order to strengthen the court the scheme depending entirely on distrust on disconnection on mutability by principle on systematic weakness in every particular member it is impossible that the total result should be substantial strength of any kind  as a foundation of their scheme the cabal have established a sort of rota in the court all sorts of parties by this means have been brought into administration from whence few have had the good fortune to escape without disgrace none at all without considerable losses in the beginning of each arrangement no professions of confidence and support are wanting to induce the leading men to engage but while the ministers of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power while they have all their canvas spread out to the wind and every sail filled with the fair and prosperous gale of royal favor in a short time they find they know not how a current which sets directly against them which prevents all progress and even drives them backwards they grow ashamed and mortified in a situation which by its vicinity to power only serves to remind them the more strongly of their insignificance they are obliged either to execute the orders of their inferiors or to see themselves opposed by the natural instruments of their office with the loss of their dignity they lose their temper in their turn they grow troublesome to that cabal which whether it supports or opposes equally disgraces and equally betrays them it is soon found necessary to get rid of the heads of administration but it is of the heads only as there always are many rotten members belonging to the best connexions it is not hard to persuade several to continue in office without their leaders by this means the party goes out much thinner than it came in and is only reduced in strength by its temporary possession of power besides if by accident or in course of changes that power should be recovered the junto have thrown up a retrenchment of these carcases which may serve to cover themselves in a day of danger they conclude not unwisely that such rotten members will become the first objects of disgust and resentment to their ancient connexions  they contrive to form in the outward administration two parties at the least which whilst they are tearing one another to pieces are both competitors for the favor and protection of the cabal and by their emulation contribute to throw every thing more and more into the hands of the interior managers  a minister of state will sometimes keep himself totally estranged from all his colleagues will differ from them in their councils will privately traverse and publicly oppose their measures he will however continue in his employment instead of suffering any mark of displeasure he will be distinguished by an unbounded profusion of court rewards and caresses because he does what is expected and all that is expected from men in office he helps to keep so me form of administration in being and keeps it at the same time as weak and divided as possible  however we must take care not to be mistaken or to imagine that such persons have any weight in their opposition when by them administration is convinced of its insignificancy they are soon to be convinced of their own they never are suffered to succeed in their opposition they and the world are to be satisfied that neither office nor authority nor property nor ability eloquence council skill or union are of the least importance but that the mere influence of the court naked of all support and destitute of all management is abundantly sufficient for all its own purposes  when any adverse connection is to be destroyed the cabal seldom appear in the work themselves they find out some person of whom the party entertains an high opinion such a person they endeavor to delude with various pretenses they teach him first to distrust and then to quarrel with his friends among whom by the same arts they excite a similar diffidence of him so that in this mutual fear and distrust he may suffer himself to be employed as the instrument in the change which is brought about afterward they are sure to destroy him in his turn by setting up in his place some person in whom he had himself reposed the greatest confidence and who serves to carry off a considerable part of his adherents  when such a person has broke in this manner with his connexions he is soon compelled to commit some flagrant act of iniquitous personal hostility against some of them such as an attempt to strip a particular friend of his family estate by which the cabal hope to render the parties utterly irreconcilable in truth they have so contrived matters that people have a greater hatred to the subordinate instruments than to the principal movers  as in destroying their enemies they make use of instruments not immediately belonging to their corpse so in advancing their own friends they pursue exactly the same method to promote any of them to considerable rank or emolument they commonly take care that the recommendation shall pass through the hands of the ostensible ministry such a recommendation might however appear to the world as some proof of the credit of ministers and some means of increasing their strength to prevent this the persons so advanced are directed in all companies industriously to declare that they are under no obligations whatsoever to administration that they have received their office from another quarter that they are totally free and independent  when the faction has any job of lucre to obtain or of vengeance to perpetrate their way is to select for the execution those very persons to whose habits friendships principles and declarations such proceedings are publicly known to be the most adverse at once to render the instruments more odious and therefore the more dependent and to prevent the people from ever reposing a confidence in any appearance of private friendship or public principle  if the administration seem now and then from remissness or from sear of making themselves disagreeable to suffer any popular excesses to go unpunished the cabal immediately sets up some creature of theirs to raise a clamor against the ministers as having shamefully betrayed the dignity of government then they compel the ministry to become active in conserring rewards and honors on the persons who have been the instruments of their disgrace and after having first vilified them with the higher orders for suffering the laws to sleep over the licentiousness of the populace they drive them in order to make amends for their former inactivity to some act of atrocious violence which renders them completely abhorred by the people they who remember the riots which attended the middlesex election the opening of the present parliament and the transactions relative to saint georges fields will not be at a loss for an application of these remarks  that this body may be enabled to compass all the ends of its institution its members are scarcely ever to aim at the high and responsible offices of the state they are distributed with art and judgment through all the secondary but efficient departments of office and through the households of all the branches of the royal family so as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the throne and on the other to forward or frustrate the execution of any measure according to their own interests for with the credit and support which they are known to have though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excuse for salary they possess all the influence of the highest posts and they dictate publicly in almost every thing even with a parade of superiority whenever they dissent as it often happens from their nominal leaders the trained part of the senate instinctively in the secret is sure to follow them provided the leaders sensible of their situation do not of themselves recede in time from their most declared opinions this latter is generally the case it will not be conceivable to any who has not seen it what pleasure is taken by the cabal in rendering these heads of office thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous and when they are become so they have then the best chance for being well supported  the members of the court faction are fully indemnified for not holding places on the slippery heights of the kingdom not only by the lead in all affairs but also by the perfect security in which they enjoy less conspicuous but very advantageous situations their places are in express legal tenure or in effect all of them for life whilst the first and most respectable persons in the kingdom are tossed about like tennis balls the sport of a blind and insolent caprice no minister dares even to cast an oblique glance at the lowest of their body if an attempt be made upon one of this corpse immediately he flies to sanctuary and pretends to the most inviolable of all promises no convenience of public arrangement is available to remove any of them from the specific situation he holds and the slightest attempt upon one of them by the most powerful minister is a certain preliminary to his own destruction  conscious of their independence they bear themselves with a losty air to the exterior ministers like janissaries they derive a kind of freedom from the very condition of their servitude they may act just as they please provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their institution it is therefore not at all wonderful that people should be so desirous of adding themselves to that body in which they may possess and reconcile satisfactions the most alluring and seemingly the most contradictory enjoying at once all the spirited pleasure of independence and all the gross lucre and fat emoluments of servitude  here is a sketch though a slight one of the constitution laws and policy of this new court corporation the name by which they choose to distinguish themselves is that of kings men or the kings friends by an invidious exclusion of the rest of his majestys most loyal and affectionate subjects the whole system comprehending the exterior and interior administrations is commonly called in the technical language of the court double cabinet in french or english as you choose to pronounce it  whether all this be a vision of a distracted brain or the invention of a malicious heart or a real faction in the country must be judged by the appearances which things have worn for eight years past thus far i am certain that there is not a single public man in or out of office who has not at some time or other born testimony to the truth of what i have now related in particular no persons have been more strong in their assertions and louder and more indecent in their complaints than those who compose all the exterior part of the present administration in whose time that faction has arrived at such an height of power and of boldness in the use of it as may in the end perhaps bring about its total destruction  it is true that about four years ago during the administration of the marquis of rockingham an attempt was made to carry on government without their concurrence however this was only a transient cloud they were hid but for a moment and their constellation blazed out with greater brightness and a far more vigorous influence some time after it was blown over an attempt was at that time made but without any idea of proscription to break their corpse to discountenance their doctrines to revive connexions of a different kind to restore the principles and policy of the whigs to reanimate the cause of liberty by ministerial countenance and then for the first time were men seen attached in office to every principle they had maintained in opposition no one will doubt that such men were abhorred and violently opposed by the court faction and that such a system could have but a short duration  it may appear somewhat affected that in so much discourse upon this extraordinary party i should say so little of the earl of bute who is the supposed head of it but this was neither owing to affectation nor inadvertence i have carefully avoided the introduction of personal reflections of any kind much the greater part of the topics which have been used to blacken this nobleman are either unjust or frivolous at best they have a tendency to give the resentment of this bitter calamity a wrong direction and to turn a public grievance into a mean personal or a dangerous national quarrel where there is a regular scheme of operations carried on it is the system and not any individual person who acts in it that is truly dangerous this system has not risen solely from the ambition of lord bute but from the circumstances which favored it and from an indifference to the constitution which had been for some time growing among our gentry we should have been tried with it if the earl of bute had never existed and it will want neither a contriving head nor active members when the earl of bute exists no longer it is not therefore to rail at lord bute but firmly to embody against this court party and its practices which can afford us any prospect of relief in our present condition  another motive induces me to put the personal consideration of lord bute wholly out of the question he communicates very little in a direct manner with the greater part of our men of business this has never been his custom it is enough for him that he surrounds them with his creatures several imagine therefore that they have a very good excuse for doing all the work of this faction when they have no personal connection with lord bute but whoever becomes a party to an administration composed of insulated individuals without faith plighted tie or common principle an administration constitutionally impotent because supported by no party in the nation he who contributes to destroy the connexions of men and their trust in one another or in any sort to throw the dependence of public counsels upon private will and favor possibly may have nothing to do with the earl of bute it matters little whether he be the friend or the enemy of that particular person but let him be who or what he will he abets a faction that is driving hard to the ruin of his country he is sapping the foundation of its liberty disturbing the sources of its domestic tranquillity weakening its government over its dependencies degrading it from all its importance in the system of europe  it is this unnatural infusion of a system of favouritism into a government which in a great part of its constitution is popular that has raised the present ferment in the nation the people without entering deeply into its principles could plainly perceive its effects in much violence in a great spirit of innovation and a general disorder in all the functions of government i keep my eye solely on this system if i speak of those measures which have arisen from it it will be so far only as they illustrate the general scheme this is the fountain of all those bitter waters of which through an hundred different conduits we have drunk until we are ready to burst the discretionary power of the crown in the formation of ministry abused by bad or weak men has given rise to a system which without directly violating the letter of any law operates against the spirit of the whole constitution  a plan of favouritism for our executory government is essentially at variance with the plan of our legislature one great end undoubtedly of a mixed government like ours composed of monarchy and of controls on the part of the higher people and the lower is that the prince shall not be able to violate the laws this is useful indeed and fundamental but this even at first view is no more than a negative advantage an armor merely defensive it is therefore next in order and equal in importance that the discretionary powers which are necessarily vested in the monarch whether for the execution of the laws or for the nomination to magistracy and office or for conducting the affairs of peace and war or for ordering the revenue should all be exercised upon public principles and national grounds and not on the likings or prejudices the intrigues or policies of a court this i said is equal in importance to the securing a government according to law the laws reach but a very little way constitute government how you please infinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the exercise of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightness of ministers of state even all the use and potency of the laws depends upon them without them your commonwealth is no better than a scheme upon paper and not a living acting effective constitution it is possible that through negligence or ignorance or design artfully conducted ministers may suffer one part of government to languish another to be perverted from its purposes and every valuable interest of the country to fall into ruin and decay without possibility of fixing any single act on which a criminal prosecution can be justly grounded the due arrangement of men in the active part of the state far from being foreign to the purposes of a wise government ought to be among its very first and dearest objects when therefore the abettors of the new system tell us that between them and their opposers there is nothing but a struggle for power and that therefore we are noways concerned in it we must tell those who have the impudence to insult us in this manner that of all things we ought to be the most concerned who and what sort of men they are that hold the trust of every thing that is dear to us nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation but what must either render us totally desperate or sooth us into the security of idiots we must soften into a credulity below the milkiness of infancy to think all men virtuous we must be tainted with a malignity truly diabolical to believe all the world to be equally wicked and corrupt men are in public life as in private some good some evil the elevation of the one and the depression of the other are the first objects of all true policy but that form of government which neither in its direct institutions nor in their immediate tendency has contrived to throw its affairs into the most trustworthy hands but has left its whole executory system to be disposed of agreeably to the uncontrolled pleasure of any one man however excellent or virtuous is a plan of polity defective not only in that member but consequentially erroneous in every part of it  in arbitrary governments the constitution of the ministry follows the constitution of the legislature both the law and the magistrate are the creatures of will it must be so nothing indeed will appear more certain on any tolerable consideration of this matter than that every sort of government ought to have its administration correspondent to its legislature if it should be otherwise things must fall into an hideous disorder the people of a free commonwealth who have taken such care that their laws should be the result of general consent cannot be so senseless as to suffer their executory system to be composed of persons on whom they have no dependence and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to those powers upon the use of which the very being of the state depends  the popular election of magistrates and popular disposition of rewards and honors is one of the first advantages of a free state without it or something equivalent to it perhaps the people cannot long enjoy the substance of freedom certainly none of the vivifying energy of good government the frame of our commonwealth did not admit of such an actual election but it provided as well and while the spirit of the constitution is preserved better for all the effects of it than by the method of suffrage in any democratic state whatsoever it had always until of late been held the first duty of parliament to refuse to support government until power was in the hands of persons who were acceptable to the people or while factions predominated in the court in which the nation had no confidence thus all the good effects of popular election were supposed to be secured to us without the mischiefs attending on perpetual intrigue and a distinct canvass for every particular office throughout the body of the people this was the most noble and refined part of our constitution the people by their representatives and grandees were entrusted with a deliberative power in making laws the king with the control of his negative the king was entrusted with the deliberative choice and the election to office the people had the negative in a parliamentary refusal to support formerly this power of control was what kept ministers in awe of parliaments and parliaments in reverence with the people if the use of this power of control on the system and persons of administration is gone every thing is lost parliament and all we may assure ourselves that if parliament will tamely see evil men take possession of all the strongholds of their country and allow them time and means to fortify themselves under a pretense of giving them a fair trial and upon a hope of discovering whether they will not be reformed by power and whether their measures will not be better than their morals such a parliament will give countenance to their measures also whatever that parliament may pretend and whatever those measures may be  every good political institution must have a preventive operation as well as a remedial it ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men from government and not to trust for the safety of the state to subsequent punishment alone punishment which has ever been tardy and uncertain and which when power is suffered in bad hands may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal  before men are put forward into the great trusts of the state they ought by their conduct to have obtained such a degree of estimation in their country as may be some sort of pledge and security to the public that they will not abuse those trusts it is no mean security for a proper use of power that a man has shown by the general tenor of his actions that the affection the good opinion the confidence of his fellow citizens have been among the principal objects of his life and that he has owed none of the gradations of his power or fortune to a settled contempt or occasional forfeiture of their esteem  that man who before he comes into power has no friends or who coming into power is obliged to desert his friends or who losing it has no friends to sympathize with him he who has no sway among any part of the landed or commercial interest but whose whole importance has begun with his office and is sure to end with it is a person who ought never to be suffered by a controlling parliament to continue in any of those situations which confer the lead and direction of all our public affairs because such a man has no connection with the interest of the people  those knots or cabals of men who have got together avowedly without any public principle in order to sell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate and are therefore universally odious ought never to be suffered to domineer in the state because they have no connection with the sentiments and opinions of the people  these are considerations which in my opinion enforce the necessity of having some better reason in a free country and a free parliament for supporting the ministers of the crown than that short one that the king has thought proper to appoint them there is something very courtly in this but it is a principle pregnant with all sorts of mischief in a constitution like ours to turn the views of active men from the country to the court whatever be the road to power that is the road which will be trod if the opinion of the country be of no use as a means of power or consideration the qualities which usually procure that opinion will be no longer cultivated and whether it will be right in a state so popular in its constitution as ours to leave ambition without popular motives and to trust all to the operation of pure virtue in the minds of kings and ministers and public men must be submitted to the judgment and good sense of the people of england  cunning men are here apt to break in and without directly controverting the principle to raise objections from the difficulty under which the sovereign labors to distinguish the genuine voice and sentiments of his people from the clamor of a faction by which it is so easily counterfeited the nation they say is generally divided into parties with views and passions utterly irreconcilable if the king should put his affairs into the hands of any one of them he is sure to disgust the rest if he select particular men from among them all it is an hazard that he disgusts them all those who are left out however divided before will soon run into a body of opposition which being a collection of many discontents into one focus will without doubt be hot and violent enough faction will make its cries resound through the nation as if the whole were in an uproar when by far the majority and much the better part will seem for a while as it were annihilated by the quiet in which their virtue and moderation incline them to enjoy the blessings of government besides that the opinion of the mere vulgar is a miserable rule even with regard to themselves on account of their violence and instability so that if you were to gratify them in their humor today that very gratification would be a ground of their dissatisfaction on the next now as all these rules of public opinion are to be collected with great difficulty and to be applied with equal uncertainty as to the effect what better can a king of england do than to employ such men as he finds to have views and inclinations most conformable to his own who are least infected with pride and selfwill and who are least moved by such popular humors as are perpetually traversing his designs and disturbing his service trusting that when he means no ill to his people he will be supported in his appointments whether he chooses to keep or to change as his private judgment or his pleasure leads him he will find a sure resource in the real weight and influence of the crown when it is not suffered to become an instrument in the hands of a faction  i will not pretend to say that there is nothing at all in this mode of reasoning because i will not assert that there is no difficulty in the art of government undoubtedly the very best administration must encounter a great deal of opposition and the very worst will find more support than it deserves sufficient appearances will never be wanting to those who have a mind to deceive themselves it is a fallacy in constant use with those who would level all things and confound right with wrong to insist upon the inconveniences which are attached to every choice without taking into consideration the different weight and consequence of those inconveniences the question is not concerning absolute discontent or perfect satisfaction in government neither of which can be pure and unmixed at any time or upon any system the controversy is about that degree of good humor in the people which may possibly be attained and ought certainly to be looked for while some politicians may be waiting to know whether the sense of every individual be against them accurately distinguishing the vulgar from the better sort drawing lines between the enterprises of a faction and the efforts of a people they may chance to see the government which they are so nicely weighing and dividing and distinguishing tumble to the ground in the midst of their wise deliberation prudent men when so great an object as the security of government or even its peace is at stake will not run the risque of a decision which may be fatal to it they who can read the political sky will see an hurricane in a cloud no bigger than an hand at the very edge of the horizon and will run into the first harbor no lines can be laid down for civil or political wisdom they are a matter incapable of exact definition but though no man can draw a stroke between the confines of day and night yet light and darkness are upon the whole tolerably distinguishable nor will it be impossible for a prince to find out such a mode of government and such persons to administer it as will give a great degree of content to his people without any curious and anxious research for that abstract universal perfect harmony which while he is seeking he abandons those means of ordinary tranquillity which are in his power without any research at all  it is not more the duty than it is the interest of a prince to aim at giving tranquillity to his government but those who advise him may have an interest in disorder and confusion if the opinion of the people is against them they will naturally wish that it should have no prevalence here it is that the people must on their part show themselves sensible of their own value their whole importance in the first instance and afterward their whole freedom is at stake their freedom cannot long survive their importance here it is that the natural strength of the kingdom the great peers the leading landed gentlemen the opulent merchants and manufacturers the substantial yeomanry must interpose to rescue their prince themselves and their posterity  we are at present at issue upon this point we are in the great crisis of this contention and the part which men take one way or other will serve to discriminate their characters and their principles until the matter is decided the country will remain in its present confusion for while a system of administration is attempted entirely repugnant to the genius of the people and not conformable to the plan of their government every thing must necessarily be disordered for a time until this system destroys the constitution or the constitution gets the better of this system  there is in my opinion a peculiar venom and malignity in this political distemper beyond any that i have heard or read of in former times the projectors of arbitrary government attacked only the liberties of their country a design surely mischievous enough to have satisfied a mind of the most unruly ambition but a system unfavourable to freedom may be so formed as considerably to exalt the grandeur of the state and men may find in the pride and splendour of that prosperity some sort of consolation for the loss of their solid privileges indeed the increase of the power of the state has often been urged by artful men as a pretext for some abridgement of the public liberty but the scheme of the junto under consideration not only strikes a palsy into every nerve of our free constitution but in the same degree benumbs and stupifies the whole executive power rendering government in all its grand operations languid uncertain ineffective making ministers fearful of attempting and incapable of executing any useful plan of domestic arrangement or of foreign politics it tends to produce neither the security of a free government nor the energy of a monarchy that is absolute accordingly the crown has dwindled away in proportion to the unnatural and turgid growth of this excrescence on the court  the interior ministry are sensible that war is a situation which sets in its full light the value of the hearts of a people and they well know that the beginning of the importance of the people must be the end of theirs for this reason they discover upon all occasions the utmost fear of every thing which by possibility may lead to such an event i do not mean that they manifest any of that pious fear which is backward to commit the safety of the country to the dubious experiment of war such a fear being the tender sensation of virtue excited as it is regulated by reason frequently shows itself in a seasonable boldness which keeps danger at a distance by seeming to despise it their fear betrays to the first glance of the eye its true cause and its real object foreign powers confident in the knowledge of their character have not scrupled to violate the most solemn treaties and in defiance of them to make conquests in the midst of a general peace and in the heart of europe such was the conquest of corsica by the professed enemies of the freedom of mankind in defiance of those who were formerly its professed defenders we have had just claims upon the same powers rights which ought to have been sacred to them as well as to us as they had their origin in our lenity and generosity toward france and spain in the day of their great humiliation such i call the ransom of mamlia and the demand on france for the east india prisoners but these powers put a just confidence in their resource of the double cabinet these demands one of them at least are hastening fast toward an acquittal by prescription oblivion begins to spread her cobwebs over all our spirited remonstrances some of the most valuable branches of our trade are also on the point of perishing from the same cause i do not mean those branches which bear without the hand of the vinedresser i mean those which the policy of treaties had formerly secured to us i mean to mark and distinguish the trade of portugal the loss of which and the power of the cabal have one and the same era  if by any chance the ministers who stand before the curtain possess or affect any spirit it makes little or no impression foreign courts and ministers who were among the first to discover and to profit by this invention of the double cabinet attend very little to their remonstrances they know that those shadows of ministers have nothing to do in the ultimate disposal of things jealousies and animosities are sedulously nourished in the outward administration and have been even considered as a causa sine qua non in its constitution thence foreign courts have a certainty that nothing can be done by common counsel in this nation if one of those ministers officially takes up a business with spirit it serves only the better to signalize the meanness of the rest and the discord of them all his colleagues in office are in haste to shake him off and to disclaim the whole of his proceedings of this nature was that astonishing transaction in which lord rochford our ambassador at paris remonstrated against the attempt upon corsica in consequence of a direct authority from lord shelburne this remonstrance the french minister treated with the contempt that was natural as he was assured from the ambassador of his court to ours that these orders of lord shelburne were not supported by the rest of the i had like to have said british administration lord rochford a man of spirit could not endure this situation the consequences were however curious he returns from paris and comes home full of anger lord shelburne who gave the orders is obliged to give up the seals lord rochford who obeyed these orders receives them he goes however into another department of the same office that he might not be obliged officially to acquiesce in one situation under what he had officially remonstrated against in another at paris the duke of choiseul considered this office arrangement as a compliment to him here it was spoke of as an attention to the delicacy of lord rochford but whether the compliment was to one or both to this nation it was the same by this transaction the condition of our court lay exposed in all its nakedness our office correspondence has lost all pretense to authenticity british policy is brought into derision in those nations that a while ago trembled at the power of our arms whilst they looked up with confidence to the equity firmness and candor which shone in all our negotiations i represent this matter exactly in the light in which it has been universally received  such has been the aspect of our foreign politics under the influence of a double cabinet with such an arrangement at court it is impossible it should have been otherwise nor is it possible that this scheme should have a better effect upon the government of our dependencies the first the dearest and most delicate objects of the interior policy of this empire the colonies know that administration is separated from the court divided within itself and detested by the nation the double cabinet has in both the parts of it shown the most malignant dispositions toward them without being able to do them the smallest mischief  they are convinced by sufficient experience that no plan either of lenity or rigor can be pursued with uniformity and perseverance therefore they turn their eyes entirely from great britain where they have neither dependence on friendship nor apprehension from enmity they look to themselves and their own arrangements they grow every day into alienation from this country and whilst they are becoming disconnected with our government we have not the consolation to find that they are even friendly in their new independence nothing can equal the futility the weakness the rashness the timidity the perpetual contradiction in the management of our affairs in that part of the world a volume might be written on this melancholy subject but it were better to leave it entirely to the reflections of the reader himself than not to treat it in the extent it deserves  in what manner our domestic economy is affected by this system it is needless to explain it is the perpetual subject of their own complaints  the court party resolve the whole into faction having said something before upon this subject i shall only observe here that when they give this account of the prevalence of faction they present no very favorable aspect of the confidence of the people in their own government they may be assured that however they amuse themselves with a variety of projects for substituting something else in the place of that great and only foundation of government the confidence of the people every attempt will but make their condition worse when men imagine that their food is only a cover for poison and when they neither love nor trust the hand that serves it it is not the name of the roast beef of old england that will persuade them to sit down to the table that is spread for them when the people conceive that laws and tribunals and even popular assemblies are perverted from the ends of their institution they find in those names of degenerated establishments only new motives to discontent those bodies which when full of life and beauty lay in their arms and were their joy and comfort when dead and putrid become but the more loathsome from remembrance of former endearments a sullen gloom and furious disorder prevail by fits the nation loses its relish for peace and prosperity as it did in that season of fullness which opened our troubles in the time of charles the first a species of men to whom a state of order would become a sentence of obscurity are nourished into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of intestine disturbances and it is no wonder that by a sort of sinister piety they cherish in their turn the disorders which are the parents of all their consequence superficial observers consider such persons as the cause of the public uneasiness when in truth they are nothing more than the effect of it good men look upon this distracted scene with sorrow and indignation their hands are tied behind them they are despoiled of all the power which might enable them to reconcile the strength of government with the rights of the people they stand in a most distressing alternative but in the election among evils they hope better things from temporary confusion than from established servitude in the mean time the voice of law is not to be heard fierce licentiousness begets violent restraints the military arm is the sole reliance and then call your constitution what you please it is the sword that governs the civil power like every other that calls in the aid of an ally stronger than itself perishes by the assistance it receives but the contrivers of this scheme of government will not trust solely to the military power because they are cunning men their restless and crooked spirit drives them to rake in the dirt of every kind of expedient unable to rule the multitude they endeavor to raise divisions amongst them one mob is hired to destroy another a procedure which at once encourages the boldness of the populace and justly increases their discontent men become pensioners of state on account of their abilities in the array of riot and the discipline of confusion government is put under the disgraceful necessity of protecting from the severity of the laws that very licentiousness which the laws had been before violated to repress every thing partakes of the original disorder anarchy predominates without freedom and servitude without submission or subordination these are the consequences inevitable to our public peace from the scheme of rendering the executory government at once odious and feeble of freeing administration from the constitutional and salutary control of parliament and inventing for it a new control unknown to the constitution an interior cabinet which brings the whole body of government into confusion and contempt  after having stated as shortly as i am able the effects of this system on our foreign affairs on the policy of our government with regard to our dependencies and on the interior economy of the commonwealth there remains only in this part of my design to say something of the grand principle which first recommended this system at court the pretense was to prevent the king from being enslaved by a faction and made a prisoner in his closet this scheme might have been expected to answer at least its own end and to indemnify the king in his personal capacity for all the confusion into which it has thrown his government but has it in reality answered this purpose i am sure if it had every affectionate subject would have one motive for enduring with patience all the evils which attend it  in order to come at the truth in this matter it may not be amiss to consider it somewhat in detail i speak here of the king and not of the crown the interests of which we have already touched independent of that greatness which a king possesses merely by being a representative of the national dignity the things in which he may have an individual interest seem to be these wealth accumulated wealth spent in magnificence pleasure or beneficence personal respect and attention and above all private ease and repose of mind these compose the inventory of prosperous circumstances whether they regard a prince or a subject their enjoyments differing only in the scale upon which they are formed  suppose then we were to ask whether the king has been richer than his predecessors in accumulated wealth since the establishment of the plan of favouritism i believe it will be found that the picture of royal indigence which our court has presented until this year has been truly humiliating nor has it been relieved from this unseemly distress but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people and shaken their confidence in parliament if the public treasures had been exhausted in magnificence and splendor this distress would have been accounted for and in some measure justified nothing would be more unworthy of this nation than with a mean and mechanical rule to mete out the splendor of the crown indeed i have found very few persons disposed to so ungenerous a procedure but the generality of people it must be confessed do feel a good deal mortified when they compare the wants of the court with its expenses they do not behold the cause of this distress in any part of the apparatus of royal magnificence in all this they see nothing but the operations of parsimony attended with all the consequences of profusion nothing expended nothing saved their wonder is increased by their knowledge that besides the revenue settled on his majestys civil list to the amount of  00000 l a year he has a farther aid from a large pension list near  0000 l a year in ireland from the produce of the duchy of lancaster which we are told has been greatly improved from the revenue of the duchy of cornwall from the american quitrents from the four and a half per cent duty in the leeward islands this last worth to be sure considerably more than  0000 l a year the whole is certainly not much short of a million annually  these are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our national councils we have no direct right to examine into the receipts from his majestys german dominions and the bishopric of osnabrug this is unquestionably true but that which is not within the province of parliament is yet within the sphere of every mans own reflection if a foreign prince resided amongst us the state of his revenues could not fail of becoming the subject of our speculation filled with an anxious concern for whatever regards the welfare of our sovereign it is impossible in considering the miserable circumstances into which he has been brought that this obvious topic should be entirely passed over there is an opinion universal that these revenues produce something not inconsiderable clear of all charges and establishments this produce the people do not believe to be hoarded nor perceive to be spent it is accounted for in the only manner it can by supposing that it is drawn away for the support of that court faction which whilst it distresses the nation impoverishes the prince in every one of his resources i once more caution the reader that i do not urge this consideration concerning the foreign revenue as if i supposed we had a direct right to examine into the expenditure of any part of it but solely for the purpose of showing how little this system of favouritism has been advantageous to the monarch himself which without magnificence has sunk him into a state of unnatural poverty at the same time that he possessed every means of affluence from ample revenues both in this country and in other parts of his dominions  has this system provided better for the treatment becoming his high and sacred character and secured the king from those disgusts attached to the necessity of employing men who are not personally agreeable this is a topic upon which for many reasons i could wish to be silent but the pretense of securing against such causes of uneasiness is the cornerstone of the court party it has however so happened that if i were to fix upon any one point in which this system has been more particularly and shamefully blameable the effects which it has produced would justify me in choosing for that point its tendency to degrade the personal dignity of the sovereign and to expose him to a thousand contradictions and mortifications it is but too evident in what manner these projectors of royal greatness have fulfilled all their magnificent promises without recapitulating all the circumstances of the reign every one of which is more or less a melancholy proof of the truth of what i have advanced let us consider the language of the court but a few years ago concerning most of the persons now in the external administration let me ask whether any enemy to the personal feelings of the sovereign could possibly contrive a keener instrument of personal mortification and degradation of all dignity than almost every part and member of the present arrangement nor in the whole course of our history has any compliance with the will of the people ever been known to extort from any prince a greater contradiction to all his own declared affections and dislikes than that which is now adopted in direct opposition to every thing the people approve and desire  an opinion prevails that greatness has been more than once advised to submit to certain condescensions toward individuals which have been denied to the entreaties of a nation for the meanest and most dependent instrument of this system knows that there are hours when its existence may depend upon his adherence to it and he takes his advantage accordingly indeed it is a law of nature that whoever is necessary to what we have made our object is sure in some way or in some time or other to become our master all this however is submitted to in order to avoid that monstrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people for it seems to be laid down as a maxim that a king has some sort of interest in giving uneasiness to his subjects that all who are pleasing to them are to be of course disagreeable to him that as soon as the persons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people it is snatched at as a lucky occasion of showering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honors none are considered as wellwishers to the crown but those who advise to some unpopular course of action none capable of serving it but those who are obliged to call at every instant upon all its power for the safety of their lives none are supposed to be fit priests in the temple of government but the persons who are compelled to fly into it for sanctuary such is the effect of this refined project such is ever the result of all the contrivances which are used to free men from the servitude of their reason and from the necessity of ordering their affairs according to their evident interests these contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous servitude in order to avoid a supposed restraint that might be attended with advantage  if therefore this system has so ill answered its own grand pretense of saving the king from the necessity of employing persons disagreeable to him has it given more peace and tranquillity to his majestys private hours no most certainly the father of his people cannot possibly enjoy repose while his family is in such a state of distraction then what has the crown or the king profited by all this finewrought scheme is he more rich or more splendid or more powerful or more at his ease by so many labors and contrivances have they not beggared his exchequer tarnished the splendour of his court sunk his dignity galled his feelings discomposed the whole order and happiness of his private life  it will be very hard i believe to state in what respect the king has profited by that faction which presumptuously choose to call themselves his friends  if particular men had grown into an attachment by the distinguished honor of the society of their sovereign and by being the partakers of his amusements came sometimes to prefer the gratification of his personal inclinations to the support of his high character the thing would be very natural and it would be excusable enough but the pleasant part of the story is that these kings friends have no more ground for usurping such a title than a resident freeholder in cumberland or in cornwall they are only known to their sovereign by kissing his hand for the offices pensions and grants into which they have deceived his benignity may no strom ever come which will put the firmness of their attachment to the proof and which in the midst of confusions and terrors and sufferings may demonstrate the eternal difference between a true and severe friend to the monarchy and a slippery sycophant of the court quantum infido scurroe distabit amicus  so far i have considered the effect of the court system chiefly as it operates upon the executive government on the temper of the people and on the happiness of the sovereign it remains that we should consider with a little attention its operation upon parliament  parliament was indeed the great object of all these politics the end at which they aimed as well as the instrument by which they were to operate but before parliament could be made subservient to a system by which it was to be degraded from the dignity of a national council into a mere member of the court it must be greatly changed from its original character  in speaking of this body i have my eye chiefly on the house of commons i hope i shall be indulged in a few observations on the nature and character of that assembly not with regard to its legal form and power but to its spirit and to the purposes it is meant to answer in the constitution  the house of commons was supposed originally to be no part of the standing government of this country it was considered as a control issuing immediately from the people and speedily to be resolved into the mass from whence it arose in this respect it was in the higher part of government what juries are in the lower the capacity of a magistrate being transitory and that of a citizen permanent the latter capacity it was hoped would of course preponderate in all discussions not only between the people and the standing authority of the crown but between the people and the fleeting authority of the house of commons itself it was hoped that being of a middle nature between subject and government they would feel with a more tender and a nearer interest every thing that concerned the people than the other remoter and more permanent parts of legislature  whatever alterations time and the necessary accommodation of business may have introduced this character can never be sustained unless the house of commons shall be made to bear some stamp of the actual disposition of the people at large it would among public misfortunes be an evil more natural and tolerable that the house of commons should be infected with every epidemical phrensy of the people as this would indicate some consanguinity some sympathy of nature with their constituents than that they should in all cases be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors by this want of sympathy they would cease to be an house of commons for it is not the derivation of the power of that house from the people which makes it in a distinct sense their representative the king is the representative of the people so are the lords so are the judges they all are trustees for the people as well as the commons because no power is given for the sole sake of the holder and although government certainly is an institution of divine authority yet its forms and the persons who administer it all originate from the people  a popular origin cannot therefore be the characteristical distinction of a popular representative this belongs equally to all parts of government and in all forms the virtue spirit and essence of a house of commons consists in its being the express image of the feelings of the nation it was not instituted to be a control upon the people as of late it has been taught by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency it was designed as a control for the people other institutions have been formed for the purpose of checking popular excesses and they are i apprehend fully adequate to their object if not they ought to be made so the house of commons as it was never intended for the support of peace and subordination is miserably appointed for that service having no stronger weapon than its mace and no better officer than its sergeant at arms which it can command of its own proper authority a vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy an anxious care of public money an openness approaching toward facility to public complaint these seem to be the true characteristics of an house of commons but an addressing house of commons and a petitioning nation an house of commons full of considence when the nation is plunged in despair in the utmost harmony with ministers whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence who vote thanks when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments who are eager to grant when the general voice demands account who in all disputes between the people and administration presume against the people who punish their disorders but refuse even to enquire into the provocations to them this is an unnatural a monstrous state of things in this constitution such an assembly may be a great wise awful senate but it is not to any popular purpose an house of commons  this change from an immediate state of procuration and delegation to a course of acting as from original power is the way in which all the popular magistracies in the world have been perverted from their purposes it is indeed their greatest and sometimes their incurable corruption for there is a material distinction between that corruption by which particular points are carried against reason this is a thing which cannot be prevented by human wisdom and is of less consequence and the corruption of the principle itself for then the evil is not accidental but settled the distemper becomes the natural habit  for my part i shall be compelled to conclude the principle of parliament to be totally corrupted and therefore its ends entirely defeated when i see two symptoms first a rule of indiscriminate support to all ministers because this destroys their very end as a control and is a general previous sanction to misgovernment and secondly the setting up any claims adverse to the right of free election for this tends to subvert the legal authority by which they sit  i know that since the revolution along with many dangerous many useful powers of government have been weakened it is absolutely necessary to have frequent recourse to the legislature parliaments must therefore sit every year and for great part of the year the dreadsul disorders of frequent elections have also necessitated a septennial instead of a triennial duration these circumstances i mean the constant habit of authority and the unfrequency of elections have tended very much to draw the house of commons toward the character of a standing senate it is a disorder which has arisen from the cure of greater disorders it has arisen from the extreme difficulty of reconciling liberty under a monarchical government with external strength and with internal tranquillity  it is very clear that we cannot free ourselves entirely from this great inconvenience but i would not increase an evil because i was not able to remove it and because it was not in my power to keep the house of commons religiously true to its first principles i would not argue for carrying it to a total oblivion of them this has been the great scheme of power in our time they who will not conform their conduct to the public good and cannot support it by the prerogative of the crown have adopted a new plan they have totally abandoned the shattered and oldfashioned fortress of prerogative and made a lodgement in the trong hold of parliament itself if they have any evil design to which here is no ordinary legal power commensurate they bring it into pariament in parliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the end in parliament the power of obtaining their object is absolute and the safety in the proceeding perfect no rules to consine no afterreckonings to terrify parliament cannot with any great propriety punish others for things in which they themselves have been accomplices thus the control of parliament upon the executory power is lost because parliament is made to partake in every considerable act of government impeachment that great guardian of the purity of the constitution is in danger of being lost even to the idea of it  by this plan several important ends are answered to the cabal if the authority of parliament supports itself the credit of every act of government which they contrive is saved but if the act be so very odious that the whole strength of parliament is insufficient to recommend it then parliament is itself discredited and this discredit increases more and more that indifference to the constitution which it is the constant aim of its enemies by their abuse of parliamentary powers to render general among the people whenever parliament is persuaded to assume the offices of executive government it will lose all the confidence love and veneration which it has ever enjoyed whilst it was supposed the corrective and control of the acting powers of the state this would be the event though its conduct in such a perversion of its functions should be tolerably just and moderate but if it should be iniquitous violent full of passion and full of faction it would be considered as the most intolerable of all the modes of tyranny  for a considerable time this separation of the representatives from their constituents went on with a silent progress and had those who conducted the plan for their total separation been persons of temper and abilities any way equal to the magnitude of their design the success would have been infallible but by their precipitancy they have laid it open in all its nakedness the nation is alarmed at it and the event may not be pleasant to the contrivers of the scheme in the last session the corpse called the kings friends made an hardy attempt all at once to alter the right of election itself to put it into the power of the house of commons to disable any person disagreeable to them from sitting in parliament without any other rule than their own pleasure to make incapacities either general sor descriptions of men or particular for individuals and to take into their body persons who avowedly had never been chosen by the majority of legal electors nor agreeably to any known rule of law  the arguments upon which this claim was founded and combated are not my business here never has a subject been more amply and more learnedly handled nor upon one side in my opinion more satisfactorily they who are not convinced by what is already written would not receive conviction though one arose from the dead  i too have thought on this subject but my purpose here is only to consider it as a part of the favorite project of government to observe on the motives which led to it and to trace its political consequences  a violent rage for the punishment of mr wilkes was the pretense of the whole this gentleman by setting himself strongly in opposition to the court cabal had become at once an object of their persecution and of the popular favor the hatred of the court party pursuing and the countenance of the people protecting him it very soon became not at all a question on the man but a trial of strength between the two parties the advantage of the victory in this particular contest was the present but not the only nor by any means the principal object its operation upon the character of the house of commons was the great point in view the point to be gained by the cabal was this that a precedent should be established tending to show that the favor of the people was not so sure a road as the favor of the court even to popular honors and popular trusts a strenuous resistance to every appearance of lawless power a spirit of independence carried to some degree of enthusiasm an inquisitive character to discover and a bold one to display every corruption and every error of government these are the qualities which recommend a man to a seat in the house of commons in open and merely popular elections an indolent and submissive disposition a disposition to think charitably of all the actions of men in power and to live in a mutual intercourse of favors with them an inclination rather to countenance a strong use of authority than to bear any sort of licentiousness on the part of the people these are unfavourable qualities in an open election for members of parliament  the instinct which carries the people toward the choice of the former is justified by reason because a man of such a character even in its exorbitancies does not directly contradict the purposes of a trust the end of which is a control on power the latter character even when it is not in its extreme will execute this trust but very imperfectly and if deviating to the least excess will certainly frustrate instead of forwarding the purposes of a control on government but when the house of commons was to be new modelled this principle was not only to be changed but reversed whilst any errors committed in support of power were left to the law with every advantage of favorable construction of mitigation and finally of pardon all excesses on the side of liberty or in pursuit of popular favor or in defense of popular rights and privileges were not only to be punished by the rigor of the known law but by a discretionary proceeding which brought on the loss of the popular object itself popularity was to be rendered if not directly penal at least highly dangerous the favor of the people might lead even to a disqualification of representing them their odium might become strained through the medium of two or three constructions the means of sitting as the trustee of all that was dear to them this is punishing the offense in the offending part until this time the opinion of the people through the power of an assembly still in some sort popular led to the greatest honors and emoluments in the gift of the crown now the principle is reversed and the favor of the court is the only sure way of obtaining and holding those honors which ought to be in the disposal of the people  it signifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away example the only argument of effect in civil life demonstrates the truth of my proposition nothing can alter my opinion concerning the pernicious tendency of this example until i see some man for his indiscretion in the support of power for his violent and intemperate servility rendered incapable of sitting in parliament for as it now stands the fault of overstraining popular qualities and irregularly if you please asserting popular privileges has led to disqualification the opposite fault never has produced the slightest punishment resistance to power has shut the door of the house of commons to one man obsequiousness and servility to none  not that i would encourage popular disorder or any disorder but i would leave such offenses to the law to be punished in measure and proportion the laws of this country are for the most part constituted and wisely so for the general ends of government rather than for the preservation of our particular liberties whatever therefore is done in support of liberty by persons not in public trust or not acting merely in that trust is liable to be more or less out of the ordinary course of the law and the law itself is sufficient to animadvert upon it with great severity nothing indeed can hinder that severe letter from crushing us except the temperaments it may receive from a trial by jury but if the habit prevails of going beyond the law and superseding this judicature of carrying offenses real or supposed into the legislative bodies who shall establish themselves into courts of criminal equity so the star chamber has been called by lord bacon all the evils of the star chamber are revived a large and liberal construction in ascertaining offenses and a discretionary power in punishing them is the idea of criminal equity which is in truth a monster in jurisprudence it signifies nothing whether a court for this purpose be a committee of council or an house of commons or an house of lords the liberty of the subject will be equally subverted by it the true end and purpose of that house of parliament which entertains such a jurisdiction will be destroyed by it  i will not believe what no other man living believes that mr wilkes was punished for the indecency of his publications or the impiety of his ransacked closet if he had fallen in a common slaughter of libellers and blasphemers i could well believe that nothing more was meant than wapretended but when i see that for years together full as impious and perhaps more dangerous writings to religion and virtue and order have not been punished nor their authors discountenanced that the most audacious libels on royal majesty have passed without notice that the most treasonable invectives against the laws liberties and constitution of the country have not met with the slightest animadversion i must consider this as a shocking and shameless pretense never did an envenomed securrility against every thing sacred and civil public and private rage through the kingdom with such a furious and unbridled license all this while the peace of the nation must be shaken to ruin one libeller and to tear from the populace a single favorite  nor is it that vice merely skulks in an obscure and contemptible impunity does not the public behold with indignation persons not only generally scandalous in their lives but the identical persons who by their society their instruction their example their encouragement have drawn t is man into the very faults which have furnished the cabal with a pretense for his persecution loaded with every kind of favor honor and distinction which a court can bestow add but the crime of servility the foedum crimen servitutis to every other crime and the whole mass is immediately transmuted into virtue and becomes the just subject of reward and honor when therefore i reflect upon this method pursued by the cabal in distributing rewards and punishments i must conclude that mr wilkes is the object of persecution not on account of what he has done in common with others who are the objects of reward but for that in which he differs from many of them that he is pursued for the spirited dispositions which are blended with his vices for his unconquerable firmness for his resolute indefatigable strenuous resistance against oppression  in this case therefore it was not the man that was to be punished nor his faults that were to be discountenanced opposition to acts of power was to be marked by a kind of civil proscription the popularity which should arise from such an opposition was to be shown unable to protect it the qualities by which court is made to the people were to render every fault inexpiable and every error irretrievable the qualities by which court is made to power were to cover and to sanctify every thing he that will have a sure and honorable seat in the house of commons must take care how he adventures to cultivate popular qualities otherwise he may remember the old maxim breves et infaustos populi romani amores if therefore a pursuit of popularity expose a man to greater dangers than a disposition to servility the principle which is the life and soul of popular elections will perish out of the constitution  it behooves the people of england to consider how the house of commons under the operation of these examples must of necessity be constituted on the side of the court will be all honors offices emoluments every sort of personal gratification to avarice or vanity and what is of more moment to most gentlemen the means of growing by innumerable petty services to individuals into a spreading interest in their country on the other hand let us suppose a person unconnected with the court and in opposition to its system for his own person no office or emolument or title no promotion ecclesiastical or civil or military or naval for children or brothers or kindred in vain an expiring interest in a borough calls for offices or small livings for the children of mayors and aldermen and capital burgesses his court rival has them all he can do an infinite number of acts of generosity and kindness and even of public spirit he can procure indemnity from quarters he can procure advantages in trade he can get pardons for offenses he can obtain a thousand favors and avert a thousand evils he may while he betrays every valuable interest of the kingdom be a benefactor a patron a father a guardian angel to his borough the unfortunate independent member has nothing to offer but harsh refusal or pitiful excuse or despondent representation of an hopeless interest except from his private fortune in which he may be equalled perhaps exceeded by his court competitor he has no way of showing any one good quality or of making a single friend in the house he votes for ever in a dispirited minority if he speaks the doors are locked a body of loquacious placemen go out to tell the world that all he aims at is to get into office if he has not the talent of elocution which is the case of many as wise and knowing men as any in the house he is liable to all these inconveniences without the eclat which attends upon any tolerably successful exertion of eloquence can we conceive a more discouraging post of duty than this strip it of the poor reward of popularity suffer even the excesses committed in defense of the popular interest to become a ground for the majority of that house to form a disqualification out of the line of the law and at their pleasure attended not only with the loss of the franchise but with every kind of personal disgrace  if this shall happen the people of this kingdom may be assured that they cannot be firmly or faithfully served by any man it is out of the nature of men and things that they should and their presumption will be equal to their folly if they expect it the power of the people within the laws must show itself sufficient to protect every representative in the animated performance of his duty or that duty cannot be performed the house of commons can never be a control on other parts of governmen unless they are controlledthemselves by their constituents and unless these constituents possess some right in the choice of that house which it is not in the power of that house to take away if they suffer this power of arbitrary incapacitation to stand they have utterly perverted every other power of the house of commons the late proceeding i will not say is contrary to law it must be so for the power which is claimed cannot by any possibility be a legal power in any limited member of government  the power which they claim of declaring incapacities would not be above the just claims of a final judicature if they had not laid it down as a leading principle that they had no rule in the exercise of this claim but their own discretion not one of their abettors has ever undertaken to assign the principle of unfitness the species or degree of delinquency on which the house of commons will expel nor the mode of proceeding upon it nor the evidence upon which it is established the direct consequence of which is that the first franchise of an englishman and that on which all the rest vitally depend is to be forfeited for some offense which no man knows and which is to be proved by no known rule whatsoever of legal evidence this is so anomalous to our whole constitution that i will venture to say the most trivial right which the subject claims never was nor can be forfeited in such a manner  the whole of their usurpation is established upon this method of arguing we do not make laws no we do not contend for this power we only declare law and as we are a tribunal both competent and supreme what we declare to be law becomes law although it should not have been so before thus the circumstance of having no appeal from their jurisdiction is made to imply that they have no rule in the exercise of it the judgment does not derive its validity from its conformity to the law but preposterously the law is made to attend on the judgment and the rule of the judgment is no other than the occasional will of the house an arbitrary discretion leads legality follows which is just the very nature and description of a legislative act  this claim in their hands was no barren theory it was pursued into its utmost consequences and a dangerous principle has begot a correspondent practice a systematic spirit has been shown upon both sides the electors of middlesex chose a person whom the house of commons had voted incapable and the house of commons has taken in a member whom the electors of middlesex had not chosen by a construction on that legislative power which had been assumed they declared that the true legal sense of the county was contained in the minority on that occasion and might on a resistance to a vote of incapacity be contained in any minority  when any construction of law goes against the spirit of the privilege it was meant to support it is a vicious construction it is material to us to be represented really and bona fide and not in forms in types and shadows and fictions of law the right of election was not established merely as a matter of form to satisfy some method and rule of technical reasoning it was not a principle which might substitute a titius or a maevius a john do or richard roe in the place of a man specially chosen not a principle which was just as well satisfied with one man as with another it is a right the effect of which is to give to the people that man and that man only whom by their voices actually not constructively given they declare that they know esteem love and trust this right is a matter within their own power of judging and feeling not an ens rationis and creature of law nor can those devices by which any thing else is substituted in the place of such an actual choice answer in the least degree the end of representation  i know that the courts of law have made as strained constructions in other cases such is the construction in common recoveries the method of construction which in that case gives to the persons in remainder for their security and representative the doorkeeper crier or sweeper of the court or some other snadowy being without substance or effect is a fiction of a very coarse texture this was however suffered by the acquiescence of the whole kingdom for ages because the evasion of the old statute of westminster which authorized perpetuities had more sense and utility than the law which was evaded but an attempt to turn the right of election into such a farce and mockery as a fictitious fine and recovery will i hope have another fate because the laws which give it are infinitely dear to us and the evasion is infinitely contemptible  the people indeed have been told that this power of discretionary disqualification is vested in hands that they may trust and who will be sure not to abuse it to their prejudice until i find something in this argument disfering from that on which every mode of despotism has been defended i shall not be inclined to pay it any great compliment the people are satisfied to trust themselves with the exercise of their own privileges and do not desire this kind intervention of the house of commons to free them from the burden they are certainly in the right they ought not to trust the house of commons with a power over their franchises because the constitution which placed two other coordinate powers to control it reposed no such considence in that body it were a folly well deserving servitude for its punishment to be sull of confidence where the laws are sull of distrust and to give to an house of commons arrogating to its sole resolution the most harsh and odious part of legislative authority that degree of submission which is due only to the legislature itself  when the house of commons in an endeavor to obtain new advantages at the expense of the other orders of the state for the benefit of the commons at large have pursued strong measures if it were not just it was at least natural that the constituents should connive at all their proceedings because we were ourselves ultimately to profit but when this submission is urged to us in a contest between the representatives and ourselves and where nothing can be put into their scale which is not taken from ours they fancy us to be children when they tell us they are our representatives our own flesh and blood and that all the stripes they give us are for our good the very desire of that body to have such a trust contrary to law reposed in them shows that they are not worthy of it they certainly will abuse it because all men possessed of an uncontrolled discretionary power leading to the aggrandisement and profit of their own body have always abused it and i see no particular sanctity in our times that is at all likely by a miraculous operation to overrule the course of nature  but we must purposely shut our eyes if we consider this matter merelyas a contest between the house of commons and the electors the true contest is between the electors of the kingdom and the crown the crown acting by an instrumental house of commons it is precisely the same whether the ministers of the crown can disqualify by a dependent house of commons or by a dependent court of star chamber or by a dependent court of kings bench if once members of parliament can be practically convinced that they do not depend on the affection or opinion of the people for their political being they will give themselves over without even an appearance of reserve to the influence of the court  indeed a parliament unconnected with the people is essential to a ministry unconnected with the people and therefore those who saw through what mighty difficulties the interior ministry waded and the exterior were dragged in this business will conceive of what prodigious importance the new corpse of kings men held this principle of occasional and personal incapacitation to the whole body of their design  when the house of commons was thus made to consider itself as the master of its constituents there wanted but one thing to secure that house against all possible future deviation toward popularity an unlimited fund of money to be laid out according to the pleasure of the court  to complete the scheme of bringing our court to a resemblance to the neighboring monarchies it was necessary in effect to destroy those appropriations of revenue which seem to limit the property as the other laws had done the powers of the crown an opportunity for this purpose was taken upon an application to parliament for payment of the debts of the civil list which in      had amounted to    000 l such application had been made upon former occasions but to do it in the former manner would by no means answer the present purpose  whenever the crown had come to the commons to desire a supply for the discharging of debts due on the civil list it was always asked and granted with one of the three following qualifications sometimes with all of them either it was stated that the revenue had been diverted from its purposes by parliament or that those duties had fallen short of the sum for which they were given by parliament and that the intention of the legislature had not been fulfilled or that the money required to discharge the civil list debt was to be raised chargeable on the civil list duties in the reign of queen anne the crown was found in debt the lessening and granting away some part of her revenue by parliament was alleged as the cause of that debt and pleaded as an equitable ground such it certainly was for discharging it it does not appear that the duties which were then applied to the ordinary government produced clear above   0000 l a year because when they were afterward granted to george the first   0000 l was added to complete the whole to  00000 l a year indeed it was then asserted and i have no doubt truly that for many years the net produce did not amount to above   0000 l the queens extraordinary charges were besides very considerable equal at least to any we have known in our time the application to parliament was not for an absolute grant of money but to empower the queen to raise it by borrowing upon the civil list funds  the civil list debt was twice paid in the reign of george the first the money was granted upon the same plan which had been followed in the reign of queen anne the civil list revenues were then mortgaged for the sum to be raised and stood charged with the ransom of their own deliverance  george the second received an addition to his civil list duties were granted for the purpose of raising  00000 l a year it was not until he had reigned nineteen years and after the last rebellion that he called upon parliament for a discharge of the civil list debt the extraordinary charges brought on by the rebellion account fully for the necessities of the crown however the extraordinary charges of government were not thought a ground sit to be relied on  a deficiency of the civil list duties for several years before was stated as the principal if not the whole ground on which an application to parliament could be justified about this time the produce of these duties had fallen pretty low and even upon an average of the whole reign never produced  00000 l a year clear to the treasury  that prince reigned sourteen years afterward not only no new demands were made but with so much good order were his revenues and expenses regulated that although many parts of the establishment of the court were upon a larger and more liberal scale than they have been since there was a considerable sum in hand on his decease amounting to about   0000 l applicable to the service of the civil list of his present majesty so that if this reign commenced with a greater charge than usual there was enough and more than enough abundantly to supply all the extraordinary expense that the civil list should have been exceeded in the two former reigns especially in the reign of george the first was not at all surprising his revenue was but  00000 l annually if it ever produced so much clear the prodigious and dangerous disaffection to the very being of the establishment and the cause of a pretender then powerfully abetted from abroad produced many demands of an extraordinary nature both abroad and at home much management and great expenses were necessary but the throne of no prince has stood upon more unshaken foundations than that of his present majesty  to have exceeded the sum given for the civil list and to have incurred a debt without special authority of parliament was prima facie a criminal act as such ministers ought naturally rather to have withdrawn it from the inspection than to have exposed it to the scrutiny of parliament certainly they ought of themselves officiously to have come armed with every sort of argument which by explaining could excuse a matter in itself of presumptive guilt but the terrors of the house of commons are no longer for ministers  on the other hand the peculiar character of the house of commons as trustee of the public purse would have led them to call with a punctilious solicitude for every public account and to have examined into them with the most rigorous accuracy  the capital use of an account is that the reality of the charge the reason of incurring it and the justice and necessity of discharging it should all appear antecedent to the payment no man ever pays first and calls for his account afterward because he would thereby let out of his hands the principal and indeed only effectual means of compelling a full and fair one but in national business there is an additional reason for a previous production of every account it is a check perhaps the only one upon a corrupt and prodigal use of public money an account after payment is to no rational purpose an account however the house of commons thought all these to be antiquated principles they were of opinion that the most parliamentary way of proceeding was to pay first what the court thought proper to demand and to take its chance for an examination into accounts at some time of greater leisure  the nation had settled  00000 l a year on the crown as sufficient for the support of its dignity upon the estimate of its own ministers when ministers came to parliament and said that this allowance had not been sufficient for the purpose and that they had incurred a debt of  00000 l would it not have been natural for parliament first to have asked how and by what means their appropriated allowance came to be insufficient would it not have savoured of some attention to justice to have seen in what periods of administration this debt had been originally incurred that they might discover and if need were animadvert on the persons who were found the most culpable to put their hands upon such articles of expenditure as they thought improper or excessive and to secure in future against such misapplication or exceeding accounts for any other purposes are but a matter of curiosity and no genuine parliamentary object all the accounts which could answer any of these purposes were refused or postponed by previous questions every idea of prevention was rejected as conveying an improper suspicion of the ministers of the crown  when every leading account had been refused many others were granted with sufficient facility but with great candor also the house was informed that hardly any of them could be ready until the next session some of them perhaps not so soon but in order firmly to establish the precedent of payment previous to account and to form it into a settled rule of the house the god in the machine was brought down nothing less than the wonderworking law of parliament it was alledged that it is the law of parliament when any demand comes from the crown that the house must go immediately into the committee of supply in which committee it was allowed that the production and examination of accounts would be quite proper and regular it was therefore carried that they should go into the committee without delay and without accounts in order to examine with great order and regularity things that could not possibly come before them after this stroke of orderly and parliamentary wit and humor they went into the committee and very generously voted the payment  there was a circumstance in that debate too remarkable to be overlooked this debt of the civil list was all along argued upon the same footing as a debt of the state contracted upon national authority its payment was urged as equally pressing upon the public faith and honor and when the whole years account was stated in what is called the budget the ministry valued themselves on the payment of so much public debt just is if they had discharged  00000 l of navy or exchequer bills though in truth their payment from the sinking fund of debt which was never contracted by parliamentary authority was to all intents and purposes so much debt incurred but such is the present notion of public credit and payment of debt no wonder that it produces such effects  nor was the house at all more attentive to a provident security against future than it had been to a vindictive retrospect to past mismanagements i should have thought indeed that a ministerial promise during their own continuance in office might have been given though this would have been but a poor security for the public mr pelham gave such an assurance and he kept his word but nothing was capable of extorting from our ministers any thing which had the least resemblance to a promise of confining the expenses of the civil list within the limits which had been settled by parliament this reserve of theirs i look upon to be equivalent to the clearest declaration that they were resolved upon a contrary course  however to put the matter beyond all doubt in the speech from the throne after thanking parliament for the relief so liberally granted the ministers inform the two houses that they will endeavor to confine the expenses of the civil government  within what limits think you those which the law had prescribed not in the least  such limits as the honor of the crown can possibly admit  thus they established an arbitrary standard for that dignity which parliament had defined and limited to a legal standard they gave themselves under the lax and indeterminate idea of the honor of the crown a full loose for all manner of dissipation and all manner of corruption this arbitrary standard they were not afraid to hold out to both houses while an idle and unoperative act of parliament estimating the dignity of the crown at  00000 l and confining it to that sum adds to the number of obsolete statutes which load the shelves of libraries without any sort of advantage to the people  after this proceeding i suppose that no man can be so weak as to think that the crown is limited to any settled allowance whatsoever for if the ministry has  00000 l a year by the law of the land and if by the law of parliament all the debts which exceed it are to be paid previous to the production of any account i presume that this is equivalent to an income with no other limits than the abilities of the subject and the moderation of the court that is to say it is such an income as is possessed by every absolute monarch in europe it amounts as a person of great ability said in the debate to an unlimited power of drawing upon the sinking fund its effect on the public credit of this kingdom must be obvious for in vain is the sinking fund the great buttress of all the rest if it be in the power of the ministry to resort to it for the payment of any debts which they may choose to incur under the name of the civil list and through the medium of a committee which thinks itself obliged by law to vote supplies without any other account than that of the mere existence of the debt  five hundred thousand pounds is a serious sum but it is nothing to the prolific principle upon which the sum was voted a principle that may be well called the fruitful mother of an hundred more neither is the damage to public credit of very great consequence when compared with that which results to public morals and to the safety of the constitution from the exhaustless mine of corruption opened by the precedent and to be wrought by the principle of the late payment of the debts of the civil list the power of discretionary disqualification by one law of parliament and the necessity of paying every debt of the civil list by another law of parliament if suffered to pass unnoticed must establish such a fund of rewards and terrors as will make parliament the best appendage and support of arbitrary power that ever was invented by the wit of man this is felt the quarrel is begun between the representatives and the people the court faction have at length committed them  in such a strait the wisest may well be perplexed and the boldest staggered the circumstances are in a great measure new we have hardly any landmarks from the wisdom of our ancestors to guide us at best we can only follow the spirit of their proceeding in other cases i know the diligence with which my observations on our public disorders have been made i am very sure of the integrity of the motives on which they are published i cannot be equally confident in any plan for the absolute cure of those disorders or for their certain future prevention my aim is to bring this matter into more public discussion let the sagacity of others work upon it it is not uncommon for medical writers to describe histories of diseases very accurately on whose cure they can say but very little  the first ideas which generally suggest themselves for the cure of parliamentary disorders are to shorten the duration of parliaments and to disqualify all or a great number of placemen from a seat in the house of commons whatever efficacy there may be in those remedies i am sure in the present state of things it is impossible to apply them a restoration of the right of free election is a preliminary indispensable to every other reformation what alterations ought afterward to be made in the constitution is a matter of deep and difficult research  if i wrote merely to please the popular palate it would indeed be as little troublesome to me as to another to extol these remedies so famous in speculation but to which their greatest admirers have never attempted seriously to resort in practice i confess then that i have no sort of reliance upon either a triennial parliament or a placebill with regard to the former perhaps it might rather serve to counteract than to promote the ends that are proposed by it to say nothing of the horrible disorders among the people attending frequent elections i should be fearful of committing every three years the independent gentlemen of the country into a contest with the treasury it is easy to see which of the contending parties would be ruined first whoever has taken a careful view of public proceedings so as to endeavor to ground his speculations on his experience must have observed how prodigiously greater the power of ministry is in the first and last session of a parliament than it is in the intermediate period when members sit a little firm on their seats the persons of the greatest parliamentary experience with whom i have conversed did constantly in canvassing the fate of questions allow something to the courtside upon account of the elections depending or imminent the evil complained of if it exists in the present state of things would hardly be removed by a triennial parliament for unless the influence of government in elections can be entirely taken away the more frequently they return the more they will harrass private independence the more generally men will be compelled to fly to the settled systematic interest of government and to the resources of a boundless civil list certainly something may be done and ought to be done toward lessening that influence in elections and this will be necessary upon a plan either of longer or shorter duration of parliament but nothing can so perfectly remove the evil as not to render such contentions too frequently repeated utterly ruinous first to independence of fortune and then to independence of spirit as i am only giving an opinion on this point and not at all debating it in an adverse line i hope i may be excused in another observation with great truth i may aver that i never remember to have talked on this subject with any man much conversant with public business who considered short parliaments as a real improvement of the constitution gentlemen warm in a popular cause are ready enough to attribute all the declarations of such persons to corrupt motives but the habit of affairs if on one hand it tends to corrupt the mind furnishes it on the other with the means of better information the authority of such persons will always have some weight it may stand upon a par with the speculations of those who are less practiced in business and who with perhaps purer intentions have not so effectual means of judging it is besides an effect of vulgar and puerile malignity to imagine that every statesman is of course corrupt and that his opinion upon every constitutional point is solely formed upon some sinister interest  the next favorite remedy is a placebill the same principle guides in both i mean the opinion which is entertained by many of the infallibility of laws and regulations in the cure of public distempers without being as unreasonably doubtful as many are unwisely confident i will only say that this also is a matter very well worthy of serious and mature reflection it is not easy to foresee what the effect would be of disconnecting with parliament the greatest part of those who hold civil employments and of such mighty and important bodies as the military and naval establishments it were better perhaps that they should have a corrupt interest in the forms of the constitution than that they should have none at all this is a question altogether different from the disqualification of a particular description of revenue officers from seats in parliament or perhaps of all the lower sorts of them from votes in elections in the former case only the few are affected in the latter only the inconsiderable but a great official a great professional a great military and naval interest all necessarily comprehending many people of the first weight ability wealth and spirit has been gradually formed in the kingdom these new interests must be let into a share of representation else possibly they may be inclined to destroy those institutions of which they are not permitted to partake this is not a thing to be trifled with nor is it every wellmeaning man that is fit to put his hands to it many other serious considerations occur i do not open them here because they are not directly to my purpose proposing only to give the reader some taste of the difficulties that attend all capital changes in the constitution just to hint the uncertainty to say no worse of preventing the court as long as it has the means of influence abundantly in its power of applying that influence to parliament and perhaps if the public method were precluded of doing it in some worse and more dangerous method underhand and oblique ways would be studied the sciene of evasion already tolerably understood would then be brought to the greatest perfection it is no inconsiderable part of wisdom to know how much of an evil ought to be tolerated lest by attempting a degree of purity impracticable in degenerate times and manners instead of cutting off the subsisting ill practices new corruptions might be produced for the concealment and security of the old it were better undoubtedly that no influence at all could affect the mind of a member of parliament but of all modes of influence in my opinion a place under the government is the least disgraceful to the man who holds it and by far the most safe to the country i would not shut out that sort of influence which is open and visible which is connected with the dignity and the service of the state when it is not in my power to prevent the influence of contracts of subscriptions of direct bribery and those innumerable methods of clandestine corruption which are abundantly in the hands of the court and which will be applied as long as these means of corruption and the disposition to be corrupted have existence amongst us our constitution stands on a nice equipoise with steep precipices and deep waters upon all sides of it in removing it from a dangerous leaning toward one side there may be a risque of oversetting it on the other every project of a material change in a government so complicated as ours combined at the same time with external circumstances still more complicated is a matter full of difficulties in which a considerate man will not be too ready to decide a prudent man too ready to undertake or an honest man too ready to promise they do not respect the public nor themselves who engage for more than they are sure that they ought to attempt or that they are able to perform these are my sentiments weak perhaps but honest and unbiassed and submitted entirely to the opinion of grave men well affected to the constitution of their country and of experience in what may best promote or hurt it  indeed in the situation in which we stand with an immense revenue an enormous debt mighty establishments government itself a great banker and a great merchant i see no other way for the preservation of a decent attention to public interest in the representatives but the interposition of the body of the people itself whenever it shall appear by some flagrant and notorious act by some capital innovation that these representatives are going to overleap the fences of the law and to introduce an arbitrary power this interposition is a most unpleasant remedy but if it is a legal remedy it is intended on some occasion to be used to be used then only when it is evident that nothing else can hold the constitution to its true principles  the distempers of monarchy were the great subjects of apprehension and redress in the last century in this the distempers of parliament it is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary disorders can be completed hardly indeed can it begin there until a confidence in government is reestablished the people ought to be excited to a more strict and detailed attention to the conduct of their representatives standards for judging more systematically upon their conduct ought to be settled in the meetings of counties and corporations frequent and correct lists of the voters in all important questions ought to be procured  by such means something may be done by such means it may appear who those are that by an indiscriminate support of all administrations have totally banished all integrity and confidence out of public proceedings have confounded the best men with the worst and weakened and dissolved instead of strengthening and compacting the general frame of government if any person is more concerned for government and order than for the liberties of his country even he is equally concerned to put an end to this course of indiscriminate support it is this blind and undistinguishing support that feeds the spring of those very disorders by which he is frighted into the arms of that faction which contains in itself the source of all disorders by enfeebling all the visible and regular authority of the state the distemper is increased by his judicious and preposterous endeavors or pretenses for the cure of it  an exterior administration chosen for its impotency or after it is chosen purposely rendered impotent in order to be rendered subservient will not be obeyed the laws themselves will not be respected when those who execute them are despised and they will be despised when their power is not immediate from the crown or natural in the kingdom never were ministers better supported in parliament parliamentary support comes and goes with office totally regardless of the man or the merit is government strengthened it grows weaker and weaker the popular torrent gains upon it every hour let us learn from our experience it is not support that is wanting to government but reformation when ministry rests upon public opinion it is not indeed built upon a rock of adamant but when it stands upon private humor its structure is of stubble and its foundation is on quicksand i repeat it again he that supports every administration subverts all government as the whole business in which courts usually take an interest goes on at present equally well in whatever hands whether high or low wise or foolish scandalous or reputable there is nothing to hold it firm to any one body of men or to any one consistents cheme of politics nothing interposes to prevent the full operation of all the caprices and all the passions of a court upon the servants of the public the system of administration is therefore open to continual shocks and changes upon the principles of the meanest cabal and the most contemptible intrigue nothing can be solid and permanent all good men at length fly with horror from such a service men of rank and ability with the spirit which ought to animate such men in a free state while they decline the jurisdiction of dark cabal on their actions and their fortunes will for both cheerfully put themselves upon their country they will trust an inquisitive and distinguishing parliament because it does enquire and does distinguish if they act well they know that in such a parliament they will be supported against any intrigue if they act ill they know that no intrigue can protect them this situation however aweful is honorable but in one hour and in the selfsame assembly without any assigned or assignable cause to be precipitated from the highest authority to the most marked neglect possibly into the greatest peril of life and reputation is a situation full of danger and destitute of honor it will be shunned equally by every man of prudence and every man of spirit  such are the consequences of the division of the court from the administration and of the division of public men among themselves by the former of these lawful government is undone by the latter all opposition to lawless power is rendered impotent government may in a great measure be restored if any considerable bodies of men have honesty and resolution enough never to accept administration unless this garrison of kings men which is stationed as in a citadel to control and enslave it be entirely broken and disbanded and every work they have thrown up be leveled with the ground the disposition of public men to keep this corpse together and to act under it or to cooperate with it is a touchstone by which every administration ought in future to be tried there has not been one which has not sufficiently experienced the utter incompatibility of that faction with the public peace and with all the ends of good government since if they opposed it they soon lost every power of serving the crown if they submitted to it they lost all the esteem of their country until ministers give to the public a full proof of their entire alienation from that system however plausible their pretenses we may be sure they are more intent on the emoluments than the duties of office if they refuse to give this proof we know of what stuff they are made in this particular it ought to be the electors business to look to their representatives the electors ought to esteem it no less culpable in their member to give a single vote in parliament to such an administration than to take an office under it to endure it than to act in it the notorious infidelity and versatility of members of parliament in their opinions of men and things ought in a particular manner to be considered by the electors in the inquiry which is recommended to them this is one of the principal holdings of that destructive system which has endeavored to unhinge all the virtuous honorable and useful connexions in the kingdom  this cabal has with great success propagated a doctrine which serves for a color to those acts of treachery and whilst it receives any degree of countenance it will be utterly senseless to look for a vigorous opposition to the court party the doctrine is this that all political connexions are in their nature factious and as such ought to be dissipated and destroyed and that the rule for forming administrations is mere personal ability on the judgment of this cabal upon it taken by draughts from every division and denomination of public men this decree was solemnly promulgated by the head of the court corpse the earl of bute himself in a speech which he made in the year      against the then administration the only administration which he has ever been known directly and publicly to oppose  it is indeed in no way wonderful that such persons should make such declarations that connection and faction are equivalent terms is an opinion which has been carefully inculcated at all times by unconstitutional statesmen the reason is evident whilst men are linked together they easily and speedily communicate the alarm of any evil design they are enabled to sathom it with common counsel and to oppose it with united strength whereas when they lie dispersed without concert order or discipline communication is uncertain counsel difficult and resistance impracticable where men are not acquainted with each others principles nor experienced in each others talents nor at all practiced in their mutual habitudes and dispositions by joint efforts in business no personal confidence no friendship no common interest subsisting among them it is evidently impossible that they can act a public part with uniformity perseverance or efficacy in a connection the most inconsiderable man by adding to the weight of the whole has his value and his use out of it the greatest talents are wholly unserviceable to the public no man who is not inflamed by vainglory into enthusiasm can flatter himself that his single unsupported desultory unsystematic endeavors are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens when bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle  it is not enough in a situation of trust in the commonwealth that a man means well to his country it is not enough that in his single person he never did an evil act but always voted according to his conscience and even harangued against every design which he apprehended to be prejudicial to the interests of his country this innoxious and ineffectual character that seems formed upon a plan of apology and disculpation falls miserably short of the mark of public duty that duty demands and requires that what is right should not only be made known but made prevalent that what is evil should not only be detected but defeated when the public man omits to put himself in a situation of doing his duty with effect it is an omission that frustrates the purposes of his trust almost as much as if he had formally betrayed it it is surely no very rational account of a mans life that he has always acted right but has taken special care to act in such a manner that his endeavors could not possibly be productive of any consequence  i do not wonder that the behavior of many parties should have made persons of tender and scrupulous virtue somewhat out of humor with all sorts of connection in politics i admit that people frequently acquire in such confederacies a narrow bigoted and proscriptive spirit that they are apt to sink the idea of the general good in this circumscribed and partial interest but where duty renders a critical situation a necessary one it is our business to keep free from the evils attendant upon it and not to fly from the situation itself if a fortress is seated in an unwholesome air an officer of the garrison is obliged to be attentive to his health but he must not desert his station every profession not excepting the glorious one of a soldier or the sacred one of a priest is liable to its own particular vices which however form no argument against those ways of lise nor are the vices themselves inevitable to every individual in those professions of such a nature are connexions in politics essentially necessary for the full performance of our public duty accidentally liable to degenerate into faction commonwealths are made of families free commonwealths of parties also and we may as well affirm that our natural regards and ties of blood tend inevitably to make men bad citizens as that the bonds of our party weaken those by which we are held to our country  some legislators went so far as to make neutrality in party a crime against the state i do not know whether this might not have been rather to overstrain the principle certain it is the best patriots in the greatest commonwealths have always commended and promoted such connexions idem sentire de republica was with them a principal ground of friendship and attachment nor do i know any other capable of forming firmer dearer more pleasing more honorable and more virtuous habitudes the romans carried this principle a great way even the holding of offices together the disposition of which arose from chance not selection gave rise to a relation which continued for life it was called necessitudo sortis and it was looked upon with a sacred reverence breaches of any of these kinds of civil relation were considered as acts of the most distinguished turpitude the whole people was distributed into political societies in which they acted in support of such interests in the state as they severally affected for it was then thought no crime to endeavor by every honest means to advance to superiority and power those of your own sentiments and opinions this wise people was far from imagining that those connexions had no tie and obliged to no duty but that men might quit them without shame upon every call of interest they believed private honor to be the great foundation of public trust that friendship was no mean step toward patriotism that he who in the common intercourse of life showed he regarded somebody besides himself when he came to act in a public situation might probably consult some other interest than his own never may we become plus sages que les sages as the french comedian has happily expressed it wiser than all the wise and good men who have lived before us it was their wish to see public and private virtues not dissonant and jarring and mutually destructive but harmoniously combined growing out of one another in a noble and orderly gradation reciprocally supporting and supported in one of the most fortunate periods of our history this country was governed by a connection i mean the great connection of whigs in the reign of q anne they were complimented upon the principle of this connection by a poet who was in high esteem with them addison who knew their sentiments could not praise them for what they considered as no proper subject of commendation as a poet who knew his business he could not appland them for a thing which in general estimation was not highly reputable addressing himself to britain thy favorites grow not up by fortunes sport or from the crimes or follies of a court on the firm basis of desert they rise from longtryd faith and friendships holy ties   the whigs of those days believed that the only proper method of rising into power was through hard essays of practiced friendship and experimented fidelity at that time it was not imagined that patriotism was a bloody idol which required the sacrifice of children and parents or dearest connexions in private life and of all the virtues that rise from those relations they were not of that ingenious paradoxical morality to imagine that a spirit of moderation was properly shown in patiently bearing the sufferings of your friends or that disinterestedness was clearly manifested at the expense of other peoples fortune they believed that no men could act with effect who did not act in concert that no men could act in concert who did not act with confidence and that no men could act with confidence who were not bound together by common opinions common affections and common interests  these wise men for such i must call lord sunderland lord godolphin lord summers and lord marlborough were too well principled in these maxims upon which the whole fabric of public strength is built to be blown off their ground by the breath of every childish talker they were not afraid that they should be called an ambitious junto or that their resolution to stand or fall together should by placemen be interpreted into a scuffle for places  party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavors the national interest upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed for my part i find it impossible to conceive that any one believes in his own politics or thinks them to be of any weight who refuses to adopt the means of having them reduced into practice it is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the proper ends of government it is the business of the politician who is the philosopher in action to find out proper means toward those ends and to employ them with effect therefore every honorable connection will avow it as their first purpose to pursue every just method to put the men who hold their opinions into such a condition as may enable them to carry their common plans into execution with all the power and authority of the state as this power is attached to certain situations it is their duty to contend for these situations without a proscription of others they are bound to give to their own party the preference in all things and by no means for private considerations to accept any offers of power in which the whole body is not included nor to suffer themselves to be led or to be controlled or to be overbalanced in office or in council by those who contradict the very fundamental principles on which their party is formed and even those upon which every fair connection must stand such a generous contention for power on such manly and honorable maxims will easily be distinguished from the mean and interested struggle for place and emolument the very style of such persons will serve to discriminate them from those numberless impostors who have deluded the ignorant with professions incompatible with human practice and have afterward incensed them by practices below the level of vulgar rectitude  it is an advantage to all narrow wisdom and narrow morals that their maxims have a plausible air and on a cursory view appear equal to first principles they are light and portable they are as current as coppercoin and about as valuable they serve equally the first capacities and the lowest and they are at least as useful to the worst men as the best of this stamp is the cant of not men but measures a sort of charm by which many people get loose from every honorable engagement when i see a man acting this desultory and disconnected part with as much detriment to his own fortune as prejudice to the cause of any party i am not persuaded that he is right but i am ready to believe he is in earnest i respect virtue in all its situations even when it is found in the unsuitable company of weakness i lament to see qualities rare and valuable squandered away without any public utility but when a gentleman with great visible emoluments abandons the party in which he has long acted and tells you it is because he proceeds upon his own judgment that he acts on the merits of the several measures as they arise and that he is obliged to follow his own conscience and not that of others he gives reasons which it is impossible to controvert and discovers a character which it is impossible to mistake what shall we think of him who never differed from a certain set of men until the moment they lost their power and who never agreed with them in a single instance afterward would not such a coincidence of interest and opinion be rather fortunate would it not be an extraordinary cast upon the dice that a mans connexions should degenerate into faction precisely at the critical moment when they lose their power or he accepts a place when people desert their connexions the desertion is a manifest fact upon which a direct simple issue lies triable by plain men whether a measure of government be right or wrong is no matter of fact but a mere affair of opinion on which men may as they do dispute and wrangle without end but whether the individual thinks the measure right or wrong is a point at still a greater distance from the reach of all human decision it is therefore very convenient to politicians not to put the judgment of their conduct on overtacts cognizable in any ordinary court but upon such matter as can be triable only in that secret tribunal where they are sure of being heard with savor or where at worst the sentence will be only private whipping  i believe the reader would wish to find no substance in a doctrine which has a tendency to destroy all test of character as deduced from conduct he will therefore excuse my adding something more toward the further clearing up a point which the great convenience of obscurity to dishonesty has been able to cover with some degree of darkness and doubt  in order to throw an odium on political connection these politicians suppose it a necessary incident to it that you are blindly to follow the opinions of your party when in direct opposition to your own clear ideas a degree of servitude that no worthy man could bear the thought of submitting to and such as i believe no connexions except some court factions ever could be so senselessly tyrannical as to impose men thinking freely will in particular instances think differently but still as the greater part of the measures which arise in the course of public business are related to or dependent on some great leading general principles in government a man must be peculiarly unfortunate in the choice of his political company if he does not agree with them at least nine times in ten if he does not concur in these general principles upon which the party is founded and which necessarily draw on a concurrence in their application he ought from the beginning to have chosen some other more conformable to his opinions when the question is in its nature doubtful or not very material the modesty which becomes an individual and in spite of our court moralists that partiality which becomes a wellchosen friendship will frequently bring on an acquiescence in the general sentiment thus the disagreement will naturally be rare it will be only enough to indulge freedom without violating concord or disturbing arrangement and this is all that ever was required for a character of the greatest uniformity and steadiness in connection how men can proceed without any connection at all is to me utterly incomprehensible of what sort of materials must that man be made how must he be tempered and put together who can sit whole years in parliament with five hundred and fifty of his fellow citizens amidst the storm of such tempestuous passions in the sharp conflict of so many wits and tempers and characters in the agitation of such mighty questions in the discussion of such vast and ponderous interests without seeing any one sort of men whose character conduct or disposition would lead him to associate himself with them to aid and be aided in any one system of public utility  i remember an old scholastic aphorism which says that the man who lives wholly detached from others must be either an angel or a devil when i see in any of these detached gentlemen of our times the angelic purity power and beneficence i shall admit them to be angels in the mean time we are born only to be men we shall do enough if we form ourselves to be good ones it is therefore our business carefully to cultivate in our minds to rear to the most perfect vigor and maturity every sort of generous and honest feeling that belongs to our nature to bring the dispositions that are lovely in private life into the service and conduct of the commonwealth so to be patriots as not to forget we are gentlemen to cultivate friendships and to incur enmities to have both strong but both selected in the one to be placable in the other immovable to model our principles to our duties and our situation to be fully persuaded that all virtue which is impracticable is spurious and rather to run the risque of falling into faults in a course which leads us to act with effect and energy than to loiter out our days without blame and without use public life is a situation of power and energy he trespasses against his duty who sleeps upon his watch as well as he that goes over to the enemy  there is however a time for all things it is not every conjuncture which calls with equal force upon the activity of honest men but critical exigences now and then arise and i am mistaken if this be not one of them men will see the necessity of honest combination but they may see it when it is too late they may embody when it will be ruinous to themselves and of no advantage to the country when for want of such a timely union as may enable them to oppose in favor of the laws with the laws on their side they may at length find themselves under the necessity of conspiring instead of consulting the law for which they stand may become a weapon in the hands of its bitterest enemies and they will be cast at length into that miserable alternative between slavery and civil confusion which no good man can look upon without horror an alternative in which it is impossible he should take either part with a conscience perfectly at repose to keep that situation of guilt and remorse at the utmost distance is therefore our first obligation early activity may prevent late and fruitless violence as yet we work in the light the scheme of the enemies of public tranquillity has disarranged it has not destroyed us  if the reader believes that there really exists such a faction as i have described a faction ruling by the private inclinations of a court against the general sense of the people and that this faction whilst it pursues a scheme for undermining all the foundations of our freedom weakens for the present at least all the powers of executory government rendering us abroad contemptible and at home distracted he will believe also that nothing but a firm combination of public men against this body and that too supported by the hearty concurrence of the people at large can possibly get the better of it the people will see the necessity of restoring public men to an attention to the public opinion and of restoring the constitution to its original principles above all they will endeavor to keep the house of commons from assuming a character which does not belong to it they will endeavor to keep that house for its existence for its powers and its privileges as independent of every other and as dependent upon themselves as possible this servitude is to an house of commons like the obedience to the divine law perfect freedom for if they once quit this natural rational and liberal obedience having deserted the only proper foundation of their power they must seek a support in an abject and unnatural dependence somewhere else when through the medium of this just connection with their constituents the genuine dignity of the house of commons is restored it will begin to think of casting from it with scorn as badges of servility all the false ornaments of illegal power with which it has been for some time disgraced it will begin to think of its old office of control it will not suffer that last of evils to predominate in the country men without popular confidence public opinion natural connection or mutual trust invested with all the powers of government  when they have learned this lesson themselves they will be willing and able to teach the court that it is the true interest of the prince to have but one administration and that one composed of those who recommend themselves to their sovereign through the opinion of their country and not by their obsequiousness to a favorite such men will serve their sovereign with affection and fidelity because his choice of them upon such principles is a compliment to their virtue they will be able to serve him effectually because they will add the weight of the country to the force of the executory power they will be able to serve their king with dignity because they will never abuse his name to the gratification of their private spleen or avarice this with allowances for human frailty may probably be the general character of a ministry which thinks itself accountable to the house of commons when the house of commons thinks itself accountable to its constituents if other ideas should prevail things must remain in their present confusion until they are hurried into all the rage of civil violence or until they sink into the dead repose of despotism  the end
