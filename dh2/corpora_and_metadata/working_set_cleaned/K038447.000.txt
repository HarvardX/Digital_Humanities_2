the iron chest a play in three acts written by george colman the younger with a preface  first represented at the theater royal drury lane on saturday   th march       the principal characters  by mr kemble etc  drury lane playbill i had as lieve the towncrier had spoke my lines shakespeare dublin printed by thomas burnside for p wogan j rice and g folingsby       preface having been for some time a labourer in the drama and finding it necessary to continue my labors i cannot help endeavoring to guard the past from misrepresentation lest my supineness may injure the future conscious that a prejudice has been created against the play which i now submit to the reader and conscious how far i am innocent of raising it it were stupid to sit down in silence and thus tacitly acknowledge myself guilty of dullness  dumbly confess i have been deficient in the knowledge of my trade damn myself for a bungling workman and fix a disrepute upon every article which may hereafter come from my hands  thanks to you ladies and gentlemen you have been kind customers to me and i am proud to say that you have stamped a fashion upon my goods base indeed and ungrateful were the attempt after your favors so long received and continued to impose upon you a clumsy commodity and boast it to be ware of the best quality that i ever put up to sale no  on the word of an honest man i have bestowed no small pains upon this iron chest which i offer you inspect it examine it you see the makers name is upon it i do not say it is perfect i do not pretend to tell you it is of the highest polish there is no occasion for that  many of my brethren have presented you with mere linings for chests and you have been content  but i trust you will find that my iron chest will hold together that it is tolerably sound and fit for all the purposes for which it was intended  then how came it to fall to pieces after four days wear  i will explain that  but alas alas my heart does yearn when i think on the task which circumstance has thrust upon me  now by the spirit of peace i swear were i not doomed to explore the rugged windings of the drama i would wrap myself in mute philosophy and repose calmly under the dark shade of my grievance rather than endure the pain and trouble of this explanation  i cannot however cry let the world slide i must pursue my journey and be active to clear away the obstacles that impede my progress  i am too callous now to be annoyed by those innumerable gnats and insects who daily dart their impotent stings on the literary traveller and too knowing to dismount and waste my time in whipping grasshoppers  but here is a scowling sullen black bull right athwart my road  a monster of magnitude of the boeotian breed perplexing me in my wanderings through the entangled labyrinth of drury he stands sulkily before me with sides seemingly impenetrable to any lash and tougher than the dun cow of warwick  his front outfronting the brazen bull of perillus  he has bellowed gentlemen yea he has bellowed a dismal sound a hollow unvaried tone heaved from his very midriff and striking the listener with torpor  would i could pass the animal quietly for my own sake  and for his by jupiter i repeat it i would not willingly harm the bull  i delight not in baiting him  i would jog as gently by him as by the ass that grazes on the common but he has obstinately blocked up my way  he has already tossed and gored me severely  i must make an effort or he batters me down and leaves me to bite the dust  the weapon i must use is not of that brilliant and keen quality which in a skilful hand neatly cuts up the subject to the delight and admiration of the byestanders it is a homely cudgel of narrative a blunt batoon of matter of fact affording little display of art in the wielder and so heavy in its nature that it can merely claim the merit of being appropriate to the opponent at whom it is levelled  pray stand clear  for i shall handle this club vilely and if any one come in my way he may chance to get a rap which i did not intend to bestow upon him good venal and venomous gentlemen who dabble in ink for pay or from pique and who have dubbed yourselves critics keep your distance now run home to your garrets  fools ye are but ephemera at best and will die soon enough in the paltry course of your insignificant natures without thrusting your ears if there be any left you into the heat of this perilous action  a vaunt  well well stay if ye are bent upon it and be pert and busy  your folly to me is of no moment ye who impartially and conscientiously sit in diurnal judgment upon modern dramatists apply not this to yourselves it aims only at the malevolent the mean and the ignorant who are the disgrace of your order   i hasten now to my narrative  i agreed to write the following play at the instance of the chief proprietor of drury lane theater who unconditionally agreed to pay me a certain sum for my labor  and this certain sum being much larger than any i believe hitherto offered on similar occasions created no small jealousy among the parnassian sans culottes several of whom have of late been vapidly industrious to level to the muddy surface of their own castalian ditch so aristocraticodramatick a bargainer the play as fast as written piecemeal was put into rehearsal but let it here be noted gentle reader that a rehearsal in drury lane i mean as far as relates to this iron chest is lucus a non lucendo they yclep it a rehearsal i conjecture because they do not rehearse i call the loved shade of garrick to witness nay i call the less loved presence of the then acting manager to avow  that there never was one fair rehearsal of the play  never one rehearsal wherein one or two or more of the performers very essential to the piece were not absent and all the rehearsals which i attended so slovenly and irregular that the ragged master of a theatrical barn might have blushed for the want of discipline in the pompous director of his majestys servants at the vast and astonishing newerected theater royal in drury lane  it is well known to those conversant with the business of the stage that no perfect judgment can be formed of the length of a play apparent to the spectator nor of the general effect intended to be produced until the private repetitions among the actors have reduced the business into something like lucidus ordo  then comes the time for the judicious author to take up his pruningknife or handle his hatchet then he goes lustily to work my masters upon his curtailments or additions his transpositions his loppings his parings trimmings dockings etc etc etc as in the writing so in the rehearsal  ordinis haec virtus erit et venus aut ego fallor ut jam nunc dicat jam nunc debentia dici pleraque differat et praesens in tempus omittat hoc amet hoc spernat promissi carminis auctor but woe is me while i was patiently waiting the expected crisis a circumstance occurred which compelled me to watch a crisis of a less agreeable nature a fever attacked me as i sat beneath the damp dome of drury and drove me malgre moi to bed where i lay during a week till three hours before the play was exhibited in addition to the unavoidable injury arising from the authors absence mr kemble the actingmanager and principal performer in the piece was and had been for a few days previous to my own illness confined to his chamber by indisposition i lay little stress indeed upon his temporary incapacity to perform his managerical duty his mode of discharging it hitherto was productive of little benefit to me  still it was some drawback  for were a mere log thrown amidst a thespian community and nominated its dull and ponderous ruler still the block while in its place would carry some sway with it  but his nonattendance as an actor so much engaged in the play was particularly detrimental  nay even the composer of the music  and here let me breathe a sigh to the memory of departed worth and genius as i write the name of storage  even he could not preside in his department he was preparing an early flight to that abode of harmony where choirs of angels swell the note of welcome to an honest and congenial spirit  here then was a direct stop to the business no such thing the troops proceeded without leaders in the dark messieur  sans eyes sans every thing the prompter it is true a kind of noncommissioned officer headed the corpse and a curious march was made of it  but lo two days or three i forget which previous to the public representation up rose king kemble like somnus from his ebon bed to distribute his dozing directions among his subjects  tarda gravitate jacentes vix oculus tollens summaque percutiens nutanti pictora mento excussit tandem sibi se cubitoque levatus etc he came saw and pronounced the piece to be ripe for exhibition it was ordered to be performed immediately news was brought to me in my sickness of the mighty fiat and although i was told officially that due care had been taken to render it worthy of public attention i submitted with doubt and trembling to the decree my doubts too of this boasted care were not a little increased by a note which i received from the prompter written by the managers order three hours only before the first representation of the play  wherein at this late period my consent was abruptly requested to a transposition of two of the most material scenes in the second act and the reason given for this curious proposal was that the present stage of drury  where the architect and machinist with the judgment and ingenuity of a politician and a wit to assist them had combined to outdo all former theatrical outdoings  was so bunglingly constructed that there was not time for the carpenters to place the lumbering framework on which an abbey was painted behind the representation of a library without having a chasm of ten minutes in the action of the play and that in the middle of an act  such was the fabrication of that new stage whose extent and powers have been so vauntingly advertised under the classick management of mr kemble in the edifying exhibition of pantomimes processions pageants triumphal cars milk white horses and elephants  as i did not choose to alter the construction of my play without deliberation merely to skreen the illconstruction of the house i would not listen to the modest and well timed demand of turning the progress of my fable topsy turvy  very ill and very weak from the effects of the fever which ha not yet left me i made an effort and went to the theater to witness the performance i found mr kemble in his dressing room a short time before the curtain was drawn up taking opium pills and nobody who is acquainted with that gentleman will doubt me when i assert that they are a medicine which he has long been in the habit of swallowing he appeared to me very unwell and seemed indeed to have imbibed poppy and mandragora and all the drowsy syrups of the world   the play began and all went smoothly till a trifling disapprobation was shown to the character personated by mr dodd  the scene in which he was engaged being much too long a proof of the neglect of those whose business it was to have informed me in my unavoidable absence from the theater that it appeaed in the last rehearsals to want curtailment i considered this however to be of no great moment  mr kemble was to appear immediately in a subquent scene and much was expected from his execution of a part written expressly for his powers  and here let me describe the requisites for the character which i have attempted to draw that the world may judge whether i have taken a wrong measure of the personage whom i proposed to fit premising that i have worked for him before with success and therefore it may be presumed that i am somewhat acquainted with the dimensions of his qualifications  i required then a man of a tall stature and of sable hue much like the son of kish that lofty jew a man of whom it might be said there is something in his soul over which his melancholy sits and broods   look at the actor  and will any body do him the injustice to declare that he is deficient in these qualifications it would puzzle any author in any time or country from aeschylus down even to the translator of lodoiska  and really gentlemen i can go no lower  to find a figure and face better suited to the purpose i have endeavored moreover to pourtray sir edward mortimer as a man stately in his deportment reserved in his temper mysterious cold and impenetrable in his manner and the candid observers i trust will allow that mr kemble is thouroughly adequate to such a personation  to complete my requisitions i demanded a performer who could enter into the spirit of a character proceeding upon romantic halfwitted principles abstracted in his opinions sophisticated in his reasonings and who is thrown into situations where his mind and conduct stand tiptoe on the extremest verge of probability here surely i have not mistaken my man for if i am able to form any opinion of him as an actor  and my opinion i know is far from singular  his chief excellence almost approaches that style which the learned denominate caricature possibility on the stretch passion overleaping it is customary bound movements of the soul sullen or violent very rarely seen in the common course of things yet still may be seen  in these is his element as our language is said to have sunk under the vast conception of milton so does the modesty of nature suffer a depression beneath the unwieldy imaginings of mr kemble he seldom deigns to accompany the goddess in her ordinary walks when she decently paces the regular path with a sober step and a straight person but he kindly assists her when she is doubtless in need of assistance  when she appears out of her way crazy and crooked  the arrogant fault of being more refined than refinement more proper than propriety more sensible than sense which nine times in ten will disgust the spectator becomes frequently an advantage to him in characters of the above description  in short mr kemele is a paragonrepresentative of the lusus naturae and were mr kemble sewed up in a skin to act a hog in a pantomime he would act a hog with six legs better than a hog with four  if any one ask why i chose to sketch a lusus naturae when it might better become an author to be chaste in his delineation i can only reply that i did so to obtain the assistance of mr kemble in his best manner and that now i do most heartily repent me for never sure did man place the main strength of his building upon so rotten a prop  well the great actor was discovered as sir edward mortimer in his library gloom and desolation sat upon his brow and he was habited from the wig to the shoestring with the most studied exactness had one of king charles the firsts portraits walked from its frame upon the boards of the theater it could not have afforded a truer representation of ancient and melancholy dignity  the picture could not have looked better  but in justice to the picture it must also be added that the picture could scarcely have acted worse  the spectators who gaped with expectation at his first appearance yawned with lassitude before his first exit it seemed however that illness had totally incapacitated him from performing the business he had undertaken for his mere illness he was entitled to pity for his conduct under it he undoubtedly deserved censure  how can mr kemble as a manager and an actor justify his thrusting himself forward in a new play the material interest of which rested upon his own powers at a moment when he must be conscious that he had no powers at all  mr kemele owes a duty to the public to his employer and to an author writing for his employers house how does he treat the claimants upon his service in this instance exactly thus  he insults the understanding of the first and injures the interests of the two last by calling in a crowd to an entertainment which he knows he must mar  i requested him at the end of the first act to order an apology to be made for his indisposition lest the uninformed or malicious might attribute the ponderosity of the performer to the heaviness of the author i was anxious to disavow all right and title to those pigs of lead which did not belong to me and of which mr kemble was the just proprietor but no  he peremptorily declared he would not suffer an apology to be made it should have been made if at all before the play began  then why was it not made  he did not then imagine that illness would have disabled him  so then a man quits his chamber after an attack which has evidently weakened him extremely and he has no bodily feel no internal monitor to whisper to him that he is feeble and that he has not recovered sufficient strength to make a violent exertion  this mode of reasoning adopted by mr kemble is much in the spirit of that clowns who did not know whether he could play on the fiddle till he tried be it noted also that mr kemble was swallowing his opium pills before the play began because he was ill  but opium causes strange oblivious effects and these pills must have occasioned so sudden a lapse in mr kembles memory that he forgot when he took them why he took them or that he had taken them at all  the dose must have been very powerful  still for the reasons already stated i pressed for an apology still mr kemble continued obstinate in opposing it his indisposition he said was evident he had coughed very much upon the stage and an apology would make him look like a fool  goodnature in excess becomes weakness but i never yet found in the confined course of my reading that goodnature and folly would bear the same definition mr kemble it should seem and he produced at least managerical authority for it considered the terms to be synonimous freely however forgiving him for his unkindness in refusing to gratify a poor devil of an author  who very anxious for his reputation was very moderate in his request  i do in all christian charity most sincerely wish that mr kemble may never find greater cause to look like a fool than an apology for his indisposition  at length by dint of perseverance i gained my point a proprietor of the theater was called in upon the occasion whose mediation in my favor carried more weight with the acting manager than a hapless dramatists entreaty and the apology was in due form delivered to the audience  one third of the play only was yet performed and i was now to make up my mind like an unfortunate traveller to pursue my painful journey through two stages more upon a brokendown poster car whose back lay all the baggage for my expedition miserably and most heavily in hand did the poster proceed  he groaned he lagged he coughed he winced he weezed  never was seen so sorry a jade the audience grew completely soured and once completely soured every thing naturally went wrong they recurred to their disapprobation of poor dodd  and observe what this produced i must relate it  mr kemble had just plodded through a scene regardless of those loud and manifest tokens that the critics delight not in the drowsy hums with which he rang nights yawning peal when dodd appeared to him on the stage at whose entrance the clamor was renewed then and not till then did the acting manager who had been deaf as any post to the supplications of the author for an apology  then did he appear suddenly seized with a fit of good nature he voluntarily came forward to look like a fool and beg the indulgence of the town he feared he was the unhappy cause of their disapprobation he entreated their patience and hoped he should shortly gain strength to enable them to judge on a future night what he handsomely termed the merits of the play here was friendship here was adroitness while the public were testifying their disgust at the piece through the medium of poor dodd mr kemble with unexampled generosity took the whole blame upon his own shoulders and heroically saved the author by so timely an interposition i was charmed with this masterstroke and at the impulse of the moment i thanked him but alas how narrow is the soul of man how distrustful in its movements how scanty in its acknowledgments how perplexing to itself in its combinations had i afterward looked on the thing simply and nakedly by itself why the thing is a goodnatured thing but i must be putting other circumstances by the side of it with a plague to me i must be puzzling myself to see if all fits if all is of a piece and what is the result  miserable that i am i have lost the pleasure of evincing a gratitude which i thought i owed because i no longer feel myself a debtor had i abandoned my mind to that placid negligence that luxurious confidence which the inconsiderate enjoy it had never occurred to me that mr kemble foreseeing perhaps that an aggrieved author might not be totally silent  steped forward with this speech to the public as a kind of salvo should a statement be made for his rigidity in the first instance it had never occurred to me that mr kemble was sufficiently hissed yawned at laughed at and coughed down to have made his apology before mr dodd appeared it had never occurred to me that his making his apology at a previous moment would have answered the same purpose to me and not to him it had never occurred in short that there is such a thing as ostentatious humility and a politic act of kindness and that i should have waited the sequel of a mans conduct before i thanked him for one instance of seeming good will close upon the heels of stubborn ill nature and in the midst of existing and palpable injury the sequel will show that i was premature in my acknowledgment  but before i come to the sequel a word or two i will be brief to close my account of this the first nights eventful history the piece was concluded and given out for a second performance with much opposition  friends who never heard the play read shook their heads friends who had heard it read scarcely knew it again several i doubt not of the impartial who chose to be active actively condemned and enemies of course rejoiced in an opportunity of joining them  no opportunity could be fairer the play was at least a full hour too long and had job himself sat to hear it he must have lost his patience but if gentle reader thou possessest jobs quality and have followed me thus far in my narrative it will appear to thee for i doubt not thy retention and combination that i was unable to curtail it effectually at the proper time  the last rehearsals i was then laid flat my dear friend as you remember i have told you by a fever the acting manager did attend the last rehearsals and suffered the piece to be produced uncut to drag its slow length along surcharged with all his own incapacity and all his opium  how then do i stand indebted according to the articles of this nights statement i owe to mr kemble for his illness compassion for his conduct under it censure for his refusing to make an apology a smile for his making an apology a sneer for his mismanagement a groan for his acting a hiss   this account is somewhat like the tavern bill picked from falstaffs pocket when he is snorting behind the arras there is but one halfpenny worth of compassion to this intolerable deal of blame  now for the sequel  i have shown i think that mr kemble in the first instance undertook a duty which he could not perform i have now to affirm with all the difficulty of proving a negative full in my face that he afterward made a mockery of discharging a duty which he would not perform  after a weeks interval to give him time to recruit his strength and the author time to curtail and alter the play for the impression which the mismanager and actor had contrived to stamp rendered alteration necessary it was a second time represented  i must here let the uninformed reader into a secret  but i must go to newmarket to make him understand me  no epsom will do as well and that is nearer home  it often happens at a race that a known horse from whom good sport is expected disappoints the crowd by walking over the course  he does not miss an inch of the ground but affords not one jot of diversion unless some pleasure is received in contemplating his figure now an actor can do the very same thing he can walk over his part he can miss no more of his words than the horse does of his way he can be as dull and as tedious and as goodlooking as the horse in his progress  the only difference between the two animals is  that the horse brings in him who bets upon him a gainer but the luckless wight who has a large stake depending upon the actor is decidedly certain to lose there is a trick too that the jockies practice which is called i think playing booty this consists in appearing to use their utmost endeavor to reach the winningpost first when they are already determined to come in the last the consequence is that all except the knowing ones attribute no fault to the jockey but damn the horse for a sluggard  an actor can play booty if he chooses  he can pretend to whip and spur and do his best when the connoisseur knows all the while he is shirking  but sluggard is the unmerited appellation given by the majority to the innocent author  mr kemble chiefly chose to be horse and walked over the ground every now and then but scarcely enough to save appearances he gave a slight touch of the jockey and played booty  whether the language which is put into the mouth of sir edward mortimer be above mediocrity or below contempt is not to the present purpose but the words he is made to utter certainly convey a meaning and the circumstances of the scenes afford an opportunity to the performer of playing off his mimick emotions his transitions of passion his starts and all the trickeries of his trade the devil a trick did mr kemble play but a very scurvy one his emotions and passions were so rare and so feeble that they seasoned his general insipidity like a single grain of wretched pepper thrown into the largest dose of water gruel that ever was administered to an invalid for the most part he toiled on line after line in a dull current of undiversified sound which stole upon the ear far more drowsily than the distant murmurings of lethe with no attempt to break the lulling stream or check its sleepinviting course  frogs in a marsh flies in a bottle wind in a crevice a preacher in a field the drone of a bagpipe all all yielded to the inimitable and soporific monotony of mr kemble  the very best dramatick writing where passion is expressed if delivered languidly by the actor will fail in it is intended effect and i will be bold enough to say that were the curse in king lear new to an audience and they heard it uttered for the first time in a croak fainter than a crows in a consumption it would pass unnoticed or appear vapid to the million  if i raise a critical clatter about my ears by this assertion which some may twist into a profanation of shakspeare i leave it to horace who can fight battles better than i to defend me  si dicentis erunt fortunis absona dicta romani tollent pedites equitesque cachinnum that mr kemble did not misconceive the part is certain for he told me some time before the play was acted that he feared the exertions requisite in sir edward mortimer would strain his lungs more than octavian in the mountaineers  that he can strain his lungs to good purpose in octavian is well known and after this his own intimation how will he escape the charge of wilful and direct delinquency when with such a conception of the part and with health recovered he came forward in the true spirit of bottom and aggravated his voice so that he roared you as gentle as any sucking dove mr kemble informed me previous to the second representation of the play that he felt himself capable of exertion   he insulted the town and injured his employer and the author sufficiently in the first instance in the second he added to the insult and injury an hundredfold and as often as he mangled the character three or four times i am uncertain which after the first nights performance he heaped aggravation upon aggravation  the most miserable mummer that ever disgraced the walls of a theater could not have been a stronger drawback than mr kemble  he was not only dull in himself but the cause of dullness in others like the baleful upas of java his pestiferous influence infected all around him when two actors come forward to keep up the shuttle cock of scenickfiction if one plays slovenly the other cannot maintain his game poor bannister jun would he speak out but i have never pressed him and never shall press him to say a word upon the subject could bear ample testimony to the truth of this remark he suffered like a man under the cruelty of mzentius all alive himself he was tied to a corpse which he was fated to drag about with him scene after scene which weighed him down and depressed his vigor miss farren too who might animate any thing but a soul of lead and a face of iron experienced the same fate  i could proceed and argue and reason and discuss and tire the reader as i have tired myself it is now my good friend one oclock in the morning to prove further that mr kemble was unsound in my cause and that he ruined my play  but i will desist here i think i have prosed enough to manifest that my arguments are not unfounded  they who are experienced in dramaticks will i trust see that i have made a fair extenuation of myself  they who are impartial will i hope be convinced that i have set down naught in malice  the only question that may arise to shake materially the credit of all i have said is  how is it probable that mr kemble should injure you thus without provocation is it in nature is it in man i can merely answer that i am unconscious of having given him cause for provocation that if i have given him cause he has taken a bad mode of revenge that mr kembles nature has frequently puzzled me in my observation upon it and that i think him a very extraordinary man  but let him take this with him should this crudely written preface ever fall in his way i have committed it to paper currente calamo i mean no allusion no epithet to apply to him as a private individual as a private individual i give him not that notice which it might here be impertinent to bestow  but i have an undoubted right to discuss his merits or demerits in his public capacities of manager and actor and my cause of complaint gives me a good reason as well as right his want of conduct his neglect his injustice his oppression his finesse his person his face are in this point of view all open to my animadversion  he is my goods my chattlels my horse my ox my ass my any thing and i would animadvert still further did i not think i had already said sufficient to gain the object of guarding my own reputation that object has solely swayed me in dwelling so long upon a plain tale encumbered with so fatiguing a hero as john kemble  advertisement to the reader i am indebted for the groundwork of this play to a novel entitled things as they are or the adventures of caleb williams written by william godwin much of mr godwins story i have omitted much which i have adopted i have compressed much i have added and much i have taken the liberty to alter  all this i did that i might fit it in the best of my judgment to the stage  i have cautiously avoided all tendency to that which vulgarly and wrongly in many instances is termed politics with which many have told me caleb williams teems  the stage has now no business with politics and should a dramatick author endeavor to dabble in them it is the lord chamberlains office to check his attempts before they meet the eye of the public i perused mr godwins book as a tale replete with interesting incident ingenious in its arrangement masterly in its delineation of character and forcible in its language i considered it as right of common and by a title which custom has given to dramatists i enclosed it within my theatrical paling however i may have tilled the lnd i trust he discovers no intentional injury to him in my proceeding  to all the performers excepting mr kemble i offer my hearty thanks for their exertions which would have served me more had not an actor dark as erebus cast a gloom upon them which none of their efforts however brilliant could entirely disperse  but this does not diminish my obligations to them  so much indeed i owe to them that when the play was last performed it was rising spite of erebus in favor with the town it was then advertised day after day at the bottom of the playbills for repetition till the promissory advertisement became laughable and at length the advertisement and the play were dropped together  if after the foregoing preface i should at a future period bring the play forward in the haymarket theater i am fully aware of the numbers who from party and pique may now oppose it i am aware too of the weight which a first impression leaves upon the minds of the most candid  still so strong is my confidence in the genuine decision of a london audience who have a fair opportunity of exercising their judgment and feelings which they have not had yet in respect to this play that i believe i shall venture an appeal  the piece is now printed as it was acted on the first night that they who peruse it may decide whether even in that shape with all the misfortunes before enumerated with which it was doomed to struggle it should be for ever consigned to moulder on the shelf  the songs duets and chorusses are intended merely as vehicles for musical effect some critics have pompously called them lyrick poetry  that by raising them to dignity they may more effectually degrade them as men lift a stone very high before they let it fall when they would completely dash it to pieces  i now leave the gentle reader to the perusal of the play  and lest my fathers memory may be injured by mistakes and in the confusion of aftertimes the translator of terence and the author of the jealous wife be supposed guilty of the iron chest i shall were i to reach the patriarchal

should they happen to marry and i have my fancies on it i will dance a galliard with thee in the hall on the round oak table sbud when i was a youth i would have caperd with st vitus and beat him   blanch you are as likely to dance now as they to marry what has hindered them if the parties be agreed  yet i have now been with my mistress these two years since sir edward first came hither and placed her in the cottage hard by his lodge   wint tush family reasons  thou know nothing thou art scarce caught two years back when we came from kent and sir edward first entered on his office here

old oak eatingroom   song adam winterton sir marmaduke was a hearty knight good man old man he is painted standing bolt upright with his hose rolled over his knee  his perriwigs as white as chalk and on his fifth he holds a hawk and he looks like the head of an ancient family ii his dining room was long and wide good man old man his spaniels lay by the fireside  and in other parts do you see crossbows tobaccopipes old hats a saddle his wife and a litter of cats and he looked like the head of an ancient family iii he never turned the poor from his gate good man old man but always ready to break the pate of his countrys enemy what knight could do a better thing than serve the poor and fight for his king and so may every head of an ancient family   enter wilford wilf every new act of sir edwards charity sets me a thinking and the more i think the more i am puzzled it is strange that a man should be so ill at ease who is continually doing good at times the wild glare of his eye is frightful and last night when i was writing for him in the library i could not help fancying i was shut up with the devil  i would stake my life there is a secret and i could almost give my life to

old adam winterton can sift a subtle speech to the bottom   wilf ah good sir you need not tell me that young as i am i can admire that experience in another which i want myself   wint there is something mavelous engaging in this young man you have a world of promise boy sixty years ago in queen elizabeths time i was just such another i remember marian potpan the farmers daughter of stocks green was then enamored of me well beware how you offend sir edward   wilf i would not willingly for the world he has been the kindest master to me he has informed my mind relieved my distresses clothed me sheltered me  but whilst my fortunes ripen in the warmth of his goodness the frozen gloom of his countenance chills me   wint well well take heed how you prate on it out on these babbling boys there is no keeping a secret with younkers in a family   wilf very eagerly what then there is a secret  it is as i guessed after all   wint why how now hothead  mercy on me an this tinderbox boy do not make me shake with apprehension is it thus you take my frequent counsel   wilf dear sir it is your counsel which most i covet give me but that admit me to your confidence steer me with your advice which i ever held excellent and with such a pilot i may sail prosperously through a current which otherwise might wrerk me   wint it is melting to see how unfledged youth will shelter itself like a chicken under the wing of such a tough old cock as myself well well i will think on it boy   wilf the old answer  yet he softens apace could i but clench him now  faith sir it is a raw morning and i care not if i taste the canary your kindness offered   wint aha lad say thou so just my modest humor when i was young i ever refused my glass at first but i came to it ere i had quitted my company here is the key of the corner cupboard yonder see you do not crack the bottle you heedless goose you  wilford takes out bottle and glasses ha fill it up od it sparkles curiously  here is to  i

long been enamored of him poor lady when he was the gay the gallant sir edward in kent ah well two years make a wondrous change   wilf yes it is a good tough love nowadays that will hold out a couple of twelvemonths   wint away i mean not so you giddy pate he is all honor and as steady in his course as the sun yet i wonder sometimes he can bear to look upon her   wilf eh why so did not he bring her under his protection to the forest since it is said she lost her relations   wint hush boy on your life do not name her uncle  i would say her relations   wilf her uncle wherefore where is the harm in having an uncle dead or alive   wint peace peace in that uncle lies the secret   wilf indeed how good adam winterton i prithee how   wint ah twas a heavy day poor sir edward is now a broken spirit  but if ever a good spirit walked the earth in trunk hose he is one   wilf let us drink sir edwards health   wint that i would though twere a mile to the bottom  drinks ha it is cheering in faith well in troth i have a regard for thee boy for thy fathers sake   wilf oh good sir and this uncle you say    wint of madam helen  ah there lies the mischief   wilf what mischief can be in him why he is dead   wint come nearer  see you prate not now on your life our good master sir edward was arraigned on his account in open court   wilf arraigned how mean you   wint alas boy tried  tried for  nearer yet  his murder   wilf mu  mu  murder drops the glass   wint why what why wilford out alas the boys passion will betray all what wilford i say   wilf you have curdled my blood   wint what varlet thou dare not think ill of our worthy master   wilf i  i am his secretary often alone with him at dead midnight in his library the candles in the sockets  and a man glaring upon me who has

now thou do not attend   wilf i  i mark i mark   wint i tell thee then our good sir edward was beloved in kent where he had returned a year before from his travels madam helens uncle was hated by all the neighborhood rich and poor a mere brute do mark me   wilf like enough but when brutes walk upon two legs the law of the land thank heaven will not suffer us to butcher them   wint go to you firebrand our good master labored all he could for many a month to soothe his turbulence but in vain he picked a quarrel with sir edward in the public county assembly nay the strong ruffian struck him down and trampled on him think on that wilford on our good master sir edward whose great soul was nigh to burst with the indignity   wilf well but the end on it   wint why our young master took horse for his own house determined as it appeared to send a challenge to this whiteliverd giant in the morning   wilf i see he killed him in a duel that is another kind of butchery which the law allows not true humanity shudders at and false honor justifies   wint see now how you fly off sir edwards revenge boy was baffled for his antagonist was found dead in the street that night killed by some unknown assassins on his return from the assembly   wilf indeed unknown assassins   wint nay it is plain our good sir edward had no hand in the wicked act for he was tried as i told you at the next assize mercy on me twas a crowded court and both gentle and simple threw up their caps at his acquital heaven be thanked he was cleared beyond a shadow of doubt   wilf he was i breathe again twas a happy thing twas the only way left of cleansing him from a foul suspicion   wint out alas lad it is his principal grief he is full of nice feeling and highflown honor and the thought of being tried for such a crime has given him his hears wound poor gentleman he has shunned the world ever since he was once the life of all company  but now   sir edward without winterton   wint hark some one calls out on

guilty  well why should i pity guilt philosophers would call me drivler  let them whip a deserter and philosophy stands by and says he merits it that is true  but wherefore should philosophy take snuff when the poor culprit writhes a plague on stoics i cannot hoop my heart about with iron like an old beerbutt i would have the vessel what some call weak  i would have it ooze a little better compassion should be set abroach till it run waste than let a systemmonger bung it with logic or a trencher cap bawl out his ethics on it till his thunder turn all the liquor sour  so here he comes  enter wilford wilf i am informed it is your pleasure sir to speak with me  fitz aye wilford i am sorry  faith very sorry  you and i meet thus how could you quit my brother thus abruptly was he unkind

thoughts when you are called upon if truth will serve you sketch out your story with her chaste bold pencil if truth should fail you wilford even take the fairest color human art can mix to give a glow to plausibility it is selfdefence and it is allowed when man must battle it with all the world against him  heaven bless you boy  that is i mean  pshaw plague  farewell and may you prosper exit

heaven send it  here comes sir edward would that i had died two reigns ago  enter sir edward mortimer fitz now brother  you look pale and faint with sickness  wint here is a chair your worship   mort no matter  to our business brother wilford you may well guess the struggle i endure to place you here the mark of accusation i gave you ample warning cautioned you when many might have scourged and even now while i stand here to crush you  aye to crush you  my heart bleeds drops of pity for your youth whose rashness plucks the red destruction down and pulls the bolt upon you  wilf you know best the movements of your heart sir man is blind and cannot read them but there is a judge to whose all seeing eye our inmost thoughts lie open think to him you now appeal  omniscience keeps heavens register and soon or late when time unfolds the book our trembling souls must answer to the record and meet their due reward or punishment  fitz now to the point i pray you   mort thus it is then i do suspect  by heaven the story lingers like poison on my tongue  but he will force it   fitz what is it you suspect   mort  that he has robbed me   wilf robbed i o horrible   fitz not yet  not yet pray tell me brother  i will be impartial  but i am somewhat moved  pray tell me brother how ground you this suspicion  mort briefly thus   you may have noticed in my library a chest wilford starts  you see he changes at the word  wilf and well i may aside   mort where i have told you brother the writings which concern our family with jewels cash and other articles of no mean value were deposited  fitz you oftentimes have said so   mort yesterday chance called me suddenly away i left the key in it  but as suddenly returned and found this wilford this young man whose state whose orphan state met pity in my house till pity grew to friendship  him i found fixed over the chest upon his knees intent as now i think on plunder tinging theft still blacker with ingratitude and rifling the easy fool who sheltered him confusion shook his young joints as he let fall the lid and gave me back the key  fitz did you not search your papers on the instant  mort no  for first habit so long had fixed my confidence i deemed it boyish curiosity  but told him this would meet my further question and at that moment came a servant in to say you were arrived he must have marked our mixed emotion  fitz is that servant here   servant twas i sir   mort was it you well saw you aught to challenge your attention  servant sir i did wilford was pale and trembling and our master gave him a look as if twould pierce him through and cried remember  then he trembled more and we both quitted him  mort when first we met you found me somewhat ruffled  fitz it is most true   mort but somewhat more when afterward i saw wilford conversing with you  like a snake sund by your looks and basking in your favor i bade him quit the room with indignation and wait my coming in the library  fitz i witnessed that with wonder   mort o good brother you little thought while you so gently schooled me in the full flow of your benevolence for my harsh bearing towered him on what ground that harshness rested i had made my search in the brief interval of absence from you and found my property had vanished  fitz well  you met him in the library  mort o never can he forget that solemn interview  wilf aye speak to that  it was a solemn interview   mort observe he does acknowledge that we met guilt was my theme  he cannot now deny it  wilf it was a theme of  no checking himself   mort he pleaded innocence while every word he spoke belied his features and mocked his protestation i restrained the chastisement he feared nor would i blazon the wrong i could not fix and subject thus by general inquiry all the guiltless to foul suspicion that suspicion lay most heavily on him but the big cloud of anger he had gathered burst not on him in vengeance to overwhelm him chill it dropped but kindly as the dew in admonition like tears of fathers over a wayward child when love enforces them to ruggedness  fitz what said you to him   mort regulate your life in future better i now spare your youth but dare not to proceed all i exact it is a soft penance  that you tarry here my eye your guard my house your gentle prison my bounty be your chains attempt not flight flight ripens all my doubt to certainty and justice to the world unlocks my tongue  he fled and i arraign him  fitz trust me brother this charge is staggering yet accidents sometimes combine to cast a shade of doubt upon the innocent may it be so here here is his trunk twas brought here at my order it is fit that it be searched  mort o that were needless he were a shallow villain that would trust his freight of plunder to so frail a bottom schoolboys who strip the orchard of its fruit conceal their thievery better  fitz yet it is found such negligence is often linked with guilt  take not  i say not yet that he is guilty but scarce heard of crafty villain yet who did not make some blot in his foul game that lookerson have thought him blind and mad it was so palpable  it is rarely otherwise heavens hand is in it brother providence marks guilt as twere with a fatuity  adam do you inspect it to winterton  wilf here is the key  even take it freely  you will find little there i value save a locket which my mother gave me upon her deathbed and she added her blessing to it perhaps her spirit now is grieving for my injuries  wint after opening the trunk o mercy   fitz how now what is there   wint as i am a wretched man the very watch my good old master wore and here my ladys jewels  wilf i am innocent just heaven hear me  fitz i must hear you now what can you say  oh wilford  wilf give me breath let me collect myself first this falls on his knees may sleep never close my burning eyes may conscience gnaw me may engines wrench my entrails from their seat and whirl them to the winds before my face if i know aught of this  fitz make it appear so  but look there look there pointing to the trunk   wilf heap circumstance upon me multiply charge upon charge pile seeming fact on fact still i maintain my innocence look at me are these the throes of guilt are these convulsions of a poor helpless friendless wretched boy the struggles of a villain  one thing more i here aver it  to his face aver it  he knows  yes he  yes my accuser knows i merit not his charge  a general expression of indignation wint o fie on it fie   fitz wilford take heed a base attempt to blacken an injured master will but plunge you deeper  wilf i know what i am doing i repeat it will die repeating it sir edward mortimer is conscious of my innocence  mort proceed  look at these proofs and talk  unhappy boy thy tongue can do me little mischief now  wilf do you not know    mort what   wilf  it is no matter sir but i could swear   mort nay wilford pause a while reflect that oaths are sacred weigh the for of these asseverations mark it well i swear by all the ties that bind a man divine or human think on that and shudder  wilf the very words i uttered i am tonguetied aside   fitz wilford if there be aught that you can urge to clear yourself advance it  wilf o i could i could say much but must not  no i will not do as you please  i have no friend  no witness save my accuser did he not  pray ask him  did he not vaunt his wiles could ruin me did he not menace in his pride of power to blast my name and crush my innocence  fitz what do you answer sir   mort i answer  no  more were superflous when a criminal opposes empty volubility to circumstantial charge a steadfast brow repels not fact nor can invalidate these dumb but damning witnesses before him  pointing to the trunk wilf by the just power that rules us i am ignorant how they came there  but it is my firm belief you placed them there to sink me  fitz o too much you steel mens hearts against you death and shame it rouses honest choler call the officers  he shall meet punishment servants going  mort hold pray you hold justice has thus far struggled with my pity to do an act of duty to the world i would unmask a hypocrite lay bare the front of guilt that men may see and shun it it is done  and i will now proceed no further i would not hurt the serpent but to make the serpent hurtless he has lost his sting let him depart and freely  fitz lookye brother this shall not be  had he proved innocent my friendship had been doubled you well know i have been partial to him  but this act is so begrimed with black ungrateful malice that i insist on justice fly knaves run and let him be secured exeunt servants you tarry here to wilford  mort i will not have it thus   fitz you must  you shall  it is weak else oons i trust i have as much of good straightforward pity as may serve but to turn dove  to sit still and be peckd at it is too tame his insolence tops all does not this rouse you too  look on these jewels  look at this picture  twas our mothers stay let me inspect this nearer what are here parchments  inspecting the trunk  mort o look no further  they are deeds which in his haste no doubt he crowded there not knowing what  to look over at his leisure  family deeds  they all were in my chest  wilf o it is deep laid  these too to give a color aside   fitz what have we here i have your leave good brother as arbiter in this here is a paper of curious enfolding  slipped as twere by chance within another this may be of note upon his trial  what is this drops a knife it seems  mort what starting   fitz marks of blood upon it   mort

on his knees and pevents him holding fitzharding wilf rapidly no i see  i see  preserve it you are judge  my innocence my life rests on it i  mort devils foil me at my own game  fate  ha ha ha sport
