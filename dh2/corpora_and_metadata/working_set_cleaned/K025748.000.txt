the lords cup or the dispensations of providence with regard to good and evil considered in a sermon  by william gilpin vicar of boldre  lymington printed and sold by j b rutter       to the inhabitants  lymington this discourse preached formerly in their church and now printed to encourage a deserving young townsman of theirs who has just set up a press is inscribed by their  affectionate and humble servant will gilpin vicars hill march         in the hand of the lord ere is a cup and the wine is red it is fullmixed and he pours out of the same as for the dregs thereof the ungodly of the earth shall drink them and suck them out psalm lxxv   0 the dispensations of god with regard to this world are represented in scripture under various similitudes not so much with a view to explain them as to give us such conceptions of them only as are necessary  among these several images that of a cup is one of the most frequent it occurs in many of the divine writers  in david particularly he speaks of the cup of salvation  of the lords being the portion of his cup  of his cup running over  and here in this beautiful passage he carries the illustration farther in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is fullmixed and he pours out of the same as for the dregs thereof the ungodly of the earth shall drink them and suck them out  from these words i shall first examine the contents of the lords cup and shall secondly and thirdly show you how the ungodly and how the godly drink of it  first with regard to the contents of the lords cup we are told the wine is red but it is fullmixed  that is however fair the appearances of things may be however splendid any state of happiness or any situation of life may appear it is fullmixed  there is always added to it a certain portion of evil by evil i mean only the usual misfortunes and afflictions of human life these are what temper the cup of the lord and in this mixed state it is poured out to the inhabitants of the earth  all nature as well as man partakes of this mixture  we see storms purifying the air but at the same time destroying the labors of men  the seasons sometimes kind but as often inclement  rains fertilizing the earth but also deluging it  the ground bearing fruits and grain but weeds also and noxious herbs  the ocean expanding its broad bosom for the benefit of commerce but the scene also of devouring tempests and overflowing tides  if we examine animal life we shall find here also as far as it regards man the same mixture of good and evil some animals are useful for food others for labor and others for convenience but a greater number we find are mischievous the larger beasts of prey devour by their strength the inferior by their craft and the blighting infect by its multitude  if from the irrational part of nature we take a view of man and his labors we shall find the same mixture of good and evil in himself what a compound is he of virtue and vice religion and hypocrisy honesty and deceit charity and malice compassion and unfeelingness with many other contrarieties are continually taking their turns in his mind good suggestions often impress him but temptations are strong and his practice wayward  man being thus compounded of good and evil all his labors partake of the mixture his food is turned to intemperance his dress to vanity his amusements to diffipation let him form what schemes what plans what systems he will let him employ all his little prudence and foresight in bringing them to perfection still he will find mixed with them in some shape or other uncertainty disappointment and miscarriage  thus in the various circumstances of his life good and bad pursue each other like the lights and shadows of a stormy day the sun may break out at intervals yet it never happens but that either the morning the noon or at least the evening of his day is obscured light and darkness are not more connected than good and evil david alluding to these sudden changes tells us that heaviness may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning  as this is the case therefore  as the lords cup is thus mixed with bitter as well as sweet ingredients and as we all must drink it let us examine in what way we may drink it best  and first let us see how the ungodly man drinks it which was the second point i proposed to consider  the text says he drinks the dregs now the dregs of any liquor are the pernicious parts it is fairly implied therefore that the ungodly man turns both the good and evil of life to his own destruction  let us first see him in prosperous circumstances with the cup of plenty in his hand here he appears in a very unfavourable light prosperity hardens him it supplies nourishment to all his bad passions his unfeeling heart is never touched by the wants of others all is centered in himself  if he has been by the favor of providence successful in any trade or profession it is then his language  at least his sentiment  that he has made himself happy  let others take the same means if they will  if they have been less prudent or less industrious than he has been let them suffer for their folly in short from looking up to no cause above him but thinking himself the source of all his enjoyments he begins to fancy himself superior to others and of course holds others in contempt he becomes arrogant proud and assuming and his features are commonly marked with what the psalmist so expressively calls the scornful reproof of the wealthy  in his gratifications perhaps the ungodly man takes the road of pleasure then all is riot and excess religion conscience decency are no limits to him  ruin often succeeds  but perhaps he drinks the cup of prosperity more cautiously he has the foresight to provide against the ruin which destroys the thoughtless profligate and to act under the conduct of worldly wisdom then we see him enjoying his prosperity in a different way instead of squandering his wealth he hoards it every increase of his fortune increases also his desires the same hardness of heart which the other showed in providing for his pleasures he shows in raising an estate conscience and religion are equally the scorn of both  the prosperity of the ungodly man takes commonly one or the other of these courses the blessings of the lords cup he turns to his own destruction as he is ill qualified to receive good from the lord let us now see whether he is better qualified to receive evil for as we observed the cup of the lord is fullmixed evil in some shape will sooner or later certainly overtake him when the weight of misfortune or the distress of sickness or the infirmities of age come upon him then the dregs of the lords cup become a bitter potion to him like a froward child he knows not what he wants every thing distresses nothing can please him he never feels the joys of religion  the heartfelt satisfaction of a good conscience and the tranquillity of a peaceful mind which alone can soothe the anxiety of misfortune or ease the bed of sickness now he suffers that keen distress which he never pitied in others  that want of assistance himself which he never administered to them  thus wretched in himself you see him in a still more disagreeable light when he mixes with others see him when you will he is always either finding fault or making complaint but follow him home and you will there find his illhumours breaking out with double force miserable are all who are thus unhappily connected with him instead of the mild sweet smile of suffering piety the softened look of tenderness with which every offer to do him service should be received he spurns the hand that soothes him the kindest offers to serve him are received like injuries the tenderness of relations the consolation of friends instead of asswaging his illhumours serve only to excite them peevish and fretful he distributes his own sufferings in large proportions upon his servants dependants and nearer connections  and yet tho you would imagine he was wholly out of love with life and wished for nothing more than to leave it with disgust you are mistaken he seems fonder of it at least more loath to leave it than the man who enjoys it most his attachment to the expiring moments of life is most happily expressed in the text he not only drinks the dregs of the cup but he keeps them to his mouth as long as he can  he sucks them out  the most horrible sight which the world can furnish is that of a wicked wretch on the edge of eternity when all hope of life is over and he has just sensibility enough to see before him the gulf of despair let us turn aside from a spectacle which makes the blood run cold and see as we proposed thirdly how the godly man drinks of the lords cup  in the first place the godly man expects to find a portion of evil in his cup he sees the propriety of it and fully acknowledges the great usefulness of this mixture of good and evil if the potion were perfectly palatable he fears he might drink to excess if all things went smooth and easy with him  if in the current of life no rubs no stoppages no difficulties ever occurred what would be the consequence he might be secure in the midst of danger tho mortal he might never think of mortality the difficulties of life  the frequent checks he meets with are what put him continually on his guard disappointment corrects his passions and shows him that he is not to imagine he must have things here as he pleases but must expect his portion of evil he takes the world therefore for what it is and does not fix his happiness upon it  all this in the sincerity of his heart he acknowledges and approves and thus far even his reason carries him but when he opens the word of god he finds the various dispensations of heaven placed in a still juster light he finds this world represented in the gospel as a state of trial preparatory to future happiness and the good and evil of life as the means of this trial contributing equally to exercise and prove his religion  many are the virtues which prosperity gives him room to exercise and which he could not exercise amidst the evils of life and many are the virtues which are the attendants of affliction and are little known in the prosperous hour he drinks the cup of the lord therefore as the lord intends  when it pleases heaven to bless him when his designs succeed and his hopes dilate in some view of happiness before him now is the time he suggests to himself when i must guard my heart with double care now is the time when insolence and wantonness and pride the attendants of a prosperous hour are most liable to corrupt me let me be careful to bar all entrance against them let prosperity soften my heart instead of hardening it let me be humble and mild and condescending and obliging to all in the midst of my own enjoyments let my heart expand let me feel the misery of others and turn my plenty to the relief of their necessity  again when it pleases heaven to mix some bitter ingredient in his cup still he has the same sense of acting under the will of god now he cries is the time when i am to exercise patience and resignation now my religion is put to the test shall i receive good at the hand of the lord and not receive evil  gracious god grant that i may improve my heart under this trial of my faith and make my sufferings through jesus christ the means of purifying my affections let me for his sake bear a trifling part of what he bore for me and let me keep that great pattern of suffering resignation always before my eyes  thus the godly man drinks of the lords cup and his draught whether sweet or bitter is wholesome to him this blessed resignation of his own will in all instances to the will of god regulates his affections  corrects his thoughts  and draws him back to the sober recollection of his station here by checking each idea as it arises of worldly happiness and yet tho this pious resignation lessens the world in his eye it is so far from interfering with his worldly happiness that it sheds the sunshine of cheerfulness continually in his breast  but most of all when the world sinks under him he feels its blessed effects while life is extinguishing it is a cordial to pain and gives tranquillity to death  let us then after the godly mans example take the lords cup with all its ingredients fullmixed into our hands let us always remember whose cup it is and who pours it out it is the lord himself whatever therefore the draught is let us consider it as mixed and tempered by the great physician of our souls it may be unpalatable  but it is our own fault if it be not beneficial  the end
