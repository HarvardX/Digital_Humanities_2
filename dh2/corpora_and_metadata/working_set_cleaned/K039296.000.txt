lucius the first christian king of britain a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants  by mrs manley  london printed for john barber on lambethhill and sold by benj took at the middle temple gate henry clements in st pauls churchyard and john walthoe jun over against the royal exchange cornhill       to sir richard steel when men cast their eyes upon epistles of this kind from the name of the person who makes the address and of him who receives it they usually have reason to expect applauses improper either to be given or accepted by the parties concerned i fear it will at first sight be much more so in this address than any other which has at any time appeared but while common dedications are stuffed with painful panegyricks the plain and honest business of this is only to do an act of justice and to end a former misunderstanding between the author and him whom she here makes her patron in consideration that one knows not how far what we have said of each other may affect our character in the world i take it for an act of honor to declare on my part that i have not known a greater mortification than when i have reflected upon the severities which have flowed from a pen which is now you see disposed as much to celebrate and commend you on your part your sincere endeavor to promote the reputation and success of this tragedy are infallible testimonies of the candor and friendship you retain for me i rejoice in this public retribution and with pleasure acknowledge that i find by experience that some useful notices which i had the good fortune to give you for your conduct in former life with some hazard to my self were not to be blotted out of your memory by any hardships that followed them  i know you so well that i am assured you already think i have on this subject said too much and i am confident you believe of me that did i not conceal much more i should not say so much be then the very memory of disagreeable things forgotten for ever and give me leave to thank you for your kindness to this play and in return to show toward your merit the same good will but when my heart is full and my pen ready to express the kindest sentiments to your advantage i reflect upon what i have formerly heard you say that the fame of a gentleman like the credit of a merchant must flow from his own intrinsic value and that all means to enlarge it which do not arise naturally from that real worth instead of promoting the character of either did but lessen and render it suspicious i leave you therefore to the great opportunities which are daily in your power of bestowing on your self what no body else can give you and wishing you health and prosperity i omit to dwell upon some very late actions of yours in public which unhappy prejudices made as little expected from you as the zeal and solicitude which you showed for my private interests in the success of this play i shall say no more trusting to the gallantry of your temper for further proofs of friendship and allowing you like a true woman all the good qualities in the world now i am pleased with you as well as i gave you all the ill ones when i was angry with you i remain with the greatest truth  sir your most humble most faithful and most obliged servant de la rivier manley  the preface i cannot suffer this play to pass into the world without expressing my gratitude to the ladies who in such a distinguishing manner graced and supported it so much beauty and good nature could not fail of rendring that person happy for whose benefit they were employed i think my self infinitely blessed in their smiles since i can be sensible of no greater glory than to hear that i have had the honor to please them  to tell the world that mr booth and mrs oldfields action was admirable in the parts of lucius and rosalinda is saying nothing new they are so used to charm the audience and delight the best judges of the theater however i beg leave to make them my public acknowledgments and to please my self with what i have heard reported of their performance in this play which is that though they have often shined in several greater parts yet none ever became them better mr booths masterly and graceful action supported lucius whilst mrs oldfields charms and enchanting manner gave life and beauty to the queen  prologue by sir richard steel not lee for buskins famed would often say to stagesuccess he had a certain way something for all the people must be done and with some circumstance each order won this he thought easy as to make a treat and for a tragedy gave this receipt take me said he a princess young and fair then take a blooming victor flushed with war let him not owe to vain report renown but in the ladies sight cut squadrons down let him whom they themselves saw win the field him to whose sword they saw whole armies yield approach the heroin with dread surprise and own no valor proof against bright eyes the boxes are your own  the thing is hit and ladies as they near each other sit cry oh how movingly that scene is writ for all the rest with ease delights you will sbape write for the heroes in the pit a rape give the first gallery a ghost on the upper bestow though at that distance a good supper thus all their fancies working their own way they are pleased and think they owe it to the play but the ambitious author of these scenes with no low arts to court your favor means with her success and disappointment move on the just laws of empire and of love prologue by a young gentleman spoken by mr walker in ancient days the time we do not know it is so very very long ago envy was forced to lead an harmless life to stay at home a mere italian wife would ye believe it ladies tet it is true she had not learned to dress like one of tou nor did she then appear a thoughtless beau nor wore cockades nor into armies go to play houses she never presumed to come and rarely visited the drawing room even masquerades where no one shows the face would not admit of envy in the place ah happy days when dullness feared no lash the author gave no wit yet got his cash when an attempt to please was taken well and on weak woman never critic fell but our new taste brings on a new demand for wit alone at present cannot stand you must have scandal politics and traps to raise the ladies blush and footmens claps what can poor we expect in such a case dare english tragedy plead hopes of grace no party favored no designs in view to make old times club faction with the new no double soft entenders to excite no politics to please the wise to night such a dull play could any modern write alas we own the allegation just but it is to you the shining fair we trust as you are fair our author hopes to find you can forgive and then you will be kind dramatis personae men honorius king of gallia mr thurmond vortimer usurper of britain mr ryan lucius prince of britain mr booth arminius prince of albany

the queen to the scene returning is met by arminius arm it is you my dearest lord i have been seeking i come to rail against the faithless sex i would inveigh against inconstant charms against the flattering gales and changing winds against the aprilseason of the year against false hopes false vows and falser beauty  luc arminius thus concerned thus strangely moved tears in his eyes distraction in his looks what mean thou albany strait let me know depend upon thy friend upon his love you are next of kindred to our charming queen and have a double title to our service  arm behold my lord and

publicly exchanged me for another  luc the common frailty of the sex  arm to pity me oh make the case your own give me some time for tears suppose your hopes by mutual love by mutual transports fired

father had his choice declared with easy resignation she became the royal bride of aquitain  luc go on i will hear thee out with patience  arm what wretch like me so doting or despairing i fought in war as one who longed to die your self can witness how i valued danger otharius slain and free to choose again what said she not for her late breach of faith how did she swear she never had ceased to love that i was dearer to her than the light but in the tenderest moment of her vows the wanderer strayed again and i was lost  luc oh heaven and earth sure i can bear no more  arm of your great merit jealous i prevailed and from your self drew the abhorred confession i warned you of the danger but in vain i durst no more as tender of her fame as willing yet to doubt of my misfortune for when i but reproached the wavering fair she used such various soothings to my mind such vows that lucius never had spoke of love that scarce was it a merit to believe her thus was my easy faith abused  luc what proof have thou of this  arm oh i had every proof her virgin heart her speaking eyes her lips her charming tongue and the pale queen of night on flowery banks whilst we invoked her beams beheld our loves each happy moment witnessed to our joys true emblems of the sex and her frail vows for as the moon so weaned her fickle passion the fleeting moments bore her truth away and only i am left to speak her falsehood an hated evidence of broken faith and yet some proof remains pulls a bracelet from his arm this bracelets of her hair wove with her hand which to the present gave a double value view well the clasp see her fair self enshrined the altar where my constant vows i paid these were the gifts she gave me with her heart why do i still such worthless toys retain when the chief jewel is recalled why yet as sacred relics of our love worship the shrine of an apostate fair hence vain remembrancers of past delight stamps upon the bracelet and picture i will tread you into dust live
