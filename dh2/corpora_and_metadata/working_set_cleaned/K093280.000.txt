delivers all the particulars concerning every person whom he memorialises from the color of an eyebrow even unto the pattern of a shoebuckle  since therefore it accords that narrators must use such

were uttered unto him by the great mr whitfield the good mr wesley the pious mr bradbury and the learned mr roman but now it behooves me for expediting the sale of my book to give an account of his birth parentage education character and behavior yet for as much as it does not in any sort suit me to deliver those historialisms according to the vanity of the times i have agreed with a scribe of

first dancing master editor zaphaniel one afternoon as i was preparing a political essay for the next days chronicle in answer to a letter i had inserted the week before on the other side the question the boy from the blue posts said two gentlemen wanted me at his masters  my dear wife whose prudence and person are unequalled was unwilling i should go but upon recollection i ventured not without some necessary precaution i must confess and was inducted into a room where two very well looking men were seated  the shortest of them was dressed in a laced coat a fine flowered gold and silver waistcoat figured ruffles a heart at his shirt bosom made of green and red stones he had a sword and a bunch of ribbands at the handle and he held a snuff box in his hand  as his complexion was of the olive tint his eyes vacant his nostrils charged with rappee and his eyebrows forehead and other parts of his face indicating he much practiced the look contemptuous i took him for some foreign nobleman just imported but he was a figure dancer at the operahouse and thus he opened the business to me  dancing master sir we have taken the liberty to send for you because we hear you are an author that gentleman pointing to his friend who wore his own dark brown hair parted on the top of his head and smoothly stroked down each side of his temples then tucked behind his ears as you have seen window curtains turned back mr zaphaniel has got some very curious stories relating to a particular player but he wants to have them put into a proper style   editor what sort of a style sir   dancing master nay as to that sir it will be left to you i have nothing to say to style for my part  gentlemen like me never read i never looked into a book in my life  i keep my chariot sir and people nowadays dont keep their chariots by book reading   editor would you have it in a drole style sir   dancing master ay ay as drole as you can faith  touch up all the actors and singers in it they are only fit to be made game with as to the dancers you may let them alone only if you can cleverly throw in any hints about myself for i teach most of the people of fashion in town i am indecd

as this porter seems to be very good we will assemble here   dancing master but sir addressing himself to me likewise that you may be the better able to understand what you are about you should have an idea of the person who this history is wrote upon therefore come to me next sunday two oclock to dine at jemmy warners ned will be there and nancy with him nancy you must know sir is a wench he is a friend to for the fellow faith has a devilish smart sort of a genius for high life although he is but a player he keeps his girl wears embroidery drinks burned champaign and betts his  0 as freely as if he was the best nobleman or dancing master in england   editor but sir you spoke something of mentioning you in these memoirs   dancing master you must know sir there is no doing any good in the world without puffing it does not signify if you are the cleverest fellow that can be in your way without you can puff yourself off or get your friends to puff you off you will never get forwards for it is not now the question whether an artist is a genius but whether he is in fashion now there are several ways of managing this bringing a man into fashion some choose to bribe a very great ladys hairdresser others get into fashion cause their fathers have a vote or their sister a pretty face or they were born on this side or that side berwickbridge or because  because  in short sir there are many schemes but i dont like any of them half so well as printing your merits in the news papers or writing a book about it  i was let into the secret by my master who got all his money by advertising for as he said never mind what other people say do you say as much as you can for yourself and keep at it and if you will go on telling the town so you will talk them into it until they believe every syllable about you  the mss i took home with me and being promised ready money began to digest the materials immediately   act i scene ii master neddys descent ascertained from the antidiluvian british records of the llwhyddwhuydd family no not all the wives in the world shall persuade me to it not for all the wives in the world would i suffer such a thing stamping with his foot at the same time and throwing his hat hard upon the ground bite my nose what the devil business has she to long to bite my nose if it was a child of my own getting and i loved the mother ever so well i would not allow it  thus was mr thomas ap morgan a welsh chairman very vehemently telling his mind to david llwhyddwhuydd his partner david mildly replying you know my dear countryman that now i am the very last look you of all the llwhyddwhuydds in all wales and will any countryman of mine any true briton and there are no true britons but welsh folks you know thomas  thomas yes to be sure i do and thank god for that i am but a welchman truly but i am a true briton and britons never will be slaves and therefore why should your wife want to bite my nose then   david now thomas would you have the most ancientest family in all wales and all merionethshire to boot as indeed mine is to be extinguished rather than let yourself be put to a little pain and if my wife should miscarry there is an end of all my hopes for only providence and good sir watkins knows when i shall be able to get another child for we have been a long time about this and if we lose this all my hopes of having a family to inherit my nam is gone because you know we have never another child in the world but that which is coming to be born now   thomas picking up his hat and wiping the flaps of it with his elbow replied you know david that i would not have mrs llwhyddwhuydd vexed now she is so near her downlying upon any account but why should you say yours is the most ancientest family in wales did not the ap morgans go to meet william the conqueror  david gods blessings upon us both i am ashamed to hear a welchman talk of any thing so little a while ago as william the conqueror why my family i have all the parchment account of it at home was in wales before the deluge   thomas but where did they go when the world was drownded   david why they went on board ship with captain noah and the ship settled upon a very high mountain and the mountain was penmanmuir and wales was the first place peopled again and japhet married into our family and i have some of his blood now in my veins and our family has been in merionethshire ever since now here lies the point my dear suppose my son because my wife should lose her longing is to be born without a nose or god help us with two noses now for great authors say that a woman with child when she longs or is affrighted the effects will be the same upon the child   thomas but i dont believe it no more than if i am carrying a fare and a dog shall come behind page   th  me and bite my leg that the gentleman or the lady look you in the chair shall have the print of the dogs teeth in their skin   david but i will show you friend thomas from the testimony of learned wise men pulling a book out of his pocket i copied them with my own handwriting to convince you of the danger that may attend letting my wife that you profess so much friendship for lose her longing   thomas well you know mr david i love to hear histories so let us sit down they did so and mr lwhyddwuyd began to read the testimonies of the learned as follows   case i  aldrovandus relates that a woman in sicily observing a lobster taken by a fisherman and being moved by an earnest longing for it brought forth a lobster altogether like what she had seen and longed for  vide the copperplate  ii is told by john swammerdam a certain woman at utrecht being with child was frighted with the sight of a negro and apprehended to be delivered of a perfect black but at last recollecting herself she made use of a second imagination to prevent the danger from the first for she washed herself from head to foot with hot water to clear the child from blackness the time of her delivery being come the child was born with all his teeth and appeared perfectly white except those places the hot water did not reach  iii by ditto a child was born in normandy with horns upon his head and cloven feet and he proved afterward to be a man of extraordinary sense and judgment the occasion of that misfortune was that his father having represented a satyr upon the stage had the knowledge of his wife in that ridiculous dress  iv we have a case in fabricius hildanus upon the faith of ludovicus horniceus a physician of frankfort viz a woman having been frighted with the firing of a gun was delivered of a child with a wound in the back of the same shape as if it had been done with a musket shot  v father malebranche in his search after truth relates that seven or eight years ago was seen in the hospital of incurables a young man who was born an idoet and whose body was broken in the same places where malefactors are broke he had lived near twenty years in that condition and has been seen by several persons the cause was his mother hearing a criminal was to be broke went to see the execution  father malebranche proceeds to explain this strange accident children says he see what their mothers see they hear the same cries they receive the same impressions of the objects and are moved by the same passions all the blows given to the malefactor did violently strike the mothers imagination and by the counterblow the tender and soft brain of the child  the fibers of the childs brain not being able to resist the torrent of the spirits were broken that is the reason why he came into the world without understanding the violent course of the mothers animal spirits went with force from her brains to the several parts of her body which answered to the parts of the malefactor twas the same in the child  but because the bones of the mother were capable to resist the violence of the spirits they were not wounded but this rapid stream of the spirits was capable to carry away the soft and tender parts of the bones of the child and it is to be observed that if the mother had determined the motion of the spirits toward any other part of the body her child had not had his bones broke but that part which answered to the part toward which the mother determined her spirits had been sorely wounded  vi a gentlewoman of helsenor says bartholin was delivered of a great cat which to the astonishment of the assistants ran away with great celerity and was never seen afterward  because the lady was frightened with one  vii bartholin also relates i have it he says from john naborousky a gentleman of poland and my good friend that a woman of that country was brought to bed of two small fishes without scales which were no sooner born but they swam in the neighboring waters as naturally as others do because the lady did long for them so that you see my friend thomas look you it is all the same according to the opinions of these learned people whether a lady is frighted or whether a lady longs  thomas well let us hear some more stories in the name of god  i do love to hear such things to be sure but god help me for my own sake but to be sure i cannot believe all these things so well as the scholars do because i have not their learning but go on do my friend do go on which request david obeyed immediately   viii philippus meurs apostolical prothonotary and cannon of st peters in louvain a reverend ancient man affirmed unto me and several others says our author thomas fienus that he had a sister complete in the rest of her body but without a head instead of which was joined to her neck a shell fish in the likeness of a seamuscle made up of two shells which shut and opened and by which from a spoon she took her nourishment and this he said was occasioned for that the mother with child with her had a strong desire after some muscles she beheld in the market but could not procure at that instant this sister of his lived in this monstrous condition to be eleven years old and then by accident happening angrily and very strongly to bite the spoon they fed her with and breaking the shells died quickly after  ix schenkius tells of a woman very big who among other discourses with her neighbors mention being made of her great belly she told them she reckoned about the time of epiphany or festival of the three kings upon which the good woman wishing she might bring forth three kings she merrily answered with all her heart and accordingly at the time she bore three sons one of them an ethiopian or of a black color as usually one of those kings are painted the same relation is confirmed by cornel gemma being seen as he says by great multitudes in the city of louvain and authenticated by undoubted testimony  x there was a lady a kinswoman of mine says sir kenelm digby who used much to wear black patches upon her face a fashion among young women which i to put her from used to tell her in jest that the next child she should go with should come into the world with a great black spot in the midst of its forehead and the apprehension was so lively in her imagination that she had a daughter born and marked just as the mother had fancied with a great black spot upon her  xi there lived amongst us at bern in switzerland says gul fabricius an honest woman who about ten years since being great with child and quarrelling with another woman put herself into such a passion that she was unable to contain herself after which falling into labor she was brought to bed of a daughter of a courageous and heroic mind but her feet and hands contracted as if ready to fight and her whole body in continual motion so that she walks as it were dancing and in a trembling posture after the manner of angry people unable to govern their passion  xii amb parey gives us to understand that in the year      a child was born in a village near fontainbleau with the shape of its face exactly like that of a frog which was brought to pass by the mothers holding that creature in her hand to allay the heat of a fever about the time of her conception  xiii but something singular beyond all these is the tale of languis of a woman longing to bite the naked shoulder of a baker passing by her which rather than she should lose her longing the goodnatured husband hired the baker at a certain price accordingly when the bigbellied woman had bit twice the bakers wife broke away from the people who held her would not suffer her to bite her husband again for want of which she bore one dead child with two living ones  why then i say thus thomas very loudly began hitting his hand hard upon the table i say the baker was   at that instant a voice from the street called chair chair out run mr david and mr thomas the book the nose the wife were in an instant forgot for the occult desire of moneygetting annihilates all other considerations as black absorbs all factitious colors  how the chairman came to be so learned as we all love to know every thing courteous reader you shall if you please be informed  upwards of twenty years had he taken in the magazines and had made so many abstracts and remembered so many extracts that if he had page     not been a chairman he might have been made honorary professor of universal erudition  he was the living lexicon to which the whist and jockey clubs applied whenever they made a bett about spelling a word and he had from observation acquired such a genius or power in disputation that all smatterers he silenced as easily as socrates did the sophists if a true scholar happened to contradict him david from his knowledge of the world dumfounded the student by offering him ten pound on it for he proceeded upon one general and not an often controverted principle i e no rich men will mind learning ergo only poor folks are scholars  therefore every fool every dunce dares to assert to contradict to find fault or praise even with the utmost ignorant effrontery and oppose the opinions of men of real merit  blockheads having one undeniable resource the proposing a wager  mrs llwhyddwhuydd master neddys mama was born in america the daughter of a mulatto woman her papa the famous councellor justice who was sent abroad on account of some books being missing the grandfathers disgrace is the reason why none of his descendants ever chose to learn their letters  hence as heinsius observes it is very easy to account for the hero of this history being illiterate  miss justice was imported undercook to a westindian family who came to england for improvement they hired a fine house the south side of maidstone within half a mile exactly of the marketplace and on the right hand of the london road  n b the utmost precision is made use of in relating the situation of the house because an attention to truth is the editors greatest care throughout the whole of this publication  in maidstone at this time there was a company of comedians that town and county being remarkable for the residence of such sort of people it is an observation of naturalists that turnips and attorneys thrive best in norfolk that sussex is noted for bad roads and smugglers and that it is as impossible to eradicate buggs from london as to free kent from hoppickers gypsies and stroling players  in all rural theatrical communities it is the custom of one of the actors to carry playbills to the people of fashions houses about the country and as these jamaica gentlefolks were remarkable for sumptuous living the manager cast himself into that part of the business this occasioned much murmuring when his back was turned among the rest of the company they would meet at the alehouse and call him all the scoundrels and tyrants imaginable but the moment they saw him returning they run out of the room begged he would drink with them and happy was he who could get his handkerchief out first to wipe the dust off from his masters shoes he loved like most of his brethren eleemosinary high living therefore he never missed carrying up a bill every morning to the west indian squires and used to wait in the hall at first along with the butchers boy to know their honors commands  scene  th page     the moonlight amor    but miss justice being very fond of players asked this proprietor of clothes and scenes to step into the pantry where the rest of the servants assembled there he was treated with several remnants of danties saved from yesterdays dinner and he made the kitchen company vastly merry for he could be exquisitely entertaining  he spoke tragedy speeches to them he showed them tricks he made them faces he sung songs he acted the lame man and the stuttering man and stood upon his head and drank out of his shoe no man had more wit than he had and he rehearsed all the other comicalities by which benefitmaking geniuses push their tickets off the young lady abovementioned fell in love with this master actor his name or at least the name he went by was samly and as mr samly was seeing miss justice home from the playhouse in about a week afterward she confessed her affection to him and informed him that she had forty nine pounds of her own and in her own possession all in specie  samly immediately fell in love with her they vowed eternal fidelity to each other and ratified those vows by the most particular engagement before they went out of the home close while the bright stars in the fiery fretted canopy of heaven sparkled over their heads and the silent gloworms twinkled at their sides the leafy hedges rustling to their embraces and the whoping owls at distance toot tooting to their sighs as mr samly observed made up great natures loving concert the next week unknown to any of their acquaintance they set out for london together samly left his clothes and scenes behind him indeed they were mortgaged for rather more than the worth to the landlord of the stable in which they acted  the editor of this treatise remembers this mr samlys company at maidstone and they had the use of a brewhouse to shift their clothes in the ladies dressingplace was the mashtub and alexander the great he has known to rehearse his mad scene very cleverly in the cooler  the brace of lovers determined to remain in cog for some time in london because as miss justice said what would all the world think of her if all the world should come to know it therefore desired mr samly would get a license as soon as possible  that he promised upon his honor should be his next mornings business and added at the same time my ineffable chloe we will content ourselves with these lodgings for the present what to thee or me does it a dram signify if as yet we are at st giless or st jamess  no we are ourselves let us be where we please  upon the instant he brandished his ladys curling irons with which he was then pinching his bag wig  majestically he strode cross the room and then with most emphatical dignity  he  spit out of the window  resuming his subject thus he went on  before the winter comes on thou opening rose of beauty well take a ready furnished house in some of the genteel squares about piccadilly but first i will determine with myself which theater i choose to belong to  a man of my merit my lovely attractress will be caressed by the managers of both houses so i will play them off one against the other promise them both and at last who bids most has me i know my cue  but i am resolved never to come upon the square of common salary actors no i will have so much certain when i play or else such a sum of money out of the house as a sharer and this way  hitching up his breeches at the same time this way i shall keep up my consequence and consequence is what an actor ought to study as much ay and more than his parts but it happened to mr samly as it may have to thee reader his expectations were superior to his advancement the managers of both theaters refused him  his case was very severe he had a great mind to print it to let the town know how he was used he did so but it did not answer any purpose the public took no notice of it and the bookseller lost money by it  his ladys fortune being soon dissipated duns grew exceedingly impertinent misfortunes presented themselves before him in all the frightful phantoms of hunger bad shoes bum bailiffs rainy weather no trust and an empty coalhole he cursed the pride of managers their ignorance their inhumanity he damned the town he despised life he grew desperate and one morning before the fringed covering of his ladys eyelights were withdrawn he went down stairs and opening the streetdoor he i am afraid it will never be believed but the fact is authentic and i can bring several reputable people to witness the truth of it  he that very morning resolved  to work at his own business and relinquish the stage for ever saying with cardinal wolsey  farewell a long farewell to human greatness onwards he went leaving his lady london his creditors and choice spirits making the best of his way to his own parish in nottinghamshire to work at the stocking frame nor cast one longing lingering look behind  scene iii miss shred and miss justice miss justice received a letter from samly that very day by the pennypost with his reasons for absenting himself and as the epistle is really curious we shall present a copy of it to the reader recommending the author to the notice of the gentlemen publishers of periodical papers as a proper person to be employed by them when they need a journalist  since he can moralize seems to know mankind has a pretty knack at abuse can write very well on the worst side the question does not much mind orthography and by his manner i fancy him neither timid hesitating or conscientious  to mrs samly my dear adorable when i consider life it is all a cheat as to the managers blast such scoundrels however i am resigned to fate whatever world i next am thrown upon cannot be worse than this  as i am now determined to rennounce the follys passions and delights of desire i have been obliged to leave thee my life and soul my all that heaven can give what can i do while there was one thing my charmer had left to raise money upon did i desert her  no  did i not my lovely creature stay with thee till the last penny was spent for we were rich in love but now approaching want with all its wofill train appearing i retire from the storm not being able to live my dear and see thee in distress therefore have cut myself off from all the pleasure of loved london and thee the chief and condescend curse on my stars to the vile mekanicall method of being obliged to get bread by working at my business  i leave you in good hands i know my landlord loves you and if during my exile as he is rich you admit him into my throne only for a time why it will be political i give you leave as it may expedite my recall as congreve says he takes your body i your mind i must have the better bargain  remember this is my request nay my command to yield yourself up to one person for the sake of another and what is done by the finest women in england and what i would do for you with the finest woman in england  adieu  after samly had put the letter in the postoffice he recollected his dear chloe could not read  however upon reflection he was not sorry for that for by heavens and all the ingenuity of arts and sciences he called out it is an elegant epistle equal to any of popes literary correspondence and whoever my girl gets to read my letter for her will and must admire the writer and with me lament the loss which the town must receive by those fellows of managers not employing me  just as the epistle abovementioned came to hand it happened that miss shred was upon a visit to miss justice or mrs samly as she was called in the neighborhood this young lady the visitor had a very great taste for plays herself and was an occasional actress at richmond and at bartholomew fair her father has been breeches seater to me these nine years and it was from his mouth that i have been assured of the authenticity of this relation  as soon as miss justice had heard the letter read she shrieked she stamped she wrung her hands she took salts not ariadne for the loss of theseus not a queen condemned to the duckingstool not  but no allusions could carricature her her lamentations brought up the landlord mr llwhyddwhuydd to whom miss shred discovered samlys perfidy although she did not show him the letter but begged mr david would leave the lady a little until she came to herself as it is good manners to do so we will attend the chair  carrying gentleman down stairs who rejoiced exceedingly at the two pieces of good news as he called them  in the first place to find mr samly was not her husband and in the next place to suppose mr samly was run away from her for david long had loved long had he secretly admired her  the tender god of soft desires roused all the sentimental soul of llwhyddwhuydd softning his heart as vinegar will render marble supple  twas on the  th day after mr samly and his chloe had taken the lodgings that miss justice fried some beef stakes and onions for mr samlys dinner and invited their landlord to the feast so relishing was the sauce page     so crisp the vegetables that the landlord thought her the finest woman he ever saw but when on the next day he discovered her darning so nicely her gallants stocking which like a french chicken glove she had drawn upon her arm while samly was rehearsing othello the conquest was complete he became perfectly her slave and sighing vowed upon his honor madam samly was the most compleatest gentlewoman to look to that ever he did see in all his life dash not the book down oh ye delicate because i have related unembellished the beginning of love  love has many beginnings but one ending love is like the city of london in a map of england and the senses are the turnpike roads on which travelers trot to it love is like the tunes in the beggars opera nay its like the beggars opera itself because the catastrophe is often brought about very unexpectedly  men have odd tastes why then should david be blamed for this is it not common for ladies to relate the surprising conquests they have made over their husbands and the simple means by which those victories have been obtained madam blanch avowed to me her spouse fell in love with her for her small ear the deputys wife shot her good man with a pair of black satin shoes and stone buckles the motion of the hips in walking has made many ladys fortune esquire pointer declared but last week he was particularly struck with the white point of his wifes elbow and with allbecoming reverence for the marriage state do i speak this as i am myself in that nuptial band i was won to surrender my liberty to the all excellent graces of my wife who in her virgin state alarmed my eager desires when she threw herself into that most graceful attitude of tying her garter here i must beg leave to be indulged with some anecdotes concerning my spouse  she was born she was bred a gentlewoman i married her out of sir trinket trollys family her mamma was companion to lady trolly and my wife born in that house was educated in all the becoming elegance inherent to a woman of the first quality  while i paid my addresses to her several wealthy tradesmen proffered her their services but her soul was above mixing with vulgarities she scorned to listen to the voice of mechanic moneylovingslaves she valued the addresses of a man of wit more than all peru  on that hint i spoke  she loved me for the stories which i told and i loved her cause she did listen to them the rules of politeness obliged us to leave the afflicted miss justice when decency desired davy to go down stairs but now we have liberty again to walk into her apartment  sit down good reader you are very welcome the young lady is pretty well recovered a serenity beams upon her brow there is not the least print of afflictions footsteps to be seen upon her countenance  but this calmness was not owing either to the affected pedantry of school stoicism called philosophy which honest teague who never read a page of seneca so well defined by saying by jasus i am born to be unhappy so i will make myself very easy about the matter  neither was the young lady of so callous a constitution as to be easily reconciled to the departure of her gallant by the method which the present females of intrigue make use of viz immediately to throw themselves in the way of another  no this happy restoration was effected by that neverfailing nostrum nants brandy q s  miraculous specific blush blush ye diplomists of gresham ye who pretend to understand things asico for your knowledge pound all the materia medica together in a mortar can ye compose such a mental succedaneum  behold reader the two young ladies and mark with what courteous words the visiting lady addresses the lady visited  mrs shred my dear samly take the other pinch it will do your head good thus kindly did my taylors daughter console her companion untwisting at the same time her paper of rappee   mrs justice call me not samly dear creature i conjure you i detest the name oh miss shred what woman would ever put her trust in man   mrs shred curse on um indeed my dear man is as the poet says deceitful as the vind  therefore woe be to the woman who has imbibed any fond ideas for wits or players or such sort of geniusses  curse me if ever wit did any good to man woman or child since the invention of clean linen  as to wits perdition catch such scrubs  they behave as bad to their ladies as they do to one another  they will never give an absent friend a good word or allow a girl a second gown to see company in   miss shreds story yes  i must confess a wit was the first man who really had me that is critically speaking possessed my soul as to my person that was merely passive in all those other connections to which my interest made me submit because as i was then upon the town and my inclinations not being engaged with my embraces i was as indifferent to the performance as an actress when she plays a part dont please her  in london madam there are men as well as women on the town and they go by the names of wits and droles and cleverfellows and choice spirits whether they give these titles to themselves or other people call them so its no matter but they are sent for into company to divert people of fashion with what they can do just as girls are i mean madam in the way of singing and saying comic things and telling stories  it is a shame though men should expose themselves so because they are all of them bred to trades and might get their livings honestly and decently if they were not a set of lazy meanspirited and conceited fellows  now when any of our sex is blasted it is all up with us we are unhappy enough to be reduced to the necessity of going into company or starving no body will employ us in an honest way because a girl who is forced to be a whore for her livelihood is looked upon especially by all good christians to be the most contemptible creature upon the face of the earth  i sent a card to one of these wits and geniuses to sup with me the consequence of which you may naturally suppose  we went to bed together  really i loved him infinitely for he was not only vastly clever but immensely odd and that you know takes with our sex immoderately  but he soon behaved as all such sort of people will horridly ungrateful for after i had paid all his debts they were not large indeed because no shops would give him much credit new clothed him and put money in his pocket he used me  as surlily as if i had been his wife had i really been married to him he could not have treated me worse  the word fool fool was perpetually his answer not only to me but to all his acquaintance we were all fools he swore and yet in the whole fifteen months of our cohabitation though he called every body bockheads yet he never did one rational or just thing but by chance he could repartee drolely tell very high stories argue charmingly upon all subjects make songs as fast as i could cut out cappatterns but his words and his deeds were no more alike than the sign of a dolphin and a real one  he once wrote a book in praise of neatness in dress of elegace and of decency he was three weeks about it and in all that time never washed his hands face or teeth once  cleanliness or dirt was all the same to him money or no money  only let him but get into company was all he cared for when he had no money he was tossed into the reckonings when he got three or four guineas he threw it away and he would sooner sit without shifting himself for a fortnight in a night cellar if he had no body left that he could make laugh but link boys than be regular to the bounds of decency and domestic enjoyments  he grew so overbearing at last so irregular and so obstinate that i could not bear it  he scorned to be talked to and too proud to say he had ever been in the wrong  he was indeed as all wits are irresolute and froward as a baby giddy as a drunken man absent as a lunatic as difficult to be pleased as a vexed idiot and conceited as an opera singer  oh my dear never have any thing to do with your geniuses unless you can get one of them now and then to write a song upon you for that very often helps a lady to many a good friend  but for all that i never would have any connection with such sort of sparks  as to granting a man that made a good song upon me a favor ang passawnt as the french say i should not mind it  but dont never dear creature be fond of them  no  the only men worth a ladys notice are those gentlemen who have no wit indeed but then they have what is better than all the wit genius and understanding in the world  and what most commonly wit genius and understanding never have any thing to do with and that is money  money my dear let but a lady have that  and she is sure of having doing saying and being just what she pleases  the next person to whom i was predestined happened to be neither a wit nor a scholar nevertheless he was both a genius and a gentleman because he was a gamester as daring as a lion he would as soon draw his sword as his snuff box and was as quick as volatile salts  he valued his honor before any other consideration in the way of playing any game at cards or dice for he would sooner venture his life than be found out so careful was he of his honor you cannot imagine how polite he was and what fine company he kept although as i told you he could hardly write his name or spell a word of two syllables but a gentlemans being ignorant of letters is no proof against his politeness for really i believe it would go very hard with some folks of the best company if they were to be examined concerning their reading and writing  miss justice very true indeed miss but thank god persons in polite life are two well bred to be pedants and i would no more ask any fine gentleman or lady after their scholarships than i would after their religion because both the one and the others out of fashion now   miss shred well madam my friend did such things in the moneywinning way and with such grace  to be sure he lived like a nobleman and mantained me like a duchess i had my equipage all upon gilded springs and i used to scorn all low bred persons as i called them for walking a foot because as my friend used to tell me nobody never need be poor if they had but a spirit to do things  for if people wanted luck they should make it or else be punished with poverty for their faintheartedness  but for all that what by the law or by one thing or another we dwindled to be obliged to live in a two pair of stairs backroom madam as you may do now and i cannot but say we used to sit and think ourselves very ill done by providence  because why should we be poor when we took as much pains in the proper way of getting fortunes as ever any people did who got estates as the fashion is now to get them well madam at last we parted and he married a methodists widow with  00 l a year jointure and i engaged myself as a figure dancer at the opera house because i was told a lady had a better chance there of being taken into keeping than at the english play houses but i did not find the opera peoples taste so eager at intriguing with any of our sex as i expected  o curse that italy my dear  but no more of that  i grew very low and i sent to my late friend who had married the methodists widow for a guinea and his answer was truly he had done with all the vanities of this life and so should i and that he would advise me not to look after money but go and seek the lord   miss justice but who am i to seek who will seek me   miss shred nay as to that madam never despair remember what is said to you in the letter about your landlord david  i am sure it may be easily brought about for him to marry you i have so often heard him say what would he give for such a wife as you   page  th case      miss justice but dear creature would it not be immensely shocking and absurd in me  in me to descend from being an actors nay a managers mistress and become a chairmans wife  perish that thought  can i bear it can i dear miss shred can i who came from a gentlemans family yes madam my papa was a counselor at law he was prosecuted for his merit persecuted for the superiority of his talents and banished from his native country by faction but i am his own daughter and can i ever agree to have these arms filled with any body who is not a gentleman born or who is not so by profession or is not a person of consequence ay consequence that was what my deceiver samly used to insist upon his consequence but why should i mention him or any other belonging to the stage i who have suffered by my fatal connection with an actor o that the world was all in flames that final destruction might seize on all since i am deceived deserted farther she could not proceed for her friend fearful least her companion should relapse into fresh grief snatched up the pewter measure in a moment in which was one remaining cordial draught and holding it to chloes lips insisted on her not making any more words but drink it off   chloe wiping her lips dear shred you are so immensely kind that to convince you of my esteem i will be ruled by you and marry this horrid creature nay i will do more for from henceforth i bid adieu to all high lifet ideas to the fond charms of even dear intrigue   miss shred miss justice you should not make rash vows consider my dear you are a gentlewoman and many gentlewomen marry only for the sake of intriguing we should use the sex as that sex ought to be used i would always choose the man who i fancied most properest for my interest to be my husband and then choose the man whom i most fancied for my lover   chloe but how dear creature am i sure that as this odd mortal this david my landlord now he knows i was only samlys mistress how am i sure i say that he will have me for a wife and upon my soul i would sooner die than derogate so far from the dignity of my birth and my principles of honor as to live with any man but a gentleman without being married to him   miss shred as to that my dear you are vastly in the right on it and our sex ought to be as strict in keeping up our consequence in that point as any or more than any other but as to the landlords knowing of your having an affair  to be sure although he is but a chairman yet he is a welshman and he might perhaps have too much spirit had he not lived so many years at this end of the town as to know that it is fashionable and what is fashionable you know must be polite besides my dear not one of his companions dare to hit him in the teeth with it if he was to marry you for fear of offending one or other of their best customers   chloe i am determined but at the same time am as determined to avoid even the appearance of intrigue what other ladies of taste and delicacy do shall be no rule for me to go by i will be true to my husband my honor and myself nor ever again grant any other man save him an involuntary embrace   the next weeks sun saw her blazoned in the matrimonial installation with how much firmness of soul she maintained her resolution of chastity will be expressed in some of the succeeding chapters in the conclusion of this i hope the reader will give me leave to observe that though like miss shred ladies may be women of the town and actresses at the same time and that there are some females belonging to the theaters who now publicly act in both capacities yet so far from being a reproach it is the greatest argument which can be brought in support of the profession of a player for although the want of chastity like the want of money may make some people appear but in an indifferent light yet according to the times neither of them have any thing to do at present with the respect which is paid to the accomplishments of genius  scene matrimony on the weddingnight after the raptures of enjoyment between mr and madam llwhyddwhudd were evaporated when every heartfelt thrill and throb of desire subsided each fine string of delight which had been extatic stretched by imaginations apparatus let down into a philosophic relaxation the new married pair lay back to back  the lady being most restless was considering whether it would or would not offend the rules of delicacy if she was once again to turn to her husband  her spouse was then debating since he had married so good a cook and so notable a woman about making his house a public one which he did the winter following and had great business among the best people in the neighborhood his spouse being so obliging a landlady occasioned the famous tripe and trotter club to be instituted at mr llwhyddwhuydds  the tripe and trotter club was the original of all the other clubs now existing in this metropolis  from thence came the famous beefstake clubs the whist clubs the oxcheek clubs the jockey clubs the hornpipe clubs the peasoup clubs the choice spirit clubs the spirituous liquor clubs the political clubs the philosophical clubs the roasting clubs the punning clubs the spouting clubs the kept misses clubs and the club of discontents  david as he began to get money grew asthmatical and potbellied not breathing so freely as he was will not to do it frightened him like the rest of the wealth accumulating part of mankind he was terrified at the thoughts of dying therefore sent for a physician immediately  reader you must have known such persons who while they worked for their living were useful members to society but when by chance or craft they become masters of money assumed a haughtiness of behavior abandoning themselves to a vitiated state of idleness and gluttony the event is their being seized with a complication of infirmities which in their active and praiseworthy state they felt not they hurry to a doctor give five guineas for advice in hopes to have a worthless carcass sheathed from the worms which was it to continue on the earth for twenty years longer would not be of five shillings use to any of its fellow creatures  david by his physicians order was to return to his former trade this he had entirely left off his soul as he said being always rather above such an employment but when health is concerned when a life is to be saved by it  although a lady or gentleman may have ever so good a spirit to be sure upon such considerations they must give way according to sir john falstaffs aphorism  honor must be hid in necessity while mr david was putting himself once more into chaircarrying exercise some soldiers were ordered to be quartered in his neighborhood and corporal knott brought a billet for himself to mrs llwhyddwhuydds  the corporal was a gentleman remarkable for his gallantry he had had as many fine woman as any general officer he was formed for intrigue and graced with every accomplishment which could undo the fair  he sung all the songs in the beggars opera he could speak ten tragedy love speeches could dance a hornpipe show tricks with cards balance a ladys fan upon his nose no gentleman could fill a teapot more gracefully or swear more often or more agreeably then he wore his hat so smartly bluff and his hair was powdered so smooth could he have been but as constant as he was lovely yet as no man is perfect he affected to imitate his betters and boast of his amors  it is natural for one hero to take another for his pattern he chose alexander the great for his it was the macedonians frailty to glory too much in his conquests which arrian could no more excuse in the son of philip than i can in corporal knott  he though admired by the fair was disliked by his brother subalterns especially the veterans who hagged by winter campaigns their faces weatherworn and scarified did not like to see him look so plump so pert so smoothfaced and wear his linen so well ironed when they who had endured all the inclemency of every hard season in the tented and untented fields of unhospitable germany who reflected that at the time they were thus fighting their countrys battles instead of wearing nice plaited linen had not any linen to plait and half a dozen brave british battallion boys who scorned to turn their backs upon double the number of french fellows though all beruffled and chitterlind yet all their linen would not set up a tinder merchant  they snarled at this beau corporal swearing he was not fit for any service but just to make one in an officers guard at the operahouse  often have i heard these noncommissioned heroes as they have limped along  that defect in their gait proceeding either from the wounds received in battle or from the neglect of not being dressed after the fight or from incurable contractions or relaxations the fatal effects of being exposed to the scorching heats and sudden damps of africa and america and to the severity of wintering in illprovided quarters on the banks of the rhine the weeser the lip etc etc for which perhaps flemish and dutch commissaries                     i was present at the disputation which old winterness had with corporal knott on this subject which with the readers leave well insert  because if it is not a story it is a dialogue and as it is a dialogue it will be a means of displaying a copperplate exhibition of an old warrior and a junior fine gentleman or more properly to explain the print it is a contrast between the charms of peace in mr knotts figure and the fortune of war in the old soldiers portrait  at the valiant tooper the altercation happened old winterness was relating in the corporals company all the engagements he had been in fighting all his battles over and over again and marking with a stick upon the sand of the alehouse kitchen the marches and countermarches of our armies dwelling with emphasis on the spot where he had received a shot or lost a limb  there my boys just there where i put my foot now there i stood on the left of the scotch greys and had these two cuts on my skull and as it might be here i had these three wounds and supposing now these pieces of pipe to be our front line as i was to the right of the royal a musket ball took me in flank and went through both my thighs and there sir as i was running after the french pollavousees i lost the use of my right eye and sir supposing this fullpot now to be bocachica castle there i stood while we were attacking it and here it was that i left my arm and leg at cartagenah  but what then  i dont think much at it not i  i have gained honor and glory enough for an honest man  i know what it is to serve my country  and so here is his majesty king georges health and all his family and old england for ever  and as to my limbs why they are welcome to um as welcome as i am to this tobacco of my own buying  this limblosing conversation was foreign to the corporals thoughts he had been bred up in polite and delicate principles which was diametrically opposite to such gothic customs although several people of birth lately have been mad enough to relapse into their forefathers rusticity and not mind the suns spoiling their complexions nor different climates having any page   th  effect upon their constitutions and have been as cool amidst batteries broadsides pitched battles and forts storming as if they were only dancing minuets at an assembly in england  yet the corporal did not exceedingly relish such maiming honors for in his days fighting for ones country was not made such a fashion among fine gentlemen as it is at present therefore he rejoiced that a peace had been so expeditiously manufactured  yet he was ready with a small sword to give any private gentleman satisfaction  because that was fighting upon honor which no person of honor could refuse  but fighting for ones country may be refused because you may have  or  or  or  or  or  etc etc knott unwilling that old chelsea should win all the applause of the company interrupted the scarfurrowed grenadier observing that a man might run as many risques be in as many dangers at home as abroad and to prove it related his intrigues with several fine women  first he recounted the hair breadth scapes to get miss neatsfoot the tripemans daughter off  how he scaled the back garret how he knocked down the watchman and how the town was obliged to him for bringing so accomplished a girl upon it  thus the corporal went on  it was i that gave that girl the first idea of acting i ust to tell her how the first time she got into grand keeping she must persuade her friend to speak to some of the managers about letting her come upon the stage because i know that is common  ay and it is grown a scheme too among several gentlemen about town to get rid of their women that way for when a girl grows stale upon their hands and they want to part with her genteely without being a settlement out of pocket by her why then these gentlemen will call on one or other of the managers and so in a sort of halfasking favourway they will tell the proprietor that there is a fine woman of their acquaintance who they know will be of service in the playhouse and taking the patentee by the hand thell say  come set the girl down in the list pon honor i shall take it immensely kind i know you will not refuse me what is forty or fifty shillings a week out of your pocket besides i am sure she will earn it and this is the way that we have women of the town belonging to the theaters  then continued the corporal there was bett filbert she was the best dressed fruit girl about st jamess market  i beat the reforming rascals for her  no woman of quality though she had ever so fine a silk stocking and diamond shoebuckle on could show a neater leg and foot then betts was with her silver clasps red clocks and pinned up petticoats and as to an elegant and polite manner of doing things who ever opened oysters with more affability then bett or made a hotpot with more taste then she did  then there was waste butt the publicans widow i spent about five and forty pounds of her money only she grew too fond and when once a woman begins to behave so its fulsome and what no man of true delicacy can bear i was obliged therefore to leave her and got cherrycheeked judy that used to lisp at buckinghamgate can omilk sir  i was private then my officer made me a corporal for her  i ant the first gentleman i suppose who has made his fortune by women nor come to preferment by giving up his mistress  winterness who had sat chewing the cud of disappointment to be cut off in the concatenation of all his glorious recitals and by a smockfaced boy too as he muttered to me rose up like ajax boiling with rage and casting his eyes upon the corporal he burst out with  why then sir i must tell you  that a man of honor sir  striking his fist at the same time against his waistcoat breast buttons a man of honor sir would as soon sell his king as his mistress  a soldier let me tell you sir would as soon desert from his post or run away from his colors as give his girl up  i have been among the beauties in my time sir  but before i would surrender my woman to a general officers summons i would be drummed out of the regiment for cowardice and as to advancement i have got chelsea honestly  i never won preferment by pimping   corporal do you call me pimp sir   this dispute would certainly have grown serious had not the editor of this work started up between them  whispered knott that he saw a fine girl pass by the sash window and give the corporal a beckon away skipped knott and i begged old winterness to be pacified and that i would bring him half a pound of the best pigtail next sunday  this pleased the veteran he shook the editor heartily by the hand promised him never to mind any more fools for the future swore when he dyed he would leave me all his papers if i would promise him to write the history of an old soldier  it is necessary we should return to the other personages of our dramatical copperplate history and consider to what purpose corporal knott was introduced into this narration with regret i record it but madam llwhyddwhuydd for all her resolutions fell in love with him  sometimes a ladys vows like french treaties are not to be relied on  they are like hasty made acts of parliament which the cunning of convniency can always find means to evade  besides when love is in the case nay when money for love and money are like a principle in mechanics which acts equal and contrary love is equal in its power of action to money but contrary in its effects for as money will make persons blind to every thing but their own interest love will make persons see every thing but their own interest and with this mechanical metaphysical tritical critical and analytical disquisition proper it is to finish this scene of the drama  the choice spirits farce there is somewhat vastly significant not only in the reputation of being a soldier but also in a soldiers reputation which made madam llwhyddwhuydd as soon as ever the corporal came with his billet to her house regard him with an eye of complacency  but when she heard what a number of women he had ruined she could not take her eyes from him not being able to imagine what he possessed so extraordinary that made so many page     ladies fall in love with him  and as we know curiosity has as sudden and violent effect upon the frame of a fine woman as an hysteric she determined to be satisfied  the corporal conceived a most violent inclination for her from the moment he was convinced her husband was a monied man and that she bore the purse  he immediately opened his trenches with a love speech made regular approaches by squeezing her hand planted his battery of ogles against her and quickly found he had a friend in the garrison which determined him to make one general assault by a billet doux that he resolved should be in the most elegant manner and concluded to have a song wrote upon her  he enquired among the choice spirits who then held their meetings like the primitive christians by stealth the reforming constables carrying on terrible prosecutions against them he found them at the cat and bagpipe in rosemarylane after declaring upon honor he was no informer and owning his business he was inducted to the president whom you see in the print one george alexander stevens and who was recommended to the corporal as a songwriter  stevens received sixpence from him as earnest for it was a rule which the poets of that club had made to always have half the money down and the president declared he would write the song as soon as ever the disputation was over which the gentlemans entrance had put a stop to  the argument was warmly supported by the two altercators stevens and harry howard the assman concerning essential qualities george insisted the only acquisitions which could constitute human happiness were temperance stability and propriety of behavior  harry on the contrary swore that there were no accomplishments worth a mans while to be master of except good breeding and a good education this dispute would have lasted much longer had not a headborough opened the door and producing a warrant against harry howard for scurrility took away one side of the argument  a sheriffs officer would have carried off the other he came there with a thieftakes dog fearful of a rescue  but least the thread of our history should be snapped too soon we shall turn over this cause and arrest to the chapter entitled the art of bailtaking or  the  by  london  and westminster  all gentlemen performers in the pen and ink way of songmaking must acknowledge it is extremely unlucky when the ladys name whose person they are to celebrate will not make a proper rhyme  the number of pretty ballads which are sung every summer season at all public places of entertainment would lose one part of their merit were it not for the name jingle which so aptly terminates every stanza such as kitty downs and zouns miss apple and couple polly savage and cabbage love miss harriot and judas iscariot   what then could a songmaker do with llwhyddwhuydd had he not cunningly supplied that defect by versifying her creolian name chloe and fitted up so tasty a lovesong for the corporal that mr knott taking the bard by the hand swore had he had any more money about him to signify he would have made george a handsome present over and above what he agreed with him for however the military mans spirit was so great and he was so well pleased with the verses that he slipped the remaining change of sixpence into the poets hand which was all knott had after paying for a tankard of porter the entrance fee which every body subscribed according to the rules of the room before they could be admitted honorary members  the editor of this undertaking cannot be so ungrateful as to suffer such a noble action of the corporals to slip without taking proper notice of it  to the most noble most worthy most  etc etc etc  ye great men of many manors who at this present writing can choose your taverns and pay a ready money reckoning for every dainty you call for while i twirling my mutton before an illsupplied fire am stretching the elasticity of my invention to its utmost pitch how to obtain upon credit one single beer and beer libation  oh would ye but imitate this generous soldiers behavior and bestow upon the artists you employ a premium for their merit but artists perhaps would think themselves happy could they instead of being paid overplus only receive the prices they agreed for  but laments are vain the laborers of genius and the lollers in a coach and six are no more analogous than politics and plaindealing  honestly and bona side i speak if they do call me names i cannot help it but of all the rich people in england were it not for their money would have no more sense no more wit no more taste no more generosity no more humanity no more learning no more affability nor more of any more mores than we have who are obliged to mind our books to make the pot boil  yet writers who pretend to satyrise rich folks are to blame nor should any pen and ink dealers call the expectants and dependants of wealthy men who are known by the name of toadeaters to an account for their behavior  to be sure the members of the toadeating club will give his honor vast applause if his honor says but any thing bordering upon common sense and they will also lift up their hands and eyes with theatrical astonishment if her ladyship should make an observation pertinent to the subject and extol the vastness of their patrons capacities now i cannot see any flattery in all this for it is wonderful considering rich peoples education the ductility of their tutors the venality of their menials and the libertinisms they are indulged in how they can ever say think or do any thing to the purpose  heirs to great fortunes are born as well minded very often as the poorest tenants child under them but the understanding of the eldest hope of great families is either totally neglected or else cultivated in an improper manner  the reason why men of genius are so seldom rewarded by men of fortune is because men of fortune dont understand genius therefore rich people are more proper objects for pity than satire it is the want of having their minds justly improved by arts and sciences which makes them such strangers to the happiness of knowing what to do with their time  to be a man of fashion they think is the excellence of perfection or they would not lavish such vast sums for the encouragement of grooms gamblers prostitutes and rareshows when so many works of public utility become abortive and so many artists pine away for want of the hand of bounty to bring them to life for the service of their country  is it not a shame that in so noble a nation as england renowned throughout the world for arts and arms the major part of those who should set a better example only exhaust themselves and their fortunes in an eternal round of visits cards auctions foreign fiddlers and balladsingers  as to balladsingers and balladmakers the difference is trifling in regard of their merit but the reward is not proportionable this stevens to my knowledge has wrote upwards of  00 songs yet never was so well paid for any nay for all the rest as for that one he made the corporal  the poets bill received as earnest for making a love song upon madam chloe to consist of four verses 0 0   paid the remainder of my demand as soon as i had finished my work 0 0   received overplus or by way of premium 0 0   sum total for poetry 0      all the rest of this mans songs i am certain the weight of paper excepted would not now sell for so much money  for the entertainment of the curious we insert the verses that mr knott bespoke printed from the authors original copy  and as this song comprehends all that has been or can be comprehended in the composition of lovesongwriting according to the method at present of the public garden poets the editor presumes this may serve as a pattern or measure for all future amorous stanza makers to cut out their works by who intend to write for the amusements of the summer parties that swarm from ranelagh rotunda to the new tunbridge  a new song called chloe llwhyddwhuydd an lambic sapphic and lyric by g a stevens embellished with notes by h howard esquire author and etcher in ordinary strophe i down the parnassian heights i soar upon pegasus back my fancy i bore bright phoebus with apollo here attend be all ye muses nine the poets friend a poet as i will show ye from france to philadelphias climes no haberdasherer of rhimes can boast a toast like chloe notes on the first verse soar and bore some people say those two lines are rather false grammar and it should be that pegasus bore but i say whatever bad grammar they may be they are good rhimes and as mr skeggs and mr massy both observed that is the most materialest thing in a song because there are very few singers nowadays who will let you know whether they sing sense or nonsense so for that reason i never troubled my head with what i published in that respect  h h  phoebus and apollo phoebus signifies the sun according to the dictionary and apollo is said to be the god of physic and poetry so a person said last night that was the reason why rhimewritings were generally called drugs and also why a great deal of poetry was used in physical operations  philadelphia that word was put in because the lady was born in the west indies  stanza i she is not  yes she is complete her alablaster ivory teeth so neat her eyes like starry suns all hearts illume and zephyrus whistling sighs her lips perfume where is her marrow know ye her cheeks are cochineeld her breasts are cupids kettledrums and loves birds nests that venus builds for chloe notes to the second verse she is not the word not is a pun upon corporal knotts name your critics that know no better will call out about false spelling but i never mind that i can write songs for all them or that either  alablaster and ivory these words are two similes to describe whitnesses and clearnesses  like starry suns poets may do what they will with nature make stars suns and suns stars because we have the poetica licentious for it  her marrow that is a yorkshire word and signifies an equal or a person upon the same footing as yourself introducing such obsolete words gives the poem a true pastoral turn and as it is intended to be sung in an evening in the music loft among the lamps and trees it ought to have some out of town allusions in it  her cheeks cochineeld one of the best lines the thought is mine but it is wrong spelt it should be scutchineeld because scutchineel is a better red than vermilion and takes its name from the herald painters first using it in painting scutcheons  the simile of scutchineel also signifies that as those insects are never used but after their death so her cheeks would not lose her color until after she is dead  cupids kettledrums that is a double ontender and loves birdsnests another and without such things a song will not fell i told the author i would etch him a headpiece to this song about the birds nest because what sells so well as smutty pictures now especially with a dash of politics in them and politics is easy brought in any how  truly mr george said he would not offend decency then people are damnably deceived in you thought i but as i told him why george says i is there not a great many tradesmen freemen of the city of london men well to pass and masters of families who are not ashamed to have their sashwindows filled with bawdy blackguard prints and why should you then trouble your head about it i will answer we could get money by it and as long as a man can but do that and not go to newgate why it does not signify what he does and as to decency i despise it for i have always got a good living thank god without it however george woudnt consent so i set him down obstinate  strophe encore tempests i will tear up by the root earthquakes i will undermine to boot with the galaxy of the milky way upon joves threshold i will at marbles play and stake my fair so showy i will dare the synagogue of gods and play or pay i will lay the odds that nothing never beats chloe notes to the third verse tear up tempests by the root this is a figure in poety signifying that the earth shall pull her hair about her ears in a passion trees are often said to be in songwriting the locks of hair of the worlds head  to boot there is a fine word for a pun and fine punc have been made about it and now i dont care who knows it but i have done more of those pieces of wit than any one else they were all afraid but i was like a true gamester i went nothing to something i knew i could not be worse and if they did take me up i was sure to be a great man as long as i lived because i should have suffered martyrdom for my wit and humor  galaxy there is no such a word at least not that i know off i asked the author and he told me it was the mosaic pavement of jupiter and junos gallery but i was not to be hummed so for what business has moses with heathen deities not that i know any thing about religion i would as soon make a song about moses as i did about zebra if i could get as much money by it  the synagogue of gods this signifies something about parsin whitfield and his tabernaclepeople but what the author will not tell me  play or pay lay the odds nothing never beats chloe this is the true verbatum language used by sporting men at all the meetings in england scotland and ireland  stanza encore when times sharp scythe mows down my breath shall i not in my quick expiring death in tinkling rills her murmuring whispers hear while she like echo sobbing sighs my dear oh corporal where go ye revived i will rush into her arms and ravish all her curling charms and charm my charming chloe notes to the fourth verse times scythe mowing down his breath is a fine metaphor and to be met with or something to the same purpose in almost all the love songs for many years past  echo sobbing because echo mr littleton in his dictionary says she sighed herself into a consumption  charm my charming chloe that i will venture to say is one of the most charming lines that i or shakespeare ever made there was as i have heard say a critic once a learned man his name was villager or scalisher or some such a foreign phrase and he said that there was one of horaces songs which he had rather been the author of than been a king without a rag on  this is as i ve heard the story  and now i say i did not care if i could but have wrote that line and charm my charming chloe if i was to be reduced to my former state and have nothing but rags on  scene the overthrow home hasted the corporal with the copy of verses and gave them the lady wrapped up as he received them from the author she hurried into her own room with the packet imagining it was some very pretty present but when it was unwafered and it appeared to be only a paper filled with written hand which she could not read one syllable mrs llwhyddwhuydd suffered the most cruel agitation of spirits that ever any lady was thrown into who by the sudden whim of spouse or papa was prevented from being punctual to the moment of assignation  she supposed the letter to be an appointment the corporal gone to the rendevouz and had left her that as a direction where to follow him how did she then lament her not being booklearned she fretted sighed stamped called on her stars on the corporal and fate  the maid passing by the door heard the outcry run down to mr knott beckoning him into the back kitchen asked him what he had done to her mistress for that as how her mistress was in the most wonderful consternation about the corporal and what he had wrote in a paper  knott who had been bajazet like enjoying though but in fancy his scheme and what an opinion his landlady must have of him and how fine a fellow she must think him to be able to write so fine a song was struck as flat with what the girl said to him as a new actor just hissed  it occured to him on the instant that the versemaker had hummed him and instead of the song he had paid for had palmed some other paper on purpose to make the lover look like a fool and knott muttered damm these wits they are always full of mischief especially against their best friends however i will break the rascals bones  unluckily for some parties george the balladcompiler then was passing along on the other side of the way the military man had a view of him and through the entry knott burst into the street after the scribbler  passion or anger will as effectually dazzle persons eyes as interest mr knott by rage was so dimsighted that as he sprung from the threshold he saw not a sedan which david and his partner were bearing by with a fair in it  against its side rushed the corporal and down came the chair shattering upon the pavement the glasses were smashed the sash frames shivered and the soldier tumbling over the top of it rolled into the channel calling out as he lay oh stevens ill do for you  george alexander hearing a threatening voice imagining it to be a bailiffs started off fast as fear could wing his feet and like an expeditious fine porter running to his duty overset every one who stood in his way  the first person who fell a victim to the velocity of the poets fears was wellfleet betty standing on the upper step of a cooks cellar with a basket full of goods upon her head one hand was rested upon her hip her elbow forming the point of an angle and with the fingers and thumb of the other hand she was snapping defiance  the bard took her in flank rushing against her outstanding elbow the sudden shock turned her half round and backwards she pitched into the cellar just as theo cibbers propertyman was bringing up twelvepennyworth of soup and oxcheek bouilli for his master comedians dinner  down soused betsys head into the dish and her feet fell on each side of the young mans head upon his shoulders her weight returned him into the cellar and the broken baking pan the oxcheek the soup and the oysters covered the floor  onward scampered george overturning haddocks waiter who had a box full of jellies in his hands then the song scribbler met parrellel to his breast a mophandle which a wench was twirling his force flung it in a diagonal direction down but the mop hit in its way the silkstockind shins of a french dancing master the blow brought monsieur capriole to the ground he pitched upon his face and his nose was flattened against the pavement  the perpetrator of this mischief began to be scant of breath and turning his head as he ran to see where his pursuers were he threw down a salop stall  the vender of that diet drink had just served a dish to no less a chapman than the little poet derrick the doer of drydens works who not thinking of any thing was very innocently cooling his sassafras when the gross bodied bard like a collier running foul of a pleasure boat tumbled the small sized versifier into the dirt  the bulk of mr derricks muff prevented him from being bruised but the blade of his pinchbeck hilted rapier snapped in the scabbard and the spray of the salop obliged the little gentleman to keep his bed until the scowerer had repaired the damage his laced coat and waistcoat had sustained  here the race ended the author of all these ills tumbling at the same time was seized by the woman to pay for what was broke spoiled and spilt  it is impossible to say what might have been the event of georges being detained since he always was inflicted with that terrible malady of non sum solvendum but mr macklin the the actor came by paid the cost and took stevens home promoting him to be his tutor  the putter together of love alamode being at that time of day in the bloom of his youth page   th  not above thirtyfour years of age took to his learning prodigiously and in less than a week was able to make out every letter of the alphabet  the couch scene the person who happened to be in the chair when it was overturned was the very drole sam foot esquire the greatest mimic genius in england who after much shrieking and struggling rose head and shoulders high betwixt the broken frame of the chairglass his face all scratched like a fresh blooded ghost ascending through the tragedy trap on his countenance pallid fear sat frightful his livid lips quivered with terror he begged help for gods sake and religiously reiterated his entreaties to the bystanders  he had not at this time exhibited publicly any of his extraordinaries neither was he as yet determined to what part of the arts and sciences he should devote himself  it was to this adventure and the advice of miss shred that the town has had the happiness of being entertained with his vis oeuvres  after he was delivered from the chair and inducted into mrs llwhyddwhuydds best one pair of stairs room miss shred who saw from her chamber the accident ran over to davids house fearful they had not politeness enough to accomodate so brilliant dressed a person as mr foot  miss shred insisted upon carrying up the basin of water and towel to the gentleman mr foot received her with all that complaisance peculiar to himself and assured her both in french and english that he was immensely obliged to her  miss shred sir a person of your appearance demands the most polite reception and as i am conscious the people of this house are too vulgar to use such a person as you are as you should be therefore i left my own house that i might pay a proper regard to one of your elegant appearance   mr foot madam you do me too much honor to be sure maam i conceive the inhabitants of this porterselling territory to be the quintessence of vulgarity my ideas never before announced such a contemptible set of reptiles as those creatures were who helped me out of the chair one should not they say mock ones friends but upon my soul they were such a collection of grotesques that while they were doing me a great piece of service i could not help taking them off and the fellow who seemed to have the most humanity about him and was really very tender of me squinted his compassion with two such inverted eyes saying  i hope your honor cant hurt sir   miss shred i vow sir that look was vastly like him but i am surprised sir a gentleman of your accomplishments should seem to hesitate about taking off your friends it is the extreme wit of the politest persons and which sir you must know and if you was not to do it sir it would be a loss to the world for you know sir each individual admires to have an acquaintance nay all their acquaintance made ridiculous and i am persuaded no person can be more happy in that execution than yourself   mr foot madam i am embarrassed at this rencontre with a lady of your consummate penetration indeed madam i have been flattered by my friends with having an excellency in taking off my intimates and shall be proud of a lady of your sensations determining concerning the merit of my abilities   immediately he went through the defects misfortunes and weaknesses of all his acquaintance with immense spirit he took off sir harrys lady as she said her prayers at church mimicked her brother the judge in his passing sentence of death shook his head as my lords uncle did who was paralytic from his infancy walked limping like sir william who lost part of his heel in a seaengagement and then in the character of punch preached a funeral sermon with such vivacity such humor and such naivetie that miss shred became transported backwards she fell in raptures upon the couch crying out bravo bravo bravo my dear creature   scene iii miss shred and sam foot curtain up again miss shred upon my honor sammy you have reduced me to the most extraordinary circumstances of not being able to look at a genleman without blushing and believe me sir i never was guilty of such an action before but as richard says for this among the rest was i ordained   mr foot madam it is impossible for me to express how high an idea i entertain of a lady possessed of such a capability as i find you mistress of therefore i can do no less than dedicate myself to your service   miss shred i accept your homage dear foot and i give you my hand which acts equal with my heart and as i know your talents are as extrordinary as you are pleased to observe my capabilities are surprising i will plan and you shall execute as i am conscious my conceptions are perfectly picturesque   this it was on which mr foot laid the foundation of that grandeur we have several times seen him so amazingly arrive at to miss shred he was obliged for the hint of giving tea by her he also was initiated into that species of wit and humor with which to this day he continues with so much originality to entertain the town  during this abovestairs conversation david was busied in picking up his chairs fragments the corporal was upon foot pursuing the author but the soldier met his officer at the turn of a street who ordered him immediately to get ready and set out next morning for cornwall  knott though he was alarmed at the command knew his duty was to be silent and obey  but took his resolutions accordingly as he had been hitherto successful in his schemes with the fair sex and that his time was so short he went upon the hunt for two of his comrades he could confide in  this was the reason that madam llwhyddwhydd did not see her lover all that day although its certain no lady ever more longed that is she wanted to be satisfied and no person she was sure or at least she thought herself sure and that fancy with many ladies amounts to a certainty that no body could satisfy her so well as the corporal  the damaged chair was sent to be repaired mr foot and his lady took coach for a country jaunt david having nothing else to execise himself with resolved to walk into wapping to see his brother on board of ship  his spouse who knew her husband would not be at home until four or five in the morning began to be vastly uneasy about the corporal who made it evening before he returned  the guests withdrawn the maid hurried to bed just as the feeble watchman whistling in his sound came by coughing out paaaast    oclock  mr knott high in blood stole like lothario unheeded to his dear llwhyddwhuydds chamber he found the lady loose unattired warm  i ashamed to say it  but fuddled absolutely non compos how it happened as well as so melancholy an accident can bear relating shall be disclosed  that night the lady went up stairs in charming spirits mr knott having received the wink of assignation while he sat below drinking with his comrades but alas unhappy gentlewoman reflecting perhaps too much on what might very naturally happen between her and the corporal she grew immoderately thirsty in poetry we should express it she was burning with desire  by mistake she put a bottle of brandy to her mouth which had in the hurry been put uncorked where the waterbottle used to stand it was there placed by the maid the mistresss sudden coming up prevented the girl from any other ways disposing it  mrs llwhyddwhuydds agitation of mind rendered her incapable of judging the difference until she had swallowed so large a gulf intoxication was the consequence by which the reader is deprived of one of those luscious descriptions which are now looked upon in the novel way the most essential embellishments for modern bookselling  yet not to have our customers entirely disappointed we present them with the lady asleep in one of those engaging attitudes so enticing page     to the very young and very old gentlemen of this metropolis who want to see pretty legs pretty feet pretty breasts and all must be very pretty  masters under age are supposed to have raw and indigested ideas not being arrived at a proper taste  elderly lovers have outlived theirs therefore both must be alike fed and their strengthless appetites tempted by insubstantial garnish not having power to relish manly food  mr knott knowing by the orders he had received from the captain there was no time to spare took some pains to waken the lady and having recovered her so well as to acknowledge she loved no man like the corporal he discovered to her how he was pinched for time the lady fearing to lose her so very lately gained lover the force of liquor and power of the corporals arguments altogether corresponding made her consent that very night to go off with him the maid fast asleep in the garret the drawer dead drunk in the cellar and her husband from home she packed up all the plate ready money and her best clothes for that is an observation i have generally made that ladies who by stealth leave their husbands are determined that the loss shall be as severely felt as the time they have to accomplish their scheme will admit  it was by the help of mr knotts comrades every article was brought safe to the fly in which the corporal and his lady were conveyed without one accident to portsmouth there the next morning by the greatest good luck they found a sloop going off for plymouth in which they embarked and in four days landed there then by easy journeys reached cornwall to which the corporals rout was directed  since we have conducted mrs llwhyddwhuydd so far well let her rest a little after her journey and take a trip to london to inquire what became of her husband  the dreaming scene david returned home the next morning about two hours after his unfaithful ladys elopement but too much filled with his evenings excess to admit of any information until snoring had evaporated some of those fumes  but the physical account of snoring which was never before attempted is proper to introduce here  to the sapientifical scientifical celestial magazinemaker selftaught philosopher lecturer and instrumentseller  to the venerable antigallicanist and balsam of life vender  to the most celebrated most advertised most graduated ludgate hill licentiate  and last though not least in character to the egregious consummate doctor of all doctoribuses the eccentrical occulistical most superlative egotist adventurer and chevalier this elaborate essay is addressed  snoring arises from the superabundancy of vapor collected the preceding night by drink and conversation treasured up in the storehouse or magazine of the head  the spirit of the liquor sublimates through the valves and ducts from the stomach and the froth or aerial parts of disputes observations altercations and witticisms make their way through the auricular glands or organs at the same time into the cellulae of the brain these puffballs thus collected float about until secretion i beg my friends of the faculty you will observe this although it is out of the power of the college to account for animal secretion ergo all physic is upon undetermined principles yet i have assigned a ratio for the secretory officinal of dreams which are these puffballs composed as beforementioned and lodged in the tenements of the pineal glands just as infant maggots are housed  but when all the pia and dura matter apartments are filled and not a single idea even for the good of self can be wedged in there will remain great quantities of this windy effluvia which the owner of the head has imbibed in the last day and nights exercise which must be discharged charged before the proper disposed imaginations can have room to act  therefore on a sudden fast issue through those windgates the nostrils the overplus of yesterdays retailings which cannot be performed before sleep has for some hours set his draining engines at work and that is the reason why morning dreams are more to be relied upon than those before midnight the violence with which this stream rushes forth from the head is the occasion of that sound which is equal to the diameter of the diapason of  but the solution of that question concerning the mathematical proportion of major and minor semitones betwixt snoring and other eructations is sent for a prize answer to the ladys diary to which we refer the reader  after david had slept about five hours loud and sound the elastic coats of his brain began to exert their pulsations and he dreamed a dream which forboded mischief as plain as any dream ever repeated at breakfast by the politest prettiest and most sensible maid wife widow or mistress you enjoyed a mornings tete a tete with or at least that you said you did  david did dream as how that the tower of london was made of papier machee and that the french intended to undermine all our coalpits and so destroy the nursery of our seamen  out of the seven or eight millions of great britains inhabitants one million we may reasonably suppose will read this book and that  00000 of those readers delight in the interpretation of dreams for their emolument we shall explain this dream viz the tower of london being made of chewed paper signified that the affection of his wife which he thought permanent as the bulwarks which the mud and grass of tower ditch semicirculates was as insubstantial as the incoherent ornaments of waste paper and the french and the coalpits meant that a wicked enemy should undermine the navigation to his wifes heart  at noon next day david waked and with broad eyes found  but by all rules of writing an author as well as a painter is to allow his customers imagination fair play or game law therefore this part of the scene shall be left to the readers conception how mr llwhyddwhuydd looked where he looked what he said when he could speak and how long it was before he returned to a capability of saying or seeing or doing any thing  suppose yourself oh sympathizing reader in this afflicted husbands situation it is with some confusion that the editor acknowledges himself rather abrupt in pretending to place any buyer or borrower of this volume upon the footing of a chairman all that we mean by begging the question is most reverend most honorable or most handsome sir or madam a possibility for what we call the finest person in england when angry to behave equal with the lowest to prove which i shall make an extract from a book called  the history of the human mind the three estates or different modes of the souls constitution are denominated highlife middlelife and lowlife  those degrees when put into a passion act upon the same parallel and as you may have seen mr bayess sun moon and earth dancing the hay so it is with these highlife shall be middle middle shall be low low high and they sometimes dance so much and so long that there is no distiction to be observed between them  but this only happens in very rare cases viz in love in anger and in drunkenness  furthermore it is said in this book chap  0 page    i wish may it please your honor that you would either look a little more into it or suffer your eldest son to be a little better acquainted with it and i would bett a good name against great riches and that is ten pounds to a crown you know that if those personages who can read it would study it not thumb and dogs ear a drole place or two but go fairly and honestly through it they would be taught to think worse of themselves than they do at present and thereby become better for the future  there would every egotist discover that his consequence was but conceit and judgment merely opinion that flattery is the universal language knavery mankinds modus conversation quibbling public spirit a riddle frienship a phantom and selfinterest grand signior  goodbreeding may be contaminated and greatness put in an extreme fury for such trifling things as an honest chairman would be ashamed to be out of temper about  and when the most polite are most angrily agitated they may and do often swear huff kick curse strike abuse break and bellow with such violence as if they were no more than a chairman or any other such illiberal beings and i beg leave to observe for all what the heralds office allege to the contrary even her grace although delicately dignified may be horridly chagrind if she permits passion to gallop over the course with her  the unfortunate mr llwhyddwhuydd presently swore himself out of breath in hurrying backwards and forwards throughout the neighborhood to tell his sad story vowed many rash vows and said many bad things when his friends found his anger was obliged for want of fresh spirits to subside and he was sufficiently relaxed to hear consolation they administered advice gratis as all english people ought to do one among another the generality of my countrymen and women are apt enough to bestow their counsels even unasked in all cases  none but physicians and lawyers making money of their words  they sell their advice as lapland witches do wind only to make more mischief  his partner begged him to be comforted squeezing mr llwhyddwhydd by the brawny part of his thumb my dear david dont hurt yourself any more by grief i dont doubt but all will be well as ever and your spouse shall come home again and there will be no harm done and you will live hapyy to the end of your days and you must take example by your betters and forget and forgive as the bible says  this speech gave david great cause of contemplation and after he was in bed that night thus he soliloquised  in the name of god and st david can i ever in honor have my wife home again am i not an ancient briton where then must i put my honor is not my honor the seat of my heart and has she not given away her honor and would she come home and take away my honor too now that damm dog of a soger has laid hold of her honor for himself  more shame for him that any of king georges men should not have honor of their own  not being able to sleep he went to his library and looking over the index of his magazines among those curious receptacles of the atoms of universal learning he found the following essay concerning  honor there is no kingdom state principality peninsula continent isthmus we have endeavored at the true magazine style it may seem tautalogous but our readers must know the necessity those monthly productions lay under to make use of many words they like stage coaches being obliged to set out to their time full or empty  metropolis city suburbs or environs in or out of christendom possesses so much honor as the town of london nor by the root of st davids leek mr llwhyddwhuydd called out no man in london has more honor than myself  to prove that london is the plenum of honor what man or woman can you meet with that will not declare themselves to be people of honor who can you converse with that will not assure you upon their honor  the turks cannot be such civilized persons as christians therefore have no idea of honor and are strangers to duelling that custom of killing is only practiced where the gospel is taught  however the mahometans have great honesty in respect of their meum and tuum dealings but that method of merchandising is no more than an absolute sentiment which might do well enough for the moral law but the statutes and practices of the european courts being by revealed religion more enlightened such infidels as turks and heathens by not having the advantages we christians have can never act so upright as we do  laws honor equity and honesty being refined are to be considered  but we refer the reader for a proper explication of those matters to our notes upon the athanasian creed  in italy spain and portugal the natives are extremely tenacious of their honor as they are also of their religion the two most noble practices of the soul  they are persons of superior honor and religion to the rest of christendom which accounts why so many people are poisoned assassinated and put into the inquisition in those countries more than any others it is all done as that very painstaking mr henriques observes to glorify god and for their own honor  the french are not much bigoted to matrimonial honor but they have very romantic ideas of glory and imagine that glory is preferable to limbs health life and even the profits of a    per cent usury  nay so prone are our english people to follow french fashions that we have adopted this mode and such is the common characteristic of our country to improve upon every invention that a great many of our britons have carried this glory much farther than ever the french dared they had a very fair trial for it lately and in spite of poltical jockeyship and though we were obliged sometimes to shift saddles and sometimes we could not go as we would yet we always came in for the sweepstakes  this was not satisfactory to mr llwhyddwhuydd he did not understand any thing about glory all his care was about his honor and not meeting with an explanatory account in any of his volumes he arose next morning to consult an old acquaintance and country woman of his and one of the wisest people ever born for she was descended in a direct line from the child that queen sheba had by king solomon though she could not prove herself of one of the most ancient families yet for the greatness of her understanding the defect of birth was overlooked and she was made overseer of the weeders to a welsh gardeners at lambeth  during the time of mr davids walking to mr winifred ap shingle and to make an end of this scene of our drama give me leave by way of tag to tell you an old story about honor  i do not doubt but you may have read it in every jest book i own the story is old  yet like a true commentator i quote the ancient things to exhibit the antiquity of my reading  magrah monaghan of connaught dined one day with terencf o hara in the queens county monaghan was every inch of him a gentleman and scorned to do a dirty thing but as necessity and honor are ever at seesaw with all gentlemen of no fortunes it happened at that instant need was uppermost and gave an impelling or propelling quality to some of mr magrahs muscles  astronomers are not yet clear enough in their accounts for us to ascertain which it was of the occult qualities innate to bodies that occasioned a silver spoon before grace after meat was said to gravitate into mr magrah monaghans pocket the thing was missed and his host very mildly taking his guest aside whispered him  my dear mac will you be telling me any thing of the spoon  mac is it me you mean the devil burn me into tinder ashes terence if i know no more of the spoon than st patrick   terence well but dont you at all at all   mac why then by the contents of this  catching up the mustard pot i dont would you be thinking i would be telling you a lie   terence but upon your honor dont you   mac my honor  by jasus there is taking the spoon from his pocket the vagabond spoon again and i will tell you one thing terence and that ant two i wouldnt forfeit my honor for all the spoons in the whole country of christendom   act ii scene iv mr llwhyddwhuydd and winifred ap shingle david llwhyddwhuydd went over westminsterbridge to consult madam winifred ap shingle  after the proper ceremonials were adjusted of who should set down first what sort of a day it was and every other polite phrase which is used among the most delicate as an introduction to more interesting conversation david acquainted winifred with his misfortune and with his partners saying he should have his wife home again and how continued mr llwhyddwhuydd can i do that with honor for i do assure you winifred that man is not worthy to carry a pair of straps upon his shoulders who is not a man of honor for a chairman when his honor is gone is no more than a hackneycoachman or a waggoner or any other of those horsedriving rascals  how then can i receive my wife again  oh winifred you dont know what a fine creature she was  to be sure her neck was as white as a damask napkin  and the best people in the neighborhood did use to send to by her pickles  and her cheeks were as red indeed as my new scarlet breeches  and such a hand  ay and for a pancake winifred look you  well god bless her majesty and all the ladies of honor but they could not toss one better to be sure  damm ochee i will be the death of that damned dog corporal scoundrel  it was lovepowder which he did give her and he shall be taken up for poisoning my wife as sure as sir watkins is a gentleman  winifred you come to me for advice david look you indeed and do speak all yourself  but you shall hear now in gods name  upon which she put her band before his mouth and bawled in his ear  you must take your wife again   he started from the chair his shoulders striking against mrs shingles chin cast her backwards into a washingtub where she lay head and knees bent together her legs hanging over the edge while he regardless of his countrywomans condition swore a horrid oath with as much solemnity as ever the finest gentleman gave himself to the devil at a hazardtable but stamping at that moment on poor winifreds cat grimalkin fixed her teeth and claws so furious in his leg that he shrieked he run about the room he cried murder over the tub he tumbled regardless where he was or what became of wie winifred or all the world but himself  so true is what was said by the first philosopher before the flood and has been annually observed by all philosophers playwriters annotators and essayists that it is natural for our own sufferings to overbalance all other considerations  the same scene continued david and winifred seated as at first winifred look you david be quiet i tell you you did not hurt me much what i have put to your leg will cure it so drink up your porter and i will fetch another quart  exit mr llwhyddwhuydd when she was gone began to be in doubt whether he should or should not pull off the piece of blacksticking plaster that the dame had applied to his leg for the bite he was not sure it was the courtstickingplaister because as he was a chairman who had been brought up at st jamess he would not have any thing as he told her touch him made at any of the vulgars houses in her neighborhood because as he was a gentleman born and got his living among quality therefore he would sooner he said have his leg swell to the bone than any lowlifed medicine should come near his flesh  imitating herein that nobleness of spirits which all those most respectable  but i am interrupted  enter second quart of porter and mrs shingle winifred swingle now david i will have you be easy hear reason and not fly into any more passions nor dont swear against your wife for to be sure a finer woman    david never was a finer woman to be sure  so is my loss the more i shall love her to my dying day but she has robbed me and run away herself into the bargain and where is her honor now   winifred dont you talk so much about honor now i desire and require of you for if you would be a good christian you must forget and forgive for what pray does the scripture say about honor  not much and pray what do the people of honor say about the scripture why not much so you need not so much mind honor if you will but be a good christian   david but then the devil shall be a good christian for me  god forgive us  but how can i ap shingle how can i bear to lie by her side now pray will there be any christanity in that   winifred silence i tell you david you shall hear what i will read to you it is our teachers sermon which he did say at the tabernacle last sunday about forgiveness and christianity and women and our backslidings so pray david mind  reads putting on her spectacles the justifying ejaculation i say unto you my beloved that when the spirit agitateth the flesh it is a spiritual act but when the flesh motioneth the spirit it is a carnal one and this is the difference between grace and disgrace  for worldly things unless sanctification seeths them are no more than kitchen stuff which the scum of our sins makes in boiling over and that is put into the offal pot of repentance  therefore the saints of the tabernacle being clarified by the justification of the new birth are pure christian suet which when mixed with the plumbs of the righteous make up the pudding of glorification   winifred speaks o sweet abraham what heavenly language is this dont go to sleep david i desire of you how can you be worse than a heathen and not listen to this sweet soulsaving speech  reads again the pudding of glorification  therefore i say that we may mingle the spirit with the flesh even as potatoes and buttermilk make stirrabout for that is the type of the carnalities and spiritualities  so i say wiping her spectacles it is not sinful to consider the uprightness of the flesh as directed by the spirit because we may receive the spirit at home or in the fields or in an alley or in a centrybox and i will stand centry among you and if you have faith you shall raise the dead to life i will not be a velvetmouthd preacher like your church doctors and book learned blockheads  no  no  no  oh  oh  can a boy fly a kite without thinking of the clouds can a woman spread her fan without thinking of an angels wings therefore i say that the natural man is not the spiritual man yet the spiritual man may think of natural things so those things are to be put forward which are to satisfy the longings of the soul and though at first it may be painful to undergo them   at that instant the tankard from the hand of mr david fell to the ground the good man overcome with the two quarts of porter the keeping all night awake reflecting upon his honor and the potency of the preachers arguments dropped fast asleep which when mrs winifred observed she sighed and said he was a lost soul waked him and after some time spent between them in settling the terms she went home with david to be his housekeeper  scene plymouth madam llwhyddwhuydd corporal knott mountebank doctor duel merry andrew cheating at cards and newspapers the corporal by this time and his lady began to view one another in not that rapturous point of sight as at first all the plate and ready money which she had taken with her was expended for mr knott had too much of the fine gentleman in him not to be fond of play and too good an opinion of himself to fancy any person could take him in but after the money was all gone his eyes were opened and he determined to commence gambler himself  at his quarters lodged a mountebank and his man the merry andrew was a master of arts in sporting he could bend slip shade spur featheredge work a brief knew shorts and longs the high and low games at put the three shuffles of whist upper and under palm opening a pack or rounding dice with all the secures the bars loads ringing of changes etc etc etc  but he having then an occasion for a partner because he wanted to take his master in for a sum and as all sporting men act best by confederacy the corporal and pickle herring entered into a family compact  mean while poor mrs llwhyddwhuydd daily sat disconsolate at home never seeing her gallant but when he reeled to bed incapable of behaving to her like a gentleman  i wish some ladies of my acquaintance with whom it is at this moment a toss up between inclination and interest would read this part of my book carefully and they would know notwithstanding modern memoirs mention whispering zephyrs eternal constancy lovelane assignations breathstopped kisses midnight moonshine a charming fellow and the post chaise door open  that according to the undoubted testimonials of several maiden gentlewomen who by heartfelt experience vow a lady is worse cooped up who goes off with her gallant than the most domestic wife that undergoes the drudgery of the nursery and kitchen  let us only example mrs llwhyddwhuydd she had no person to visit her was visited by no person obliged from having a house of her own to put up with a mean ready furnished lodging in which sitting all day solitary  for believe me dear lady the fine fellow of your fancy soon grows sick of his sweatmeats and every fond couple who leave honor family and all for love having then nothing but love to live upon soon eat up their allowance  think ladies what mr davids wife suffered who like all other eloping ladies had trusted the gallant with all and dreaded to ask him for a single shilling lest he should think her extravagant denying herself necessaries because he should not grumble at expense how melancholy her case no companions but her own thoughts reflecting and comparing past with present times her former respect her present infamy  her husbands tenderness his repeated tenderness her gallants coldness his continued indifference  it is not i hope so bad with every lovely lady errantress yet many of them have experienced  dont sigh dear creatures  i know its a melancholy scene and in the catastrophe still more vexatious because the reason which some ladies allege for running away from their guardians or parents is the unbearable usage which they receive at home therefore apply to gallants in hopes of mending their condition as flying fish spring out of the sea to avoid the dolphin and tumble into the jaws of the shark  yet as the most timeservingscribbler subscribes himself at the bottom of a dedication to his right honorable patron as the tradesman bows bill in hand to his honor with parallel awe i address the ladies and assure them that my opinion of their magnanimity will not suffer me to imagine any thing here said can alter what a fine woman has already resolved upon  no  spite of all advice or example her spirits will carry her through whatever her will gives the word for let the consequence be  no matter what  davids spouse had for some time been in a most uncomfortable state she felt the severe pinches of necessity which are evident symptoms of repentance daily hourly did she reproach herself how ill she had used her dear dear husband how ill her gallant had used her not a friend had she to confide in except the merry andrew abovementioned to him she now and then disclosed her griefs he proffered her all the assistance in his power vowed he had a vast regard for her and sealed those vows upon her lips just at the instant the corporal opened the door  all in rage mr knott rushed on the tumbler kicked him down stairs b  d his lady and vowed never again to bed her  indeed mr knott was glad of an occasion to break off the acquaintance for he found it very heavy supporting her out of his pay and beside he had commenced another intrigue with a lady who kept a raffle who had agreed to go off with him  the tumbler all in a rage for being used so by the corporal went instantly to his master and discovered that the night before himself and the corporal had cheated the doctor at cards of fifteen pounds four shillings and told his master that his conscience would not let him keep it  no one thing can hurt a lady or gentleman or any other two legged existent if there are any other persons in this kingdom that are not either gentlemen or ladies except some of the opera singers  i say and am sure nothing can hurt so much as being made a fool or a tool unless selfinterest orders it so to be  then indeed as a  b  c  d  e  and  etc observed it is proper to appear in taste  but to be a tool and be out of pocket by it  seneca at the head of his stoical regiment of old buffs could not bear it  and as the doctor like all other doctors wore a sword which i believe the faculty at first bore emblematically to denote an aptitude to kill after a consultation with his merry andrew he determined upon having his money and sent mr knott the following letter  sir i ham by my purfeshon as will as you a gentleman because as your a soger so am i a doctur of fysick i did not think any gentleman wode ave taken away mi moni clandestenly that is rank burgularly and wors then robbing upon the hi way  however sir i suppose your a gentleman for all that so i desir you will gi me satissfakshon and send me my moni agin or mete me with your sword at nine oclock to nite in the ditch by the cloisters it will be moonlight and we can see to kill one another  yours doctor jones   the corporal received this note as he sat over a large bowl of punch with two recruits just listed he was as brave as british spirits could make him and reading the letter swore twas very well he would come he would do every thing like a gentleman and give every body satisfaction  but as to returning or paying the money back he was above it  no he was too much a man of honor he swore to be compelled no the sword should decide it  all flush all gallant was mr knott the drum beating recruits singing and bumpers going briskly about  yet the contents of the letter began like oil to prevent the potency of the brandy punch any longer sublimating into the corporals head  not that he feared the doctor or even death the president and commander in chief of all doctors but his honor was doubly concerned he promised to meet a lady a new lady that night and he would not break that appointment for twenty doctors but then who would dare to say knott woudnt fight no body should he swore and in order to keep his word and honor with both parties he laid his plan of operations accordingly  the doctor who was equally political in what a political age do we now live made this appointment by moonlight because his antagonist should not discover that he had a quire of white paper for a breast plate fastened neatly under his shirt  each combatant firmed in his safeguard scheme went with the utmost intrepidity to the combat nobly magnanimously they met so when  no  come all ye spirits who have inspired the belligerant powers to firm fighting and thou whoever thou art whether begot by folly or madness or both thou aethernal who presides over duels suitablespirit for such a subject inspire me to describe the memorable behavior of those truly paired bellonists who so intrepidly paraded upon the supposedtobesanguinaryspot and then so woundless  so  so  so  so have i seen  ay reader and so may you also have seen as well as me a great many things but among all the shows did you ever observe a slit deal figure set up on the top of a malthouse tunnel or as a scarescrow in a garden holding in each hand a wooden sword which by the contrivance of the carpenter and force of the wind whirled its arms about above and below across around slashing striking flourishing in every prizefighting direction ingratefully thrashing that air which puts it in motion  thus is a duellist agitated by honor which is no more than air a puff a wind a vapor  mistake not the editors meaning  he is only writing concerning the term honor which urges planet struck people to take the unnecessary trouble of cutting one anothers throats when as the madman observed let but your enemies alone and they will dye of themselves  but duellists like jobson at blindmans buff lay about them slap dash north east west south on every point of the compass because this honor answers to all points all make a point of honor  it was one of honors points the moneygetting point which goaded the doctor to this honorable experiment and which the editor would not have been so explicit in had he not taken the trouble of visiting tennis courts billiardrooms horserace meetings whistclubs skettlegrounds hazardtables and nine hole alleys and been assured from all parties there that the doctor was right in point of honor to demand his money and the corporal was right in point of honor to refuse returning it  the place appointed for their meeting was a very wide dry trench high mounded on each side and open at each end like that part of new market turf called the devils ditch and where for the name sake all hereafter duels should be decided  they came to the spot just as the clock struck nine they drew their swords and stood in quart and tierce attitudes between four and five yards asunder  they flourished their blades on which the moon shine bright beaming the glare startled the heroes  as veracity is the editors principle observance throughout this treatise it is necessary to relate how two such men could be brought to the scene of action and draw their swords at each other  the doctor was assured by his tumbler that if he did but send a challenge it would bring the corporal to any terms and he had nothing to do but only go to the appointment draw his sword and knott would return the money  after by his mans advice the letter was sent the mountebank began to have some qualms  he doubted he was dismayed and as mr john wesley and mr john wesleys coadjutors have often declared that satan buffetted them about even so was the doctors thoghts tossed here and there and not knowing what to make of himself he resolved to bumper it about until fighting time to drive off even the idea of death  not that he way any stranger to that spectre having employed him in as many shapes as the doctor had patients but he wanted not that fiend to have any concerns with himself therefore he drank to fortify his mind and wore a stationary breast plate to barricade his noble parts  the corporal marched to the rendesvouz with a certainty of success  first from his own consequence that the quack scoundrel dare not fight him next let it even come to the worst and he should be obliged to draw his sword  mr knott had planned such a scheme  and entirely by the scale sector and true modern practice of duelling which is to acquire the vast vast honor of being a fighting man and duellist without running any dangerous risque  the corporals plot was to wait for his antagonist to make the first thurst then to fall backwards immediately and bid the doctor make the best of his way off because that he himself was a dead man the doctor having done for him  both thus secure in their safeguards stood firm  but at the distance beforementioned indeed it is proper all quarrelling people should so keep asunder their right arms were extended sword pointparalled to sword point  at last the doctor being by drink the most elevated quavered out ha ha and stamped his foot at the same time but the unfaithful sod sinking to his tread brought his body forwards destroyed the center of gravity and prone on his face he fell without stretched arm and weapon  the corporal observed the glittering steel advance backwards at that signal fell down and with a great groan cried out  o i am done for  it is through and through me  doctor i forgive you  but make the best of your way off  for  oh  i am a dead man  terrified at these words his antagonist reflecting on what it was to kill a man and not according to the secundum artem statute crawled backwards on his hands and knees crab like out of the opposite end of the ditch leaving his sword as he supposed sticking in the corporals body as soon as he got upon his feet he scamperd off strait forwards not minding which road he took all he thought of at that time was the hue and cry which he fancied he heard very plainly behind him  the corporal rising by degrees was soon satisfied of the success of his scheme and picking up the duplicate sword hastened to his other rendesvouz and there he showed his new lady the weapon which he had brought away with him telling madam raffle i was obliged to kick that scoundrel mountebank my dear and make him deliver up his sword here it is you see for his insolence to pretend to dare to hint any thing against your reputation  in the beginning of every intrigue fond beauty fancies all is gospel which her gallant speaks  knotts new mistress replied that to be sure i knowed as how mr corporal you was a vastly brave man and we will live and die and i will go through the world with you  but the catastrophe of their loves hereafter  we have now got rid of a pair of lovers as dexterously as any play wright who after cunningly bringing them together gives the prompter a cue  wheu  wheu whistles mr pimperlimpimp the word giver and the brace of woers are intersected from the audience by the canvas landscape or size painted street scene and the rest of the comedy goes on as usual  when our last express came away the mountebank was on foot terribly racing it along panting and trembling  the conclusion of his helter skelter flight we shall now relate under the anticomic title of  the originality of ghosts and anatomy of phantoms rondocosto kambe danesso in his defense of praeternaturals subnaturals and nonnaturals very wisely tells us that there are some very famous and what is more very great and what is more very rich people who are undetermined whether ghosts are apparitions or apparitions ghosts whether deathwatches dreams nightmares witchcraft fallingstars screechowls and religion have or have not reality to them the following exhibitory is recommended  it is requested by the putter together of these lusitoriae that all those maxims which relate to the analysis solution and dissection of phantoms will be carefully studied by out of

yes answers the man of title these wits and droles are very well for a gentleman to be entertained with now and then at taverns or on shipboard but they should not be taken any notice of publicly  for they are always poor  know nothing of the world and are rather impertinent  the deserted genius penniless and a stranger is left upon the beach to make the best of his way where he can  well suppose

having been condemned to perish in the streets without benefit of clergy had not adulation persuaded preferment to hire the whole distressed family ostentatiously and now they are employed by his honor as haymakers harvest folks hedgers stablesweepers errandboys and turnspits  by this hyperbolical style the reader will observe hope and promise are included in the dissertation upon phantoms  this will be illustrated in the continuance of the quacks history who we left upon foot nor have we yet brought him to a standstill fright made him miss his way it was midnight before he reached the gates of his inn they were barred and every candle out in the neighborhood  pleased to think all was so quiet he resolved to creep up the back way into the yard get his money and clothes out of his room before daylight and secret himself among the miners  up a broken butterice belonging to the garden he scrambled and got astride the wall just as tom the tapster opened the gardendoor in his breeches shirt and slippers  the moon brightly shining at the mountebanks back made a long black shadow upon the grassplat which moving before the servants eyes stopped him from stepping forward his knees knocked together his teeth chattered his feet he drew softly out of the slippers and and sidling barefooted he slunk into a dark arbor at his left hand  the medicinemonger was not a whit less terrified at seeing a human figure in white for the moon gave him full view of the tapster a cross the wall he sat aghast he thrice attempted to say some prayers but had none to say he muttered the only religious sentiment which he knew viz grace after meat saying lord make me thankful for what i have received  this over and over he repeated holding himself on the wall by the help of his hands as a sailor fixes his fists upon the saddle pommel  the doctor was confident he saw the corporals ghost almost petrified with apprehension he sat there and there would have sat until morning had not the stronger fear least the ghost should be creeping along the side of the wall to seize him forced him from his place and heaving himself up by his hands he straddling throwed himself along the wall on the ridge of the bricks with his eyes all the time fixed on that spot from whence the ghost had vanished  he reached the top of an old cowhouse and rolling himself upon it his weight broke the boards and betwixt two rafters he sell jammed midway his weight forced him down his bulk prevented his whole body to fall through there he was wedged fast by the waistband and fancying all hell held him he shrieked roared kicked flung his arms about and tumbled the loosened rotten planks over and over  the poor drawer hearing the dreadful outcries ecchoed his shrieks with shrieks more shrill and run up the yard calling out help murder fire help help  the noise wakened every one in the inn except the landlord each started up terrified at the exclamation confusion and affright seized them from first second floors and garrets from down feather and flocks all came hurry scurry like mob from the twelvepenny gallery  back to her own bed betty the chambermaid slipped to put some things on leaving her gallant a london rider shaking in a fearraised argue fit  the hostess scudded from the sergeant of grenadiers her eldest daughter slipped out of the commanding officers apartment her youngest down barefooted was brought trembling upon the bootcatchers back all the rest of the good company half dressed assembled round the tapster who told them there was a spirit playing the devil in the old cowhouse  by the tempting promise of two guineas the three ostlers and a stagecoachman were persuaded to go armed with pitchforks to find out this ghost and the company the female part all went together to get the rest of their clothes on and the gentlemen the same agreeing to meet in the large dining room to hear farther particulars and sir greenfin calipash was to be seated in the grand chair to take the examination  while the guests were getting ready all big with expectation like the polite audiences in cocklane a new noise alarmed them an outcry which was within the house proceeding from the landlord who having been put to bed very drunk was by the continuation of the various noises waked and parched with thirst bawled out loud as asses bray  some oatale a tankard of oatale and be  to ye  after the tapster and mountebank were brought up stairs all the company in the house the host excepted crowded into the room  all stood together promiscuous postilions baronets ostlers ladies bootcatchers squires chambermaids great heiresses cookmaids etc etc for fear and selfpreservation absorb all distinction in such terrible times of danger excepting that just then a lady even of the most delicate principles would prefer a porter to a pretty fellow for her partner  sir calipash in the chair the drawer deposed he saw the ghost and described it to be a black one  the poisoner of parishes gave in his evidence that it was a white one  dr sinecure the learned professor and connoisseur begged leave to be heard upon that subject concerning the seeming contradiction of deposition in respect of the color of the ghost and then he coughed and then he hemmed and then thus went on i am conscious my most intelligent auditors that i can clear this contradiction much to the satisfaction of the polite part of the assembly i have now the honor to speak before  because  cough and hem again  i say because ladies and gentlemen i have not only considered the nature of ghosts philosophically but by every rule of prespective as far as is relative to the vanishing  have i sir greenfin your permission to proceed bowing low as he addressed the president the president as low down bowing in return  upon which the professor of universal connoisseurship in arts and sciences looking about him with much consequence coughed hemmed spit wiped his mouth smoothed his foretop spread his stock pulled his ruffles and began  every ghost every ghost and every apparition and every apparition as well as every ghost possesses in its own nature two sides or contrasuperficies which are denominated philosophically an opaque side and a lucid one  cough  now the two witnesses being as it were fixed or placed at opposite angles saw the opposite sides of the ghost  for instance the drawer who saw it a black ghost had his rays of light absorbed by refrangibility of reflection while the other had a view of the ghost in his illuminated state arising from refraction because the radiancy of the rays striking upon the retina and this pellucidity of shade is called by the painters the clear obscure  cough etc  thus therefore i form my hypothesis  coughs  suppose my left thumb to be a my left little finger b all my left hand c  hem  hem  now therefore i say a plus b b minus c because every person being capable of seeing a dark or a light that is an opaque or a lucid superficies or side belonging to my finger and thumb not only according as i form it into an inclined plain then the shades and lights fly off in tangents of obtuse angles or if that the object refracted is diametrically opposite in a horizontal parallel to the optic nerve thus it was one saw the apparition in a black or nigriferous point of sight and the other beheld it as a light or illuminated appearance  cough hem and spit  had i my most ineffable auditors had i my books and instruments here i might perhaps have demonstrated this more clearly  sir tim dowgate replied it was clear indeed and he apprehended every syllable on it  vastly clear indeed lady dowgate answered the doctors a most amazing man of science and i am positive has more true learning than all doctors commons  indeed lady hadit observed nothing could have been delivered more clearly and she understood every word on it so do i so do i its immensely clear vastly so replied all the polite heap and agreed that as a scholar an artist an orator and connoisseur dr sinecure was quite the thing and they were sure on it  the underbred part of the assembly allowed him to be a most wonderful man and every one gentle and simple joined in praising loudly his late lecture and great learning and they agreed he had made it out so well that they all understood it  the doctor condescended to incline his head in a direction between a bow and a nod with the utmost pedagogick consequence  then sir green fin calipash stood up and tucking his neckcloth ends under his garnet breast buckle he begged leave to observe that as he had always made the good of this nation his study and would venture to say that he knew both old and new englands political constitution as well as any one man in it yet he could not say although he apprehended every thing doctor sinecure had said yet he could not say he understood the meaning of these affairs about black and white ghosts because though he believed in ghosts as much as any christian could yet why sholud ghosts be black or white either why might they not as well be of any other colors  dr sinecure black and white are no colors black is an absorbment white an aggregate  hem  ghosts cannot be of any color  ergo  hem hem hem   sir greenfin so then i suppose you would persuade me by that inuendo of ghosts not being of any color that they cannot be of any party but i know better i know that ghosts are as liable to be in the french interest as they are to be of ours and that this may be a political stroke either of our foreign or domestic enemies  may not the thieftakers and ghosts have a fellowfeeling   lady hadit screaming out a laugh a fellow see  e  eling  oh sir calipash what an idea  can ghosts feel   enter landlord in shirt and napkin nightcap lady hadit was the first who viewed him and her ladyship gave a loud shriek sprung upon on the windowseat and wrapped herself in the windowcurtains  every one in the room by this time had a glance of the figure in white all run helter skelter oversetting benches tables chairs stools burrowing like rabbits underneath them and hitting their heads against one another striving to hide themselves  between sir greenfins legs crept the landlady which overset the knight upon sir timothy dowgate who was hiding himself under his wifes petticoats lady dowgates head and shoulder buried at the same time beneath a card table  every person rolling topsy turvy one upon another the furniture cracking  dr sinecure the chimney board being thrown down had made there to cover and tom tapster and cook maid nan took to the same hiding place  the reader may recollect that at the alarm of the ghosts the innkeeper waking parched with thurst bawled out for some oat ale not any being brought he determined to fetch some himself and as it was the middle of summer and he very hot would not stay to put any clothes on but out of bed hurried down and seeing a light in the large one pair of stairs room opened the door and occasioned the aforesaid confusion wondering he stood and called out i only want tom tapster  oh christ cries nanny who stood with tom in the chimney corner  a great groan came from doctor sinecure who was mounting by toms help he began to work with his elbows to pull himself into the chimney  where is tom tapster again the land lord called out  o lord again shrieks out nanny and was running from him although her old sweetheart and twice asked in church the waiter seizing her by her gown skirts begged her for gods sake not to leave him the doctor was by this time standing upon the tapsters shoulders striving still to mount higher let go my gown for gods sake tom thus nanny began pitiously to request her trembling lover if you have any love for me tom get away least the devil fly away with us both  landlord where is tapster tom   nanny cook here here sir and please your honor mr devil he is in the chimney place squire but dear good gentleman my lord devil i hope your honor will not take me along with him for all he holds me fast good mr devil dont for gods sake go tom go go now dont you hear how his worship calls you  the landlord began to be terrified  the word devil being so often mentioned had an effect upon his spirits and he turned his head about to see where he could run to  when lady hadit who had been at bopeep behind her windowcurtain imagined she could be certain the figure in white must be flesh and blood  more earnestly looking she vowed she could take her oath to its being a man courageously left her pedestal and advancing demanded who are you   landlord me madam please your ladyship the landlord my names jordan   landlady from under sir greenfin it is the devil in my husbands shape my lady oh dont go near him   landlord the devil i believe has been in your shape several years i am sure  but i am the landlord roy lady   lady hadit sir i take for granted that you are flesh and blood and not a spirit but if you are satan or beelzebub or any other of those subterranean geniusses which the vulgar world call the devil i presume you are too polite to behave indelicately to persons of quality   landlord indeed my lady i am no more a devil than any other christian body whatever and i only want a little oatale and that made me call tom tapster   coming sir bawls the waiter and down souse on his posteriors squashes dr sinecure upon the hearth and his teeth were loosened by the fall for he stood upon toms shoulders who bolted out in an instant but over eager as he stooped to get out of the chimney he beat his master down with his head  the sidelong attitude in which the landlord lay across one of the benches made lady hadit burst into a violent laugh for it was as her ladyship said such a sight  this mirth and the preceding conversation dispelled the good companys fears they raised themselves by degrees or else were helped up tom and landlord went down and the rest retired to their separate apartments  the landlady waited upon lady hadit and would have made an apology for her husbands rudeness in standing naked before her  lady hadit not at all mrs jordan i beg you will not mention it pon my honor it was excessively drole  i dote upon such things   mrs jordan your ladyships vastly good to be sure   lady hadit but my dear creature jordan had you seer him fall down  my god  i though i should have expired  such a sight   mrs jordan a wretched sight to be sure your ladyship  but then i am obliged to put up with it however i am vastly glad that as how after my brute of a creature had been so mischiefous as one may say  i am happy that he could divert your ladyship so i wish your ladyship good night   exit lady hadit good night mrs jordan  divert me  my god what wretches there are in this world  sleeps interlude between the acts called the mystery revealed this is to satisfy all the curiosi in england scotland and ireland concerning the spiriting away of miss canning and also of the cocklane miss fannys spirit these were phenomena of such vast consequence to the public that all the people in london interested themselves strongly either on one side or the other the cause of these transactions must have remained a secret had it not been for this publication which is authenticated beyond doubt or even beyond contradiction for my brother has made his affidavit about it and gave me his papers and from those papers for the satisfaction of the town and country and in my brothers own words too i shall insert it as he swore to its veracity before the worshipful the whole bench of justices  the journal of m trip i william trip mate of the concord transport captain robert farding of lynn regis master do declare that as we were coming from lisbon june        it happened to be my watch upon deck i saw a bean cod overset in our ships wake just as we were coming out of the tagus  we having not taking in our boat i got down abaft cast off the painter and skulled away to pick up a person i saw floating and brought him on board our vessel  the gentleman whom i got out of the water happened to be a roman catholic parson one whom they call in their lingo a jesuit and who had got out of portugal by stealth  he was very ill while he was on board us and i tended him so one day as we lay off the wight he sent to speak with me and when i came he desired me to sit down by him and hear someting he had to say to me  upon which that i might be as one may say yard arm and yard arm with him i got a coil of rope clapped it aloft my sea chest brought it along side his hammock so i set down on it and our heads were then on the same latitude together  so then he began reaching out his hand on the starboard side says he my good friend  you have been so civil to me that i have no way to return your kindness but by making you a present of this book of receipts and telling you a piece of secret history that you may make money of it if you have a mind to print it  you must know mr trip that our society for many years found our interest declining both in france and portugal and therefore our superiors thought of reestablishing themselves in england  several missionaries that were sent from rome to england assured us in their letters that the english people would believe any thing that the system or fashion of the minds of the generality of both the high and low life multitude turned upon an axis whose points were conceit and credulity  the success which the methodists and their doctrines met with encouraged us greatly nay our society received several letters from their most eminent preachers in your island and they told us our mission would be received provided we joined them and that upon particular pecuniary concessions on our side they would unite with us because they assured us they must and would be of infinite service to our society since they knew so well how to work upon the multitude  before we would consent to sign any articles with them we resolved from experiment to discover how far we could venture to impose upon the people of england  i was dispatched upon that mission and to prevent suspicion or the least inquiry of what i was i made interest to be engaged as one of the subaltern players belonging to the theater in london only to do trifling parts and when i was once seen upon the stage in that capacity it was impossible any person could suspect i was good for any thing  a brother of our order followed me with fresh instructions but as his part required he should be introduced at all hours and in all places to the very best company he assumed the character of an italian fiddler tooth cleaner and designer and when we have met to compare notes in an evening he has made me smile to hear him relate how every door used to fly open at his approach and he would gossip for two hours with very great personages while the antichamber would be full of colonels and commodores waiting for an audience  the earthquake was of my projecting so was the bottleconjurer it was me who wrote the prophecy for the person called the lifeguardman but in reality he was porter to the fanciscans at padua  he as you may remember foretold the return of the earthquake would happen such a day and bloomsburyfields and bloomsburysquare was filled with coaches and whole families crammed in them who there set all night not daring to trust themselves in their own houses i smiled when i saw them thus huddled together but was amazed to see many of your preachers hurrying out of town as if they were panick struck with the dread of leaving this world  when they are certain there is one so infinitely preferable and in which by the doctrines they profess they must be eternally happy  are they thought i only like physicians who administer medicines for the good of mankind as they say yet have no faith in their own prescriptions  one afternoon by chance i met with elizabeth canning she had lost sixpence was crying about dared not to go home she said  i observed her she had the most stupid look yet on conversing with her i discovered she possessed cunning and obstinacy  by the promise of making up her loss a new topknot and the temptation of riding in a hackneycoach i prevailed upon her to go with me and when she was perfect in her part i exhibited her as you must remember this scheme answered to prove english peoples aptness to embrace or take part with incoherencies  rejoiced i was when the gentleman who endeavored to detect the imposture met with such opposition by his example i was sure other magistrates would be deterred from making any other strict and impartial enquires  for indeed mr trip thus the jesuit went on though your nation is one of the best in the world yet at present folly and prejudice have spread themselves so pestilentially among all ranks and denominations that any person who now would en deavour to benefit his country from a praiseworthy principle of integrity  so great is the defection throughout all degrees  so epidemic the contagion of selfinterest the patriot would be hooted at for a madman reviled as a pretender or punished with contempt and if possible with beggary  preferment makes the english nation behave just as the children of israel did when the manna fell among them they snatch up all they can overload themselves often  no matter by this method less is left for their neighbors  after this affair was over i was sent for back to rome upon special affairs relative to our society but i left a brother of our order full instructions how to proceed and the plan for a project that as soon as he recovered he was to put in execution it was the cocklane phantom or what was then called miss fanneys spirit  this was our most favorite scheme this was our corner stone we therefore employed more  i suppose he would have said skill but our ship at that moment by the wind shifting took such a lust that her leerufftree dipped in the water and the jesuit was canted overboard out of his hammock pitched his head upon the trunnion of a four pounder and never spoke another word  i was overset but i soon righted but as for my companion death clapped a stopper upon his tongue as quick as one could crack a biscuit  and this is the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth as witness my hand  william trip mariner  in the analytical destination of the incorporalities of ghosts wrote originally in runic translated by saxo grammaticus into the german there is one page which for the benefit of all true believers i have taken the trouble to render into english viz  there are three distinct or separate species or classes of ghosts and apparitions  the first is the misers spectre this phantom invariably appears loaded with chains to tell where money has long been hid and it comes as a skeleton because it is supposed to starve itself to death ergo it cannot have any flesh upon its bones  the second is the winding sheet ghost or torchholdingimmateriality which is a lovesick maiden that glideth along the midnight dew to undraw the feet curtains of her forsworn swain and bidding him bethink him of former affairs of plighted troth and ruined maidenheads she comes in a white sheet to do penance for being so foolish as to break her heart hang drown or poison herself for love and constancy  the third and last is the hobgobblin or raw head and bloody bones  this is very terrifying and often used to appear to several particular persons both at sea and land an hour or two before an engagement  but it is at present as well as the lovesick ghost almost out of fashion  eternal infamy upon his name who wishes to have any more ghosts among us and all honor praise and preferment attend and wait upon the ambassadors chaplain who gave the grand signior wise and christianlike advice not to open a communication between the mediterranean and red sea because it would disturb all the ghosts that are now so

elixir to her mouth  and gently gulping  once  twice  thrice  administered warmth to her sorrow chilled breast discontent died away sleepful she sunk upon her pillow lulled to rest by the calm opiate of genuine hollands  scene next morning just as madam llwhyddwhuydd sat down to her tea the merry andrew came jumping into her apartment bawling out as loud as a bribed voter bellows liberty madam

rushing strait forward overset the breakfasting stool  where where is it she cried snatching at the same time the chronicle out of the tumblers hands  but recollecting her inability to make the words

and double ds and double us and i cannot spell it   mrs llwhyddwhuydd i know it child never mind that my dear go to the next word   mr somerset i will begin again madam and skip that   mrs llwhyddwhuydd do so my best friend   mr somerset reads again whereas chloe the wife of muster what do you call um was decoyed away by one knott a corporal this is to give notice that if she will return home to her own lawful spouse she shall meet with a hearty welcome and no questions asked   the husbands grief was left to the readers imagination the editor bequeaths the wifes joy to the same colourist and as he made bold to carry her off takes the same freedom to bring her home again her husband received her with all that joy which every fond forgiving spouse has felt when with outstretched arms he once more impounds his long strayed lady  blessing each other they embraced and over and over again they blessed that day and also blessed the inventors of publishing newpapers advertisements etc  in honor of the press i must be allowed  a dissertation on dailypapers no patriot in or out of place ever considered their utility with that grateful attention these publications deserve  is there a want in the world but what may be instantly relieved if the patient will but consult the columns of those morning and evening intelligencies with as much gravity as ever any one of the faculty pulled off his gloves i do declare that without the help of these dictionaries for the day the great business of the nation could not be carried on  how could mrs philips hope for the continuance of her customers or the nobility and gentry know where to pay in their opera subscriptions where could they send for the best royal beautifying fluid or could be sure of having french chicken gloves genuine how should we know when mr whitfield preaches in edinburgh or georgia or where we should be sure of roman purl unadulterated how should we be ascertained where the most notified dr tailor performs his occulistical or oratorial operations or where the best liquid blacking is to be got where to send for the pure aetherial volatile quintessence of essence or how could we be informed that the seawater at brighthelmstone is better than any other seawater were it not for being so instructed by paragraphs and advertisements aforesaid o credulity crecredulity thou universal power how much are we indebted to thy influences  new discoveries elixirs lotions injections and nostrums for the ladies are as we read to be had at every toyshop  sometimes indeed the applications and uses of these extraordinary succedaneums are not expressed in so delicate a style as polite persons might wish but when we consider the humane intent of the makersup and venders of these medicines the style is excused  as in the country we put up with the indelicacy of the entertainment for the good will of the host  the humanity of the college of physicians here must be noticed they have an authority to inspect into medicinemongers and can nay and should and i suppose do visit several places where drugs are sold yet it never was known that any deputation from gresham college or apothecarieshall inspected into the noted dr franks dr sarrant dr rock dr jesuit drop dr greek water etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc this wilful omission is owing to the same public spirit by which mr ashley on ludgate hill is agitated gentlemen of the faculty are willing to let every person have physic as well as punch in small quantities and therefore wink at the aforesaid advertisers  yet such is the malignity of humankind that even this generous behavior of the faculty has been found fault with and the babbling pack of scandal yelpers bark out  that as quacks make diseases worse the profits of the regular bred must be thereby increased  malicious insinuations as if gentlemen of the m d signatures would be guilty of such pitiful finesses thus the mad multitude have as basely clamoured against the police  the lowlife herd of hirelings give out that truly if the worthies in commission would but take half as much pains to suppress the bawdyhouses bagnios etc in their parishes as they labor to take highwaymen it would be of more benefit to the nation in general  but how little do these people know of sporting  if the cover was grubbed up the breeding of game would be prevented how then could money for a subscription pack of harriers tarriers etc be collected  with what force i ween  but good heaven forgive us god bless their majestys and every person who is commissioned by them to see justice done as it should be  and as mr jacob henriques observes it is all for the glorification of old england  when i mention the word quacks it is not to be presumed that any gentleman recipevender acting under letters patents can be hinted at because we are all certain patents are only granted to men of excellent science of approved education whose discoveries have been owing to indefatigable study and are witness from repeated experiments before the most skillful to be entirely calculated for the health and preservation of the people of england  these and many more uses than these belong to newspapers they not only bring health to patients but ladies to despairing lovers and wives to husbands as in the case of mr and mrs llwhyddwhuydd now under our consideration had it not been for the convenience of advertising when could they have come together again  yet david did not descend one grain from the dignity of inbred honor by permiting his wife to return home  for while he had one readymoney customer left his big heart despised submission but when all his trade was lost the garrison of his great mind was forced to capitulate his nobleness of spirit and blood of japhet were forced to surrender prisoners of war at and to discretion he obeyed the times madam llwhyddwhuydd gave him her hand he kissed it  tears of joy swelled over his eye brinks and he told her in the name of god and good people how his heart was glad to see her to be sure and i do hope in deed i do now  mrs llwhyddwhuydd and so do i husband that nothing hereafter may be mentioned concerning my former withdrawing myself for although my dear husband i esteem you as so worthy a man ought to be esteemed yet if ever you was to reproach me with what might or might not suppose to have happened during our separation that moment should be my last i would the next plunge myself to the bottom of the river and prevent that way your ill usage   her spouse though in raptures at the stateliness of his wifes gesture yet the resolution of her look frightened him fearful that she should make away with herself especially as he had been at such an expense to fetch her home too he kneeled down and begged her to be pacified and forgive him if he had said any thing amiss  she forgave him and raised him with a tender reconciling look equal to what the most enraged though detected lady can soften into when her husband has made a proper humiliation and giving up all his informers  for it is not possible a man can love his lady either married or unmarried unless he will wink at her errors and the larger those errors are or the greater the number the more occasion has he to manifest his affection  to do david justice which a man so well born as he was deserves although his enemies said he was a perfect totherendofthetownsman suffering himself to be carried down the tide in the corrupted currents of this world admitting the flaws and cracks of reputation to be cemented by the solder of selfinterest yet he never let awry word pass his lips against his lady  madam llwhyddwhuydd grew again the admiration of the neighborhood and customers even the best in the parish assembled there every evening as before times  scene the trollopees catastrophe or retort uncourteous soon after mrs llwhyddwhuydds return mr ap thomas her spouses partner with a full pot of porter in his hand happened to run against her just as she came from her sunday noons walk in st jamess park  her white satin trollopee was splashed with it and the very smell of porter always made mrs llwhyddwhuydd sick because persons are apt to depise what they get their living by her clothes were spoiled and such clothes too  a dress that the first duchess in the land might have gone to court in  passion ever has power to serve an ejectment upon reason the suffering lady on that account became so little mistress of herself that she called thomas several severe names and at last told him he was a vulgar creature  the word vulgar was grimgribber to the ancient briton to be reflected upon as if he was not a gentleman irritated him to that degree that he returned her severe words with words yet more severe  the writer of this part has served his time to the knowledge of mankind and since worked several year journeyman in that profession else he never could have believed such words could have escaped any mans lips who valued himself upon being a gentleman as mr thomas uttered  he made use of such phrases that no persons if they were not in a passion or chose to be looked upon superior to the scurrilous rank of informing constables would rehearse  for in most illiberal language he reproached her with the corporal  company coming in very fast she could not with decency stay to hear him any longer ladies may like to listen to some sort of expressions yet it is not proper every body should know it it was extreme modesty that made mrs llwhuddwhuydd quit the bar and leave her adversary master of the field of battle  she went up to her chamber and sent for miss shred to consult about repairing the damage done to her dress then she acquainted miss shred with thomass abuse repeating the very words over and over and over again and concluded saying no miss upon my honor i never can or ever will forgive that page      fellor  he told me that the corporal  my god  besides to call me whore madam whore my dear miss  i never was on mans whore it was always love to which i gave up my soul not any mercenary views and therefore as i never took money how can i be a whore  miss shred indeed madam i wish you was to have been last lecture night at our tabernacle to have heard that good creature the doctor divide the difference of going into keeping through inclination or interest  love for love is as he said like the levitical law of an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but mercenary matches with or without the parsin it is all the same is a sin not to be even purified even by regeneration but dear madam you never told me why you would come home again i hope the corporal was not inconstant   mrs llwhuddwhuydd inconstant miss do you imagine the horrid country ladies could have any charms for a gentleman like mr knott who had been titup a titup with all the beau moon of st jamess park we suppose she means tete a tete  inconstant  no miss i ashure you looking in the glass i didnt fear any rivals but i could never forgive the corporal because he would not hold his tongue to be sure he might have made himself worthy of any womans love if he would not have boasted so and made my name the tenttalk of his comrades i vow miss i have blushed spontaneously as one may fay and my cheeks have burned as much as if one was talking of a body when i used to reflect how my name might be brought up as the corporals concubine before a parcel of sutlers wives and sogers trulls  me miss  was it me to be treated so  i could not bear the idea rising up i i to be used so  walking forwards and backwards her left hand extended upon her right breast her right hand waving a handkerchief in a curve or serpentine line i here she set down again i who was born in the ingies and my mamma was first waiting woman of quality to the empress of the catawaws   miss shred pouring a little more into the glass indeed madam it is immensely monstrous to reflect how men will blab and that is one reason why i have often wished to be a person of quality because they dont care what is said about them   miss llwhuddwhuydd very true dear miss but as i am but a simple gentlewoman one is obliged to be careful concerning ones reputation and as i left the corporal because i would not be talked off shall such a reptul as thomas pretend to reproach me my husband knows of it and every body knows my husband is a man of honor and therefore  miss your health   miss shred to be sure madam such affairs as yours with the corporal may happen to the finest woman in england and in polite life it is looked upon to be no more than an accident and no persons would blame you but vulgar creatures nor is there any harm in it  that is when it proceeds entirely from the spirit as we prove at our love feasts the methodists have all nightmeetings called love feasts    here follows in the manuscript seven chapters of mr zapanhiels own handwriting upon the seven deadly sins and a collection of receipts of regeneration which he entitles fullers earth for the spots of the soul and the account how miss shred became a methodist which is introduced by a preface of observation wherein he says that gamblers and ladies of pleasure if they live to grow old and have saved money enough to encourage our pastors or any pastors to pray by them they are weaned from their wickednesses and become sanctified for the older we grow the wiser we grow  and he says further in exhorting all sinners to regenerate  oh what a heavenly comfort it is to consider that a sinner after running through a life of all wickedness shall only by attending on our tabernacle be purified is it not a rich balsam for a sore soul therefore come unto us all ye who are afflicted with the remembrances of the methods by which ye have got your wealth and ye shall but give a tithe to us by way of paying insurance to the saints who will infallibly save you from being shipwrecked on the rocks of perdition and will stcer you into the harbor of grace yet we are not papists no  we will not give you absolution  we are not protestants  no  we will not save you by repentance  no no we are methodists and it is regeneration shall save you it shall be the cork waistcoat to keep you floating and ye shall not sink into the bottomless pit of the sea where the devil of hell lies in the shape of a shark to devour you  all these sentimental chapters the editor postponed and therefore was obliged to cut out and to turn over above  0 pages before he could find the continuation of this register which went on as follows  the natural reason for a ladys longing davids lady soon had it in her power to perform her vow  the vow of revenge which she had solemnly taken to be even with thomas her trollopee spoiler finding herself with child to the great joy of her spouse she told her husband she longed for a bite or two at his partner thomass nose and it was that which occasioned those learned quotations inserted in the first pages of this history and if the reader pleases to remember mr david and his partner in the midst of that most classical conversation were called away by the noise of chair chair  just as mr llwhyddwhuydd had fixed his straps to the poles a message came that his lady was taken very ill upon which hurrying away as fast as he could with the fare he returned to comfort his good woman who that morning fell in labor occasioned by her over care as an oeconomist  for though madam llwhyddwhuydd was big with child and reckoned every hour yet she would needs go to market herself because she said servants had so many ways of cheating their masters and mistresses it happened as she passed by a public house near the market two people were quarrelling about the critical rules of the game of put the altercation being pretty high the cards were thrown out at the window just as this lady was passing by and the knave of clubs hit her upon the nose she was frighted put into a chair carried home immediately and fell into labor in about half an hour her friends immediately prognosticated that from the incident of the knave of clubs striking her it would be a boy if it had been a queen they said it would have been a girl and that her son would as he grew up be an odd mortal and as comical to look at as the knave of clubs was the subsequent behavior of needy has verified the truth of the prediction  just at this time many prodigies appeared in the political theatrical and scholastic worlds or circles  at this time the great alloway was in blossom at hoxton and a maiden sizes at york city the first calf with five legs that ever was shown in england came to town that day and that day mr whitfield  but whether these revolutions and portents happened in consequence of neds coming into the world or that neds coming into the world was in consequence of these things happening we leave with submission to the retrospection of all searchers into futurity  scene the delivery after madam llwhyddwhuydd was put into bed and her gossips assembled the good women ordered a manmidwife to be sent for but mrs llwhyddwhuydd knowing the objection her spouse had to menmidwives was prudent enough to refuse such assistance because she was sure it would offend her husbands delicacy  however the other ladies were unanimous for a man she entreated she begged they were obstinate the dispute was loud it reached into the street and every stall chandlersshop and cellarkeeper in the parish assembled at the door and determined that as they knew david was sent for he should not pass into his own house until they had his word and honor to send for a manmidwife for his lady for as each said if it was only for the look of the thing he should have one david appeared at that instant they surrounded him as the print relates to you much better than i can however one figure in it i must beg leave to explain which is the bigbellied female who seems to be full of grief  that lady is spouse to a most celebrated writer of political papers and who has wrote very severely against menmidwives because not being able to pay for their attendance those gentlemen had refused their assistance  she was a party deeply concerned in this dispute and it afflicted her to take notice of davids obstinacy  he indeed once or twice attempted to speak  but it was a vain attempt as he could not we beg leave to speak for him  p      slaughter surgeon and man midwife    mr llwhyddwhuydd was too fond a husband to deny his wife what she desired but being a great reader the newspapers and magazines informed him of the indecency indelicacy and evil tendency of having menmidwives  the putters together of those daily and monthly paragraph compendiums had proved that no husband of nice honor would suffer a manmidwife and as david was a man of the nicest honor how could he endure them  in some papers it was hinted that menmidwives could be of no use because the indian women delivered themselves  in other papers it was inserted that in a state of nature there were neither men midwives nor parsons and that people could do well without both and as how in the first ages and the first ages were the best ages and that this age was the worst age but in the first ages there were no arts or sciences nor occasion for any that people would live better without them than with them that neither mankind or womankind had need for more help than the animals in the fields or the fowls of the air that it was only villainous custom evil habits wrong tendencies and the prejudice of education that made us employ surgeons tailors chemists shoemakers menmidwives dancingmasters snuffmakers frenchcooks saddles shirts shifts or pockethandkerchiefs  from the information of those weekly paid journalists we may easily account why great scholars who study nature so nicely are such great slovens as they know by their extreme skill that we are not superior to the beasts they choose to retain as much brutality as possible in their behavior  david like the traveller in the contention with the wind wrapped himself up in his surtout determined to stand out the tempest when word was brought him that madam llwhyddwhuydd was brought to bed of a fine boy and as like the father   he would not stay to hear the rest of the messengers observation bursting through the crowd run home and received the congratulations of his company mr llwhyddwhuydd indeed rejoiced having a son and heir and that was the utmost of his hopes wishes and prayers before he had read the observations abovementioned yet now his principal satisfaction arose from the reflection his lady was brought to bed without the help of a manmidwife  the metaphysical scene the authors of joseph andrews and tristram shandy wrote themselves into reputation and i believe got money by what they did and really deserved it  ever since i have engaged in this work i have endeavored to copy one or both of their styles manners or maxims but i cannot fancy myself quite so clever yet have i all that customary fondness that becoming partiality for my own works which every author ought to have and hold all the rest of my cotemporaries in a trifling light to myself this i do as well as any or all the dramatic writers of england ireland or scotland but yet i dont find myself honestly speaking a jot better genius for all the abuse i make use of  if the connections i have with publishers could be on my side discharged or a protection granted me i might wear a laced coat and live without working as well as many other gentlemen  then i would no more meddle with a pen and ink than a lady in high keeping would mend her own linen for my mind scorns the drudgery of writing reading and reflecting as much as any rich man in the kingdom can do  my wife has an acquaintance who promises to provide for me either in the church the navy the law the army the customs at court or in the excise it does not signify what branch it is for if a man has but interest he is fit for any place  must it not irritate a genius like me or like my spouse to see so many dunces driving their one horsechaise or else crammed into hackney coaches taking the air to white conduithouse on a sunday raising a dust on the new road and choking such foot passengers as me and my wife but we enjoy the satisfaction to reflect though those wretches ride about flourishing in the folly of finery  yet they perhaps not one of them ever made a rebus or can repeat the greek alphabet  at this instant the dear creature my spouse is sitting by me in dishabille indeed  for what need we outward ornaments when we can deck the mind with understanding or look upon the fashions of the world but to condemn or pity those that use them  our base grovellingmoneygettingneighbours envy us and abuse us for suffering our children we have but six indeed to run about ragged but i despise their rancour my wife its too well born too well bred and too great herself to descend to the servile domestic drudgery of tending nurseries or the base culinary employment of cooking victuals no we had rather go without a dinner than dress one for ourselves and the ingratitude and ignorance of the world will not allow us to afford a servant  n b this digression is here inserted to amuse the reader until madam llwhyddwhuydd was well enough to see company  all the better most people of shuglane and middlerow came to pay the lyingin visit but madam llwhyddwhuydd confessed to her very intimates that she could not relish a visitor with half that satisfaction who lived on the city side of northumberland house as she did those at the polite end of the town  the gossips met and cawdle crowned the board unworthy would it be of me to have registered this gossipping had not the meeting been so particularly famous for the metaphysical conversation which they for the first time started in english  concerning several abstruse and occult points predicaments qualities essentials and immaterialities relative to ideas contract resistance modes of the mind habits of the body rules of government errors of administration defects in religious worship inequalities of rewards and punishments hell happiness doctors commons faith perjury simony heresy adultery accidents of matter and spiritual essences  piecemeal have these subjects been retailed even unto this day in every coffeehouse tavern punchhouse alehouse eatinghouse and nightcellar unless the more interesting vocations of politics strumpeting or gambling have employed the good companys attention  first gossip indeed madam you say true and i must own that after i was delivered of my first child i could not help considering deeply about these things and so when i went down for my health into the country i used to love to see the hens lay eggs and then those eggs i was told would produce chickens upon which ladies a thought came into my head that i never have been satisfied about since and that is  which was made first the yolk or the eggshell if the eggshell was made first how came the yolk in it if the yolk was made first how came the shell over that   second gossip that madam is one of the mostest curious questions in the world and it was the parson of our parish who first axt me that question and he laughed at me cause i could not resolve him so i made my husband send it to the rial saciety and they will tell us about it i know by and bye   third gossip now there is one thing that i want to know sadly because our sexton says the vestry divided about it and they should know to be sure ladies that is  whether stillborn infants have any sins to answer for   first gossip to my knowledge madam this has made great disputes among the clergy and they are divided in their opinions though to me it is as clear as noonday for how can poor infants answer when they never had been taught to speak   all oh to be sure quite right quite right indeed   third gossip pray ladies dont you take fate to be a free agent   fourth gossip to be sure madam whatever may be a ladys fate yet she is a free agent because now suppose i was fated to be married to a person whom i cannot say i could relish it is at my upshot to be sure whether i will act or no and so fate is a free agent  but a gentleman who lodges in my one pair of stairs told me but yesterday talking about free agents and fate and what might be the fate of agents that fate and free agency were like king and commons that the mind was the monarch and the will was the people so i told him in answer that whatever his mind was he could not have his will of me without i had a mind   all oh no to be sure no to be sure   first gossip now ladies give me leave to ask you whether as adam never was born as other people have been sense that is no lady was ever brought to bed or with child of him could he have a navel   all no no no to be sure no   third gossip my brother ladies we all know is a great writer and once wrote a whole newspaper himself he is so great a genus at handling his pen that i was told by the waiter at ronelor how he might have wrote a song and it would have been sung before the grand company there and that you know madam would be the vastest honor imaginable because the quality could recommend him you know to be poet larum songmaker to the rial familly but he has gone and disobliged my husband and all his friends for he has hired himself to a club of philosophers and so be is to publish a book to prove how far free will acts upon the lodestone and he says he dont doubt but he will get a penshum for it   mrs murdock the nurse then began a discourse upon ethics to determine the identical spot of satans demesnes or where hellfire was she affirmed it to be seated in the middle of the sun  but madam celery the greengrocers lady denied that and said it was in the middle of the earth  miss shred who was always a systemist supposed there were several hells and that every comet contained one  the bible was quoted by jenny douglass but when it was asked what bible because mrs murdock observed there were so many histories of the bible published at sixpence per month she could not tell what to say to it for she didnt suppose they could be all good because the bluepaper covers said so  madam llwhyddwhuydd observed that she supposed they were all true translations and explications or else to be sure the bishops would not suffer such things to be published  mrs murdock well there are so many religions and so many religious opinions and so many books about religion and so many disputes and so many sort of preachers that they are not all to be trusted   first gossip no madam why ant they all christians   mrs murdock christians no madam  why some are presbyterians and some are methodists   miss shred as to methodists madam murdock you must excuse me because they are the only christians for they are regenerated and no body can be a sincere christian until being regenerated but there are a great many people in the world that are of no religion   mrs murdock and that is better than not being of the true one for its a shame to see how parents use their children here the poor innocents are soused over head and ears or else they are circumscised or else made quakers or else one thing done to them or else another and so they are bound prentice to this or to that teligion without ever knowing if they can like it  and that makes so many different opinions in the world when they grow up to be men and women because it dont signify whether they were made jews or christians you see jews behave as christians and christians as jews and there is no telling one from tother i think   this conversation determined madam llwhyddwhuydd that as there were such disputes about religion her son should not undergo any spiritual ceremony until he came to years of discretion then he might choose which religion he liked best and that was the reason our master neddy was never christened  scene islington thus far the editor compiled of the mss and attended on the appointed sunday at mr warners who is a very good sort of a man and one to whom the putter together of these historical paragraphs has been very much obliged  this would not have been mentioned but to convince the world all authors are not so ungrateful as to forget the friends who formerly filled their bellies  i have composed drolls for mr warners booth and by his recommendation i have wrote several dramas for the proprietors of puppetshows in which i used to adhere entirely to the strict rules of aristotle rapin and bossu the chastity of taste among english audiences at that time was so pure they would not bear the smallest innovation of the unities of time and place even in mr punch  because as the coffeehouse connoisseurs observed it is more instructive and more elegant even to be lulled into a slumber by the rules of art than kept awake and in spirits by all the fire of fancy contrary to the greek and french scale or standard  at that time mrs charke sister to the late mr theophilus cibber had a famous puppetshow which was conducted with such regularity  to compare the puppetshows of that time with the puppetshows of this time would be only an illnatured attempt but charlotte charke used to pride herself that her company her ladies at least were all vestals because as she said a lady belonging to the theaters royal may be weak enough or fond enough or mean enough and mercenary enough to descend being upon the town but who mrs charke used to exult who can say they ever supped with the queen of sheba at the shakespeare or had fair rosamond at haddocks  this daughter of colley cibber the late poet laureate was a lady of surprising singularity but the oddities of the human mind are unaccountable  there is his honor sir  a great politician yet all his delight is chucking sixpence into a quart decanter  is not mr  the great physician an admirer of parched peace but cannot eat any except what he cooks himself  mr  the famous mathematician prefers battledore and shuttlecock to painting poetry and music and dont we all know several dignified  who though amazingly orthodox value themselves more upon their taste in venison and madeira than in interpreting the scriptures  some ladies of distinction have been known to admire low company their husbands at the same time not caring for any but it is impossible to account why we are whim bitten so far has oddity been epidemical that noblemen have been known nay and several at this time are really fond of their wives and what is as remarkable their ladies are as warm in their affections for their husbands  our minds will be attached to irregularities miss  with the finest eyes in england affects to be near sighted and lady  a most charming figure drawn by elegance and dressed by grace  chooses to appear round shouldered  sir  one of our most eloquent speakers and a gentleman of amazing learning believes he can spin a top better than any other man in england and wants to have  00 upon it  the rt  who has seven of the finest children perhaps in christendom has impaired his estate in purchasing and preparing butterflywings to line his study in imitation of tapestry and mr  the most eminent attorney in great britain employs his whole time in gudgeon fishing  this mr warner abovementioned had an oddity of temper which is uncommon among theatrical managers he never looked upon his people to be off the stage as good as himself he never chose to countenance them as acquaintance or be familiar with them as friends  a fortnight or three weeks preceding the borough fair he used to have a great levee of people in the business although at that instant perhaps out of employ who would wait upon him to know if he wanted any hands in the acting singing dancing hocus pocus or hannock and jannock way  they used at first to come about dinnertime and no person keeps a betterhouse than he does or understands it better there was always something good in the pot or roasting at the fire there would they walk up and down the kitchen  now glancing at the meat now at the master sometimes darting their eyes down desponding into the dripping pan then eagerly expectant lift them up again to the boiler and then they would strut across the kitchen and spout and say to be or not to be and jemmy would laugh and whisper me saying not to be eat by them colls i assure you  some of these passages i was remarking to mr warner and we were thinking of old affairs and i just had told him of the drippingpan and the tragedy and comedy people as mr zaphaniel and the dancing master came in we went up one pair of stairs and there i was shown master edward and miss ann walking arm in arm up and down the skettlealley  the history of miss ann you see mr poet observed the dancing master you see there that is miss nancy she is a very desirable girl faith as showey a figure as it is possible to represent  i owned her figure was extremely agreeable  i protest mr zaphaniel replied she is comely amongst the daughters of delight  yea she is fair as the fairest females of judah  she is more precious to my sight than the rose of sharon or the snowdrops of damascus verily my friends my heart beats to behold her and i would sooner choose to have her within my fold than both my fists full of the gold of ophir  dancing master this lady appeared first as a public performer at sadlers wells for some years before she had performed with the public but never until then theatrically as she was extremely agreeable in her figure and the novelty of her dancing added to it with her excellence in the execution she soon grew to be a favorite with the town and the ensuing season nancy was engaged at covent garden playhouse she became vastly celebrated admired imitated and followed by every body which is always the consequence when once a lady of pleasure becomes the fashion  the first night of her performance at the new house our hero whose soul was ever agitated by love and ambition confessed himself her admirer  let me do master edward this justice to praise him for his emulation in so spirituously aiming at every new part in comedy which mr garrick is famous for yet as every biographer is supposed to be the friend of the genius whose life he celebrates i would advise master edward rather hereafter to strike out a new cast of acting for himself where comparisons could not be made in justice to his merit it must be allowed he who is capable of being the master stephen the miser etc etc has a sufficiency of comic abilities to be without buffoonery grimace or mimickry a capital actor and be held in a much higher point of character than what at present he is although now he is the drole and comical one of the town and pleases them with his performances it is in his power not only to give pleasure to an audience but to gain their esteem and difficult as that part may be to act it is worth his while to study it  edward was in love to all the degrees sallies and dependencies of desparation  the lady observed her conquest and enjoyed it she knew her man had heard that to his girls and his gamesters he did not mind what money he threw away he was a trout worth tickling and therefore returned him look for look  emboldened by this eye language he began to contrive a scheme for enlarging the correspondence he wished to talk with her but he wanted words  he wished to write to her but he wanted letters therefore employed his landland mr thomas philips of whom more hereafter to be his secretary  i cannot forbear mentioning a piece of ingratitude of neddys to that old gentleman who behaved in this affair extremely friendly to him and yet so far can gaming absorb all grateful principles that edward has betted twenty to five his landlord will not live until lady day next the conceit of such a bett has had a violent effect upon the mind of the old gentleman mr pond also to the best of my remembrance has such another wager i have not indeed a syllable to say against mr pond he is as fair a sportman as ever stepped up the stand and pays his betts as punctual as if he was a man of quality yet after he has said done to such a bett what business had he to drive mr philips from gregs coffeehouse it seems as if it was designed as a heartbreaking stroke since to be debarred from that academy of universal conversation must be as great a damp upon the spirits of any of the curiosi as it was to bussy rabutin to be banished from the french court  when miss ann became a principal dancer she had a friend a female one i mean to wait upon her behind the scenes to watch her motions and take care of her steps  this duenna was her relation and therefore had a more than ordinary care of her charge least detraction should be malicious  the ogles which neddy the drole and nancy the desirable reciprocally interchanged alarmed the old lady guardianess she trembled at the danger nancys honor was in and soon as they came home that evening thus began the most careful governante  i once thought yes that i did miss nancy how you had a better spirit and a more politer taste than to coquet it with a player  mercy upon us what is our family fallen too if this is the case and so youre in love with the fellow are you i say love too i will tell you what child when once any fine woman like you condescends to give her company to people of fashion who can pay her well for it why there is no harm done  but for a lady to fall in love it is just like a tradesman dealing all upon honor they had better shut up shop at once my dear   miss ann lord madam how you talk as if i ever loved a man in my life you know i never did and yet you know i have had as fine men as ever put laced clothes on and did i ever love any of um how should i i have had too many and seen too much of them to love them indeed i used to tell them i did what then that was no more than rehearsing ones part you know  as to love  why now madam you know you have gone out a nursing and have a sweet creature it was and yet at the same time it was ready to make you sick why so it is with us girls of the town we kiss men and fondle them and make babies of them and tell them they are sweet creatures and yet at the same time they make us almost sick  what then it dont last long and though the service may be hard it is soon over and if the wages are good what does it signify   governess but who would receive wages from a player   miss ann why now didnt you but yesterday read in one of those sixpenny blue covered books there that we take in monthly and a charming libry they make that is certain  how that a great roman catholic emperor laid a tax upon peoples making water and how his son found fault with him for it because it was a base thing and didnt the father as the book says take up a piece of gold that was gathered by the tax and bid his son examine if it smelt of chamberly so madam what does it signify if we girls can but get money who it comes from do you think my mercer can tell one bodys guinea from another   governess yes child but what guineas can you get from a showman   miss ann why mun he no more minds money than i do modesty but will give it away as unconcerned as i do my haircombings besides maam the case is this i shall not always look so well as i do now for these cursed washes i use for all they do give ones neck and face such a fine whiteness yet they make ones skin in a morning look all crumpled like a washerwomans fingers and turns ones flesh as yellow as a peasepudding now you must know that this young fellow ned will always have a good salary from the playhouse because he is devilish comical to be sure though he has not all the wit in the world neither  what then  the fitter for my purpose  if i can but persuade him to marry me  why shouldnt i be made an honest woman of and i will too  i have got some money and i would give it all if i could but be made an honest woman for it dont signify talking but i can no more look a modest woman in the face as i should do than i can say my prayers i wonder what is the meaning of it however i dont despair cause i know neds but a nicodemus and a girl may get him to do any thing we are to sup together to night   governess are ye then i suppose you are to go to bed together to night but not at my house nan  no by all that is honorable i never will consent to so undervaluement a connection  a player lie with my relation  no  as to your having an intrigue with a man of fashion why it is what no lady need be ashamed of and indeed few are  for that is natural and therefore no sin in it but shall any of our family ever stoop so low as to lay the cloth for an actors ordinary i detest such business but see there is harris from the shakespeare at the door some gentleman has sent for you i will lay my life on it  go to him in the lords name but never let me hear any more about mr what is his name   miss not being willing to anger her governess like other prudent young ladies was determined to hear her guardianesss opinion and follow her own she went to the shakespeare where her impatient lover ned waited for her  thus began the amor  mr warner then bringing up dinner prevented any more being said upon that subject  master edward and miss ann dined in the next room the apartments only divided by a slit deal as we were impatient to be earwitnesses at least of their conversation we dispatched our ordinary with such expedition that both their dinner and ours were over together when for the benefit of observation mr zaphaniel made three or four peepholes in the partition through which we could see the underwritten dramatis personae  edward ann jemmy mrs molly as i was determined to be punctual in their conversation i took it down in short hand at the very time the dialogue was uttered as follows  miss ann lord ned now dont be so foolish as to pull ones hair out of order so i am sure you men not one in a hundred of you know how it is to treat a woman as you should do  lord dont paw one so   master edward paw one so  there is a pretty speech indeed  paw one so  what now is that polite language miss   miss ann may be so  i hope you dont set up for a critic do you sir   master edward suppose i do maam   miss ann why then i suppose you do wrong sir  because you should never find fault with other peoples words until you can tell your own letters sir   master edward i can always tell your letters nan when you send to me for money   miss ann yes but who reads them for you your landlord does not he   master edward your landlord does not he why i neither value my landlord nor you into the bargain   miss ann nor any body else ned that ever did you any favors i will say that for you your gratitude and my virtue are two very fine things if any body could but tell where to find them  there was what is his name who wrote the droll for you which you thought proper to call your droll and made you your dish of all sorts and the day of taste and several comic songs which have been of such service to you in your benefits both in town and in the country how did your serve him did not you exspose him falsely and scandalously and strove by what you said of him publicly in some of the infamous bawdyhouses that you frequent to render him contemptible and he had never done any thing to my knowledge to merit such treatment  i wish he would write something about you i wish he would nothing he could print against you could be half so bad as the abuse you have loaded him with in my hearing neddy but he dont value you  nor i neither  that for you  that for you and she snapped her fingers as if playing upan the castanets or like caledonian ladies figuring country dances   master edward there is a pretty piece of st giless music for you there is a gentlewomans action for you   miss ann no ned i lost that character as soon as i let you have any thing to say to me   master edward i think myself as good a gentleman    miss ann what because you wear a laced coat and belong to the play houses why so does newgate tom and he bought his finery secondhand oo the same way that you came by your wit  your jokes  you have them all at secondhand now  the maker will not furnish you any longer  you a gentleman yes when a night mans cart may pass for a noblemans chariot   master edward if you never was to have any people to trade with you but gentlemen you would have very few customers   miss ann i had one too many when i took you for my chapman   master edward well let us have no more of your nonsense   miss ann as much sense as yourself ned and come of a better family  now there is a spiteful fellow for you to throw a glass of wine in my face  o you malicious  but i will do for you  and then she clapped her hands together as if she was applauding him for his acting  i will expose you sirrah i will tell squintum of you yes that i will mr jews face though for that matter he knows as many tricks as you do for to my knowledge the saints at the tabernacle can humm as well as any player in england they are a parcel of sad dogs and for your part ned you are    at that moment master edwards clenchd fist like a battering ram was drove hard horizontally against her mouth which blow would have been repeated quick as the change of a pantomime trick had not the rest of the company interposed  soon as the suffering lady recovered the use of her speech bursting into tears she declared that the villain wanted to spoil her face because she should not get her bread any longer as she ought to do  for you know jemmy addressing herself to the landlord and still crying a girl upon the town when she has lost her beauty is like a toyshop having its show glass stole away but by g   mrs molly oh dont swear my dear creature consider it is the lords day and such a thing as an oath shocks me christ what conscience must those people have who break any of the commandments   miss ann lord madam i dont want to be taught about conscience i believe my conscience and yours too madam if they were hung upon a hedge to dry no body would think them worth stealing   mrs molly madam i suppose that i may have as much conscience as my betters   page        miss ann but if you have not more than most of them lord help you madam  see how that fellow stands grinning there  dont hold him jemmy  let him come on  curse me if i dont box him  i will beat some conscience into him  so stand clear for if i dont give him something to make him remember me may i never know what a guinea is again   in a hurry she pulled off her treble ruffles with trembling fingers twitched from her waist the deep flounced apron threw her garnet edged cap upon the floor and in amazonian attitude flourishing her fists with hornpipe step she advanced against her adversary who stood in beargarden position with horrid grin as satan encountered the seraph abdiel  the ladys locks unfilleted fell down her back dangling like the dropping tresses of a sign painted mermaid  he bareskulled bruiser like  and now the belligerant pair advanced within fingers reach of each other  oh for that warning voice  but what signifies wishing for it that churchills a very illnatured monopolist and will not part with a note of it  come then thou stimulator and inspirer of all prosaic scribblers who like me jumble words together unmusical unmeaning inaccurate inelegant and indifferent spirit of ribaldry assist me to sing or to relate  how nancy seized ned by the collar with one hand and with the other drew from the top of his forehead four perpendicular lines along his face  blood following every scratch  but as she passed her fingers down two of them were caught between his teeth she shrieked he bit his fist fell furious on her face his other hand seized her hair and with head bent back and swelled out throat down on the floor she fell pulling ned upon her and by the fall her fingers were released  but as it often happens in states that those who are in shall be out and those who are out shall be in the nose of mr edward pitched between the upper and lower rows of ivory which adorned miss nancys mouth quick as a sharks snap she fixed them in the gristle ned roared like a whipped schoolboy she pinned him fast  she   enter in a violent hurry the waiter to mr zaphaniel and his company waiter gentlemen there is somebodys footman below axing after an author  down stairs hurried the editor   footman sir you must come to our house this moment  great people are to be obeyed implicitly not a reply to be uttered  because passive obedience is elected footstoolmaker to lady fashion   away i went along with the servant running trotting walking panting and almost breathless arrived at the palace of my patron  the footman informed his honor that the man who made books was below  very well let him wait  so i did about three hours and then had the happiness of a command to attend there next morning delivered from the most respectable personage himself who condescended to give me that order viva voce as i stood bowing at his chariot door before he pulled the glass up  this postponing or delay in my affair with my patron arose not from his haughtiness  or any other supercilious practice with which geniuses are generally treated when put into trammels by their superiors  my benefactor my maecenas my magnus apollo had too much regard for the arts and sciences to use me or any other professor in so contemptuous a manner  but the reason i had not an immediate audience was  an artist from siberia having met with the celebrated tooth and pinion scheme of mr jonathan swift for making verses mechanically improved upon the hint and constructed an engine for the universal erudition of mankind respecting arts and sciences  this piece of mechanism being just imported was brought to my patron for his countenance and inspection just after the footman came for me he saw at once its most amazing utility and cried out bravo before one wheel went about  the rudiments of learning the judgment of scientific taste the excellence of all genius the mystery art plan design projection section elevation and estimate of all professions callings and occupations without the gift of invention the labor of study or the benefit of a fine understanding this machine explained and taught instantly by the new discovered principle of intuition and in half an hours time the purchaser became an universal master of arts as easily as pretty miss plays tunes on a hand organ  it was very dear and therefore no persons but people of fashion being able to become purchasers it kept the knowledge of every thing confined to the polite part of the world and as every thing is to be estimated by its worth and as the worth of every thing is only what it will sell for at market and as no body but rich people can afford to buy every thing and as every thing a man buys is his own therefore only people of estate family title or pension can be said to be possessed of the arts and sciences which they purchased in the manner above related by this engine  the name of it is technicatholicautomato pan toppidon  the fabricator met with that encouragement it behooves the rich to afford the ingenious  the truly delicate made a point of encouraging so extraordinary an artist especially as he was not of this nations growth but imported  persons of breeding observed their children threw away a horrid deal of time at school and as they could judge by themselves that they were very little the better for it nothing could therefore be so immensely convenient or indeed so elegant a piece of furniture as a clockwork schoolmaster that would teach grown people of fashion to be persons of reading and taste while their hair was dressing one objection was made to the engine which was that it could not be so proper a thing to vent ones spleen on as a living creature because it is the ultimate of taste among the very best bred to behave rudely to those ingenious who have only their own merit to recommend them more especially if the artist should by the misconduct of parents and cruel decree of providence be born in england  for the truth of this and other as horrid particulars i appeal to the behavior of   0 of all the connoisseurs who keep coaches  as to what any person else is pleased to prate about it is not to the purpose because no man has a right to speak in company unless he is qualified by much money or sanctified by court interest then he may express his contempt for his own countrymen with proper consequence  sir minikin pinfly at the opera last week was observing to lady fidgill her ladyship having informed the baronet that the great premium was given to the gentleman who had found out the art of preventing black lead combs from being brittle in an affair of so much consequence to the nation in general as black lead combs he thought that the contriver could not be too much encouraged especially if he was a foreigner because i do assure your ladyship that english artists are generally immensely impertinent  lady fidgill frightfully so pon onner sir minikin and then they are vastly ungenteel and such slovens   sir minikin detestable my lady  to be sure i dont trouble my head about pictures or statures or books but a gentleman must have such things for furniture and if i send to any of these artists to do a job belonging to those things if he is a foreigner the dear creature is so delicate so submissive and such vast good company  i vow i dote upon them but if you send for any of the english brutes of geniuses why truly they are so saucy they will not dine but at what table they please and are so impudent as to pretend to offer to give their opinions to one of us as if such common bred creatures could know things so well as we do   lady fidgill they are hideous creatures and i cannot bear to see a genius without it is at sadlers wells and to be sure there they are very well upon the wire or tumbling or dancing hornpipes but for your paintingengraving people  or your housebuildingarchitects or mathem  i detest such horrid barbarous names but indeed the whole crew of creatures who know one nonsense or another about the arts and sciences are only mob  positive mob  i am sure on it specially those born this side berwick  they even have the effrontery with their stuff about understanding and learning and fancy and wit and humor to conceit their senses are as good as ours who are persons of distinction and scorn to be beholden to any such low bred mechanical acquirings as they value themselves upon   an interview between author and patron next morning being introduced to my most respectable lord submissively i made my obeisance in low bows according to the eastern worship as soon as the door of his apartment unfolded for me to appear before him  he beckoned me to advance i did bending at every step and as i approached the carpet where his armed chair was placed in which he reclined i was awed i considered myself in the time of the roman mythology entering into the inner temple where the tutelar deity was enshrined  the good the great the wonderful man all affability in his smile all condescension in his gesture was thus most graciously pleased to announce his will unto me one of his unworthy dependants  n b as his honor spoke to me he was putting a piece of brass wire into a guineapigs ear on account of some philosophical experiment i suppose  connoisseur your wife mr trip is a vast intelligent being and one for whom i have an immense regard   i bowed  indeed i bowed at every word i had conferred upon me for by the observations i have been empowered to make in the politest grandest assemblies of my superiors i have noted a bow and a smile and a curtsy and a simper are the general answers and explications to almost every address  my patron having set down the guineapig pulled out his earpicker and as he used it thus delivered himself  you are going mr trip to enjoy a happiness which very few geniuses ever enjoyed or is it fit they should you will be provided for according to your merit by having a place but it must be accepted on certain conditions  author may it please your generosity  you may be certain of my coming into any conditions i hope you will find i possess as proper a ductility of mind as any other writer your mightiness has been pleased to make pensionary   connoisseur your speak sir as every man of sense ought to speak by men of sense i dont mean those wretches who pretend to be clever without having shoes to their feet or dare to arraign the conduct of their betters yet have not as much earth of their own as will serve to bury them they mr trip should be punished they shall starve for their contumacy but be you conformable you shall find your account in it you are a man of sense your understanding i dont doubt is clear ripe and strong that is clear enough to distinguish what is for your own interest ripe enough to be ready for any thing and strong enough not to be biased by any of those beggarmaking bubbles of public spirit love gratitude friendship freedom those and other such like terms mr trip are only tubs tossed out for the whale and which the hydra mob call the harmonies and sympathies of the soul  next you are to take care that in your future writings you rail against the liberty of printing call it the licentiousness of the press  you are also to endeavor to inculcate the doctrine of nonresistance and to argue strenuously for the eligibility of arbitrary power  lastly you must give up all your friends relations and acquaintance to me mr trip   author your honor may be assured that not one of your honors writers can give up more for your service than i will or do more any how because thank god providence has blessed me with as copious a talent for abuse as for panegyric i know may it please your honor and with all respect to your universal scientific conceptions  i know as well how to vilify as to compose a dedication and if my play    connoisseur tomorrow mr trip you shall go under instructions for a foot walk in the excise for no genius shall be unrewarded by me such i mean who are modest and know themselves but as you will now be settled for life  you must relinquish all acquaintance with what are called cleverfellows they are dangerous companions rebellious reipublican spirits who have the insolence not only to think about us but even are profane enough to give their opinions concerning how things are and how things should be however you have a better way of thinking and therefore keep company only with those who have nothing to do and as little to say and taste the benefits of that tranquil indifference which hardly any but those who have their fortunes made for them are ever acquainted with   i bowed to the ground i bowed and hastened home happy to think i should soon be able to lead an uniform steady and obedient life go to bed get up dine sup and so forth always in one way at such and such stated hours and never make any attempts at wit or humor or concern myself with the merits and distresses for the future of my fellow creatures because i should arrive soon at that glorious state of insipidity and dissipation in which i had often seen many of what are called the gay part of the world indulge themselves  being thus provided for by his excellency i humbly take my leave of the public sorry i could not finish this work but more sorry for some other of my works wherein i have endeavored to be witty and comical for which i most submissively beg pardon of all gentlefolks in general from the highest of the betitled unto the lowest of their doorkeepers and promise for the future to be as dull as the best of them  yet well as i can to expiate in some measure for former offenses i propose a scheme to prevent authors attempting either humor or wit in what they write for the future viz  as some part of the army is to be disbanded if those persons who in the camp are the hangmen of the army and called the provost guard and if the most active of the drummers who have had the most practice in whipping during the late war were not to be sent adrift but incorporated in the regiment of reforming constables this scheme with the other common methods of turn out and starve scoundrel what is your wife and ten children to me would preserve the police of this kingdom for the future in proper subordination and writers on the wrong side of the question be taught respect  farewell n b the proprietors of the copy of this history having been at a great expense for plates and authors hope the town will encourage the assiduity with which they have labored to find out a person capable of finishing this work because by the first editors preferment this dramatic performance  a work so very essential toward bettering the understanding of every reader whose penetration can unaenigmatise the foregoing pages must have been postponed sine die the loss which that would have been to the public can never be estimated    an account of the continuation of this work an errandboy belonging to the printer vulgarly and irreligiously called a devil hearing that for want of an author no more copy could be obtained to complete this volume told his master he knew a gentleman who lodged in his mothers back garret the author and devil being bedfellows who the boy said he was sure would finish it because he had often heard the gentleman say that as far as a pen and ink could go he would undertake any thing  the devil being agent for both parties a bargain was immediately struck between publisher and author whose name is cannon commonly called captain cannon on account of his inventive faculty or allegorical manner in which he was will not to express himself  this person appeared to be one of the extraordinaries of the times by his argumentatives against the late orator henley  in those altercations the loquacity of cannon was so conspicuous he became a favorite among all the people of exquisite taste particularly a mountebank doctor who admired the lad for the facility of his physical and metaphysical replies and determined even without the least interest being made in the young fellows behalf strange as it may seem to encourage so promising a genius therefore constituted him immediately his merry andrew  a widow lady whose spouse had suffered the severity of the law because he endeavored upon a belligerant principle to investigate the universal axiom get money fell in love with the merry andrew for eating fire and tow she was then in equipage by a very famous ministerial writer therefore the lady had power to recommend or introduce cannon to her friend who made him his amanuensis  under this master he became proficient in politics and was properly initiated in the grand mystery of mysteries or the true art of preferment writing viz to deify the ins and make devils of the outs  the methods he made use of in his pickleherring capacity were of infinite service to him in his political one he was also a very good posturemaster and that brought him into great esteem among his superiors and he had hints that he should be encouraged equal to the most celebrated of the retained writers  he grew noted among the notified he was supposed to have great interest with some people it was whispered about he was in the secret therefore when in company he abstracted himself accordingly  he began to consider himself and reflect that such a writer as he was and engaged in such connections was liable to meet with a sudden change of circumstances either for the better or worse according to the weight balance or prejudice of party  upon a chariot and the pillory he daily meditated as they were both particular exaltations and what he knew had been bestowed upon different persons very often for the same action  conscious of his own importance he formed to himself a new system of behavior and assumed wore and bore an authorlike consequence  he had his shoes cleaned every day and wrote e s q r after his name the waiters at the coffeehouses made bows to him and the landlord at the shakespeare shook him by the hand he had the liberty of the scenes gave his opinion in the greenroom and told every body how many days in the week he dined with my lord  then he wore a sword and a snuff box began to pity poor writers hired a laced coat and looked about him  at last he condescended to tell the town himself that he was a man of wit and learning and folks pointed at him as he went along the streets saying that is he  he drew his pen for preferment and waged scurrilous warfare against all his betters who were out of favor he fought blushless through the field of faction he mangled the overthrown he despoiled the departed of their honors venality crowned his temples with a brazen frontlet and trampling over the fallen worthies she led him to the shrine of secret services where the oracle assured him protection and reward  at that time there were numbers to provide for who had been true servants of his honor and for whom when no more vacancies could be made new places must be contrived  this was the captains case he had the promise of being inspector general of the milk office within the bills of mortality to prevent so wholesome a commodity from adulteration  the author of this salutary scheme was an arabian who came over here in olivers time to get a patent for it because foreigners always are more studious for our good and study more for the benefit of this nation than the english can do or indeed dare do for themselves  but the arabian was discovered to be in the tartar interest because he endeavored to substitute mares milk instead of cows to make us brew all our porter from oatmeal and pretended to prove horseflesh more wholesome than roast beef  this project was thrown aside for several years until particular contingencies occasioned it to be revived as above mentioned and all the proper attendants appointed viz     tasters who were to be the sons of freeholders   clerks these were obliged to be housekeepers   porters these were obliged to be housekeepers a gauger these were obliged to be housekeepers a secretary these were obliged to be housekeepers a deputy these were obliged to be housekeepers the inspector general he was allowed to be any thing with him was joined a company of assistants  composed of two apothecaries two dairywomen two experimental philosophers one buttermelter two spectaclemakers two physicians two wetnurses a clysterpipe borer a metaphysician and the curds and wheykeeper   the multiplicity of friends which somebody or somebody else had to oblige procrastinated the institution which made cannon about the year      relinquish all his inspectorial hopes and be contented with the head labor of an author mantaining himself by the sweat of his brow as poets or prose people should do  during the winter season he picks up a pretty living with several more such subaltern genii by putting together magazines and memorandum books penning murders making rebuses and singing songs for both parties and writing in newspapers against the players  yet i must do those prose writers the justice to declare that they would not do so if they could help it  they acknowledge it is wrong to prejudice the town against any performer because his bread may be lost by it  what then  they had rather all the world should starve than themselves and starve they must if their works did not go off and they can only send abuse to market well knowing scurrility is always saleable depraved appetites delight in things uncleanly and some virtuosi make collections of snakes toads spiders monsters deformities dark lanthorns and poisoned arrows  in the summer months these writers retreat into the country mantain themselves very decently and indeed reputably by making hay and harvest work  n b the publisher thus far has taken the liberty to premise in behalf of the second undertaker of this performance who now begs to be indulged in a word or two from himself  cannon to the reader it is with reluctance that i agreed to finish the memoirs of this comedian because i am not in amity with any theatrical professors  having met with severe usage from the superiors of that fraternity  at the age of    i did a tragedy not acted it i mean for i was always above being a player but wrote one which had not the least bankruptcy among the unities and therefore i assured myself i must have great credit for my manufactory  as to making interest to have my tragedy recommended though i was told it was the only way to go to work yet being bigoted too much to the excellence of my piece i despised such advice and was assured within my own mind that it would be put into rehearsal by the manager upon his first reading it  but multa cadunt etc  however by using the same chandlersshop i got acquainted with a young lady whose sister was dresser to a very celebrated actress  she invited me to drink tea with her sister the dresser to whom i read my play who approved of it mightily because as she observed there was not much dressing in it  i had the honor of being introduced to the lady her mistress who received me with pecular deportment which as gil blas observes most of the ladies theatrical put on to strangers especially if the visitors are foot people  she stared at me when i came into her room so much that i was prodigiously out of countenance a fault of which even detraction will deny i am often guilty  but recollecting it is the common look which ladies bear both on and off the stage when they condescended to see their inferiors i began to come to myself  after i had been surveyed as much as she thought it consistent with her dignity to observe me she tinkled a silver handbell and on the maids entrance the lady in a most delicate accent ordered her servant to take the footstool which the actress was then resting one foot upon  carry it there thus the lady pointing to the corner of the room ordered put my footstool there that the man pointing to me may set upon it and read his play to me and bring my eaudeluce and my ether bottle  then in the most engaging attitude she reclined herself upon the couch on which she had before been seated and looked like one of those fine figures at the print shops of venus or a madona or some singing or dancing lady in a repose and those graving and etchings are done by some great man or after some great mans manner as we are told in the catalogues by auctioneers and picturedealers who have such universal capacities it is impossible for them to be mistaken  they are the loadstones of connoisseurship the only judges of genius counselors of taste determiners of merit interpreters of science and leadingstrings baits bits curbs spurs whips wheels levers pullies and primum mobiles for every lady and gentleman of fortune who choose to be trammelld into taste and be ambled about as connoisseurs hobbyhorses  before i had read a page of my play the lady interrupted me finding great fault with my tones with my emphasis and my accents  swinging herself off the couch she arose with a graceful dignity becoming a penelope the gold fringe of her slippers playing to her feet her silk train sweeping along the carpet then flourishing her white handkerchief the lady spoke three or four speeches of calista to show me how people ought to deliver tragedy after that when she had again seated herself as she looked into the lid of her patchbox she enquired if i had seen her play all her characters and which i liked her best in  my reply was for i had a hint given me not to be sparing of compliments that where every one was excellent it was impossible to perceive an inferiority  she smiled with the utmost complacency upon me she took my mss promised me it should be done and suffered me kneeling to salute the back of her hand as i took my leave but meeting at the door a person very richly dressed i was ordered to walk in again  this visitor to the lady was in a velvet coat embroidered a gold tissue waistcoat embroidered and every other part of his apparel equally rich i took particular notice of his watch chain it was remarkably long and as remarkably filled for i counted no less than ten various seals and toys in different shapes upon it  the gentleman was a very eminent haberdasher and a great friend of the ladys as i heard afterward he stared at me also full as much as i had been stared at before  then turning to the gentlewoman he asked her in very ill pronounced french who the devil i was  she replied an author  i thought so he replied still in french and swore a great oath at the same time  i thought he was a shabby genius of some sort or another  but now my angel well have some fun with this fellow i haant roasted a scribbler a great while for damn me if these authors not one in a hundred of um have any thing to say to a gentleman as they should do because they are blockheads and ought to be caned kicked or dragged through a horsepond for what business have they to think about their betters  i would not discover to him or the lady that what they said in french was understood by me but allowed him to the length of his tether without interruption and he accordingly assumed all that contemptuous behavior that unworthy insolence which the wearers of fine clothes conceit they have a power to

he knows too much of the world for that and i keep company at the bedford so often with the best writers in england  that sure my dear i must know how to behave to authors well sir and so at leyden you say  i suppose you studied the oriental sciences there   author the oriental languages sir   gent haberdasher no sir i mean the oriental sciences  i believe i am too much acquainted with both sciences and languages to mistake one for the other the oriental arts and sciences i mean as to the oriental languages i red um all and every one from the teutonick down to old homers iliad odyssey and his telemachus   lady pon my honor caddy you must have had a vast education my dear to read so much and remember things so   gent haberdasher faith i never red much po my onner  i was rather a buck at school  but i had a quicker way of study i believe than any other fellow ever had in the world  but a  mr author  and so  dont you never write no songs   author sometimes sir   gent haberdasher o then well have a song come sir sing one to the lady   author indeed sir i cannot sing  i cannot indeed sir   gent haberdasher nay sir but i insist on it to oblige the lady  to whom he then said in french i know the fellow cannot sing cause i have heard him attempt it among comus court but that is the fun on it well make him expose himself   lady  replied in french for gods sake my dear merchant dont ask him i shall die with his noise i am expiring with the headache already  he sing i am certain poor devil he looks so down in the mouth that he could only hymn the hundred psalm or a hanging stave for a tyburn penitent on an executionday   gent haberdasher in french still bravo bravissimo my angel  you have more wit than all the world  then bid him tell us a merry story or desire he will say something clever oh damn it that does for these genuisses at once   lady in ditto he looks so disconsolate he shocks me    gent haberdasher ditto repeated well now you shall have a drole scene my   then in english and so sir i suppose you live by writing   author i endeavor to maintain myself and family sir by every exertion of my small capacity that honesty and industry will warrant   gent haberdasher and pray sir what can you get a year by writing   author as to that sir    gent haberdasher ay as to that sir  oh mum a word to the wise is enough  you are not willing to confess because you are afraid i should want to borrow a hundred of you  why sir my credits pretty good and if you was to lend me a cool thousand i would give you   per cent and an eighth for it i suppose sir you are too conversant with the stocks to be ignorant what that is a year   lady lord my dear    gent haberdasher in french encore nay my angel let me alone for upon my soul if gentlemen were not now and then thus to mortify these fellows and make them ashamed of themselves for not having money there would be no bearing them i have a great mind to show him an eighteen shilling piece and a guinea and ax him what is the difference i will hold six to four he dont guess the first time   lady let me perish then but you will be immensely wrong and barbarously absurd you see he turns pale and red every minute i am sure he is hurt enough already   gent haberdasaer well mum then i suppose sir in your play you have been critically exact in the preservation of the unities and you have seen what aristotle and bossu says upon that subject for that is what i blame shakespeare for the fellow had a fine knack at metaphor faith but he never understood the unities now if he had but have been a scholar and could have read what aristotle and bossu says   author aristotle to the best of my remembrance says    gent haberdasher ay i know as well as you do what  but that is nothing now to the purpose what either aristotle or his brother the stagyrite says  i speak how things should be done dam it there is nobody but gentlemen that can either write or judge for that matter i wish it was not quite so damned scandalous to be either an author or a scholar there are about twelve of us that would and could restore the drama to that original purity which the divine plato the preceptor of socrates and plautus says the stage ought to be preserved in   author under favor sir i did not think plato was much attached to dramatic poetry any more than he was to homer whom i cannot think he uses so well   gent haberdasher what does not plato use homer well  that is false mr author you must allow me to tell you  i beg pardon but i know better  why plato is the best friend homer ever had   author but i mean sir that plato who was disciple to socrates   gent haberdasher pho pho mr author we ant to be hummd so neither youre devilishly out there never was but one plato and he taught socrates all he knowd and if you have a mind for a bett you shall have your sum on it this plato my dear betsy was cotempre with the first primitive fathers   lady pray my dear were they poets or playwriters   gent haberdasher no my dear they were what was called the christian philosophers in opposition to the heathen philosophers and this socrates we have been talking of he was burned for his religion because he turned christian   lady let me perish my dear if your memory is not astonishing i shall be jealous by and by that you have so much learning in your head it must prevent you from thinking of me   gent haberdasher never by all that is soft i swear upon which be kissed the lady and turned to me with a look of happy consequence as much as to tell me what would you give could you do so  i suppose mr author that you must have heard of sophocles and empedocles   author yes sir   gent haberdasher i red all their works at college both their tragedies and comedies and though i never looked into um since i only wish i had a hundred on it that i couldnt say um all by heart without missing an apostrophe and so i suppose you have heard of terence and euripides and lucans true history swift stole every line of gulliver from him to my knowledge   lady well this conversation is to me immensely agreeable and dear caddy you are the most surprising creature   gent haberdasher my souls affection i do believe nay without vanity i am sure on it that if i had a mind to it i could have made a greater figure as a scholar or a writer than any on um but i was always above such slovenly pedantic notions authors are very well when a man has a mind to make a lady a present of a song or an acrosic why then such fellows are useful because they take the trouble of composing these things off of a gentlemans hands and books now and then of a rainy day are well enough but at other times they are damned low dull stuff  but i beg pardon mr author for talking french so   author oh sir a gentleman has a right to converse in what language he pleases   gent haberdasher that is true sir and therefore you and i now will have a little latin together  you remember horace his advice about discipline qui mihi discipulus puer es cupis atque doceri   author sir i beg to be excused but that is not in horace   gent haberdasher not horace  that is a fine hum indeed not horace what the devil sure i know horace a little better than you i thought i should find you out  why does not he go on and say  hoc ades huc amino concupedictis tuo up then he started looked in the peer glass and stroked his eyebrows gently  the lady at that instant standing with her back to him told me  sir this gentleman is a prodigious scholar and you must submit to him in these things i assure you but i could see that she winked at me while she said this i would have taken the hint but flesh and blood could not bear to give up horoce to qui mihi emboldened by the ladys signal i told him that perhaps as gentlemen were not obliged to read so much as authors were his memory might not be   gent haberdasher o dam it sir as to that i have a better memory than any man in england and those two lines i spoke are horaces and i will bet you  0 l on it and out he pulled a green purse seemingly full of money which in his eagerness he let fall upon the teatable and broke a cup and saucer belonging to a set of french china that had been presented to the lady by a former lover and which set she told the gentleman she would not have had destroyed for  00 pounds   a strange scene of altercation ensued reproaches rose high between them  until the gallant swore several of the most horrid oaths profaneness could put together that he never would speak to her again and hurried out of the room bouncing the door after him as violently as if like sampson he would shake the house down about us  after the passionate departure of her friend the lady addressed herself to me  but in a manner different from that she received me with  affectation was away  the haughtiness of the actress was banished and only the fine woman of affability appeared  desiring me to sit down with a look that spoke the most delicate sensibility the lady told me  i believe sir i am not the only person in this room whom the hotheaded man that has just left it made uneasy this morning for if i guess right your face told me you understood every thing he said to me in french about you  author indeed madam i understood every syllable   lady i thought so by heavens i thought so i admire your behavior sir and will endeavor to recompense you for the pain of mind i am conscious you must have endured too much i feel of that myself what are all diamonds equipage fine furniture and elegance of dress when the mind retreating into itself shrinks back ashamed to reflect on the means by which those are purchased yet i must act the hypocrite i must conform  conform to those i hate nay worse  bear with rich stupidity applaud with seeming attention arrogant dullness and flatter even fondly flatter indelicate folly sure of all slavery mine is the worst where the will is not left free what is    thus she gave vent to her reflections as she walked up and down the room tears following one another down the damask of her cheeks transparent as dew drops upon the rose leaf  at that moment her lover the gentleman haberdasher returned and discovering her crying run to her took her in his arms forced her to the settee and kneeling down before her begged her to forgive him desiring her to accept of a ring he held out to her and vowing that had he known his leaving her so abruptly would have so deeply affected her he would not have done it for all the world  the ladys face at this time seemed agitated with astonishment and disdain by turns but i had not an opportunity any longer to observe it her friend addressing me that instant with you will excuse us this morning mr writer i shall be glad to see you some other time  exit cannon the dedicatory specimen assured of my play being presented i sought some time for a proper person to dedicate it to one from whom i could expect the greatest advantages one who could do me great service if i did but properly apply myself and blazon forth his merits to the world  i had a sufficient quantity of matter by me which i had abstracted from the greek roman and french panegyricks and also from the works of most of our best writers upon religion from whom i had borrowed the choicest phrases which they made use of in their addresses to the divinity all these things i had ready marshalled to appear in rank and file before the public in behalf of my patron as soon as i could find one  being for some time troubled with bad eyes because the room where i write lay and cook my victuals smokes terribly and as i dread blindness more than any other distemper i gave up all thoughts of baiting my works with great mens defense and turn pension or place fisher  i considered my natural defects ought to be first remedied therefore to the occulist chevalier tailor senior i addressed the following dedication  to the prime genius of this age professor of the art of teaching the passions and unparallelled adventurer sir the performance i here offer to the public under the sanction of your name is an extraordinary work and therefore should be addressed to an extraordinary man  you have distinguished yourself as such through the whole course of an unblameable life  a friend to the ladies you have been as your works confess but your love of them has arisen from your being able to taste their genuine beauties  no countryman of yours or of any other great man can i be  i was born at sea  national flattery therefore am i free from  i only do scanty justice to the man not only as a man but also a minister or administrator of the greatest of blessings and which concludes the happiness of a whole people  you have opened the eyes of all the world taught both sexes to look about them placed them perspectively in a proper point of sight to see and also to be seen  though some persons may blame you  as blackguards will be abusive  dont mind the mob now  a hundred years hence you will be out of the hearing on it  then you will have and a fine satisfaction it is to be told on it what no popularity can give  no temporary wants destroy  you will then have every thing in the world a dedicator can bestow upon you for who the devil dare contradict him  the day you was born if eyer that day was was the brightest period of british glory  the doubt i have of your birth arises from my supposing you to be the unborn doctor one who sprung spontaneous among us  to be  ay or not to be just what himself and the conscious rectitude of a right mind pleases  in the political science of perspective  the point of sight point of distance and vanishing line properly investigated are as follows  the point of sight is preferment  the point of distance is what length your patron will go to serve you  the vanishing line is hope  all these multiplied in a proper modus form  mr hogarths line of beauty  and that praise in all its parts as well as in the whole for the honor of every country is almost exclusively your own  therefore to the importance of your mightiness prostrate at the threshold of your munificence do i asiatically bow my head hallelujahing your honor and honors and may your scientific brow nod benignly on the insignificancy of your most humble and most submissive servant and slave the author  first chapter of the continuation of the history of neddy etc how master edward was to be brought up the morning following the gossipping scene david and his lady at breakfast consulted together upon the most proper methods for educating their son and heir  david to be sure and indeed my dear wife i do suppose you will suckle the child yourself   mrs llwhuddwhydd you do then my dear you are guilty of a very indelicate supposition are ladies of fashion to turn wetnurses and have their heads horridly distracted by the noise of the nursery or vapoured to death with cradlerockings is it taste  i ask you my dear upon your honor is it taste for me who come of such a family as i am come from to have a child dangling at my breast as beggars carry their brats nay is it for your honor your wife should appear so you who come of so good a family   david yes thank god and good providence i do come of the most ancientest family that ever was born   mrs llwhuddwhydd there my dear you must be wrong immensely wrong upon my honor  your family may be the more ancienter in england but my family is from america we were the ancestors of five original nations of the senekas from whom came the chikasas from whom came the catawaws from whom came the cherokees   david but i tell you my family is the most ancientest in the world ay and in america to boot for they did go into the ark as gamekeepers to squire noah and his worships son did marry queen winifred and from whom came the cadwalladers and from whom came the tudors and from whom came the llwhuyddwhuydds   she ay and from my family came the cherokee and the   both together rikketis and the mohawks and the tomahawks   he and from mine the ap morgaus ap jenkins ap rice ap jones ap    then they raised their voices at the same time louder and louder until out of breath and black in the face they stood speechless staring at one another like a pair of pitted turkeycocks  the lady first recovered and giving her husband a look blended with scorn and reproach that look which fine women know so well how to wear beating a tatoo with her feet and hitting the teaspoon upon the edge of a saucer thus she addressed him  i am sorry sir that i should so far forget myself as to contend with you about families upon my honor i shall for the future take care how i ever enter into any such arguments with you and immediately fell into a violent fit of the sullens  had i but time to analyze that distemper and point out the methods of cure how happy should i make many husbands but a more interesting scene presents itself viz  david kneeling at his wifes feet most pathetically begging her to be good to him to speak to him to look at him or let him take hold of her hand  but all his address was vain  vain as the petition distress presents vain as the hopes of wit or pretensions of undowerd beauty and virtue  mr llwhuddwhuydd was forced before the preliminaries could be signed to give up upon his knees every original branch of his family and allow both lineally and collaterally the superiority of his ladys ancestry  mrs llwhuddwhuydd i beg my dear husband now you will rise  i choose it  there is my hand i offer it to you as a token i dont take any thing ill  i forget and forgive it is taste to do so and i will suffer death before i would be impolite but pray husband how will you have our child brought up   david he shall be put to school as soon as he goes into breeches and he shall be kept at learning latin and greek for    or    years to be sure because i will have him a great scholar and then i will bind him prentice    mrs llwhuddwhuydd no excuse me  he may be a scholar indeed i am not against that because perhaps one day or another such a thing may be taste but i renounce his being prentice there is something so vulgar in it  no let him go into the army i am certain that as you have carried such a number of people of fashion for so many years and as they are under great obligations to you for the care you have always took of them they would not deny you such a small favor as to give your son a commission   david but for all that my dear i would have him a scholar ay he shall be a genius too   mrs llwhyddwhuydd dear mr llwhyddwhuydd i shall faint at the very name of a genius  my god a genius  what shall my eldest son the hopes of two such families as ours be made a genius why at best a genius can but be a jack of all trades and as to his making his fortune by genius why you may as well say the sun shines at midnight is not every genius despised by the politest people do not the persons of quality call creatures so out of contempt my god did you ever know any body of fashion a genius  no mr llwhuddwhuydd instead of bringing your son up a genius let him be a gentleman let him keep gentlemen company not but i must say if his genius could turn to politics    david and please god so it shall i will bind him prentice to a politician and when he is out of his time he can set up for himself and provide for his relations  enter miss shred and doctor nostrum miss shred dear creatures excuse me coming in so suddenly  but i promised you know last night to bring a great physician and my friend to prevent your son mr david ever feeling any pain or being in any danger while he was cutting his teeth  give me leave therefore to introduce the only man in the world that has any sort of skill to you  he knows more than the whole college of doctors put together and they envied him  so they woudn give him his degrees without his undergoing an examination  but he was above that therefore he went down to edinburgh  there they knew better  he had his certificate signed at once and now he practices here in spite of all the london doctors  and what is very wonderful he took physic entirely out of his own head for he never was brought up to it   david no   doctor no sir i discovered it all myself  i scorned to be taught i despise all the fellows of the faculty they are ignorant pretenders i have a genius above them all   david ay ay that is the thing  a genius  for a genius is above all learning look you as much as god is above the devil bless us   doctor ladies let me beg your attention while i plainly demonstrate to you the nature of childrens teethcutting  hyppocrates and celsus declare infants are subject to the aphthae phoboi diarrhaeas and paroxysms upon cutting their canine teeth hernius tells us of inflammatory tonsils tumors of the parotid glands or saturiasmoi which may be i think the achor  now aetius says    david never mind what mr aetius says sir no more than an cracked chairpole for you do say such fine things yourself about hyppocrates that i would give all i was worth in the world if i could but talk so learnedly   doctor this ladys  pulling a phial out of his pocket this is the magnetica tinctura sacra the loadstone elixir or anodyne specific with this if you wash the infants feet it will attract all the morbid foul and peccant humors from the childs head and your son shall cut his teeth as easily  as  as    david ay it stands to reason as easy as i can cut an onion  it must  i have read about loadstones  and my magazines do tell me about sir isaac newtons attraction yes yes well god help me i have studied and studied a great deal yet never can be a great man because doctor i have not a genius   which observation we beg the reader will memento and endeavor to become a genius it is a sure and certain estate to him as for example this doctor nostrum to whom and the rest of the nostrumists who without understanding or experience education or capacity so publicly advertise and vend their unwholesome compositions to the detriment of the credulous multitude and reproach of those who have power to prevent such scandalous impostors  finis
