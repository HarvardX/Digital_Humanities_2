brightest ornaments appear an ancient hive of aristaean bees with pleasure swarmed among the fragrant trees long did their labors over the land diffuse aerial honey and ambrosial dews collected from the meads and rosy bowers and morning sweets that tip the gaudy flowers of their gay pride despoiling every plain to feed with heavenly juice the humble swain and load with labored sweets the flowing land again safe was their hive from all oppressive harms no dreams of danger discomposed their swarms but famed for peace and order they were known true bees due homage to superiors own this was their state when busy moths arose and wasps insidious equally their foes hornets and drones and all the humming tribe whom hate could summon or whom interest bribe gnats beetles locusts all the worthless kind of hateful insects in the riot joined buzzing false dangers and distracting fears in new confusions now the hive appears customs unknown to ages heretofore corrupt the breed the virgin race deflowr so when false teachers in the church arise schism prevails and true religion dies faith takes her flight unable to sustain the mighty shock reason persuades in vain till heavenly energy our breast inspires with sacred sense of true etherial fires then the dark clouds of error fly apace and revelation reassumes her place now the warm foe their io paeans sing in every vale loud peals of conquest ring the painted butterfly with empty sound proclaimed the gaudy triumph all around every vile insect to the hive repairs foments the tumult and the plunder shares sated with spoil with

forsook in vain the victims on their altars smoke in vain the fragrant gums in spheres ascend thunhallowd incense did but more offend then highflown priests their new distinctions brought and faction for religion first was taught then piety and ancient faith decayed and synodmen the churches right betrayed then vice and virtue were in schools defined as the declaiming stagyrite inclined but truth

and for the church such flaming love confess shall in vile terms of their superiors speak slight their authority their orders break in open disobedience live and rail and hope by innovations to prevail with intermediate sessions why confound the churches peace the convocation wound by rights usurped why presbyters prepare their primates power without consent to share and fill without his

much the churches welfare she revered such true diffusive charity reveals what sense of goodness in her soul she feels a charity which in its nature shows heaven for its birthplace where it first arose from whence descending to her royal breast the radiant virtue kindred flames confessed and owned the bright abode worthy the godlike guest for me the first desire which does control the secret springs which move my rising soul is that her glorious reign i might rehearse in equal numbers and distinguished verse but far o far above the poets flame is her bright story and immortal name could i

annas glory be my endless theme but whether does the ravished muse aspire not phoebus boasts a more exalted fire or touches with more art the sweetly sounding lyre in vain our monarch labors to engage with all her clemency these men of rage who their defect of duty would supply by wrangling for their independency who without precedent insist to use forms of their own and their own methods choose
