  the voyages travels and adventures of william owen gwin vaughan esquire with the history of his brother jonathan vaughan six years a slave in tunis intermixed with the histories of clerimont maria eleanora and others full of various turns of fortune volume the second  london printed for j watts and sold by j osborn at the goldenball in paternoster row mdccxxxvi  the voyages travels and memoirs of william owen gwin vaughan esquire we arrived at calais after a pleasant passage of six hours and took up our lodging at the tableroyal where we were detained four days with the false report of the death of the french king lewis xiv for the governor kept the gates shut and would not permit any foreigners to go out of the city calis or calais is a very strong town in the province of picardy though i think not strong enough to be called as it is one of the keys of france it is as near as i could guess a little bigger than dover but more populous it would i believe be a very poor place if it were not for the resort of foreigners and a frenchman told me that when they were at war with england their white bread immediately turned to brown intimating their riches did not come from their own nation  the cause of my stay here gave me no small joy for a letter came to my hands from my dear isabella which was left at the post house of dover and brought me by the same captain i came over with to calais this proved a consolation to me in all my travels for whenever i was melancholy i had recourse to that the letter was as follows what shall i say i have not expressions enough to paint out my passion thy absence and the farther thou go from me increase my love and anxiety i look on the allseeing sun and bless his beams because it shines on thee i worship the winds as the indians do the devil for fear their rising should be prejudicial to thee and the number of em with their names almost equals the roman catholic saints yet i am obliged to revere em all in gross as they do my time is almost spent in reading the accounts of places where i suppose the disposer of my heart is to visit i have found the road to dover and dined with you in imagination though food is almost a stranger to me i saw your horses brought out and pursued the way with you to dover i saw the castle the pier and viewed the fatal vessel designed to waft from me all my peace of mind  i followed it as far as my poor eyes could see and waited on the beach sighing to the winds till you arrived at calais as fatal to me for my loss as the loss of that was to queen mary the sister to queen elizabeth who when she died told her attendants they might see calais written on her heart if death should end my days thy image would be found on mine to be a day without seeing the idol of my soul i have thought long but oh to be absent for three times three hundred and sixty five days nay perhaps for ever what heart like mine can bear the imagination but yet the day will come two tedious days of the time are gone already if heaven will be pleased to send you back i shall be grown by that time well versed in geography for that shall be now my only study and i shall think it some satisfaction in all my griefs to know the situation climate and constitution of those places my love intends to visit i could dwell on this melancholy subject for ever but must take leave of the dearest object to the disconsolate  isabella     when our embargo was taken off we took postchaises and arrived at paris in three days from whence in compliance to my uncle i sent him the following short account of my journey  my dear uncle after turning my back to my native country though my mind was still there we arrived safe at calais from thence after being detained four days by a false report of the kings death we made three hard days journies to paris from whence i shall send you this short description to let you see i intend to follow your precepts exactly paris the capital of france is situated upon an island in the river seine which gives name to a county called the isle of france though it is possible it may stand upon more ground than london yet i take the latter to be better inhabited than the former their public buildings far exceed ours in number and magnificence the louvre much surpasses that of st jamess or whitehall before it was consumed by fire as to their cathedral church of notredame i cannot make any comparison with that of st pauls till i see it finished but i think this a noble august building and the magnificence of the inside shows their religion to be well dressed and gives a luster i am not able to describe the archbishop of paris seems to be seated with more grandeur than an eastern king  here is plenty of wine but no good water that i could meet with in the chapel called the holy chapel which is a fine building i was showed part of the crown of thorns the jews in derison honored our savior with and two of the nails that fixed him to the cross but i must own my faith was not quite strong enough to believe it though i thought it prudent to keep my thoughts to myself the monasteries are so numerous here that one would imagine the laity were not the major part and most of the holy buildings are fit to be palaces for the greatest princes  the earth in one of their churchyards as i am told will consume the interred in eight days the reverend father raimond whom you commended me to has been dead more than four years but his brother who has taken orders since who was also one of your acquaintance has done me many services upon your account last night he took me to the jesuitscollege where a play was performed with the utmost magnificence and the number of the chorus dancers surprised me i counted fortyfour in one entry in short sir paris has many curious objects to delight the eye and captivate the senses i have sent you the book of the carrousels that were performed      when the double marriages of the king and his sister with the prince and infanta of spain were celebrated in the same place king henry ii in one of those tournaments was killed by a wound in the eye i am informed by monsieur coypel the ingraver the figure of every person is exactly like whom it is designed for i have also sent you the statue of lewis the thirteenth of the same composition in every degree that stands in the middle of the palaceroyal and in my judgment it wants nothing but bulk to be as fine as the original you will likewise find in the same parcel all the classics printed at the louvre though i was obliged to father raimond for your favorite terence the rest i procured of a bookseller tomorrow the good father is to introduce me to monsieur and madam dacier where i promise to myself much satisfaction if my want of years will not make em look coldly upon me i gave monsieur audran the present you sent him and in return he has sent you a set of his battles from le brun of the first impression which by the by uncle seemed as if you had sent as they say in wales applesauce to fetch a pig for they are hardly to be valued  after telling you the dirt of paris like an ill reputation is hard to be got off i shall conclude my little account of that city with telling you the monastery of val de grace is i think one of the finest buildings in paris which one of their poets has thought fit to commend in the following lines  urbs orbi similis toto celeberrima mundo musarum seeds regina lutetia salve francigenae tu metropolis pulcherrima gentis hospitio regum grato regisque ministros excipis and reliquas das jura suprema per urbes from paris i shall lead you to versailles a royal palace four french leagues west of this famous city i shall wave the description of the palace and bring you into the gardens which i suppose are finished since you were in france when you are entered the basin of syrene stands full in your way and after that twentytwo more fine fountains waterfalls and cascades that delight the eye with an exuberance of variety from these you pass into the labyrinth a place you cannot well get out of without a silver clue and yet it is the most delightful place to lose ones self in in the universe aesop stands on one side of the entrance and cupid on the other and the fables of aesop are represented in waterworks within the labyrinth that is    of them which you must take in order   the owl and other birds   the cock and partridges   the cock and fox   the cock and precious stone which i think ought to be the first as in aesop   the pendant cat with several rats   the eagle and fox   the jay and peacocks   the dunghillcock and turkeycock   the peacock and magpy  0 the serpent anvil and file    the old monkey and young ones    the battle of the beasts    the hen and chickens    the fox and crane    the crane outwitting the fox    the peacock and nightingale    the parrot and monkey    the monkey turned judge    the rat and frog  0 the hare and tortoise    the wolf and crane    the kite and other birds    the monkey crowned    the fox and stag    the rats in council    the monkey and young cat with the chestnuts    the fox and grapes    the eagle coney and beetle    the wolf and porcupine  0 the serpent with many heads    the cat and young cock    the kite and pigeons    the dolphin and monkey    the fox and crow    the monkey and crane    the wolf in the statuarys shop    the snake and porcupine    the ducks and spaniel and all these fables are as well expressed as if you saw em pencilld by the finest painter the sight i must own gave me a profusion of delight  nothing in the world can show the grandeur of the monarch more than this palace and gardens and the nobility to imitate their prince have built handsome palaces near versailles so that this place that was fifty years ago a barren spot is now become a great city i mean for the multiplicity of the buildings though every thing is excessive dear from the great concourse of nobility that surround their prince a french gentleman that had been in england told me he wondered the kings of england had not more magnificent palaces gardens and waterworks i replied we had finer waterworks than any they could boast of waterworks returned the frenchman where i replied in the city of london where every house had a sufficiency of water conveyed from the rivers by pipes he confessed indeed that was a very great work and was certainly of more use than theirs of versailles  when we returned to paris father raimond carried me to a little village called mont martire or mons martyrum where we dined at the abbey of nuns of the order of st bennet this hill and village took its name of mons martyrum from st denis the protector of france who was beheaded before the image of mercury in the pagans time and the good people will have it that the pious saint walked three mile with his head under his arm and then let it drop where since they have built a town after the saints name but i am apt to believe their heads that approve this story are no more a burden to their shoulders than the good saints was when he had it under his arm father raimond otherwise bigot enough to his religion seems to laugh at such traditional stories  the same afternoon we made a tour to the town of st denis where we viewed the cathedral which is very magnificent though the repository of their kings to me seemed the chiefest ornament the inhabitants tell you this church was never ill used either in the norman or english wars though most of the others in france where the english or normans came suffered much the abbot of this place has more power than many archbishops and owns no superior but the king being suffragan to no archbishop and though the monarchs of france are crowned at rhemes the regalia is kept at st dennis under the care of the abbot they also boast of more relics than any other place in the universe as the head of st denis put in a silver nightcap with fine oriental pearl round it a nail of our saviors cross the finger that st thomas put into our saviors side an arm of st simon the head of st bennet an englishman that was with me the same time we saw these rarities told me st bennet must be a very monstrous saint for he knew of one of his heads in italy and another in spain but his companion salvd that by telling him he shed his heads as stags do their horns i hope you will pardon this merry account since it is not my own then there is a cup that king solomon used to drink out of but my merry enlishman affronted the friar that showed us these rarities by asking him if king soloman drank it full always for it was a very large one a pot that was at the wedding of cana in galilee where our savior turned water into wine joan of arcs sword which i think is bigger than that of edward the thirds in henry the sevenths chapel in westminsterabbey judass lanthorn that he bore when he betrayed our savior with a kiss and many more which we did not see for when our english companion asked the friar how often the horns had been mended he grew outrageous and would show us no more and father raimond was very much scandalized in bringing such a parcel of heretics to profane their relics by looking on em  i am much pleased with my tutor though he seems very reserved in giving me any account of his former condition or family though an accident happened a few days ago that makes me imagine there is something very extraordinary in his affairs an english young gentleman a traveller did me the honor to make me a visit some few days ago and my tutor coming in seemed in the utmost confusion at his sight and went out of the room unperceived by my visitor with a great deal of precipitation in a day or two afterward when i informed him i was to dine with the same person he entreated me very earnestly to be excused and told me he had such reasons for not seeing him that if i was acquainted with em i would certainly pardon him in desiring not to be in his company i fansy when we are a little more familiar he will be more free and let me into this affair i must confess it puzzles me very much i shall not give you any farther trouble now my dear uncle but be pleased to give my respects to the amiable family we last visited and give me leave to subscribe myself  your most affectionate nephew etc p s i have wrote to my father by the same post i thought it would not be wrong to let you know it for fear you should give yourself any trouble in communicating to em the contents of this and i shall always proceed in the same method in my travels though i should be glad to hear from you how the family goes on     i was obliged to leave paris sooner than i intended upon receiving the following letter sir i know for certain your life is in danger therefore would advise you to quit the place as soon and as secretly as you can a gentleman of my acquaintance imagines the coldness of his mistress proceeds from the esteem she has for you i have in vain endeavored to convince him of the contrary perhaps i should not be in so much fear for you if he had generosity enough openly to resent his illgrounded hatred to you but i know him to he a person as void of honor as of courage therefore every thing is to be feared from him take care of the servant you have hired for i have taken notice they are often together it is possible there may be no harm in their intimacy however i think caution is necessary therefore if you please i will borrow him for a few days and send him upon a business that he may execute for me as well as an honest man if he should prove a villain i would not have you stir out today nor receive any visits if you can handsomely avoid it i will be with you in the evening and inform you farther  entirely yours raimond     the receiving of this letter very much surpised me for all the time i remained in paris i had not made any acquaintance with the fair sex and bating the visit i made to monsieur and madam dacier i had not been in the company of any females the thoughts of leaving paris very much rejoiced my tutor who was never easy upon the account of that young gentleman i communicated the letter to him who was as much surpised as i was in the evening father raimond came and pressed me to be gone the next day he informed me his acquaintance had courted a young lady and showed him a letter from the very person where she herself informed him of all he knew and was as pressing for me to be gone as the good father therefore i agreed to set out for marseilles the next day in order to imbark for italy and my baggage was to follow me i sent my french servant to the good father who took him home that night and the next morning i pursued my journey with my tutor and my english servant who might very well pass for a frenchman for he spoke that language as well as english i was very much surpised and vexed at this accident for having got acquainted with several persons of the royalacademy at paris i had the pleasing hope of cultivating my understanding by their conversation for study and the thoughts of my lovely isabella filled up all my time  in our third days journey near the skirts of a wood we were attacked by half a dozen robbers who would have certainly got the better of us if while we were engaged with them two french gentlemen with their servants had not arrived seasonably to our rescue we left two dead upon the place and the other four made their escape i returned the french gentlemen the thanks they deserved for their succor for if they had not come to our assistance we must certainly have been murdered but by the providence of god not one of us was wounded the gentlemen were bound for toulon therefore i resolved to accompany them to that place which lay as convenient they informed me to embark for italy as marseilles we thought it proper to push on without taking any notice of w happened to us because it would retard our journey though we might have received a reward for the death of the two thieves we all arrived safe at toulon without meeting any other accident by the way from whence i sent orders to marseilles for my baggage to be brought from thence but the french gentlemen leaving me the next day i thought it proper to go to marseilles myself toulon the telo martius of the romans is a bishopric and has a very fine port and very strongly fortified the two great moles of  00 paces each that almost cover the whole port has not been many years finished by the present king lewis xiv though begun by henry iv when i arrived at marseilles which lies about  0 miles from toulon i received a packet of letters from england which the good father raimond took care to send with another from paris from an unknown lady that unravelled the meaning of my so suddenly leaving that city the letter was as follows sir i am in love and have long been beloved by a gentleman that has taken it into his head to be jealous of you though i never had the honor of conversing with you i have seen you i must confess and had the inadvertency to commend you before him though without any farther thought for the person i mention has laid such hold of my heart it can never get from him twas i that used that method with father raimond to make you abandon paris which i hope you will forgive for i should never have brought to temper the heart of him whom i love more than myself if you had continued here the design upon your life was all fiction for the man whom i adore has too much honor to deal so treacherously with any person his only fault is jealousy but that is a sign of his passion for me as you came to paris as a traveller i hope your sudden leaving it will not prove prejudicial to you and remember the women of france are not so fond of variety as many foreigners imagine though i believe you have too good understanding to fall into that mean way of thinking i am so much a stranger to you that i hardly know whether you are versed enough in our language to read an epistle of this nature therefore it has given me some trouble to have it translated into english for which i hope you will pardon one who will ever have a good opinion of your good nature the servant too is honest and to reward him for the loss of so good a master i have taken him into my service and i intend to make him amends i might have let you continue in ignorance of this adventure but i could not bear you should have a hard thought of the person i esteem though an utter stranger to you and i shall think my self obliged ever to subscribe myself  your humble servant etc     i must own i was a little uneasy to be made such a tool of however i soon forgave the lady considering the power of love  i was compelled to wait a fortnight for want of a vessel to imbark in for genoa and therefore had leisure enough to view this city marseilles is a city of the greatest antiquity in france it was founded by the phoceans a colony from athens as strabo tells me it is one of the finest ports of france and the safest for it was never known any vessel ever perished there by storm it was a flourishing city in the time of the romans who made alliances with em finding it not an easy matter to overcome it by the means of its levant trade it is esteemed the richest city in france and its situation upon the mediterranean makes it so advantageous for trade that it will ever prove so this city was free till the year      when it submitted to the king of france with the rest of provence it is so well peopled that it is difficult to walk the streets for the multitude of passengers backwards and forwards the public buildings are very magnificent here the galleys of the crown are kept in admirable order under command of a strong tier of guns the churches and monasteries are numerous and beautiful and the clergy here seem more open and facetious than in any other place i have seen in france  i embarked for genoa in a dutch vessel bound for that place but in the dusk of the evening which succeeded the first day of our voyage we were pursued by a corsair of tunis the fright and confusion was very great for our vessel carried but eight guns and sixteen men besides eight passengers the master made many false tacks in hopes to lose him in the night but at the dawn of day we discovered him about two leagues to leeward of us and the wind ceasing with the rising of the sun we had no hopes to escape for they made up to us with their oars which we were without however both sailors and passengers resolved upon their defense and the rather because we observed a vessel under the french shore who by her working seemed to endeavor to come up to us though some of the most timorous would have it another rover of barbary notwithstanding we made ready to receive em but the wind freshning a little we chose to make all the sail we could for the port of toulon not above seven leagues distant from us but our endeavors proved fruitless for before eight a clock she came within gunshot of us and plied us with her forechace guns though without any damage for not one of the shot entered our ship which they perceiving left off firing because it retarded their course and rowed hard to come along side of us which they did in an hour from their first firing when they came within haling they bid us strike that moment or every man when we were taken should be flung overboard but we gave em no other answer than with our great guns and small arms which i believe they did not expect but they returned our civility with interest and after plying it warmly on both sides for half an hour they boarded us on our forecastle and those that understood their language declared we should all fall a sacrifice to their revenge the knowledge of that gave us fresh resolution to fell our lives as dear as we could but an accidental shot taking away our colors the rovers thought we had struck to em which gave em some pause but when they found we continued the fight even to desperation they fell on furiously again but a lucky shot from us flew into their powderroom and blew up their quarter within two foot of the water this gave us fresh courage and we cleared the deck of all that were alive on board us they cut off their grapples and fell a stern but still plied us with their small and great shot we made all the sail we could to get out of their way and by degrees left em out of gunshot but found our ship shot through in several places between wind and water and we were forced to lie by to stop our leaks while we were endeavoring to find em out it was a great satisfaction to me to see the other ship we saw under the shore get up with the corsair and engage her they fought furiously about half an hour but at last overcame her yet that satisfaction was allayed by my being informed our leaks could not be found and the water gained upon us notwithstanding they labored hard at the pump the master immediately made a signal of distress and the ship and prize came to our assistance the ship proved a spanish guard de cost the captain came on board us and very civilly offered me a cabin of his lieutenants who was killed in the engagement with the corsair i was much pleased with the offer and got my things removed on board the captains name was don juan de fonseca his ship from barcelona of  0 guns where he was obliged to go to refit for this was his second engagement in the first he had sunk a rover of barbary who went to the bottom without saving one human creature our ship had made shift to stop her leaks but not so effectually as to pursue her voyage so after a consultation the master determined to put into toulon to refit therefore i resolved to accompany the spanish captain to barcelona having satisfied the dutchman for my passage i had much ado to make him accept it telling me i had done him more service than that came to in the engagement though i my tutor and servant had the good fortune to escape without any wound in our bodies yet several shot had pierced our clothes the stock of my carbine was shot away as i was charging it without doing me any hurt and the hat of my tutor had part of the brim shot away we lost but three sailors in the desperate engagement and five wounded two of which were passengers before night we parted with the dutchman and saw him by the help of a telescope enter the harbor of toulon ere it was dark and we pursued our voyage for barcelona accompanied with the algerine prize  the captain of the spaniard lost nineteen men in this last engagement and thirtyfive in the former besides thirty wounded in both so that his complement was so very much lessened that if it had not been for the help of the galleyslaves out of the corsair who were most spaniards he could not have worked his ship the captain of the prize was a flemish renegade who was intended to be executed as soon as we arrived in spain but a wound he received in the groin prevented it for he expired before we got into harbor the rest were moors therefore intended for the galleys of spain their complement was   0 men when they first set out a roving but they had lost    in the engagement with us besides    that were blown up with their powder and    with the spaniard don juan de fonseca made me a present of a very fine turkish scimitar adorned with wrought gold which very much pleased me and in return i made him with a great many entreaties accept of a gold watch of tompions make but i had almost affronted him when i offered to satisfy him for my passage to barcelona where we arrived without any impediment he did me the honor to introduce me to the governor and said so many things in my commendation that made me ashamed to hear em but the spaniards are noted for hyperboles however the governor used me with a great deal of civility wondering a person so young should begin his travels so early and ordered me an apartment in the castle and in all the time i continued there never pressed me to go to mass or once asked me concerning my religion which i was very well pleased at for he was assured i was a protestant by my country  don juan de fonseca was hardly ever from me and the civilities i received from him i shall never forget i found nothing of the stiff formal spaniard in him nor indeed among any i had the fortune to converse with so that i imagine the general character of the spaniards we receive in england is not altogether true they are certainly cautious concerning their women yet not all out so much as i expected for i never was introduced into any family without seeing the female part of it but they never stay long in company or indeed seldom look at any strangers but when they are spoke to or just upon their entrance into a room and when they take their leave  barcelona the roman barcino is the capital of the province of catalonia it was built by barca the carthaginian from whom it takes its name though sometimes it was called by the romans faventia colonia and julia augusta it was taken from the moors of spain by lewis the pious emperor of germany it has two rivers that wash the north and south side though neither of them of any great note the mole is a very fine one though the harbor being so full of sand will not permit large vessels entrance the buildings are very handsome though it does not exceed marseilles in any thing and for trade it falls very short i was advised by every body to winter at barcelona which i resolved to do to perfect myself in the spanish language nothing extraordinary happened to me while i was there though murders were committed almost every night which is reckoned nothing there one gentlewoman was murdered by her brother as she came from her devotion at the cathedral church this poor lady it seems had an intrigue with one of the dons of the place and the brother came as far as toledo to punish the stain of his family as he called it and i never knew he was so much as imprisoned for it another person of note was shot through the back as he was making water against a wall this gentleman it seems had been too busy with another mans wife as the rumor went though the adventure was forgot the next day  the death of one gentleman gave me some concern having some knowledge of him he was a person of good extraction but his family was fallen to decay he made his addresses to a beautiful lady and gained her affection but the parents of the lady got him a post to the west indies not out of love but to get him out of the way however the enamored couple corresponded together by letter for two years in the mean time her parents resolved to wed her against her will to a rich spaniard of quality that was in love with her the young lady sent word to her lover of her unhappy marriage that was approaching and attempted to make her escape but was prevented by the infidelity of her confidant the gentleman understanding how matters went resigned his post in the indies and arrived at barcelona ten days after the fatal marriage was consummated the news almost broke his heart and his passion was so violent that he cast many ways to get a sight of his mistress and at last obtained it they had several meetings at a friends house of the gentlemans but i was informed by a person that knew the affair that all their meetings were very innocent at last they were discovered by the new husband who hired several bravos that did their work so well the poor gentleman was murdered as he was just entering the door where his mistress waited for him some time after the husband met with the same fate as he came from visiting a new mistress some supposed the wife had a hand in the murder but it was never found out and the lady went into a monastery before i left barcelona i received a letter from my dear isabella with several from my uncle and father that of isabellas was as follows my life i thought i never should have heard from you more and though i allowed of the difficulty of sending to england at all times yet i began to have the utmost uneasiness but now i know the reason of it my fears are redoubled your tutor has wrote an account to your uncle of your engagement with a corsair of barbary where he declares you were their guardianangel consider my love you have two lives to answer for that of your own and i hope of your isabellas though yours is far more dear to me than my own if the love you professed to me be not a fiction do not trust the sea but with the utmost necessity you have proved it an unconstant element already and more dangers attend it than storms and shipwrecks you may go from barcelona to italy if you please by land for i am now grown a mistress in geography and love was my teacher i thought that face and heart too tender to fight with any thing therefore as i am deceived in that i tremble to think you may deceive me in your love no question but france spain and italy have beauties enough to put the strongest faith to a dangerous trial but if your love should cease dont put an end to pity keep it a secret for should i once know you false twill end the life of your  isabella p s i am concerned to let you know that i am persecuted afresh by him you have often called your rival but be assured while i have my faculties you shall never have any rival in my heart which is and ever shall be entirely thine       this letter was the only joy i received all the while i was at barcelona though i was disturbed at the account of my rivals renewing his addresses the governor asked me if i had not gained a mistress since my arrival and when i answered him in the negative he seemed surpised sure said he you must have a very insensible heart not to feel the charms of love in so warm a climate where it is almost the chief business of the nation but alas he knew little of my soul which felt the pangs of love in a much colder climate than spain i received so many civilities from this gentleman that very much perplexed me because i had nothing extraordinary to make him a return and to add to the obligations i had to him when i left barcelona he gave me leave to redeem a slave from the galleys which is esteemed the greatest honor can be done to any stranger though i did not take so much time to examine the demerits of the criminals as a nobleman did who having the same honor done him asked all the slaves the crimes that brought them into that condition but every one of em to the last man told him they were either put in by malice or mistake but the last man told him frankly he could not say but he was put in very justly for taking a purse in tarragona without the consent of the owner the duke upon this gave him a stroke with his cane you rogue said he what do you here among such a parcel of honest innocent fellows get about your business the person i redeemed was both old and unhealthy and therefore i thought him the properest person among em that he might have the satisfaction of ending the remainder of his days in freedom  i observed a gloomy melancholy had seized my tutor and though i strove all i could to divert him yet i found it to no purpose neither could i prevail upon him to know the cause of his sorrow he only answered me that it was his natural disposition but i saw too much of him not to know his disease lay in the mind yet had hope time and the various climates we should visit would cure him but hitherto his malady increased one day when i was retired to my closet to write some letters to england he came into the room not knowing i was there and for some time sighed and wept bitterly at last he broke out into something like the following complaint sure never wretched mortal ever felt the pains and disappointments that i have undergone they are too great to bear allseeing heaven that inflicts these punishments upon us creeping things sure will forgive us if we seek a remedy by death for naught but death can cure my misfortunes as he was going on with his complaints i purposely made a rumbling in my closet which he hearing was going down stairs but i prevented him by opening the closetdoor and called him back well governor said i will you still persist in grief and yet tell me you have nothing troubles you i am sorry you betray a want of confidence in me whom i would have you reckon among the number of your friends and you may command every thing in my power as such sir answered my governor in much confusion i am convinced of your goodness to me and therefore have in a short narrative written the account of my misfortunes which i intended for your perusal after my death and when you have considered em i am well assured you will not blame me for cutting off my cares with my life i shall blame you for nothing i replied but your persisting in that melancholy thought consider the task you have undertaken that of returning me safe to my uncle also remember time works many strange cures of the mind as well as the body in common calamities i own replied my tutor time is a very good physician but when the malady is lodged in the soul and no balm to heal it on this side the grave time only makes the burden too heavy to be born however i own there is a duty incumbent upon me on your account and i will lay aside my resolution of dying till you have perused this fatal account of my unfortunate life and then i doubt not but you will out of compassion dismiss me to the peaceful grave when he had done speaking he put into my hands the following relation  the history of clerimont my family is not of the meanest though i was born to suffer unheard of misfortunes through an unhappy passion in my youth i was brought up in the roman persuasion but being left to the care of an uncle a clergyman of the protestant religion he soon wiped away the notions i had received from my infancy of the roman faith but as it little concerns my wretched life to relate any thing farther of my minority i shall step at once into my melancholy story  after leaving the university my uncle took me to dwell with him intending as soon as possible i should take my degrees in order to procure me a living but in the mean time fate was at work riding one summerevening to take the air the sun so powerfully shone upon me that i was constrained to go to the skirts of a wood for shelter from his fiery beams the place being inviting i got from my horse and laid me down upon the grass setting myself to read and insensibly fell asleep but was awaked with the neighing of a horse in the neighboring wood which i found was my own that had slipped off his bridle and left me taking the bridle in my hand i went to catch him but being a horse of spirit he led me from place to place not suffering me to come near him i was so much fatigued in following him that i was constrained once more to sit down and let him graze in my sight in a few moments i heard the neighing of another horse in the adjacent thicket which mine soon answered and galloped that way the noise proceeded from i was obliged once more to rise and follow him and at last came up with him where i found him playing his pranks with another horse and a gentleman whipping him to get em asunder but with the bustle the other horse got loose also and away they ran together kicking and biting each other so that each of us feared the loss of his horse as i was going to follow em once more i heard a female voice call to me for heavens sake sir said she if youre a man succor a distressed woman who is in danger of losing her honor and her life though i did not set up for a knight errant curiosity and humanity made me turn back where  rceivd a woman tied by her hair to the stump of a tree all bloody the sight very much surpised me but as i was going to release her the gentleman that was pursuing the other horse cried out to me villain if thou offerest to set her at liberty this moment is thy last turning about i saw him within ten paces with his sword drawn running upon me i had no weapon therefore thought it advisable to desist and expostulate with him but he would not hear reason nor tell me the meaning of this adventure i was in a very great dilemma between his threats and the persuasive rhetoric of the suffering lady but at last resolved notwithstanding the apparent danger to release her if possible but as soon as he perceived my intention he ran at me with his sword crying nay then take thy death first having my bridle in my hand i struck at him with a good force and by good providence struck his sword out of his hand and as he stooped to take it up i repeated my blow upon his head and the bridle being a curb i stunned him with the stroke so that he lay speechless grovelling on the earth and i run to free the lady but finding some difficulty and hot regarding the man he was got up and running once more upon me with his sword which i should have secured would infallibly have dispatched me if the lady had not cried out yet i could not avoid being run through the side though no more than a flesh wound he then seized me and we struggled together a long time but he being very strong and i weak with my wound he got me down and with the fall the sword flew out of my side i grasped him close about the neck so that he could hardly breathe but he must have made an end of me if the lady had not released herself with the assistance i had given her before who took up his sword and run him into the leg the pain of which made him let go his hold of me and i got up again snatched the sword from him which he had drawn out of his leg and struck him so forcibly over his head that i once more sent him breathless to the ground i was just going to run the sword into his body in my heat of passion but i considered immediately it would look like an action of barbarity to stab a defenseless man therefore i desisted and in a few moments after i fell speechless by him with loss of blood but was brought to my senses by a violent pain in my leg that the barbarous wretch had given me in wounding me several times with his penknife as i lay incapable of defense  he did his utmost to reach my breast but he was so feeble with his wounds that he could not get any farther i rose in a violent passion and wrenchd it from him intending to put an end to his life but my feebler strength could not obey my fury therefore i seated myself as far from him as i could expecting my last moments for the lady was fled and little hopes of succor appeared we being in a wood above a mile from any road i had nothing now to do but make my peace with heaven while i was meditating i perceived five men with the wretchs horse coming toward us as soon as he perceived em he cried out with all the transport his strength would allow of now villain thy wretched fate approaches here said he to one of the fellows take that villain that has in this manner basely abused your master and hew him to pieces notwithstanding i thought death was near without any farther violence yet i was resolved to defend myself as well as i could therefore snatched up the sword that lay near me and put my back against a tree for without that support i had not strength to stand the villains one and all came furiously toward me but i kept em some time from wounding me by means of the sword thrusting the most eager of em into the throat but finding my strength failing me i made one effort before i fainted and thrust my sword into the body of their master who was endeavoring to rise falling upon him at the same time for want of strength that moment several country fellows came rushing upon the servants of the inhuman villain and drove em out of the wood wounding several of em two of em came to me and supported me while another that was a surgeon examined my wounds have courage said he sir your hurts are not dangerous though your loss of blood makes you faint i thanked em for their seasonable assistance which was surely sent from heaven for one moment longer must have brought me inevitable death sir said the surgeon the lady whom you rescued sent us to your assistance who will be here immediately to return you the acknowledgments due for such a signal service  after my wounds were dressed the surgeon went to examine the wretch that lay speechless with his sword in his body upon drawing it out he gave two or three groans and opened his eyes staring wildly about him for some time when he found how matters went what said he does that villain live still yes i replied heaven guards the good and the title of villain properly belongs to thee who would oppress virtue and wrong the innocent and thy treatment of her and me has been so barbarous that if thy crimes do not draw the punishment of heaven upon thee i will seek thee out and endeavor to chastise thee in a manner that shall show thee i have not forgot i am a gentleman though thou art of the brute creation and only bear the outward form of man i would give replied the brute half my estate to have it in my power to scourge thy presumption he would have said more but the probing of his wounds made him faint before they had made an end of dressing him the lady arrived attended with several servants thank heaven said she the preserver of my life and honor lives how shall i show my grateful acknowledgments i replied i had done nothing but what every honest man would have done or ought to have done  this surgeon interrupted our discourse by informing the lady it would be dangerous for me to talk much but i could not avoid speaking with my eyes for i found my heart insensibly leaving me the charms of the fair one were too powerful to be withstood though ruffled and disordered by this unlucky accident after the surgeon had dressed the wretch the cause of this disaster he asked the lady what must be done with him leave him said she to consort with his fellow creatures the beasts of the field for human society will disown him immediately after the countrymen returned bringing along with them three of the servants they had taken all of em very much wounded there said the lady take your villainous master and shut him in some dark cave for it is not sit he should breathe common air with honest men and you continued she must be brutes like him to serve such a monster the servants made their excuse as well as they could urging their masters commands and promising for the future never to be partners in his crimes if they continued with him well replied the lady learn to be honest and heaven will forgive you take the wretch your master and bear him where i may never see him more perhaps he may also repent since he finds his punishment comes from heaven the ablest of the fellows got upon his masters horse which was brought along with mine by the countrymen and his master was laid along before him hardly sensible of what they did but i was so weak and faint they were obliged to cut boughs and make a hurdle on which i was laid and carried to a fair house about two miles from the wood yet notwithstanding my weakness i found a secret pleasure in being under the same roof with a woman that had entirely robbed me of my heart  my wounds made me keep my chamber several weeks though i had the happiness of seeing my fair one twice a day during my illness and my passion increased with my strength one day before i left my chamber i begged her to inform me how a woman of her condition could be brought into such a dangerous adventure sir said she by base treachery which i will inform you in as few words as possible  this wretch for i cannot call him gentleman though blind fortune has bestowed her favors upon him in a lavish manner long courted me in vain though my father who is now abroad pressed me very much to accept him for a husband blinded by his vast riches yet my heart disdained him when my father went into spain to settle his affairs i forbid him the house and ordered the servants whenever he came to visit me to shut the doors against him this treatment put him in such a passion that he broke my windows and endeavored to come in by force threatening to murder all my family such impudent proceedings obliged me to have my country neighbors in my house as a guard from his insolent fury this was not only troublesome but expensive however tired with his attempts to no purpose he left off his persecution and i began to recover my former tranquillity near four months past without my once hearing of him and when i did i was informed he was making his addresses to a lady on the other side of the country the news was infinitely pleasing to me and i durst once more venture abroad as usual  one day my woman that had been my servant from my infancy begged i would be godmother to a grandchild of hers whose parents lived in a village about five miles from my dwelling i could not refuse such a trifling request though it was an office i did not take any great delight in when the day came i was obliged to go on horseback attended with one manservant and my woman for my coachman was ill of a fever when we came within a quarter of a mile of the wood where heaven sent you to my assistance my woman called to mind she had forgot some little presents i had intended for the mother and the child therefore she sent the footman in a hurry back for em while we proposed to ride on softly till he overtook us as we came within a few yards of the wood my horse gave a start at something and looking toward the wood i perceived to my dreadful surprise the villain that brought me to the distress you rescued me from he flew out of the wood and on the instant seized my horse by the bridle come madam said he we may now converse together without scaling walls to come at you fear had so tied my tongue that i could not give him any answer but when i found him leading my horse to the wood i jumped off and ran toward the plain as fast as my fear would permit but to no purpose he soon overtook me and bore me by force into the wood maugre all my complaining sighs  when he had hurried me about a furlong i perceived five or six of the villains servants they immediately seized me and put me before him on horseback he ordering them at the same time to catch my horse and wait at a certain place in the wood till he came to them the barbarian then carried me to a more unfrequented part of the wood where he proceeded to fill my ears with his nauseous courtship but still threatened to use force if i did not immediately comply i tried by all the persuasion i was mistress of to prevent his horrid purpose telling him time might produce strange things and if he would forbear any violence i would give him leave to visit me as usual no no madam that is only a wile replied the monster to get out of my power but i will do the deed and then leave you to determine whether you will send for me or no when i found entreaties would not prevail i called heaven and earth to my assistance but to no purpose he then proceeded to violence using the most horrid imprecations that he would satiate his most abominable lust and then murder me to conceal the deed  i resisted as long as my weak strength would permit but he at last overpowered me so far as to bind me to the root of the tree where you found me and no doubt had fulfilled his damnable purpose if your timely assistance had not saved me when i found my deliverer in such imminent danger pursued the lady i took up his sword with an intention to have killed the villain but using the weapon with fearful aukwardness wounded him only in the leg and perceiving you faint ran out of the wood to seek for succor by good fortune i met the surgeon and my servant returning who got together some of my fathers tenants that were haymaking in the meads near the wood  as we came to your succor i saw my woman lie upon the ground bleeding i ran to her assistance but she cried good madam trouble not yourself with a wretch that has basely betrayed you but heaven has punished me for my perfidy and all i ask is forgiveness from that and you she informed me that my intended ravisher had given her  00 l to betray me to him in the manner i have related i asked her how she came thus wounded she answered me by the hand of heaven as she was waiting till he odious deed was finished a horse came galloping out of the wood and running furiously upon the beast she was on the creature in a fright ran away with that swiftness she could neither stop him nor get from off his back till he threw her down her foot hanging in the stirrup she was dragged ill the stirrup broke and left her in the conflition i found her in i was surpised at this treachery because i little suspected it though it was obvious enough yet the hurry of my spirits never gave me leisure once to think upon any thing but your safety  the surgeon however was about to dress her but she pushed him from her telling him his art was vain for she was that moment expiring and accordingly she breathed her last begging forgiveness of me and heaven maugre the resentment i had against her i could not help shedding a few tears for her loss  the rest of my story you are sufficiently acquainted with since you hazarded your life to save me from the ravisher who as we are informed is expired of his wounds and though i am a creature so far from wishing the death of any one that i would give all i am worth to save an innocent persons life yet i cannot help being pleased at his death since it frees me from the apprehension of suffering from his brutal temper which i am assured never will be changed  to make my tale as short as possible i will freely declare to you dear sir that i gained her heart though she protested she would never wed till the death of her father without his consent but that i almost despaired of considering the disparity of our fortunes besides he was accounted the most penurious wretch on earth this gave a damp to the joy i received when she gave me an assurance of her heart though she vowed she would suffer a thousand deaths rather than give her hand to any one but her deliverer as she was pleased to call me  during my cure no man ever thought himself so happy as i did beloved and ever in the presence of her i loved though we concealed our passions from all the world but my wounds being healed decency required i should be gone though our separation was equal to the pangs of death all our consolation was in our intercourse of letters and sometimes meeting as by accident  a few days after our parting the father to my fair one arrived from spain she sent me a note wherein she advised me to make him a visit and endeavor to insinuate myself into his favor i waited on him accordingly but was very much surprised at my reception instead of giving me thanks for the timely assistance i gave his daughter he seemed very much out of humor with me and in an odd stiff formal manner told me the world had been censorious upon his daughter on my account and therefore desired i would never enter his doors again i found to my grief there was nothing to be done with him in favor of my love therefore took my leave with a heart full of the greatest sorrow yet notwithstanding the danger we continued our correspondence though with a thousand fears  i kept nothing a secret from my good uncle who persuaded me to forget my passion but that was the only thing i could not obey him in the knowledge of it gave him a great deal of uneasiness though he was so just to pity me and hoped time might work a cure  one day as i was going in disguise to the place where i was to receive a letter from my love i saw in the road a country fellow grovelling in the dust when i came up to him he informed me with a great deal of pain that his horse had thrown him and with the violence of his fall had broke his leg he entreated me to give him some assistance though my time was short for my own affair compassion would not suffer me to leave a man in such distress and anguish therefore i caught his horse that was grazing near and mounting him led him to a neighboring village where i procured a skilful surgeon to attend him but before i took my leave he begged to speak with me in private when every body had left the room friend said he for i was dressed in a country habit i have one favor more to beg of you which is to take that letter carry it as directed and for your pains there is half a crown but you must do it with all secrecy tell the person you give it to of my unfortunate condition and upon return with the answer i shall reward you by giving you another half crown with many thanks for the favor as a crown was a very extraordinary reward for one in my habit to go half a mile i durst not for fear of some discovery refuse it therefore took the letter with promise of a quick return neither was it out of my way for it was directed to a person that kept a publickhouse in the road where i was to pass  as i pursuing my little journey i called to mind the person to whom the letter was directed who had formerly been a servant to the father of my mistress for she once proposed a meeting at his house but better considering we found a place more convenient and less to be suspected i therefore began to be jealous of some ill design which possessed my fancy so strong that i resolved to open the seal in such a manner that the arms which furthered my suspicion should not be defaced if the contents were innocent of any ill intent the first publichouse i came at i went in and opened my letter where i found to this effect sam i send the bearer to you to consult how we shall get that scornful minx into my custody the vessel and all things are in readiness and the false report i have caused to be spread of my death will favor my design i have likewise sent three trusty rogues to dispatch that fellow who rescued her out of my hands before for i must have my revenge as well as love satisfied it is but within these few days i learnt where he lived tomorrow night i shall come in disguise the back way to your house and bring the other  00 l with me take care of privacy in my reception and send your things to my retreat that i may put em on board i hope you have overcome that scruple of parting with your wife which so much possessed you when i last saw you be sure to keep thy tongue within thy teeth for if women are big with a secret they are in pain till they are delivered i will assure you you may rely on tom the bearer therefore conceal nothing from him i send you this letter as his credentials because you never saw him before as my ambassador he is faithful for i have tried him  yours etc     you may judge my surprise when i had read this villainous writing and found my mistress as well as mysel in such imminent danger my thoughts were in such confusion and disorder that i could not determine with myself how i should proceed in this affair at last i resolved to deliver the letter as directed to see what farther inlet i could receive in the dangerous affair i therefore made the best of my way to the house where i fortunately met the man alone he changed color in the reading of it several times examining the seal very circumspectly but that he should have done before he opened it though the nicest observer even he that sent it could not have discovered the letter had been opened however i could find by his odd questions he was not overwell satisfied with the bearer observing my face as if he would look me through i began to suspect he might find me out in my disguise not being well assured but he might have seen me when i was brought wounded from the wood senseless however at last he began to be a little better composed he took some pains to persuade me to drink something but i informed him i had business a little further therefore was obliged to return immediately he then made me promise to call as i came back telling me he would go along with me to the person that sent me to which i agreed and went on to meet my dear mistress  when i told her the story of the letter she could hardly give credit to it believing her intended ravisher had been in the regions of death but at last being convinced he was still living she resolved not to stir abroad for fear he should put his wicked designs in practice desiring i would do the same though i had not informed her of my danger the grief we felt at parting almost overcame us and it was with some difficulty i could bring my countenance to dissemble my sorrow when i called upon the innkeeper  after staying some time we set out together but i could plainly perceive his mind was very much disturbed in crossing a meadow we observed a kite had pouncd a poor pidgeon and flew up into a tree in our way as we passed i ran as fast as i could and with stones frighted him from his prey the pidgeon not quite dead fluttered about the tree and at last fell at our feet which i took up thus it is said i in the world power rapine violence and lust which stop at nothing to compass their wicked desires though they prey upon innocence and virtue yet they often meet with their reward in this world as well as the next that kite that left the innocent pidgeon in that condition has every one for its enemy while the poor pidgeon is pitied but birds are instigated by nature to what they do the kite was compelled by hunger and necessity to seek his prey but vicious man preys upon his fellow creature out of wantonness or revenge your reflection replied the innkeeper seems something above your condition and i will freely declare very much surprises me therefore beg the favor to be answered one question sincerely i told him i would why then said he do you know any thing of the person that gave you the letter or any thing relating to the contents or do you know the gentleman who sent that messenger though i must own i abhor an untruth yet i thought it would not be convenient to declare what i knew therefore answered in the negative the man was some time before he spoke looking steadfastly upon me all the while at last he broke silence to this purpose friend i know not your condition yet do verily believe you are not what you seem but be that as it may i have in this short acquaintance such a strong opinion of your wisdom and integrity by your countenance and discourse that i shall discover a very important secret to you upon this condition that you will never disclose it give me your advice and not endeavor to prejudice me i replied his confidence in me obliged me to be his friend come then said he let us go out of this path for hedges and ditches may have ears as well as walls as the saying is  when we came to a convenient place we sat down and he related to me all the passages of what i knew before concerning the family of my mistress and my own adventure how the wretch who sent him the letter had prevailed upon him to betray the young lady his former mistress for  00 l into his hands and fly with him into the west indies where he had a large estate and should be shrouded from the law now i must own the money has a prevailing power and my poverty pleads for the gentleman besides i have a wife that has of late given me proof how much she strives to send me to heaven by adorning my brows but yet i have a conscience for my monitor that every moment tells me i am about a wicked deed and this letter i have received which you was the bearer of has staggered my resolution for i find by the contents an innocent gentleman is to be murdered for doing a noble and a generous action therefore the first thing i shall desire of you before you give me your advice is to promise me you will go to such a place naming my uncles house and inform the young gentleman his nephew of the danger he is in for though i have no knowledge of him yet i know his uncle to be a person who is an honor to the habit he wears and has the goodwill of every body when i had read the letter i affected to be very much astonished at such a design in a kingdom famous for the goodness of its laws where such crimes are punished with death and told him the danger he run in such a vile proceeding the usage he must expect from such a villain when he had him once in his power and the reward might be taken from him nay perhaps death might be his payment from such a barbarous wretch that he might have the fewer to maintain  he allowed all i said for oracles yet he was still hankering after the  00 l it would be a piece of justice cried the innkeeper even to bite him of it i cannot deny but it would i replied but i think that impracticable i wish we could contrive replied he to let him run away with my wife i then should get  00 l and be rid of a base woman that has made me a cuckold the letter seems to intimate said i that you had some scruples in parting with her that is true replied the innkeeper for when he first moved me about this wicked business i had only a jealousy of her falsehood but since i have proved it i despise her as much as i loved her yet i have even concealed my knowledge of her falsehood though i was an eyewitness of it i began to inquire further into the affair and found he had reason enough to get rid of his wife therefore we spent some time in conference about bringing this affair to bear but could not think of any probable means come cried the innkeeper since we cannot think to any purpose let me entreat you to go and prevent the young gentlemans fate the young gentleman said i is safe enough for to let you into a secret in return of yours i am the very person in this disguise  the innkeeper was thunderstruck at what i told him and seemed willing to be rid of his companion but i brought him to himself by good words and some money which i gave him as i told him for his intention to save my life i own said he it seems a mark of providence in my meeting with you and therefore i abhor myself for my wicked intention and shall never set my mind at rest till i have gained forgiveness from heaven and you we were interrupted in our farther discourse by a person that crossed the meadow with a fishingrod in his hand though he was so intent to get over the hedge to the river that ran near it that he saw us not that is said the innkeeper the villain that has seduced my wife my blood rises at him i have a good mind to run after him and push him into the river hold said i why did not you show your resentment when you caught him in the act and revenge yourself because said he my blood was froze with horror and i had not the power to stir well then i replied let him alone now for i have something in my head that may be of service to you not only to get rid of your wife but to fecure the  00 l too did your wife ever receive any letters from him to your knowledge i believe not replied the innkeeper for when he comes a fishing he generally lies at our house so that they have opportunities enough of conversation without writing to each other why then said i contain your self a little go to the angler and tell him your wife has betrayed herself to you and forbid him your house or if you dont like that method take any other to prevent his coming to your habitation but dont use any indirect means well replied my host i will take your advice about the calmness of my mind though i shall not proceed in the other affair quite according to your direction for i think after owning myself a cuckold to my cuckoldmaker nothing should follow but his destruction  i staid about half an hour inly ruminating upon my unhappy condition before he returned i have dont cried my host i believe he will not come to my house in haste i hope you have not murdered him said i no no i proceeded in another manner by reading a letter he carelessly dropped once i found he owed a considerable sum of money to a certain person in london who threatened to trouble him remembering the persons name i went up to him as he was fishing and told him i was glad i had met with him for there were officers to arrest him at our house at the suit of suchaone he seemed surprised as not doubting the truth and begged i would stand his friend in his concealment therefore i have sent him to a cousin of mine that keeps an inn about ten miles off with a promise to come and inform him when the officers are gone you have done well said i and now i will inform you of my design  you shall write a letter in answer to that i brought you where you shall mention that you shall have the lady in your possession ready for him to take her away tomorrow the letter i will indite for you which you shall transcribe and then i will write another as from the angler to your wife to tell her that you have discovered your jealousy to him and forbid him your house but that if she consent to fly with him tomorrow night he will come attended with some friends and bring her to a place of safety very well replied my companion i understand you and so put my wife upon the gentleman instead of the lady a rare contrivance if it succeeds come said i let us go to a house and write the letters that we may lose no time i wrote to the villain that does not deserve the name of man in this manner sir i received yours and have succeeded to my wish i have found by an extraordinary accident that your mistress is in love with the person who rescued her from you in the wood and she is to come tomorrow night to be conducted to him by some of his friends from my house therefore you must not speak a word when you take her away till we are safe on board come early for fear we should meet with those persons she expects though i hope your emissaries will prevent him by cutting his throat and dont forget my reward for i am not hero enough to venture my life for nothing be assured if i have the money the woman is yours     ay marry cried mine host as he was writing it this will do what i wrote to his wife you have as follows my dear the cuckold your husband met me today as i was angling and forbid me the house having discovered our intimacy one night in the arbor in the garden therefore if you will fly with me tomorrow night i will send some trusty servants to conduct you to my own habitation where you shall command my house as your own and if we can by any contrivance dispose of your hornifyd spouse it shall be your own fault if you are not my lawful wife take no care of what you leave behind you for i will provide every thing for you rich and of the best send your answer by the bearer whom i can trust but send it in writing sealed with the seal i gave you those words were put in at my hosts request to strengthen the contents and be ready but dont speak a word till you see me for one of the persons i have employed to conduct you imagines it is a rich heiress i have stole one that he knows and if you speak will discover you by your voice rest contented and be happy in the embraces of your constant  l m     right still cried my host but who will be the bearer i told him i would carry it myself while he went on to the maimed fellow that brought the letter and sent him away hurt as he was to his master we agreed to part but i promised him i would come after him and consult farther  when i arrived at my hosts i found his wife tricked up like a duchess and to give her her due she seemed an agreeable woman she took the letter with some confusion which something alarmed me for fear she might know his hand she went into another room and returned immediately with a bottle of wine and a cold chicken and put half a guinea into my hand friend said she if my husband should come and catch you and suspect there is money to pay your reckoning if not it is to pay you for your trouble i thanked her as much like a countryman as i could upon which she went out and staid some time when she returned she gave me a letter give that said she with my humble service to the person that sent you and tell him it is very well  when i had got my commission i made what haste i could to my landlord and found him helping up the countryman upon his horse and the surgeon cursing and swearing at the folly of the fellow to get on horseback in that condition however go he must the fellow said if he died by the way but the man of the house sent one to attend him to his masters and we staid till the fellow returned which he did in three hours telling his master he had conducted him safe home in the mean time we examined the letter i brought from my generous landlay which was to this effect that she would fly to the worlds end with him and live upon roots and water to enjoy his sweet company and leave that despicable wretch her husband whom she loathed as much as she loved him etc a brave wife by my troth cried my landlord  when i gave him the halfguinea she made me a present of he said it was well there were not real bailiffs at his house for mr angler for his wife by her extraordinary bounty to the lettercarrier would certainly pay her lovers debts if she could any way raise the money my thoughts now began to return homeward but my companion told me he would not leave me till he saw me safe at my uncles for fear the wretches should discover me i thanked him and accepted of his company because i was to shift my disguise by the way and consequently might be murdered in going from thence to my uncles for he knew not of my transformation neither should i have gone home till our designs had been accomplished if it had not been that my uncle would have been frightened at my absence therefore we agreed to go both together and my landlord to lodge in the neighborhood of my uncle and both return the next day to wait the issue of our project  when we came to the house where i was to dress the person told me there were three men had been with him to know where my uncle lived and asked several questions concerning me but said he i did not like their turn of discourse therefore gave em no intelligence so they proceeded on their way i told him he had acted wisely for they were wretches that had a design upon my life if so said he looking out be upon your guard for here they come up the lane i had not pulled off my disguise therefore ventured out of the door keeping my hand upon a brace of pocketpistols i always carried about me since my rencounter with that wretch one of em rid up to me and asked me if i had seen mr suchaone naming my name mr clerimont said i speaking in a country manner yes he will be here presently i wait for him by his own order i am glad on it replied the fellow for i have some earnest business to communicate to him and was informed at his uncles that he had not been at home since morning therefore with your leave well wait here till he comes with all my heart said i if you please you may alight and put up your horses no replied the fellow our horses are hot therefore well ride softly up and down to cool em and when he arrives if you will come and acquaint us i will give thee something thank ye master said i i will be sure to do it upon this they rode off i watched em some time and found they were very busy in consultation in the mean time i instructed the man of the house to go to the constable and bring a sufficient force along with him but before he went out they all three returned and alighting from their horses they desired i would put em into the stable for they were now cool telling me they would accept of my offer and wait there till mr clerimont came well gentlemen said i for his sake you shall be welcome to what the house affords come sit down the fellows seemed a little shy however they sat down at last and began to be very free with the liquor we gave em and we plied em so close that in two hours we did not want the constables assistance to secure em for they were all three drunk to a degree  when the constable came i ordered him to keep out of sight till i sent for him i began then to examine the soberest of em asking him what business he had with mr clerimont not said i but if i look into your hand i need not ask the question for i am so skilled in palmistry that i can tell things past present and to come that is to say in plain english replied the man you are a conjuror however to try your skill there is my hand do your best and spare not this hand said i has received in part or will receive shortly the price of innocent blood the man drunk as he was seemed to be in the utmost confusion yet endeavored to hide it by pulling back his hand it is in vain to conceal it from me said i you and your companions are hired to murder that clerimont you so earnestly enquire for and the constable is now in the house to apprehend you  this spoke with a confident air made him turn pale for his other two companions were fast asleep but still he put it off as a jest till i called in the constable here constable said i take these three rogues into custody and see em well secured till tomorrow they came here with an intention to murder me i having sufficient witnesses to prove it against them and are you that clerimont cried the fellow i had been talking to yes said i now let me know what is your business with me turn every body out of the chamber replied he and i will convince you we had no such intention i told him i thought it was impossible however after searching em for arms and finding none i ordered the room to be cleared sir said the man how you got your intelligence is a very great mystery to me but we three were certainly sent from such a person to murder you for the reward of  00 l a man and after we had made an end of you we were to imbark with him for the west indies we received  0 l a man as earnest of the rest but resolved not to commit so barbarous an act upon the innocent therefore we intended to acquaint you with the real truth hoping you would cause the report to be spread of your murder about your neighborhood for a few days till we had received the reward and our master had embarked i own you may hardly find faith to believe me but it is truth as i hope for heaven you may perceive we have no arms about us and if you please to examine our pistols at our holsters you will find they are as empty as my masters heart is of humanity  i immediately sent to examine their pistols and found em unchargd as he declared this proof gained on my belief well sir said the man i hope you think what i have said is truth but the more to strengthen it pray awake my companions and examine them now what discourse we had together was spoke so low that if the other two men had been awake and sober they could not have understood us therefore i caused em to be roused from their drousy humor while i went and put on my own clothes when i came in i ordered the person i had been talking with to tell em he had seen me well and have you broke the matter to him said one of em yes he replied and i do intend to comply with his request we are glad on it returned the other two then our fourscore pounds apiece is all snug i found upon a further examination the fellows were honest nay one of em told me it was not altogether the lucre of the money that prevailed upon him but to save an innocent gentlemans life for said he if we had not undertaken it some others might that would have gone through with their work  the difficulty i now labored under was which way to cause the report of my death without alarming my uncle therefore took this method which was approved of by the three men i put on my disguise once more and gave em the clothes i put off which we mangled and blooded in several places and ordered em to tell the wretch who sent em that they found me hunting in a wood alone and there murdered me and the place being private not likely for any one to find me immediately they had stripped me and brought my clothes as a proof that my business was done effectually they all three gave me many thanks and promised me in a few days to let me know their success for they were resolved to leave their master secretly as soon as ever they had received their reward not caring to live any longer with such a barbarous wretch upon this we parted and my host and i went to our repose the next morning i dispatched mine host to regulate matters with my hated rival and designed to follow i told my uncle i intended to go see a relation about twenty miles off and should not return till the next day for i did not think it proper to acquaint him with the motive of my journey i went in my usual disguise but durst not go to the landlords house because his wife would know me for the lettercarrier therefore chose to ride into a neighboring wood till it was dark where i entertained myself with a book i brought along with me but i was very much surpised an hour before night to see the wretch and two more along with him enter the same wood i began to have some dreadful apprehension for fear they should find me out therefore leading my horse further into the wood and tying him fast fetched a round and came almost at their backs yet though i was so near em they could not come to me immediately by reason of the interposition of a thick copse of hazels which kept me from their sight now my revenge is satisfied cried the villain my heart feels lighter and it looks like an omen of future contentment in possessing that ungrateful maid i must own i do love her and would wait a year with patience if at the end she would reward my love  you were very patient replied another when not long since you attempted to ravish her and no doubt had dont if the person who has paid his life for his presumption had not prevented it it is true replied the barbarian the first fire of my passion i own was the flame of lust but i now begin to fansy if i could gain her heart i should revel in bliss for a whole year at least without being cloyed but how tedious do the moments pass continued the villain oh how i long for night how will the trembling slut be bit when instead of flying to the man she loves she will find herself in the embraces of one she detests this wood will once more be the bawd to my designs as soon as ever we have left the shore i will proceed to the enjoyment of the scornful dame  i must own this declaration made me shudder and i had once resolved to draw my pistols and shoot the villain through the head if the consideration of our project had not hindered me i waited with as much impatience as my rival did till the moment came of our decampment as soon as they were mounted i took horse and followed but my horse hearing other horses before him neighd several times which caused my leaders to stop however as there was but two and i in my disguise i resolved to push on and come up with em as i came even with the wretch and his companion they asked me where i was going i told em to such an inn naming the place where they were bound this fellow said the ruffian may hinder our design therefore we must prevent him though this was spoke in a whisper yet i heard it plain and began to repent of my forwardness in following them i therefore put spurs to my horse to get out of their reach  hold hold cried the master not so fast i want to speak with you i have a job for you to do which i will pay you well for it is only to go to the harbor which is not above three miles off and inquire for the speedwell galley that lies moored to the wharf bid em immediately unmoor and prepare for sailing and send the boat ashore to wait my coming which will not be above two hours if thou will do this there is a crown and if you will wait till i come i will give thee another thank you master said i with all my heart if your worship will bespeak a bed for me at the inn as you pass by ay that i will replied the wretch and a good supper beside i gave him thanks turned my horses head to go back again and resolved to do as he desired for then i should see the end of our project  when i came to the harbor i found the boats crew ashore waiting for their master when i had executed my commission the coxen cried what is the devil in my master does he think my memory so short that i should forget his orders in five hours i fansy so said i for he paid me well for my journey and yet but in part for i am to stay till he returns for the rest of my reward i think the open air is a little too cold to stay in it three or four hours together therefore if you will go with me to an alehouse i will spend part of my wages upon you a few words struck up the bargain and away we went  when the company were pretty well warmed with their liquor i began to ask em a few questions concerning their master intimating that we had been in treaty about my entering into his service why replied the coxen you had better stand still and walk horses as the saying is i own he is good at promising but the worst at performing i believe in the whole dominions of great britain how comes it to pass then said i that you will serve such a scurvy master why you know master replied the coxen we sailors are very blunt honest fellows therefore as i believe it is not in your power to hurt me i will tell you the truth we are all married or have settlements upon his plantations in the west indies therefore it is our interests and as he brought us out with him we must wink at his rogueries that he may carry us to our own plantations again otherwise i would leave him this instant for i dare swear he is upon some ill design this moment in return to your confidence of me i replied i can assure you it is so nay and such an action that not only may endanger his life but the lives of those that assist him in it upon this all the company began to look upon one another with countenances full of fear sblood if i thought that cried one the devil might assist him for me some baudy business cried another i suppose i dont care to hazard my life for any whore but my own i would venture my life said another in an engagement in hopes of plunder but i will see him d  d before i will have any thing to do with his dirty work  in short every sailor had something to say upon the occasion and i found by their sentiments they were all honest fellows or seemed so and the more they drank the more they seemed resolved to oppose him in any ill design i let em into some part of the story in order that they should stand the poor wretchs friend that by mistake might be brought among em for i did not doubt but when he found out the trick that was put upon him his brutality and disappointment would push him on to murder the woman this was the only motive that induced me to enter into conversation with em therefore i intended to take my leave but was prevented by a loud knocking at the door immediately after entered the wretch swearing abominably at the coxen and sailors in not being at the boat to wait his coming  the sailors began to grumble and told him they were not his slaves nor would be used as such i dont know where this dispute would have ended if the three fellows that were hired to murder me had not followed their master and desired to speak with him in private what is it you want with me you troublesome vermin cried the brute you know what we want replied one of them and therefore we expect to be satisfied before you go on board you know very well we were to have the reward when our business was finished and not keeping your word with us makes us imagine you intend to forget the rest of the money if we dont put you in mind of it you villains cried out their master if you mention one word more of that affair look to yourselves you know you goodfornothing rascals that it is in my power to hang you all therefore no more words or an halter shall be your reward you have been too well paid already a halter our reward cried the fellow and what should be his reward that put us upon such an action why you caitiffs you know very well cried their master i only ordered you to bastinado the rascal not to murder him and you clods if i had time to stay i would find out means to help you to the gallows come rogues said he to the sailors and fly to the boat this instant better words cried the sailors or you shall to sea by your self zounds we know you cannot do without us and therefore well be better treated and though most of your governors of plantations are bad enough yet there is one gone to take your place that we may expect justice from without paying for it what the devil i suppose there is a conspiracy in my absence replied the quondam governor who has put rebellion into your heads not you my honest friend i hope speaking to me the three fellows not observing me before seemed very much surpised at the sight of me and one of em cried out in a transport good god mr clermont what brought you here ha clermont said the wretch is the villain then living still i own i was very much surprised at this discovery but was brought out of it by his furious approach with his drawn hanger in his hand however i had presence of mind to pull my pistols out of my pocket and aimed one at his breast telling him if he offered to come one step forwarder i would shoot him dead at my feet  the sight of my pistols made him stop short and call to his men to seize me some of em not thinking what they did were going to obey his orders gentlemen said i hear me two words and i will deliver my self into your hands upon saying this they stopped and i informed em in short of their masters implacable hatred to me when they had heard my story they one and all cried out they would stand by me with their lives upon this he sullenly sat down and was some time before he opened his mouth a general silence followed but our eyes were busy looking at each other at last he opened in this manner sir can you forgive me for my past black designs against your life i own this contrition at this exigence looks like falsehood but upon the word of a man of honor i repent from the bottom of my heart of all my base actions when i look back on em it is with horror how amiable a figure do you make clothed in innocence and virtue and how like a fiend of hell do i look covered with such hateful crimes but repentance i hope may wash my stains away and i shall think i am in the first road to virtue if you will vouchsafe me your pardon and friendship my servants that i find have saved your innocent life shall receive the reward they expected for the humanity that their master wanted my seamen shall find me for the future such a commander as they can wish for and when we arrive in our own country their reward shall exceed their expectation  very well replied the coxen half drunk i have heard your worship talk at this rate before now ay ay cried another we know his tongue is well hung he promises as well as ever a gentleman in the universe and performs as ill i must confess said the intended ravisher the character my own servants give me is enough to startle a stranger but what other motive but repentance can make me declare myself in this manner i find myself a new man and only wonder at my former self all the while this dispute lasted i was inly ruminating how i should proceed i was in very great doubt of his sincerity for i observed in all his discourse he turned his eye very often upon the door as if he expected some of his men from the ship to take his part at least i thought so beside i wanted very much to confer with my landlord who i knew would accompany his wife though unknown to her therefore i told him i would go out to recompose my spirits and return immediately again very well he replied you are at your own liberty and it will be my utmost wish that when you come back you will forgive one that will ever think it his highest happiness to be esteemed your friend i made him no reply but went out and found my landlord who was waiting at the door with four or five more all in disguise and masked attending his good wife who seemed very impatient i told him what had happened and asked him advice how i should behave myself damn him he replied dont trust him for if you do he will certainly deceive you but however conceal yourself somewhere about the house till i go in and feel his pulse for i must get rid of madam some how  i consented to his going in for i concluded it was the only way to try his sincerity for if he really repented he would restore his pretended lady to her liberty therefore i retired to wait the event however upon second thoughts i judged it the safest course to get my horse ready for fear of things just as i was leading him out of the stable i perceived my landlord and the gentleman coming toward me and i must confess did not know what to think of it but they stopped as soon as they were got out of hearing of the people about the door why it is a terrible business i own said my landlord to be disappointed in your revenge for i will engage he is two miles off by this time for he mounted immediately and flew away like lightning damn him replied my false penitent i wish his horse may break his neck not impossible cried my landlord but since he is gone let us proceed to business your men you may depend on it will soon return to their duty now mr clermont has left em therefore give me my reward and i wish you luck and a boon voyage there it is putting a purse in his hand all in gold i hope your worship replied my landlord has not put a trick upon me no on my word returned the villain you are the only one i intend not to deceive and if you will send me word you have murdered clermont i will send thee the next return after it a hundred hogsheads of the best sugar in my plantations my thoughts were very much confused before but in hearing this i forgot all patience i drew a pistol from my pocket and running up cried no villain heaven has reserved me to punish such a mortal devil as thou art i discharged my pistol at his head and seeing him fall mounted my horse and flew away like lightning in earnest i rid six or seven miles before my troubled thoughts returned to reason and then when i began to think i condemned myself for being so rash and thought of the crime i had committed in killing a wretch with all his sins about him  i did not go home that night neither should i have thought of reposing myself if my horse had not put me in mind of it by seeming jaded but being far from any house i drove him into a meadow and sat under a hedge till break of day when i got home my good uncle saw visibly the discontent was increased in my countenance but i would not wound his peace farther by telling him what had befallen me i only feigned some slight indisposition therefore staid at home three or four days but under terrible inquietudes and what increased my apprehensions i heard nothing from my mistress for several days beyond the usual time the only consolation was that no intelligence came concerning the death of the wretch i supposed i had killed for i was well assured if i had been called to an account for it the fatal inquiry would have broke the heart of my pious uncle  i was almost afraid to go to my landlords as i called him though i had no reason to doubt his honesty and wondered i had not seen him in so many days therefore after many irresolutions i ventured to visit him in my disguise as usual when i came to his house they told me he was ill of a fever i asked a countryman that was drinking at the door concerning him i dont know says the countryman the mans a fool i think he takes it much in dudgeon that his wife has made him a cuckold and you know sir it is many an honest mans fortune now i think he has reason to be out of his wits with joy that he has got rid of a devilish wife by this fellows discourse i understood every thing had succeeded to his wish but i trembled to think in what manner i feared he might have murdered her to break his marriage bonds and was very uneasy to know the truth while the fellow and i were talking a maidservant came to me and asked me if i was not the person that brought a letter to her master some time ago i was something surprised at the question and did not readily give her an answer if you are the same person said she perceiving i said nothing you need not be afraid my master only ordered me to bring you up stairs if you should come here at any time i followed her to her masters chamber without opening my lips i found him on his bed and seemingly very weak when the door was shut he arose  well sir said he my ends are accomplished though in such a manner that has given me very great uneasiness for notwithstanding i had all the reason in the world to despise my wife yet her deplorable end though it shows the judgment of the almighty upon wicked persons has cast me into such a dreadful melancholy that i believe i shall never shake it off when you sir fired your pistol at the base villain that deserves the worst of deaths the report frighted the horse my wife rode on to such a degree that he ran away with her and plunging into the sea threw her off we tried all means to save her but she sunk to the bottom and we never more saw her it was supposed the tide of ebb carried her into the main ocean well but landlord said i how did you proceed with the men after the villain was killed alas sir replied my landlord you was not so lucky to make an end of him for one of the balls only grazed upon the top of his forehead and it is not improbable but the other might wound the horse my wife rode on which made him so outrageous  when the wretch got up again and found the smallness of his hurt he was for pursuing you but was prevented by the unfortunate accident of my wife he mourned very much the loss of his mistress as he thought and i own it was some good luck to me that she was not discovered to be otherwise for he is of such an implacable temper i dont know how far his revenge might have carried him for after we had tried in vain to find out the unfortunate wretch he was still upon a project of making an end of you but i wrought him into such a belief that i would certainly do it for him that he gave me twenty guineas for the job as he called it his men indeed grumbled much but the three servants that were hired to murder you would not be prevailed upon to go on board till he had satisfied em according to his promise he made many excuses telling em he had not money enough about him at last he gave em twenty guineas apiece and assured em he would give em the rest when he had them on board but notwithstanding his fair promises when their horses were embarked and every thing ready to go off with the boat the three men were no where to be found they searched in vain for some time and were obliged to set sail without them i suppose his uneasiness was for fear they should discover his damnable intrigues  as soon as the ship was out of harbor i got upon my horse and came home but was very much surprised to find the horse that run away with my wife into the sea and supposed to be drowned at home before me all this is what i wanted to declare to you and would have waited on you but my melancholy and indisposition prevented me  i told him he ought to consider that a bad wife was a good thing to get rid of and though i was as much concerned for the manner of it as he could be yet it was very probable when the villain had found out the trick that was put upon him but his brutality would have drove him to give her the same death or an usage worse than death i own it replied my landlord and since it seems to be the hand of heaven i ought to be satisfied but even what i have gained by it seems at present to give me very little contentment and i should have been willing to have forgiven her if i thought she could have returned to her duty but i hope time will wipe off this score of melancholy however if i can be of any service to you in your amor you may freely command me  i was very much rejoiced at this kind offer and told him it was the only thing he could oblige me in since i knew he had the liberty of going to the house of my mistress unsuspected i therefore freely declared to him the whole progress of my love and the uneasiness i was in for not hearing from my fair one well said he notwithstanding my weakness if you will give me a letter of credence i will promise you an answer tomorrow and i shall think i am doing a good work in endeavoring to join two bodies whose souls are united in heaven i was in such a transport at his manner of speaking that i embraced him with the ardour of a sincere friend as indeed he always proved himself such a one to me and i think sincerely in such lowborn souls such honesty is almost a miracle i sat my self down immediately to write to my dear eliza  if you would know the torment i endure in not seeing or bearing from you think a person on the rack with his torturers inflicting every torment that mortal life can bear and that is but a faint idea of what i suffer the bearer of this i am not ashamed of calling friend notwithstanding the disparity of our conditions ease my tormented soul with a line from that hand which only can relieve the pain i undergo i have something to relate to my dear eliza of what has befallen me since i last saw those lovely eyes that is something surprising do not thou keep me upon the rack of despair any longer but contrive with the bearer to give me a meeting once more if you would save the life of  yours eternally clermont   when i had finished my epistle i read it to my landlord who said so many things above his station that i was surprised at his manner of expressing himself he took my letter and assured me he would bring me some answer if he ventured his life for it i took my leave of him and resolved to return the next day in hope of a favorable answer when i offered to reward him for the trouble he was undertaking he absolutely refused it and was almost angry with me for proposing any such thing no said he be assured i am no mercenary messenger and though i have transacted an affair with that wretch that looks like guilt i will never while i live harbor a mean thought but hope to convince you that a person without birth or education can pursue virtue as well as those who have that advantage of us  i returned the next day before noon but my landlord was not come back the disappointment gave me the utmost uneasiness at last he came and gave me a letter which i knew by the superscription came from my adorable eliza though wrote with a pencil the contents were short as follows my dear clermont i am and ever will be your  eliza     my dear friend said i to my landlord i am infinitely obliged to you for the pains you have taken but am surprised though pleased at the shortness of her answer sir said my landlord i have a wonderful story to relate to you and i doubt not but twill surprise you as it did me but first read that letter which i received just now from one of the servants that was hired to murder you  mr cheeseman i would have you be on your guard meeting the coxen of my quondam masters ship i own i was much surprised to find him in england whom i thought many leagues off he informed me that going out of the harbor the morning that our hurlyburly happened the tide being ebbed more than they imagined they struck upon a sandbank where they were obliged to wait for the next tide of flood to carry her off during that time the corpse of the woman whose horse carried her into the sea was found which being taken up proved to be your wife and by several letters in her pocket it was supposed that you with the confederacy of mr clermont had contrived to impose upon my master be it which way he will he fancies so and has vowed bloody revenge upon you both therefore i send you this by the desire of the coxen that you may provide against one whom no law has fetters strong enough to bind from doing crimes too bad to name take the advice of  your humble servant richard cross   the reading of this letter i must own very much alarmed me now said my landlord i will relate the history of my journey when i came to elizas fathers house whose servant i was and whose tenant i am i went with the pretense of paying him his rent though not due this week but guess my surprise when as soon as i entered i saw that execrable villain the captain walking in the garden with my old master i knew it was not my business to be seen by him though i was then ignorant of the affair related in the letter from mr cross therefore watching them till they came into the house i went into the garden a back way to consider as well as my troubled thoughts would let me what i should do the respect i had for you prevented my returning without delivering your letter though i knew i staid in the mouth of danger while i was beating my brains to no purpose i saw my young mistress eliza come into the garden overwhelmed with sorrow i took my opportunity to speak with her and gave her your letter which she received with the utmost joy  she informed me that the wretch the captain had been there three days and her father was so much rejoiced to find him alive that by report was thought dead that he resolved to force her to be his wife in a few days but she bid me assure you she would sooner lay violent hands upon herself than ever consent to give her hand to such a monster of mankind we had not time for much conversation for that moment her father sent for her in she only took the opportunity of writing with my pencil upon the blank leaf of your letter that line i brought you immediately after i saw em all three come into the garden so thought it high time to make the best of my way  during this short relation my mind felt he utmost inquietudes all the passions incident to human nature took their turns within my breast but at length revenge got the better and i came to a firm resolution of making a sure end of that barbarous wretch the cause of all my misfortunes i communicated my thoughts to my landord who very strongly dissuaded me from t but to no purpose when he found his reasons had no force upon me he offered me his assistance we were some time before we could form a proper method to accomplish my design but at length we fixed upon sending him the following letter  sir i am informed for certain that your coxen with the rest of your men have resolved to run away with your ship and i am assured nothing but your speedy appearance can prevent em every person but myself is in the conspiracy and i am seemingly so that i might have this opportunity of letting you know their villainy no matter for my name but you shall know me when you see me by my wearing an old goldlacd hat which no one on board has but myself i would have you come alone for i will take care to prevent their design till i see you if you are expeditious for i have a secure method with your assistance only to put an end to their farther villainy without danger therefore pray sir communicate this affair to no one person till i see you  your obedient servant etc   this letter we conveyed to him the same evening and followed the messenger as imagining he might take horse immediately i let my landlord into my manner of proceeding and ordered him to retire as soon as he should see the wretch appear with an injunction on him if i should be killed to bury me as privately as possible and let my uncle have a letter i had wrote to him wherein i had informed him of every thing that happened to the present moment  our letter had the desired effect for at the dusk of the evening my landlord acquainted me the groom was getting his horse ready and he found he intended to go alone according to the purport of the letter therefore full of the spirit of revenge i rid on about two miles before where i waited for him upon an open common that lay in his way i never gave myself time to think all this while what might be the consequence of such an action in a quarter of an hour i saw him enter the common i rid up to him and bid him stop at my manner of proceeding he took me for a highwayman for he told me very calmly he had nothing about him worth my venturing my life for no wretch said i i come for thy blood who has often endeavored to spill that of the unhappy clerimont clerimont cried he in a transport the only man i wished to have met with and though i have an affair of consequence upon my hands yet i will stay to put an end to thy detestable life i had no time to ask him what arms he carried not intending to take any advantage of him for as soon as he had done speaking he fired a pistol at me it was so well aimed that i heard the balls whistle through my hair i was not long behind him but returned him one in exchange that shot his horse stone dead the sudden fall of his horse prevented his getting clear of the beast therefore i alighted from mine and disengaged him from him though such impious villains deserve no humanity said i yet i can never forget i am a gentleman he made me no reply but drawing his hanger ran furiously upon me aiming a blow at my head that would have ended all my misfortunes if i had not received it on my left arm i found the stroke had wounded me very much therefore before he could redouble his blow i shot him through the head he gave a groan fell down and expired  i had then lost all my resentment and ran to help him up but i found the top of his skull shot away and his brains upon the ground for though it was night the moon was up and i could not help standing in a fixed posture to view the horrid act as it was then represented to my fancy my hand had done but my friendly landlord roused me from my thoughts that i might take care of my safety for he told me he heard the galloping of horses in the lane that led to the common the way we came therefore we mounted our horses and rid away he leading a full speed and i following not knowg well what i was doing so full of trou re my thoughts after my wound  i went home and concealed no  uncle who was under terrible apprehensions we learnt afterward the horses we heard were the father of my mistress and several servants who followed the unfortunate wretch as imagining some extraordinary business by the change of his countenance when he read the letter i sent him they took up the body and buried him privately in the chapel that very night searching him they found the letter that was the cause of his sudden departure and though i had disguised my hand yet my dear eliza guessed the letter came from me and that imagination gave her insupportable uneasiness  the next day her father with all his servants rid to the port to examine concerning the affair and eliza knowing they could not return till the next day sent to my landlord to be informed concerning the tragical affair before he went to her he sent to give me notice where he was going though a dreadful melancholy had seized me and the pain of my wound was troublesome i immediately put on my disguise and followed him to elizas i met him returning but prevailed on him to go back with me and if possible to procure me a meeting with my dear mistress he complied with my request and my landlord having related every circumstance of my affairs before i received this consolation from my mistress that she could but barely blame me for my conduct in the danger i exposed my self to  we parted with mutual vows of constancy but with sad presages of what befell us afterward  it was about this time your noble uncle fixed his eyes upon me for your tutor though i must own i had no inclinations that way for i was yet fed with hope fortune would still befriend me in my love  a full month past on without hearing any thing from my dear eliza my landlord was forbid ever entering the doors of her cruel father and no reason given for such treatment though it was not hard to guess we understood eliza was under the strictest confinement i was almost distracted with this cruel proceeding but had no other remedy than patience  one day as i was walking in our courtyard ruminating on my sad state a footman brought me a letter the superscription i soon knew to be my dear elizas he told me it required no answer and disappeared in a moment i broke open the seal with trembling fingers and to my astonishment found what follows sir i send you this to tell you that fortune will have us entire strangers to each other therefore it is my only request to you that i may never see you more  eliza     i will omit to tell you the many different passions i felt at the perusal of this cruel epistle but i fixed a resolution to see the ungrateful if it cost me my life for before her eyes i intended to put an end to it if i could ever get a sight of her  near her house the severn streamed along which you well know enriched the neighboring towns with her watercarriage i put myself in the habit of a bargeman and addressing myself to elizas fathers gardener told him if he pleased to allow me my provision i would work with him till the return of the boat i belonged to which is a thing very common in that country the bargemen going to work at any farming affair till their boat is towed up with horses where there is a tract for em when there is no tract men supply their places i was admitted and the second day saw eliza and made myself known to her though i had not the opportunity of speaking to her she was confined in a room two pair of stairs next the garden i thought by the signs she made me she was still faithful which i was confirmed in the next morning busying myself as near to her as i could she threw a handkerchief down which i took up unperceived by any one in it was the following letter my dear clerimont the letter you received my cruel father dictated and forced me with threats of severest vengeance on you to write be assured my heart shall be ever yours and if i cannot reward your faithful passion i will resign my self into the arms of death to avoid the embraces of any person living but those of my dear clerimont my father is making all the search imaginable after the murderers as he calls em of his friend therefore be careful of yourself and preserve your life for her who shall be ever your  eliza p s i farther beg you will not hazard your self in this manner though it is the greatest joy i can be capable of knowing to see you but i conjure you would depend on my conduct and trust to time to cure those wounds of absence       this letter made me shake hands with life again which i had almost numbered among my greatest enemies i immediately left my new employment and went home to my uncles who was ever pressing me to accept of that office which i now can call my only consolation i found means to let my adorable eliza know his solicitation on that account who also persuaded me to it giving me her faith to be ever constant but i believe i should never be prevailed upon to be so far from the object of my love if elizas father had not resolved to prosecute me for killing that unfortunate wretch and my uncle was informed he had suborned witnesses to rob me of my life therefore after settling a correspondence between my uncle my landlord and my lovely eliza i bound my self to your commands i have received several letters from all three which came in your packets that gave me an account of the welfare of my mistress among other things letting me know after my absence she had her full liberty as before but when you have read this last letter i hope you will forgive me if death should release me from that duty which i paid you to my last moments  my dear nephew my hand trembles not through age but concern when i am forced to give you the melancholy account of the death of your mistress eliza her cruel father would force her to wed a person whose courtship was hateful to her upon your account to prevent which the morning of her detested nuptials she took poison and expired at the altar my dear child arm yourself with that divine weapon patience and with the assistance of heaven combat those dreadful ills that assail thee man was born to suffer and i think it no crime for one of my cloth to repeat a line out of a play though upon this sad occasion  who would fardles bear to groan and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of but i hope my dear nephew will bear all with an angels patience which is the hearty wish of  your affectionate uncle   i must own i was very much affected with the story and the more because it resembled my own fortune the reflection gave me much uneasiness i sent for him and we mingled our sighs and tears together  now pray sir said my tutor think after the load of grief which is fixed upon me whether death is not the only friend that can shake it off i strove to comfort him with the little eloquence i was master of but bid him have recourse to his uncles last letter and that would teach him life was not given us to dispose of as we pleased that was a sin never to be repented of and must i then bear this load of life he replied perhaps till gray hairs appear upon my head no no sorrow sure will do its office let friendship my dear governor said i supply the place of love and that from me you may entirely depend on he at last resolved to suffer all he told me purely to oblige me  i now began to be in terrible anxieties on my own account for in my last letters from my uncle he mentioned nothing of my dear isabella i remembered with grief of mind i had left behind me a very powerful rival endowed with wealth and title the pride of the female sex but then i thought isabella had none of her sexs frailties and i would sooner believe the legend of the wonderful images of the portugals than think she could prove false in the church of boucas a village near the city of oporto in the capital of the province enter douro e minho in portugal is placed a crucifix bigger than the life averred to be wrought by nicodemus it was cast up by the sea and when it was first found wanted an arm there were many curious workmen employed to make the image complete but as soon as the arm was fixed on it immediately flew off again to the amazement of the artists in short there were as many arms made as would have served another briareus or a chinese idol to no purpose but at last as the good fathers are truly traditionally informed one was found floating on the sea and being applied to the image stuck so fast without the assistance of the statuary that it could not be taken off again and though the body and arm were found at some years distance it proved to be the true arm  at santarem a town in the province of estremadura in portugal is another wonderful image of our blessed savior an infant that has outgrown several niches made purposely for it and though first a child when erected yet they protest it now is full six foot high and has almost outgrown the last nich and if it should proceed in thriving at this rate it is to be feared the roof of the church must be removed to make room for it    we embarked on board of one of the king of spains galleys for genoa in order to view some part of italy for i found it impracticable to go by land as my lovely isabella advised me in her letter but before i left spain i sent my uncle my father and mistress an account of every thing that befell me and where i was bound next  my poor governor was still inconsolable though he strove to appear cheerful in complaisance to me but i found his malady had struck him to the soul and i feared death would lay his icy hands upon him yet i had hope variety of objects might help him sometimes to forget his grief and indeed his fortune having something resembling my own made me doubly suffer with him i had forgot to ask him who the person was we saw at paris that gave him so much uneasiness and when it came into my memory forbore to ask him for fear i should recall his sufferings up afresh but when we arrived at genoa we found that young nobleman there where he avoided him as before he then informed me it was a distant relation of his of the roman persuasion that had often done him ill offices upon the account of his being a protestant and farther to make him hate him had begun to make his addresses to his dear eliza purely in contradiction to him upon that account i resolved to make but a short stay there  the city of genoa no doubt is very ancient some will have janus the founder though i cannot but think the word janua implies a gate and it was certainly in the time of the romans one of the gates to italy it was undoubtedly a city of great power when rome flourished for livy tells me liguria genoa being its capital revolted against em when rome triumphed over africa asia and greece their armies pressed the romans to that degree that they offered vows to jupiter stator to stop the progress of the ligurians but at last more by policy than force it was made a province of italy  of all the countries in the universe genoa seems the most abandoned by nature but certainly the most assisted by human industry for notwithstanding the barrenness of the situation among high cliffs and fruitless mountains one of the proudest cities of europe raises her aspiring head there is not one foot of earth in their noble gardens but stands em in as much as an acre in wales this proud city suffered much in the reign of lewis xiv by a hostile fleet sent to punish the state for some misdemeanors which forced them to a disadvantageous peace the duke is invested with a regal crown at his inauguration for the island of corsica being part of their dominions they give it the title of a kingdom  at this city i received a packet from england brought me by a young gentleman of the sweetest countenance i ever saw though the letters he gave me almost distracted me that from my uncle was as follows my dear child dispose thyself to hear the most uncomfortable news fortune could prepare for thee thy dear father is no more my tears flow so fast i can hardly write thee the following account that pernicious woman the complication of all ill women in one has deceived both thee and me last week my dear brother thy father sent a messenger to me desiring me to come to him without delay i found him almost expiring when i entered the room where he lay the first object i perceived was the vile womans son john stretched dead upon the ground the sight very much surprising me thy father faintly called me to come near that said he is the first part of the punishment due to my cruel murderess this morning continued your father that wretch my wife sent me my tea as usual when she would not favor me with her company and the unfortunate boy bringing an excuse from his mother that she could not breakfast with me i detained him to keep me company it was not long before the mother followed him and inquired in the utmost confusion whether he had drank any of the tea the boy resolved her he had drank two dishes i found by her extravagant exclamations there was something extraordinary in the affair and soon found we were both poisoned in my rage i drew my sword and made her partake of the same bitter cup more than once then locked her in that closet where i have heard no stirring these three hours perhaps the period of her wicked life is come for i find my own approaching dear brother i have very little to say the rugged hand of death has seized me pray keep this story secret if it is possible and be a father to my dear boy he would have said more but the pangs of death stopped his tongue and his eyes closed for ever the mournful sight drove me into such a furious passion that i drew my sword in order to sacrifice the author of our misfortune but when i opened the closetdoor there was not any body to be found searching about i perceived some linen tied to the foot of your fathers escritore which hung out of the window going to see how she had made her escape i perceived her body lie breathless under the window upon the ground with her brains on a large stone the only one i believe in the whole garden the linen i find broke about a foot below the sash she went out at she has suffered by the hand of heaven it is true but we have lost a brother and a father by her wickedness who imposed upon our easy natures come my dear son for i now must call you so and comfort me for this irreparable loss nothing but your sight can assuage my grief come and take possession of a fortune that can overbalance that of isabellas let us mingle our tears together to moisten the ashes of your good fathers grave but grieve not too much my child for fear you should endanger that life which is entirely wrapped up in yours i have concealed our misfortunes as much as possible and the coroner my friend has brought in the affair accidental death and the world is imposed on in such a manner that they imagine there was not any design in the melancholy story the relation has so much dispirited me that i have hardly strength to subscribe myself  thy dear uncle and father etc p s all thy brothers are gone to eternity before thy father except thy brother jonathan whom we have not heard any news from these seven years and we may reasonably suppose he rests in peace in the grave       this letter put me out of love with life and my good governor gave me that comfort he had formerly received from me but had it not been for the consideration of my uncle and my divine isabella i believe i should have called death to my aid the letter i received from her gave me some consolation it was wrote in such a touching manner for my loss with the lamentation of her whole family and her dependence on my life and love that i resolved to live if it was but to thank her for her tenderness though i must own i felt the utmost concern in the loss of that consolative epistle it was three whole days before i inquired for the young gentleman that brought me the packet but what was my surprise when my governor brought him to see me and at the same time told me in that young gentleman i beheld his amiable eliza i forgot all my sorrows at so unexpected a rencounter and my heart overflowed with an inexpressible joy on the behalf of my governor i could hardly believe my senses what cried i dead and revived again i must own replied the charming eliza my story is a little romantic but the obligations my lover has received from you shall prevail upon me to relate that part of it which you are a stranger to and though i ought to blush at this transformation i am sure you will forgive me when you know it proceeds from love  after our illfortune had separated us a gentleman of a great estate related to clerimont renewed his fulsome addresses to me and though of a different religion my father gave his cruel consent and the day was fixed for our nuptials by the advice of a female acquaintance i drank a sleeping draught which deprived me seemingly of all the faculties of life when the intended bridegroom came he was very easy under his disappointment and said to one of his servants loud enough to be heard by my father pox on it this had been lucky enough dick if she had staid till the day after our wedding very true replied the servant the weddingsheets and the shroud are the best linen can be put on a woman and the sooner she changes returned the master the better then with a horselaugh without taking any leave they rid away  my father was very much incensed at his brutal behavior and as i found afterward repented his usage of me he prepared a magnificent funeral but i spared him the trouble in coming to life again and i must own never received any testimony of his tenderness before he caressed me with all the love expected from a parent vowing never more to force my inclination and spoke several favorable things of my dear clerimont but alas the funeral he had taken such pains to furnish out for me proved in some fort for himself for two days after my revival leaning over a balcony to give some directions to the workmen in the garden it gave way and he fell never to rise again in this world  the fatal accident notwithstanding i was a free woman and mistress of a plentiful fortune gave me unspeakable discontent for by his behavior to me i began to revive the love and duty which his former severity had almost killed after i had performed the funeral rites i began to think of my dear clerimont and being informed by his good uncle he had wrote him an account of my supposed death took a resolution of undeceiving him myself therefore embarked for barcelona in a ship of my own since my fathers death as a passenger unknown to any one after settling my affairs at home i soon found you out and had the pleasure of seeing the deep melancholy growing in the face of my lover i embarked with you for genoa without discovering myself or ever appearing before him but in the night to observe his sighs going to the post house here i found that fatal packet directed for you and took that opportunity to wait on you though had i understood the contents of it i should not so readily have brought it last night i revealed myself to clerimont for i could no longer bear his sorrows and today he has brought me to pay you the thanks suitable to your goodness but as i have not words sufficient i beg you would take even my silence for the force of eloquence working in my mind that should be my task replied my governor but i am as incapable as you for i find the torrent of joy poured so unexpectedly in upon me has made such a revolution in my soul that my body is not able to bear the transport therefore dear sir think your self what a grateful heart would say and imagine my thanks  the good fortune of these happy lovers was the balm to the extreme sorrow i felt i was resolved to return for england with my governor and his mistress in the first vessel of our country that was ready but at last it was agreed to travel by land for the better convenience of eliza  while we were providing for our journey a galley of genoa arrived with a corsair of barbary she had taken after a bloody resistance there were six and thirty slaves redeemed from a wretched captivity they had undergone on board the corsair hearing there was one englishman among em i resolved to relieve him and carry him home along with me after his hard sufferings my governor went according to my desire and brought him to me at first sight i was struck with a tenderness i could not give any account for but after a little conference i found it was my brother jonathan who had been absent above eight years i never considered i had met with one that would take some part of my fortune from me but the joy i received in relieving an only brother from misery gave me the utmost satisfaction he gave me his history in the following manner  the history of mr jonathan vaughan you were so young my dear brother when i left my fathers house in order to make a campaign in flanders that i believe you can hardly remember it my brother richard and i were both cadets at the siege of namur and though we behaved our selves perhaps with courage enough we gained nothing more than several dangerous wounds that confined us to our quarters longer than we desired for our glorious monarch king william took that place held before as impregnable while we had the mortification of being under the surgeons hands  when we had strength enough to go to the field the campaign was ended and our money falling short we could not provide necessaries to embark for england with the king without making figures below our birth we wrote to our father laying before him our necessities and had  0 l paid us by a banker of amsterdam with this small pittance we had the disagreeable news of by fathers second marriage and a scurvy hint that money would not be so ready for the future this put us almost out of our senses for  0 l would not go far with a couple of young fellows just coming into the world that were obliged to live like gentlemen however to make the best on it we discharged our servants sold our horses with some part of our unnecessary equipage and raised our bank to a hundred pistoles with this small stock we embarked for ireland where we were informed our king intended to be at the head of his troops early the following spring for it was strongly reported the rebels had gathered together a formidable army there but meeting an english vessel in the channel this news was contradicted they gave us an account of the assassinationplot and that every thing was quiet in ireland this put an end to all our hopes of getting employment therefore we intended to land in england and steer our course homeward but providence intended otherwise  the fifth day after we put to sea we discovered the lizard and a french privateer at the same time we had but ten men besides seven passengers and four guns therefore made all the sail we could to avoid em but to no purpose we fought em briskly for half an hour but losing three of our sailors and two of our passengers among whom our poor brother richard lost his life whose death had almost ended mine we surrendered and were carried prisoners to st malos st malo maclovipolis aletha maclovia is a seaport in the province of bretagne in france it is built upon a small island joined to the main land by a large bridge though the town is not large it is wellpeopled strong and rich by traffic from this port in time of war with england or holland many privateers are sent to infest the english channel  by good fortune i had concealed the best part of our money in the waistband of my breeches and the captain seeing my grief for the loss of my dear brother prevented my being searched restoring me all our little equipage and used me with a tender friendship when we landed i was not imprisoned with the rest of our unfortunate men but was almost compelled to live with the captain i freely owned to him the money i concealed but he would not touch a penny  i wrote several letters to my father wherein i acquainted him with my hard fortune and the death of my poor brother begging him to relieve me from my misfortunes by paying my ransom which i had agreed with my captain for three hundred crowns i could have satisfied him with what little money i had but he refused it telling me he would stay till it was sent me by my friends that he might have more of my company i received but one letter to the many i sent and that gave me hopes i should have the money i wrote for by the first opportunity but i waited in painful expectation near a twelvemonth to no purpose and my little stock was almost spent besides my clothes were pretty well wore out and i began to fear i should want common necessaries  my captain continued very kind to me notwithstanding the reason he had to the contrary nay offered me my freedom on my bare word but my heart would not let me accept it at last he pressed me to go to sea with him but i told him whatever obligations i had to him i hoped he would excuse me if i refused to fight against my own king and country i might have entered into the service of a nobleman but my spirit would not permit me i must own i had a longing desire to signalize myself by the sword and an opportunity happened some time after that seemed to favor my design  the french fitted out a fleet of ships to bombard tunis tunis is a city and seaport upon the coast of barbary governed by a bey or dey though subservient to the emperor of constantinople it is large strong and very well peopled their chief riches consist in their corsairs who generally take all the vessels of what nation soever though perhaps at peace it is seated in a plain near the lake barbasueco nine leagues from the ruins of the ancient carthage  under the command of the chevalier fourbin a gentleman well experienced in maritime affairs i was recommended to the captain of the superbe by my friend who received me very cordially  when we arrived at tunis we bombarded it for six days and almost reduced it to ashes there were several merchantships within the bar that the corsairs had taken from several nations one we were informed was richly laden with our captains consent i took fifteen men well armed and in the middle of the night we rowed into the harbor under the mouths of their cannon cut her cable and brought her off but the ships sails being taken off the yards we were obliged to tow her away with our longboat the whole bulwarks thundered upon us incessantly and at last an unlucky shot tore to pieces our longboat what became of the rest of the men i know not for never having learnt to swim i soon lost my senses  by the beams of the morningsun i began to open my eyes and perceived i was cast upon a ridge of sand that the tide of ebb had left uncovered under a rock at the back of the town yet out of sight either of the ships or harbor though i could hear the moors voices above me i was very faint and found it difficult to rise but i recovered some strength when i had disgorgd the vast quantity of seawater i had swallowed by good fortune i had a small brandybottle in my pocket that was of great service in reviving my spirits  i began to walk but to my great grief found i had above two miles to go upon the sand before i could come to an opening of the country and to add to my misfortune the tide was flowing very fast so that if i did not make haste it would overtake me before i could get away judge then my distress if i staid where i was i must have inevitably been drowned and if i went on i had no hopes but of being a miserable slave  i walked as fast as i could though heaven knows with a heavy heart yet sometimes i thought as i was an englishman it might be of some advantage to me and therefore formed a story in my mind that i hoped would prevent my falling into slavery  when i had got off the sand i perceived the country about me was chiefly gardens but being fatigued through heat and weakness i was obliged to sit down under a high wall of reeds designed for a fence to a garden behind me under this shade my sorrows and reflections brought sleep upon me whether i would or no for i strove to resist it but was soon i believe awaked by dirt and weeds that were thrown upon me out of the garden behind the surprise made me cry out upon the instant i heard people call out to me as i supposed in the moorish language though i could not understand em i got up and walked on and immediately was met by four moorish gardeners as i imagined by their implements i went submissively up to em though i perceived they were in some consternation by their faces we talked together though we could not understand one another at last one of em went from the rest and returned in a few minutes with two more one of em seemed to be their master by his habit and the other was a spanish slave i understood enough of that language by the help of my latin to let him into the knowledge of my being an englishman when their master found that an english youth about thirteen or fourteen years of age was sent for this boy as i was informed afterward was taken in an english vessel when he was about nine years of age going to maryland with his parents who both died with grief at their misfortune and the lad was prevailed upon to turn mohammedan i told him i was an englishman taken prisoner by the french and made my escape from em in the night in one of their boats alone but being unacquainted with the coast was thrown upon the sandbank the moor ordered me to be asked if i understood the mathematics or navigation or whether i had any friends at tunis i replied as to the mathematics i had no knowledge of them as being designed for the landservice but i hoped every englishman would be a friend to their wretched countryman in distress i added i did intend to apply to the consul at tunis but the moor informed me the english consul and most of their merchants had abandoned the city on account of its being bombarded by the french  in short i found by all his discourse he intended me for one of his slaves it would avail me nothing to reason with him therefore i was forced through a fatal necessity to accept of my chains as cheerfully as i could i was taken into the house through the garden with some seeming civility and had a comfortable supper if my sorrows had not spoiled my stomach though i eat and slept alone upon a bed made of rice straw but alas reflection brought ten thousand daggers to my heart and rest was almost a stranger for many days  my master never troubled himself about the siege yet i had the curiosity to inquire of the english lad how things went and had some pleasure to hear that the ship we got out of the mole was safe in the french fleet  my chief business at first was to look after three arabian horses that belonged to my master and i happened to do my business so well that he gave me some encouragement and his son about seventeen would be never out of my company  in three months time i made a very good progress in the moorish tongue i could make shift to talk with my master in his own language i begged the favor of him to let me see the city of tunis but he would not let me stir out of his house the french fleet did not stay long after my unfortunate accident but i learnt by the boy they had reduced the city almost to ruins the reason of my masters not permitting me to go into tunis was as i supposed for fear i should meet with some merchants that might procure me my freedom  understanding i could play a little on the flute he procured me several very good ones with which i had the misfortune to please him more than i desired but alas what is music to a wretch that every moment longed for liberty or with what fancy could i touch the instrument when my thoughts were ever fixed upon my hard fate however i was the more esteemed by him and i must confess if all their slaves were used as i was they could have nothing to trouble them but their want of liberty but libertys the salt of life and nothing can relish without it or supply its place  my master lived a luxurious idle life as all the moors do that have not employments all his time was spent in eating drinking praying sleeping performing the ablution the ablution is a washing which the turks and moors perform after they think themselves polluted by the conversation of women sleeping doing the effects of nature touching a christian or a drop of wine spilt on their garments nay some are so superstitious never more to wear those garments  or visiting his wives they were five in number but i cannot describe their beauty never having an opportunity to see their faces but their shape and air seemed very inviting i often saw some of em at a distance in the garden with their faces veiled for none of the slaves are allowed to speak to them or even to come near enough to do it would be an unpardonable crime  i began now to think all hopes of seeing my own country were over with me for i could not find the means of sending a letter to my father in england all the consolation i had in my misery was that my master never importuned me on the account of my religion i spent four years in my terrible servitude for i always thought it so notwithstanding my favorable usage in the beginning of the fifth year of my wretched slavery my master died and his son took possession of his fathers fortune i began now to feel the hopes of freedom revive in my soul again for the young moor seemed to have some friendship for me but alas i found to my terrible consternation he was possessed with the most hateful passion man can be guilty of he soon altered his usage of me when i let him know i would rather suffer death than comply with his infamous desires i can hardly mention it without blushing his ill treatment upon that account plunged me into despair for to be revenged on me he not only put me upon the most servile offices but i often suffered the bastinado the bastinado is a number of blows with a thick cudgel on the soles of the feet which sometimes makes the sufferer incapable of walking many days the moors not only punish slaves that way but mahometans also when they are guilty of theft and not able to return what they stole  i believe if i could have procured any weapons i should have cut him in pieces and put an end to my own anguish by a voluntary death  the young english mohammedan often gave me some consolation by mingling tears with me but alas that tenderness was all he could give me and that very secretly my miseries increased upon me and i begged the youth to procure me a dose of opium that i might sink into an eternal sleep and lose my life and misery together but i could not prevail upon him  my new beast of a master about a month after the death of his father was obliged to take a journey to look after the estate that was left him i knew not how far he was to go but i was informed his affairs would keep him in the country forty days at least so i resolved in that time to make some attempts to escape though i lost my life  when he was gone i had little business to do and was well used for even the moorish servants were concerned for my barbarous treatment when they had an opportunity they would come to hear me play on the flute and always bring something to make merry with  one evening an old woman came to me before the rest of the servants and gave me a letter which i opened and to my surprise found the following words in english sir though i write to you in english i am a moor by birth and daughter to the illustrious fontimama that was the name of my old patron while he was alive i was contented with my condition but since the angel of death has taken him from me my brother grows most insupportably tyrannous in short i have heard your story and pitied you before i was capable of love but now i have seen you though in disguise last night unknown to you or any one but the bearer of this i must confess myself absolutely yours if we can join our hands in the holy bands of wedlock  i know you will be surpised when i tell you though all my friends are followers of mahomet yet i am a sincere christian in my heart without baptism and my manner of being one i shall let you know mustapha the name of the english youth that lives in our house taught me to speak your language before i was seven years old by the command of my late father as also to write your way the turks and moors write from the right hand to the left  when i had learnt all that mustapha could teach me my father procured me many books in the english tongue i read the mall some i translated into morisco to divert my father among them were several books of your holy law though unknown to any one which i perused at first out of curiosity only but found so much sound truth and pure divinity that i began to abhor the absurdities of the alcoran and by degrees i hope i am come to a state of salvation through the blood of your prophet that suffered on the cross to save his followers that truly believe in him the sensual paradise i abhor painted by mahomet only to beguile his voluptuous adherents  i have found several stories in your books of the forwardness of moorish women but believe me dear englishman i hope i shall never carry any thing but virtuous inclinations in my heart which ever shall be yours  p s i will take an opportunity in the absence of my brother to converse with you for i would willingly have you owe your sense of the obligation to something else than bare hopes of your freedom which we will concert when i see you and let your condition be what it will i hope to bring a dowry i mean a worldly one that is lawfully my own to keep us above want think favorably and  adieu my soul      imagine dear brother the pleasure that filled my mind at the reading of this letter but i must own they proceeded from the hopes of my liberty for love had never yet laid hold of my heart  in the evening when the servants came about me as usual they were amazed to find me so merry i sung several moorish lovesongs that i had learnt among em for their language is very poetical and several english ones that touched upon my own circumstances which very much delighted em in short we spent the evening in pleasure and mirth  i went to rest with a mind far more at ease than usual but had not slept long before i was awaked with a gentle rapping at my cell door when i opened it i perceived the old matron that brought me the letter come said she in the moorish language very softly put on your clothes and follow me from mahomets hell into paradise i will be your conductor though a christian as well as yourself i dressed myself with a confusion of thought i had never felt before i followed my conductress without well knowing what i was about and entered into a lower room of a summer house at the bottom of the garden in the dark where i heard the sweetest voice i ever heard in my life the sound went quite through my soul and set my body in a tremble bid the sheslave make fast the door said the lady and light up tapers she instantly obeyed and showed me the most amiable young creature my eyes ever beheld i stood like one changed into a statue with admiration and i was not able to utter a word for some time i kneeled down before her and kissed her sleeve the sleeves of the turks and moors hang down very low and by kneeling and kissing them is expressed the most profound submission either to man or woman  but she gently raised me up with the most obliging smile imaginable what sir said she must i against the custom of your country declare my passion for you and not have a single word in return i replied the sight of such an unexpected angel might well take all my faculties away come said she sit down and partake of a small repast i have prepared for you and cheer your spirits with a cup of wine though i drink none myself not out of any respect to the prophet mahomet but that i never was accustomed to it i know you english gentlemen make it your common drink i begged to be excused from either neither could i indeed for the sight of her filled my soul with a profusion of delight and dear brother you must love like me before you can guess at the soft thrilling pleasure that ran through my blood i will not detain you with the tender things we said to each other but sure novels and romances cannot produce you a hero that ever was so much struck at the first sight of his adorable mistress twas then i wore the double chains of love and bondage in short we exchanged our hearts and gave one another assurances of eternal fidelity that can never be shaken on my part or i believe on hers  i must beg leave to recover myself from this tenderness not altogether becoming a man before i can pursue the thread of my uncomfortable story  several evenings were past thus delightfully during the absence of her brother we had many schemes to set us at liberty and at last agreed i should have a sufficiency from her to pay my ransom though it should amount to ten thousand crowns and when i had got my liberty she would find means to make her escape to me i must own though it was a proof of the sincerity of her love i made many scruples of receiving money from her but she assured me she would make use of none but her own she had prevailed on her father to settle a sufficient fortune upon her though very uncustomary that she might ever live a single life though her only reason was she never would join in marriage with one contrary to her own religion and her father being infinitely fond of her not knowing her true motive gave into her possession secretly the value of twenty thousand pounds english money besides several rich jewels the thoughts of so much unexpected happiness gave another turn to my looks which i could not hide but i made the servants and slaves believe the absence of my master occasioned the alteration  a jew was pitched upon to transact the affair who are a sort of people in that country used to all manner of business and of the utmost secrecy when money ties up their tongues this jew was to bargain with my master for my freedom as cheap as he could and to have two hundred and fifty crowns when the affair was completed he knew nothing of fatima that is the name of my divine mistress for the bargain was made by the old woman  one day when i was pleasing myself with the thoughts of my coming happiness my master arrived even twenty days before he was expected the moment he came in i was ordered before him here said he in the arabian tongue to a moor that was with him is the surly slave i told you of he is yours now use him like a dog as he deserves and take him from my sight this moment upon the instant i was laden with chains and by several slaves forced to follow my new master i was in such a surprise that i had not opened my mouth till we had got a good distance from the house i then desired submissively to speak to him i informed him there was money come from my friends and now in the hands of ben addi the jew to pay for my ransom he told me he would talk with me about it when he came back from his voyage i was thunderstruck at his answer and endeavored to soften him but in vain for we never stopped till we came on board a galley that lay in the road of tunis and in two hours afterward put to sea  as soon as i came on board i was chained to an oar and if i did not do as i should do i was taught with many unmerciful blows i endeavored to put an end to my miserable life with my irons but was prevented with another chastisement the thoughts of my dear fatima made me more outrageous and i was resolved to starve myself to death i exclaimed against fortune my old master and my new one in the moorish language in hope it might provoke the latter to put an end to my life but instead of that he came to me desiring i would have patience telling me i will treat with you for your ransom now and i swear by mahomet when i come back and you pay me what i agree with you for you shall that moment have your liberty this promise composed me a little for the moors never falsify their words when they swear by their prophet i begged his pardon for the rudeness of my tongue and promised to do my duty quietly for the future we agreed for five hundred crowns and i proffered him fifty more if he would release me from my hard labor he told me he could not do that because he should want one to supply my place he farther added if i could strike up a bargain with any of the sailors and do what i could in the room of the person that would undertake it he would freely give his consent but not one of the moors would listen to the proposal at last the gunners mate agreed with me for twenty crowns provided i would reassume my oar when we came to any engagement the bargain being struck my chains were taken off and i agreed with the captain my master who was a sicilian renagado to eat at his table for the other thirty crowns this would not have been complied with had he been a natural moor for they never eat with the christians but renegadoes are not so scrupulous  we were out two months before we met with any ship of europe but near the coast of alicant we encountered an english merchantship that proved too hard for us disabling our galley and killing and wounding above fifty of our men so that at last our captain thought fit to give over the attempt he resolved to go back to tunis to refit but the next day a violent storm took us which lasting eight days we were drove out of our course and when it abated we found our selves near the island of corsica several renegadoes advised the captain to make a descent and seize some of the inhabitants in order to better their voyage which he complied with though much to my sorrow to be so long absent from tunis  turning a point of land we discovered a galley of genoa preparing in a great hurry to attack us we endeavored to get away but to no purpose for they came up with us and after a desperate engagement took us though with great loss on both sides neither do i believe we had submitted if our captain had not been killed for i think i never saw a man behave himself with more courage and conduct when he found there was no avoiding the engagement  thus my dear brother i have gained my freedom from the chains of bondage and sure never any prisoner rejoiced less at his liberty than i do and if i had not met with you that gives me all the joy i am capable of feeling without my dear fatima i believe my sorrows would have made an end of my miserable life nay as it is i can never be happy without her we condold with my brother some time at his melancholy relation and i must confess i felt so much that my heart prompted me to think of attempting to bring off the object of his desires when i communicated my thoughts to my brother he was transported we were several days before we could light upon a project that seemed reasonable at last we determined to hire a tartane and engage about a dozen resolute men who should be all disguised in moorish habits we got a broad flatbottomd boat built on purpose something like our ferryboats in england only with higher sides and not so heavy with these we intended to sail for tunis anchor as near as we could to the long sandbank behind the rocks my brother mentioned where he was thrown out of the longboat then with our flatbottom boat land as near the house of fatimas brother as we could and bring her away by force  my brother and governor liked the design very well and would make one in it even with the consent of the fair eliza who was resolved her dear clerimont should partake of whatever fortune befell us nay it was hardly in our power to prevent her going along with us we hired a vessel and got our boat ready but we had much difficulty to get men some of the slaves were solicited i mean those that were set at liberty with my brother but none would venture near the barbary coast again willingly at last by great rewards i picked out seven englishmen and four genoese that promised to sacrifice their lives for us  we embarked with a favorable wind and arrived in the latitude of tunis in twelve days but we did not think it proper to come too near till it was dark when night appeared we made for the shore and anchored within half a mile of the sand then getting our flatbottomd boat out my brother my governor myself and nine of our men got into it every one armed with two brace of pistols a cutlass and a short dagger but we were not got above half a mile from the ship ere we struck on the sands though we suffered no damage because the sea was very calm but the tide flowing our boat floated again in half an hour when we came near the shore we left off rowing and set her forward with poles got for that purpose that we might not be discovered by the noise of our oars we soon landed at the place my brother purposed two of our men we left to secure the boat and keep her even with the water as the tide ebbed away we then set forward led by my brother when we came near the place a great mastiff dog opened so loud that he might be heard even to the city of tunis but my brother being foremost and knowing him called him by his name but the poor creatures joy to see him was almost as loud as his barking  in short the house was alarmed for we could see torches waving too and fro in the garden however we encouraged one another and went boldly on to the gate just as we came to it it flew open and a young moor flew from us like lightning we did not care to lose time in pursuing him but pressed in still following my brother who led us into the very courtyard the first he met seemed to be a person of distinction by the richness of his dress he was followed by seven or eight servants when he came up to my brother he made a stop and some words passing between em in the moorish tongue the moor immediately fired a pistol at him we thought we had no time to lose but fell upon em like so many furies killed two or three of em and immediately dispersed the rest but as we were following my brother into the house we perceived him faint and fall speechless upon the ground while we were examining his wound a lovely young creature came running to us all in disorder crying in english if you are christians protect me i did not doubt but this was the fair fatima by her extraordinary beauty and speaking english therefore ordered my brother who was shot quite through the thigh to be put in a wheelbarrow and immediately carried to the boat we had put our handkerchiefs into the wound and stopped the bleeding but he had not recovered his senses we immediately followed with the amiable christian moor but were forced to turn about to defend ourselves against the person that fired at my brother and his slaves that he had once more rallied he called to us in a prodigious fury but we understood him not he made a stroke at my head with his scimitar that would have infallibly ended my days if i had not received it on the hilt of my sabre but i ended his fury by shooting him dead at my feet  the slaves seeing their master fall ran yelling back again into the garden i took up his scimitar and made the best of my way after our people when we came to our boat we pushed away as fast as ever we could for there was no time to be lost we could easily perceive the city was alarmed by the firing of several guns and the lights that gleamd over the points of the rocks we imagined the young turk that rushed out of the garden when we were going in had given notice to the city which we supposed to be the young english mohammedan my brother mentioned in his relation  one of the two we left to look after the boat was a genoese surgeon who immediately dressed my brothers wound as well as he could in the dark but he could not assure me whether there was any danger or no till he came to have light enough to examine it more circumspectly  the confusion we were all in did not permit us to take notice of a young moor that was in the boat with us i asked the surgeon and the other genoese that were left to look after the boat how the youth came there he told me not long after we landed he walked after us to listen if he could hear any thing and perceiving this young spark coming toward him with a great deal of precipitation he thought it was his best way to secure him for fear he might alarm the country i was loath continued the surgeon to fire upon him not knowing but there might be people near us therefore resolved to engage him with my cutlass but as i was going to assault him he fell upon his knees and spoke in such a beseeching accent though i did not understand a word of his discourse that i could not have the heart to hurt him therefore secured him in the boat and in the hurlyburly quite forgot him for i think his seeming innocence and his tears which have never ceased since he has been with us would have prevailed upon me to have set him at liberty  i spoke to him in lingua franca lingua franca is a compound speech generally understood by the moors on the sea coasts as well as those on the sea coasts of italy france and spain most parts of the mediterranean the hellespont and adjacent islands  and italian all the tongues i am master of but he did not understand me  all this time my brother lay senseless and his condition almost brought me to despair but the surgeon comforted me by telling us as soon as we came on board he had cordials that would restore him for he assured me he was not dead i comforted the fair fatima as i thought her to be as well as i could but judge my surprise when she gave me such answers that assured me she was not her we had ventured our lives for the knowledge of this almost made me lose my senses i raved and tore my hair and would have thrown myself into the sea in order to swim back to the shore and recover her or lose my life but it could not be for just as we got on board our vessel we perceived a moorish galley coming out of the port we cut our anchor and made all the sail we could to get from em and as if heaven took our parts a brisk gale arose that was fair for our purpose so that when the morning dawned we lost sight of her  in the mean time my brother came to his senses but when he learned that we had failed of our purpose he swoond again and every body thought he would have expired it was a full hour before he opened his eyes but then uttered such complaints as melted us into pity that understood him the surgeon my governor and i were all standing about him persuading him to be dressed but he utterly refused it no said he since my dear fatima is lost for ever it is in vain to think of persuading me to live immediately after this we were surprised to see the young moor rush into the cabin and looking steadfastly on my brother give a great shriek and fall senseless at my feet my brother turning his heavy eyes that way cried out oh heavens what do i see why would you use me thus cruelly we soon understood by his transports that the disguised youth was his lovely fatima  our joys were now as extravagant as our sorrows were before she soon came to herself and running to the bed where my brother lay fainted away again no words i am sure could have the force to discover so sincere a passion and we all wept for joy to see such tenderness it was some time before their transports had leisure to mind those about em and it would have continued longer if the surgeon had not let us know it might endanger my brothers life therefore i prevailed upon her to withdraw while his wound was dressed i then went to make my compliments to the other lady who was still upon deck in the utmost confusion for i must own the disappointment we supposed she had occasioned made me entirely neglect her i soon made her easy and let her into some part of our story and began to inquire what strange fortune had brought her to those circumstances we found her in she related to us her short story as follows  gentlemen i am daughter to an english merchant that has resided upwards of ten years at leghorn my father had contracted me to one of his countrymen that lived at naples he came to leghorn to see me we liked each other and were married my husband being obliged to go to venice by land i was embarked in a felucca for naples but a storm came upon us that drove us from our course we were taken by a corsair of tunis where i was sold to a young moor who intended me for his seraglio but i was resolved sooner to suffer death than yield to his embraces last night he was resolved to force me if i would not comply willingly to his base desires and was going to execute his horrible purpose the moment you entered the garden but the cries of his slaves alarming him he ran to his arms and left me i hearing the english tongue spoke among you hoped you might be christians disguised as it proved therefore resolved to put myself in your hands not knowing any thing of the mistake which heaven has i hope brought to a joyful end i shall ever acknowledge the blessing i have received from you and i am assured both my father and husband will return you suitable thanks for redeeming me from infamy and slavery and if you think fit to put my ransom at ten thousand crowns i will engage it shall be paid either at leghorn or naples  i let her know we were gentlemen above such mercenary ends and i should think the obligation sufficiently paid by sending her to her father or husband which she thought fit when we arrived at genoa i might have known indeed replied the lady by your countenances and actions you are not of the vulgar strain however i hope you will be so good to acquaint me who are my preservers that i may ever remember you in my prayers and wish you eternal felicity in this world and the next i let her know i would take an opportunity to satisfy her when my brother was out of danger his hurt mended every hour and before we arrived at genoa he could with the help of a cane walk upon deck in calm weather as we set out secretly from thence we took care to be as secret in our returning back  i rewarded our men above their expectation though not more than i thought they deserved for it must be owned our undertaking was very hazardous and the success was far beyond even my hopes neither had we any one that received the least hurt but my brother when i showed him the scimitar of the moor i had slain he soon knew it to be that of his barbarous masters as he called him and the fair fatima could not hear the death of her cruel brother though born of different mothers without shedding tears which only showed the excellency of her nature for sure she had reason enough to wish his death  she told us when she heard he had sold my brother to the captain of the corsair it gave her an infinite satisfaction for she knew those sort of persons understood the value of money so well they would be easily prevailed upon to part with any thing for that shining dross i sent that very night said fatima relating her story to the jew an account of what had befell the slave he was to redeem with a strict charge to finish the affair the next day the next morning as i was sitting alone with all my thoughts employed about my love and casting about my escape for i was assured of my dear vaughans freedom my old slave interrupted my meditations with the fatal news of his being carried away the night before the terrors i felt took away my senses and i continued several hours in a swoon when i revived my tears flowed incessantly and my faithful slave with all her goodnature could not give me any consolation it was two days before i could be prevailed upon to take any nourishment but the jew informed my old slave that the corsair did not intend to make more than a four months voyage therefore having some faint hopes of seeing my love again i resolved to live till the time was expired  during that tedious time my life was made more uneasy by the barbarous treatment of my brother who was resolved to wed me to one of his acquaintance that as he often said he might get rid of one he hated he brought him to see me though against the custom of the moors and i had the illfortune to please him too well i need not tell you that brothers among the turks and moors have an absolute command over their sisters and the wives of their deceased father therefore the day was fixed for our nuptials which was to have been three days after i had made my escape after that barbarous decree my brother gave me more liberty than usual therefore i had an opportunity of conveying a turkish habit into the little summer house where i had often conversed with the charmer of my soul the key of which i had kept ever since the death of my father by degrees i carried all my gold and jewels there and that very night you came to relieve me was the night i had fixed upon for my escape first giving my old faithful slave her liberty with a sum of money to make her meanly happy for the rest of her life even with my brothers consent i had but just dressed myself and secured my little fortune when i was alarmed with a confused noise of people in the garden and imagining they were coming to seize me rushed out of the gate and flew as fast as my weak limbs would permit me yet in the terrors of my apprehensions i knew not where i was going i must own i was very much frighted at meeting a stranger yet i thought it was better than falling into the hands of any of the people of tunis i soon knew you were upon some clandestine design though every body speaking italian i could not understand what was spoke and the thoughts of what fortune might attend me gave me many terrible and uneasy apprehensions  the appearance of a wounded person and the sight of a moorish lady as i took her to be you brought along with you soon convinced me you had succeeded in your design i did intend to discover myself to her hoping she would give me her protection i spoke to her in the arabian language but was surpised to find i was not understood and immediately after perceiving the discontent that spread itself over all your faces i could not help endeavoring to find it out imagining i heard english spoke among you doubled my curiosity i need not tell you my surprise when i heard the voice of my dear vaughan repeat my name whose loved accents were ever in my ears you saw the violent working of my soul and brought me from death to life a life of joy and transport  the unlookdfor happiness of these four lovers made me once more think of my own uncertain fate and of my dear isabella who was never from my thoughts  my uncles intention at first was that i should make the whole tour of italy but the unfortunate end of my dear father was the cause of his desiring my immediate return as he mentioned in my last letter and i cannot but own maugre my curiosity which was very prevalent i was pleased to think i should see my dear isabella before the tedious time prefixed for my return  finding no vessel ready to carry us to marseilles where we had agreed to go by sea we embarked for leghorn and the rather that we might return the lady we had brought from tunis safe among her friends we embarked on board a felucca but had the mortification to find the young nobleman in the vessel bound for leghorn the relation of my governors mentioned before our uneasiness was the more on the account of the fair eliza who never durst appear upon deck notwithstanding her disguise for fear of being known by him neither would my governor once come in his sight and to add to my misfortune i was obliged to share cabbins with him or lie upon deck  during our short voyage he seemed goodnatured to a degree but was so officiously talkative and troublesome he was hardly to be bore ever plaguing me with stories of his successful amors  i was said he desperately in love with a lady at genoa who suspecting i had a passion for another woman whom i must own i had an affair with when first i arrived would not let me alone before i had wrote her a letter to convince her of my coolness but not understanding the italian language well enough to write my self i was obliged to employ a countryman of ours to write it for me which i transcribed and by the consequence that followed for i should have been murdered if i had staid any longer at genoa i believe i had not fair play from my friend in the translation i know you are a master of that language and i should take it for a singular favor if you would once more render it into english that i may be a better judge of my countrymans sincerity i must own i took it from him to translate that i might be rid of his company for some time the contents of this fine letter were as follows madam i own i have received proofs of your passion but what then do you think a young english traveller can he confined to one woman no no more than he can he satisfied with viewing one country i find myself like the be willing to taste the sweets of every flower and as i intend to visit the most celebrated cities of europe i design to have a mistress at every place i come to if it he only to learn the difference of the various race of females i own i liked you the best of any woman i ever saw till i found one that pleased my fancy better and now i despise you as much as ever i loved you make yourself happy with the first lover that addresses you and never think of one that has forgot you long ago till the writing of this letter time hung heavy upon my hands and another reason was i have so much compassion for you that i would not have you think i will ever wear your chains again therefore the troublesome fetters may serve some other fool for none but fools would always sacrifice their incense to one idol where there are so many amiable divinities to draw our devotions one from another farewell and he happy if you can without me for i certainly am and will he happy without ever being  yours etc     the sense of this letter gave me a more despicable opinion of the fool that wrote it and i must own the trouble i was forced to endure in having his impertinent company gave me very much uneasiness for during our voyage i was obliged to appear as a stranger to my brother my governor and the ladies for fear he should come to know em but our arrival at leghorn after a voyage of five days gave me some repose for as soon as he landed he took a postchaise for florence and rid us of his most troublesome company though he returned in a week and went back in the same vessel for genoa again i must own foreigners may justly have a contempt for our nation when too many that travel have the same sentiments with this young impertinent  as soon as we landed we conducted the lady to her fathers house where we found the whole family in mourning we did not immediately discover her to him but pretended our business with him was only to recommend us to a house where we might reside during our stay in leghorn he told us if we could be contented with a melancholy family we might make use of his house as if it were our own we thanked him for the favor and by degrees got out of him the reason of his mourning my brother being a man of some mirth told him he believed by the art of divination he could in less than five minutes inform him whether he should ever see his daughter again and the day and the hour of their meeting but the merchant expressed some uneasiness as imagining my brother made a jest of his sorrows nay sir said my governor dont look grave at what the gentleman proposes to you for i can assure you he has an admirable knowledge that way what my governor said seemed only to add to his confusion pray sir said i tell me one thing is your soninlaw here or at naples gentlemen returned our kind host i must own you look like such pray dont laugh at the misfortunes of a mourning family whose distress is never to be forgot my unfortunate soninlaw is now in the house with me but such a picture of unhappiness that cannot be looked on without compassion and i fear his death in a very short time will add to our mourning i began to think the unexpected sight of the lady might be as prejudicial as their sorrow therefore told him in a few words by degrees the adventure of the lady and fetched her out of a room where she was concealed and had heard all to throw herself at his feet when she appeared he stood fixed in astonishment for some time but when he was convinced it was his daughter that knelt before him the tears of joy gushed out so fast that stopped the utterance of his tongue when his extravagant transport was a little abated he went up to his soninlaw and after staying some time brought him down with him he appeared the very shadow of a human form and notwithstanding he had been prepared for the tender interview as soon as he entered the room he sunk speechless into his fatherinlaws arms we thought it proper to retire into another apartment during this dumb scene it was some time before they came to us but the redundancy of their gratitude had almost overwhelmed us we intended to stay but three or four days at leghorn leghorn is a seaport mentioned by polybius antoninus and the famous roman orator cicero it formerly belonged to the states of genoa but cosmo de medicis duke of florence exchanged it with their state for serezana on the key stands that noble statue in marble of ferdinand i with four turkish slaves chained at each corner of the pedestal they represent an old man and his three sons who were put to death in that place for attempting to run away with one of the galleys of the state in order to regain their liberty  leghorn is a noble rich town of great trade wellfortifyd and a convenient safe port that freely opens its arms to embrace the merchandise of all europe even the outsides of many of the noble buildings have paintings too good to be exposed to the injuries of the weather and the insides are so profusely decorated with statues pictures intaglias etc that the beholder would imagine himself in so many poetical enchanted palaces their chief trade consists of florence wine oil and anchoves though there are constantly small vessels in the port laden with wine of sardinia corsica and languedoc which is drank on board to avoid paying the duty so that each vessel is a public tavern and notwithstanding there are frequent disorders committed yet they go on with impunity and no notice taken of em by the state    but we were pressed so obligingly that a whole month passed away before they would hear of our moving and then with the utmost reluctance  we visited florence florence the capital city of the great duke of tuscany was built by sylla in the year of rome     seventysix years before the birth of christ situated upon the river arno it justly carries the epithet of fibrenza iubella by the italians florence the fair there is a noble column with the statue of justice on the top of which the meaner sort of inhabitants say justice it placed so high that poor people cannot reach her by computation it contains  00000 inhabitants charles the great in the year of grace  0  very much enlarged it and built a new wall with the addition of   0 turrets  00 cubits high but its present strength must consist of the inhabitants for the fortifications seem more ornamental than useful a council was held here in the year      to the year      to unite the greek and latin churches anno domini      jerome savdnarola a holy religious man was burnt by the populace for reproving the vices of this city john cimaba was the first eminent painter in the year   00 that began to restore that noble art almost buried in the ruins of time which since has spread itself almost over europe the trade of this place is much decayed and seems now to center at leghorn the tuscan dialect is esteemed to be the most refined italian but their guttural pronunciation has occasioned this italian proverb la lingua toscana in bocca romana the tuscan tongue must have a roman mouth  and saw all the rarities of the great dukes repository which is certainly one of the noblest entertainments in the world at least it appeared so to me and my company  when we came back to leghorn in order to prepare for our journey a violent fever attacked me that confined me to my apartment for near two months which i can attribute to nothing more than the anxiety of my mind and as most fevers are attended with deliriums i was for ever crying out of the infidelity of my dear isabella even when my illness was gone the lowness of my spirits gave force to my imagination and those uneasy thoughts retarded my strength  one day taking the air upon the water the master of the felucca that brought us from genoa passing by in a boat told me he believed i had left a packet of letters in my cabin which he would bring me if i would give him a direction i did not remember i had lost any thing however i desired he would send em where i lodged the next day when he brought em they were sealed up sir said the italian i found they were in a language i did not understand and not knowing the consequence i sealed em up and left em at my lodgings directed for you or the young gentleman that shared my cabin with you imagining one of you would search after em before i returned from genoa where i have been twice since i brought you to leghorn and if i had not met you accidentally yesterday i should have committed them to the flames before i went back to genoa i thanked him for his civility and opening the packet found they were directed for my english companion i had in the felucca against my will i laid em among my other papers not having any curiosity to peruse em with an intention to give em the right owner if ever i should have the misfortune to see him again but when i told my governor and brother at dinner of my packet they seemed willing to know the contents that they might have a farther occasion to despise the gentleman or at least to make themselves merry with his fine epistles after dinner we went to my apartment and taking out the packet i gave it my brother to read the first was as follows dear sir it is with infinite joy i am informed of your health and to communicate some of that pleasure to you i must acquaint you my father is gone to visit the residence of his ancestors that is in plain english i have buried him sumptuously his death you know has made me master of   000 l a year and the liberty of pursuing my pleasures without restraint but i think it is a great pity the japan law concerning children is not of force in england there is a law in the empire of japan or a custom as strong as a law that all fathers of any nobility resign their estates to their eldest sons when they have reached their twentieth year or five and twenty at the farthest the fathers generally retire to some castle and spend the remnant of their lives in contemplating the vanities of this world but are always ready to give their sons proper advice in their worldly affairs if the son thinks fit to ask it some fathers retire among the bonzies or priests and never enter into conversation with any of the world despising the pomp and sple of it ending their days in mortifying their flesh  the old put of a pere forsooth in his lifetime talked to me of virtue morality and i know not what stuff dinning ever in my ears that nobility without virtue was like an eminent barren mountain seen and slighted  i have once more made my addresses to isabella with all the glaring equipage of nobility and fortune but she is as cold as a cucumber but i have found out the reason of that coldness it seems she is damnably in love with that young learned blockhead vaughan i will tell you how i came by that knowledge in one of my visits at her mothers house i was told the young lady had been some time in the garden i made no scruple of following her but you must think i was something surpised to find her asleep in a retired arbor with a letter in her hand from that wretched coxcomb you and i have so often laughed at who should have been well whipped by me for his impudence before he went from england but that i thought it was beneath me to chastise a schoolboy  i took away the letter without any manner of ceremony and showed it to her mother and aunt but was very much surpised to find they had no resentment against vaughan nor the girl for such a discovery though i found it was new to them they both coolty told me isabellas inclinations should never be forced yet if i could gain her consent theirs would soon follow in short there is nothing to be done with the young girl and i own i think i oud like her even for a year or two now i have learnt by piecemeal that vaughan inends to travel the way you design if you meet with him which is very likely cannot you recommend him to some italian man of business or rather find some method by letter to make isabella believe he has got him a mistress in his travels ay that will do in my opinion better then her resentment may bring her to my arms for upon second thoughts t is not quite generous to take away his life since now i remember he once was in some danger in saving mine besides if i could accomplish my affair with isabella i dont know but he might be fool enough to hang himself and then my revenge will be complete if you can think of some way you will very much oblige me i shall find no difficulty in deceiving isabella however the sooner the better for n short if i cannot find some method speedily i must even ravish her i think and make an end of the business that way our friend dick is dead of the surgeon but it is his own fault i told him the danger he was in if he conversed longer with the lady you wot of in germanstreet without consulting a surgeon but he slighted my advice and therefore he has answered that folly with his life my dear friend i wish you sounder mistresses than dicks and hope you will remember  yours for ever     the reading of this letter gave me the most horrid apprehensions my soul ever knew i called to mind the letter i translated from the italian at the desire of that wretch not doubting in the least but that was the engine made to destroy all my peace in the first transports of my fury i said and did the most extravagant things imaginable to the surprise of all the company  the first letter was directed to paris and the second to genoa my brother casting his eyes cursorily over the second i perceived his color change seeming very unwilling to read it i snatched it out of his hands and to my surprise and terror found i was utterly destroyed  my dear friend i received your last packet with more transports than i ever felt from the sweet consenting embraces of a mistress i think your policy in overreaching that contemptible coxcomb vaughan exceeds even machiavel for cunning and i dont doubt but breathing the same air and being in the same climate where that prince of politicians was born inspired you but i must tell you how fortune assisted me in carrying on the deceit  you know the letter vaughan translated by your instigation was not sealed i by good fortune was at isabellas mothers where i met the uncle of vaughan i took an occasion to borrow his seal and with it sealed that letter intended for isabella their arms being the same you may be assured it helped my design  two days after this i got trusty roger my cunning dog of a footman to put on a sailors dress and deliver the letter to isabella when i was present i had ordered him to tell her he received that letter with many others from some english gentlemen at genoa the young lady blushed and trembled when she received it viewing the seal very circumspectly but the hand of the direction not being the same that was expected from the seal she seemed to be in the utmost consternation however there was no one to make observations upon her looks but myself her mother and aunt being gone some moments before roger came with the letter to dress themselves in order to make a visit and isabella was to go along with them the young lady went into the garden in order to read the dear epistle with more freedom and staid so long there that the mother with the aunt came down dressed ordered the coach to the door and inquired after her i told em a sailor had brought the young lady a letter from genoa from one i supposed she was very glad to hear from for she changed countenance several times then went to the garden to enjoy the contents alone the mother and aunt seemed very much disturbed at my short story and followed isabella into the garden without giving me one word in return some moments after i was a little surpised i own to see the aunt return in great haste calling to the servants for water the house was all in an uproar and i soon understood isabella was in a fainting fit this gave me some little uneasiness to think she loved another so well yet i buried it soon knowing violent passions never last long  isabella was brought in by the servants to  appearance void of life with the mother and aunt weeping over her they put her to bed but as fast as she recovered out of one fainting fit she fell into another in short the family was in so much distraction for several hours that i thought it proper to retire without ceremony feeding on the hopes this disturbance would produce  i sent the next morning to inquire of isabellas health and was informed she was in a violent fever the messenger brought me a note from the aunt that told me her niece was often troubled with a bad digestion and those fainting fits were too common with her yet that was the worst she ever had etc i own my dear ned i could not help smiling at the note but however i found by it they intended the true reason should be a secret and you know it was my interest not to divulge it  in about ten days after this affair i ventured to make em another visit where i found isabella so much altered that in reality i pitied her she looked as if she was going to her grave but notwithstanding her paleness her charms were as powerful as ever and i own i love her more and more every time i see her one thing gave me infinite pleasure at this visit i observed her looks were not so full of scorn when she cast her eyes upon me i did not mention my passion for several days but the respect i treated her with and the tenderness i expressed for her melancholy indisposition seemed grateful to all the family  when i once more mentioned my love isabella only sighed and shed tears but did not rally me as she was wont to do in short i followed my business so close that the whole family gave me their consent and isabella now treats me as her future husband she has freely declared to me the passion she once had for vaughan and only begs our nuptials may be delayed till she can wholly give me that heart the other so little deserved this declaration is no secret though the cause is not known out of the family vaughans uncle has been very much busied about some concerns of his brothers family who is lately dead together with his wife and a son of hers and it is whispered in the neighborhood as if some poisoning work had been done in the family by the wife though she has suffered herself i only wish the knowledge of it when it reaches your raw traveller may prove a mittimus to convey him into another world for fear our plot should be discovered however when i have wedded isabella i shall take care to put bounds to her liberty i mean if my love should continue after wedlock which i begin to think no impossible thing  vaughans uncle this morning came to pay his respects to the family as usual but the mother the aunt and isabella ordered the servants to say they were abroad the old gentleman returned home something chagrind i suppose his visits there for the future will be thought only a trouble to the family my dear ned i shall not write to you any more till our nuptials are over which i hope will be in two months at the farthest however let me know where you intend to be that i may be sure where my epistle may find you and i wish thee as happy with thy italian dames as i hope to be in two months in the embraces of the charming isabella and next to her be assured to share the heart of  your obliged friend and servant etc etc etc   at the reading of this villainous letter all my fortitude resolution and philosophy left me my disordered soul whispered my heart to put an end to my wretched being which i had certainly done if the thoughts of revenge had not bid me live i immediately gave orders for my journey to england but my impatient fancy outrun all expedition yet the tumult of my spirits threw me into another violent fever and though every one thought it would be certain death to remove from the place where i was yet i ordered a litter and the next morning pursued my journey attended with my governor eliza my brother the fair fatima and servants  eliza in our first days journey was taken with a sudden indisposition that prevented our going any further that day we were far from any town and it was with great difficulty we found accommodation at a little village a mile from the main road i was agitated with so much impatient passion that my friends found it a hard task to persuade me from leaving them behind and pursuing my journey with my two servants the next morning eliza was much better but to my great mortification i was so weak that i had not strength enough to rise without help yet notwithstanding my condition i ordered my litter to be got ready but was informed the men went away with it back to leghorn early in the morning i lost all patience at the disappointment and fell out with my friends not doubting though they denied it but it was their contrivance to prevent my journey during my weakness in short my illness redoubled its attacks and took such strong possession of the outworks that it was the opinion of every one about me my life could not hold out much longer my senses left me and a strong distraction seized my soul but even in those fits of madness revenge was uppermost for they informed me when i came out of those possessions all my ravings were upon isabella and my rival threatening death to both  the place where we were had but little accommodation for us even in health and much less for a person in my condition therefore my brother unknown to me applied himself to a neighboring gentleman who freely granted us the use of his house i was removed there and having the advice of the best physicians from florence my distemper by degrees left me but i still continued in such a weak condition it was impossible for me to remove so soon as my impatience would have me i was well assured the time affixed for the fatal nuptials was elapsed therefore my heart began to feel some ease in the resolution i had taken in the revenging the loss of my love by the death of my hated rival or falling a victim to my misfortunes this hope gave me room to gather some strength which in a few days increased so much that i could walk in the garden which was one of those noble ones in italy that surpass even many princes in other countries but what was my surprise when in a neighboring arbor i heard the voice of that wretch singing an italian air who by his damnable wiles had prevailed upon me to translate that letter which was the sole cause of all my misfortunes my fury gave me strength enough to fly to the place from whence i heard his detested voice as soon as i came near him i could not help crying out with the utmost transport of fury villain thy last moment is approaching i never once considered i had no other weapon than a cane to assist me in walking which i thrust against his breast with such violence that he fell backwards in a mighty fright however finding it was no offensive weapon i had in my hand he drew his sword and made several thrusts at me which i parryd with my cane for some time and at last with much difficulty disarmed him but the violence of the exercise being too strong for my weak condition i fell to the ground almost senseless the wretch seeing that recovered his sword and with all his strength stabbed me through the shoulder the sword entered so far into the earth that he made several fruitless attempts to pull it out again i had just sense enough to know what he was doing without any power to prevent him but my brother jonathan coming upon the instant put an end to his vain efforts by laying him breathless at my feet with a blow of his sword he then came to my assistance leaving the wretch weltring in his blood the family and my friends were soon alarmed tho no one could come to the true knowledge of this quarrel for the present but the appearances seemed strong against the other because i had no sword however the gentleman of the house took care of him as having some small acquaintance with him he informed us that the villainous wretch waited for a servant that he had sent to leghorn for a packet of letters which i too well knew were those the captain delivered to me when my wound was dressed i informed the gentleman of all that befell me when he heard his barbarous policy to undo my peace he exclaimed against his conduct vowing never to give him any countenance for the future  my wound was not dangerous though the loss of blood contributed to my weakness but the wretch that gave it me seemed in a very dangerous condition for the blow my brother gave him had fracturd his skull and the violence of the pain often took away his senses yet in his intervals he talked of nothing but revenge declaring to every one that came to visit him my brothers blood should make atonement for the torment he suffered as for myself he had sufficiently punished me in being the instrument of robbing me of all that could make me happy in this world i must own i was in some fear for my brother therefore was for leaving the place as soon as possible but the italian gentleman in whose house we were advised us not to pursue our journey by land he laid before me the many difficulties we should meet with and convinced me we should make our voyage sooner by imbarking for marseilles and traveling through france by land the alps at this time of the year he assured us were covered with snow and many had perished by mistaking the road the consideration of the two ladies prevailed upon me more than any danger i feared therefore we were determined as soon as possible to return to leghorn and procure a vessel to carry us to marseilles  my wound was so well healed in six days after i received it that the seventh i resolved with my companions to venture on horseback in order to return to leghorn but when the time came my brother was not to be found we made all the enquiry imaginable to no purpose but what gave me some small satisfaction was that fatima assured me he was gone to leghorn to provide a vessel for our voyage i own i much wondered he had not informed us of his design but as the fair fatima seemed very easy i thought i had no reason to be otherwise  we took leave of our friendly italian though i must own i parted with some regret from that infamous wretch who was the cause of all my sorrows without giving him the punishment due to his crimes however i did not doubt but the justiee of heaven would overtake him and i found some consolation in overcoming my just resentment  we pursued our journey for leghorn where we arrived the next day without any accident but upon enquiry after my brother we could learn no news of him i began then to be very uneasy and observed a gloom on fatimas countenance notwithstanding all her endeavors to conceal it several days past in this uncertainty till fatimas fears began to be too powerful for her prudence yet all my persuasions could not get the reason of my brothers absence from her though she confessed to me she knew it my governor eliza and i had many conjectures but none could give us any consolation especially since we observed fatima began to be inconsolable and confessed his stay was beyond the time prefixed we pressed her on all sides to declare to us the reason of his unexpected absence with this persuasion that it was possible the knowledge of it might be of service to him but all our entreaties proved ineffectual yet she declared if we had no tidings of him in two day she would confess to us the secret  we went to bed full of terrors and for my own part sleep was a stranger to me but in the middle of the night i was alarmed with a violent knocking at the gate the servants of the house not rising at the second alarm i slipped on my gown and with my sword in my hand went down into the courtyard but guess my surprise when asking who was there i heard my brothers voice i opened the gate and my surprise was doubled when i found my brother on horseback at the head of a litter with a sick man in it attended by four servants but when i found the person within it was the wretch that had wounded me in the garden of the italian gentleman my wonder tied up my tongue and my company who by this time were come to us stood like so many statues struck with the sight of medusas head at last observing my brothers diligence in helping him out of the litter in a seeming trance we all involuntarily gave him our assistance without knowing what we were doing we put him into bed and then followed my brother out of the room leaving his servants and a surgeon with him that came in their company without speaking a word so full of wonder that our tongues seemed of no use to us  when we came down into the hall my brother tenderly embraced us all though his dear fatima could not speak yet the tears of joy that fell from her fair eyes convinced us all of the tender love she bore him when we were seated some time gazing silently at one another my brother began his story as follows  my dear brother i must first beg your pardon for concealing from you what i am going to relate but my reason for it was that you would not have given your consent to what i designed to do two days before we intended to leave our friendly italian i received that letter which he gave me to read to jonathan vaughan esquire you may perhaps imagine i shall forget the injury i suffered from you but be assured the moment i have strength enough to draw a sword i shall expect satisfaction for your cowardly treatment in a day or two more i shall be able to punish you for the wound you gave me if that person can have courage enough to look a man in the face who would stab him behind his back the gentleman of the house my friend being imposed upon by your false legend has withdrawn his kindness from me but i hope by your punishment to let him see how you have slandered basely one that cannot forget the injury without washing off your crime with your blood all i fear is that this notice will make you fly from my just resentment but no place on earth shall hide you from my chastisement my rage should correct your brother for his illmanners in reading those letters you were all well assured belonged to me but i know his curiosity carried his punishment along with it yet when i have with my sword let out your treachery and baseness i may think it worth my while to scourge him for that folly that can have no other excuse than the childish curiosity of a boy who left his school before he had been well whipped for his impertinence  p s the third morning after receiving this between the hours of five and eight i shall expect to see you alone with a single sword in the meadow by the river the river arno or arnus the chief river of tustany in italy takes its rise in the apennine hiils near the source of the river tiber that runs through rome the river arno washes the walls of florence and is navigable from thence to leghorn where it empties itself into the sea arno a furlong from the house       this letter was given me continued my brother by a servant who told me he was ordered by his master to wait the next morning in the same place for an answer the letter i own gave me much concern i advised with my dear fatima and with much difficulty got her consent to send an answer in which i promised to meet him at the time and place appointed i assured fatima i would be with you in eight days at the farthest and for that time she gave me her word to keep the affair a secret from every one the morning i parted from her was with the utmost sorrow she took her leave of me as if she was never to see me more i retired with my servant full of grief to the little cottage upon the skirts of the mead where i gave myself up to examine my conscience and endeavored to make my peace with heaven though i own to you i thought i was going to do a deed not in the least acceptable to god as soon as the appointed morning came i arose giving my servant orders to observe the combat and if it was my fate to fall he should immediately repair to you after laying me in the earth and give you an account of my end  about six of clock i perceived my antagonist coming slow and pensive along the skirts of the meadow when he came nearer to me i observed he had been weeping tears said i can make but poor atonement for the many injuries thou have heaped upon my poor brother and me therefore betake thee to thy sword that i may chastise thy perfidy he made me no answer but drawing his sword i made a full pass at him which he opening his arms received into his breast and fell toward me upon his face with the point of my sword out at his back i was very much surpised at his manner of proceeding and calling my servant who waited at some distance we both raised him up forbear said he and think not of giving assistance to a wretch that rather deserves death from your hands and who came on purpose to be punished for all those crimes the heat of youth and want of thought have made me commit i had no other way to recompense all those ills i have done your worthy brother but to receive death from your hands the wound you formerly gave me probd me to the soul my illness gave me leisure to think and thought was my monitor i knew what i had done instigated by one whose nobility is a stain to virtue was the basest act i could have committed i had no other method to meet with the death i desired but by writing that letter to you i had not the assurance to look your injured brother in the face but i beg by honor virtue and all the amiable train of goodness to plead for me to your noble brother whose virtues rank him above nobility i considered my crime no more than a little artifice which would be approved by all the laughing part of the world but when i weighed it fully in my illness i found it the basest blackest and most inhuman policy that ever was committed by mortal man i often used to whisper to myself what anxiety have i felt even for a disappointment of a day but what must these two poor virtuous innocent abused souls suffer even to the separation of their mortality my wound was never so dangerous as reported but the torments of my troubled conscience persuaded even the surgeon that i was often delirious when alas all my madness was in my mind and not in the brain i purposely when i was calm threatened revenge upon you but it was only that you might be informed of my false resentment against you i well knowing your spirit would find some means to seek me out and punish me for my crime as i deserved even the letter i wrote to you went to my soul because what i wrote was against my conscience all i desire of you is to bury me obscurely and let my faults be forgotten in the grave he endeavored to say more but his tongue falterd his eyes closed and grafping me faintly by the hand he sunk to the earth in all appearance never to rise again we took him in our arms and with the sword in his breast carried him to the cottage and then sent my servant for the surgeon that attended you both in your illness while he was gone there seemed no sign of life in him i must confess his unhappy condition had wiped away all resentment in me and i felt for him all the tenderness of a brother and friend washing his face with my repentant tears often cursing myself for the rash act  when the surgeon came he drew the sword out of his body upon which he opened his eyes fetching a deep sigh but closed em immediately again however the surgeon probd his wound and gave me some hopes it might not prove mortal we undressed him and put him to bed but the surgeon desired we might leave the room till the evening he came again for he confidently assured us by that time he would either be past cure or out of danger i own i could not obey his orders but sat by his bedside till the evening the surgeon returned and all that time i could not perceive him to breathe therefore i was assured in myself the soul had taken her flight for ever the surgeon by his countenance seemed to think as i did but when he took off his plasters from his wounds he cried courage sir we have hopes and great ones too i own those words very much cheered my drooping spirits when he had once more dressed him he forced open his mouth and poured in some cordial which upon the instant caused him to groan and some moments after he opened his eyes faintly looking upon us but did not seem to know us in short it was four days ere he came to his senses and then the surgeon declared he was out of danger since in that time he had escaped a fever  i was so much concerned for his welfare that i had even forgot the time i proposed to meet you at leghorn was elapsed therefore i sent my servant to acquaint you with the reason of my delay intending to follow the next day but we were very much surpised last night to find the poor fellow tied to a tree in the road having been robbed of his horse his clothes and money as also severely beaten into the bargain  though the gentlemans wounds were almost healed yet he continued so weak that he could not get out of his bed without assistance yet knowing the necessity of my being with you he would accompany me in the litter that carried you a days journey into the country that i had ordered to be concealed in the village to prevent my dear brother your pursuing a rash design that must have ended with your life considering the weakness of your condition i will wait on you said he to your worthy brother to obtain his pardon or die at his feet when he was informed we were near the house where you resided the thoughts of seeing the face of the person he had so heinously injured took away his senses and he fainted away but the surgeon assured us a little rest and quietness would soon restore him therefore desired he might not be disturbed for some hours  when my brother had ended his relation revenge hate fury with all the train of violent passions left my breast and in their room soft compassion tenderness with friendship took their place though i was undone through his means yet a gloomy contentment took possession of my soul so that i could freely pardon the man who was the cause of all my misfortunes i was overcome with an ardent longing to embrace him all the company felt the same sentiments with me neither could we prevent the tears gushing from our eyes at my brothers short story  we all returned to rest and i must own i had not felt the balmy effects of slumber so sweet for many days though the latter part of it was disturbed with a dream of my dear isabella i thought she appeared before me with those piercing rays of beauty with which she first wounded my soul can thou then forsake me she cried ungrateful wretch what have i done to merit such barbarous usage are these the vows and promises thou made me at our cruel separation why did thou betray my easy heart to feel the torture of despair for ever but know thou wretch though death will soon overtake me yet i will die anothers to punish thee when she had as i thought pronounced these fatal words she flew from me in a violent rage and the agony i felt in my dream awaked me in a cold sweat all over my limbs though this was but a dream yet my mind felt all the tortures imaginable at the thoughts of my miserable fortune  the next morning my brother informed us the gentleman was better and expressed a great desire to see me after breakfast we all went up together at sight of me the tears ran down his cheeks which choked the passage of his words for some time for heavens sake sir said i do not add to my sorrows by making me bear yours i know your penitence and it is with the utmost candor i now declare i heartily forgive what is past and beg to be ranked in the number of your virtuous friends this goodness he faintly replied had overwhelmed his soul with so much confusion that it was more than his feeble spirits could stand under and upon saying that his speech failed him and a deadly paleness overspread his face it was a full hour before we could bring him to life again and i began to taste all the bitterness of grief for his condition when he could use his tongue he said so many humane tender things as plunged all the hearers in floods of sorrow insomuch that the surgeon turned us all out of the chamber declaring he would upon the instant leave him if we offered to see him again till he thought fit  just as we left him a packet was given me from england which i knew to be my uncles hand i had not wrote him any letter for near four months having indeed almost forgot through my brothers affairs my sickness and my own unhappy love i had any such person in the world and when i did call him to mind the intention of my journey to england made it of no signification to write i sound by the date of the letter it was full ten weeks since it was wrote  my dear child the torments i endure for thy silence are not to be described it never can enter into my mind that thou should forget me therefore what can i suppose is it unnatural to think thee out of this world and that i am now writing to an angel in heaven good god what terrors does the very thought invade me with my dear boy should this letter come to thy hands consider me as one in this small time thou have been absent full twenty years older than when thou saw me last grief has shook her malevolence upon my head and i am become from a facetious middleagd man of fifty an old decrepid wretch of fourscore thy worthy fathers loss thy absence and my fears for thee have added to my gray hairs which i own are multiplied by the mother and aunt to isabella would thou think it my boy they are as strange to me as humility to a priest have broke off our correspondence and to complete all o my child arm thyself with patience if my conjectures prove true are speedily going to wed isabella to that upstart nobleman you formerly had some words with and all this without assigning any reason to me for their proceedings it is true they have a right to do as they think fit but it is very strange and i own my patience and fortitude through all these concurring misfortunes can but poorly bear up against them alone come then my dear child and by thy assistance i shall be able to hold out against all the assaults of fortune and in thy company forget the ill treatment of the world but if i neither see nor hear from thee very speedily my gray hairs will soon be brought with sorrow to the grave poor bettys fears for thy welfare almost equal mine i have taken care of ihy unhappy fathers affairs come and take possession of that and all that is mine but be expeditious my dear child or thou will come too late to close the eyes of  thy dear and loving uncle w vaughan   all my sorrows were renewed at the reading this melancholy epistle and i began to curse my stars for my unthinking backwardness in writing and to write now seemed to me to be of no use because i intended to embark for england the next morning however all my friends advised me to send my uncle a letter for fear some accident might retard our voyage i took their advice and sent him one giving him a succinct account of every thing that had befell my brother and me since my last and of that fatal letter which had caused the coldness of isabellas family and my inevitable ruin with a promise to be in england with the utmost expedition  the wounded gentleman hearing we were to imbark for marseilles the next morning was resolved to go with us notwithstanding his weak condition and all our persuasions to the contrary could not avail the surgeon informed us the sea would rather do him good than harm and he was resolved to attend him to marseilles therefore the next day we left leghorn with a prosperous gale and in eight days we arrived safely at marseilles without meeting with any accident by the way the hurt gentleman mended every day and when we disembarkd he was able to walk without assistance he had reconciled himself to my governor and eliza the presents he made them were worthy the gift of a prince and unknown to me he and my brother had settled my fathers estate upon me and had given my brother an equivalent out of his own fortune when i complained to him of his profuse generosity for heavens sake sir said he accept this small favor in recompense for all the misfortunes i have heaped upon you and would to god the rest of my estate and life could but restore what i have robbed you of i would freely surrender both yet who knows but fate has still reserved the amiable isabella to bless your arms i am strongly possessed with that hope i have some reason to believe you the care of providence and such wretches as that perfidious man and i must surely be punished in the loss of all our unlawful desires would wish for all my days to come shall be spent in begging forgiveness from heaven and you sure there must be the seeds of some goodness even in the most profligate heart and repentant tears may make them flourish and kill those weeds of baseness that shadowed over our vicious inclinations i would not be the wretch i was some few days ago for all the gaudy titles of state and grandeur  in short there was such a virtuous alteration wrought upon him i could not help esteeming him equal to my brother his friendship was in some sort a cordial for my disappointed love for i had made a firm resolve after the loss of my dear isabella to forget all the fatal charms of the sex which at best enervate the soul of man unbend his mind and render him unfit for noble actions i intended to dedicate my future life to my king and country my new friend strengthened me in that resolution our design was as soon as we arrived in england to buy us posts in the army and make for the future war our mistress these thoughts almost engrossed my whole soul but the idea of the charming isabella would too often intrude and fill my heart with a medley of love and arms  we set out from marseilles in postchaises for paris where we all safely arrived healthful in body though for my own part with a mind full of cruel disturbances we were obliged to stay some time here to dispose of a casket of valuable jewels that fatima brought from tunis and procure bills of exchange for our money for fear of accidents but as soon as we arrived there i dispatched one of my servants for england to acquaint my uncle of my coming here my fever attacked me again but i was so impatient to come to my journeys end that as soon as our affairs were ended we hired postchaises for bulloigne where we safely arrived though late at night but found the gates shut against us but having recommendations to mr gordon a winemerchant a gentleman just settled at bulloigne he prevailed upon the captain of the guard to give us entrance and through his accustomed goodnature he would accommodate us at his own house where we were nobly entertained he pressed us so oblingly to stay some time that we appeared almost guilty of illmanners but despair and love seldom regard forms  he finding our affairs pressed us to be gone procured us a vessel to carry us to dover and we embarked the next morning at break of day but before the sun was two hours old a general darkness overspread the hemisphere followed by a most violent tempest mixed with thunder and lightning that the captain of the vessel declared he had never seen the like the helm was of no use therefore we were obliged under a reefd foresail to run before the wind trusting to the mercy of providence for three nights and days upon the fourth the storm retired and gave us leave to make an observation we were greatly surpised to find we had passed the lizard upon this we consulted what course we should steer but finding the wind favorable for milford haven the captain was prevailed upon for a sum of money to steer for that harbor the night approaching the tempest as if it abated only to fetch breath came on more violently than before and all the hopes we had of life was to steer our course for the open sea our vessel bore up against the storm very well for two days but on the third the master came into the cabin with looks that told us our misfortune he informed us the vessel had sprung a leak and should the storm continue a day longer we must inevitably sink to the bottom  the tears of my friends i must own shocked me very much yet for my own part i sat in expectation of the last moment with the utmost tranquillity but in a few hours the storm very much abated yet with all our assistance the water gained upon us and no land appearing we had no hope of saving our lives  the vessel was once more left to the mercy of the waves whose frightful swell though the wind was laid ran mountains high the master ordered the longboat out that we might endeavor all we could to save our lives but the mariners as soon as it was in the water crowded so fast upon one another that the rope which held it to the ships side broke and in a moment after the boat was swallowed by the billows three out of thirteen of the sailors that were in it sunk to the bottom never to be seen more alive it was with the utmost difficulty the rest were saved the sailors finding no hope of escaping that way began to throw overboard their guns watercasks and provision and by the divine providence found out one of the leaks which they with much difficulty stopped and by continual plying the pump cleared her of some water but the incessant labor fatigued us all so much that we began to despair again yet life being sweet every person in the vessel put forth their utmost strength and labored hard all night in the break of the morning we discovered land to the inexpressible joy of the sailors and what wind we had pointed fair for the place but our joy had like to have been more fatal than the storm for upon the first notice of discovering land every person ran upon deck like madmen to be confirmed in the pleasing news never regarding the pumps till we found the vessel almost sinking under us yet the hope of life inspired us with new strength we worked as hard as if the sight of shore had been a days rest from labor we had no boat to land with therefore the captain made a signal of distress and in less than an hour we saw several boats rowing toward us the captain wisely considered if these boats should come on board every one would be for getting into them and leave the vessel to sink for want of working therefore he ordered towropes out that the approaching boats might lend their assistance that way accordingly he acquainted the sailors with his intention and they with the passengers approved of it the boats when they came near us obeyed the captains order and in two hours we arrived safe in st aubins bay a harbor in the island of jersey the island of jersey in latin caesarea from julius caesar who gave it his own name this island and guernsey are all that is left to england of their mighty french conquests it appertains to hampshire under the jurisdiction of the bishops of winchester having for its church government a dean and twelve ministers of the gospel and for its civil a bailiff with twelve of the chief gentlemen of the island called jurors to administer justice besides these a governor deputy governor and captains for their several garrisons yet the complainant has still the privilege to seek redress from the king and council in most cases of wrong or difficulty  this island is famous for cider and perry but its staple commodity is the famous jersey stockings so well known in england  the air is mild pleasant and not unwholesome the soil rich and fruitful the very hedges produce apples and pears without planting and the meanest cottage can accommodate you with a cup of cider or perry their french wheat is equal to any in france and their other grain as good as any in england the sea yields them plenty of fish and wildfowl innumerable  this island by a strict calculation contains   000 inhabitants and can raise in defense of their country not including their garrisons upwards of  000 fighting men it is above  0 miles round  0 in length and   in breadth the inhabitants have to the last been in the interest of the crown of england and more than once the retreat of their distressed princes the earl of richmond afterward henry the seventh first took shelter here and from hence went over to britany where he raised forces sufficient to gain the crown and punish richard the third for his bloody reign  king charles ii made this place the first stage of his exile during olivers usurpation this island was the last place that surrendered to the parliamentforces nor would the then heroic governor surrender elizabeths castle till he received an order for that purpose from prince charles then residing at the french court and in consideration of their many services and unshaken loyalty it has had many privileges and immunities granted by the crown of england among the rest a silver mace sent em by king charles ii in the year       through their watchful courage they have often repulsed the french who have made many vain attempts to graft this scien to its ancient stock the greatest inconveniency is its want of wood for fuel instead of that they make use of a sea weed by the inhabitants called vrau the chief town of the island is call st hilaria but the strongest castle perhaps in his majestys dominion is called elizabeth completed in that queens reign built upon a rock in the middle of the ocean in the mouth of bay st aubins there is no passage from the island on foot but at low water nor then for above ten men in front opposite near the town of st aubins is another strong tower surrounded by the sea called la tour or the tower the natives in general speak french as well as english and seem to be a courteous goodnatured affable people never better pleased than when conferring obligations   the noble lord jermin the then governor came to the harbor and invited me and my company on shore where we were entertained and accomodated as well as if we had been in england i shall decline mentioning those fine qualities so well known in his native country and only say he is adored in his government the inhabitants expressing the utmost sorrow when it occurs to their memory the time must come for him to leave them  we were obliged to stay in this place many days against our inclinations though the abovementioned nobleman did all in his power to make the time pass away as pleasantly as he could  when our captain had taken out his lading and ballast to search for the leaks he informed us twould be full twenty days before his vessel would be in a condition to put to sea again this notice made us all very uneasy but for my own part i appeared so very much dejected that the noble governor out of his good nature seemed to sympathize with me in sorrow i must own though life was a burden to me yet the thoughts that my dear uncle would imagine me no longer in this world and with sorrow break his heart added pain to pain and grief to grief the consolations of my friends were to no purpose though their friendly sighs were mingled with mine  my lord governor perceiving the uneasiness we expressed at our stay in the island sent to guernsey a small vessel to inquire whether there was any ship preparing to sail for england she returned the next day and informed us a ship from the east indies had put in there the late storm and intended to set sail for england in two days  this news revived all my company therefore we took leave of the governor with thanks for his kind usage embarked in the same vessel that brought us the news though it was almost evening and about midnight arrived safely in st peters harbor in the island of guernsey guernsey in latin sarnia lies nearer england a seven leagues than jersey it is very stony and nous yet there are fine meadows and pasture scattered up and down the whole island it is famous for the best of butter with which and fish they drive a considerable trade with france st peters is the chief town very well inhabited  situated upon a rock about half a mile in the sea is cornet castle a place of great strength commanding all parts of the harbor which is generally the residence of the governor  in the reign of king charles ii the magazine of powder was fired by lightning in the night when the governor lord hatton his lady children and family were in their beds the governor was forced out of the window in his shirt thrown upon the wall of the castle several paces from the chamber when he lay and received no hurt but his lady and several of her maidservants were killed by the accident his child an infant was found the next day in its cradle under a beam sleeping in safety     inquiring for the captain of the ship in the harbor we found him at a tavern but i was agreeably surpised to find it mr brooks and his ship the elizabeth which he worthily saved for his cousin mr bridgford that married the widow by a wile he hardly knew me at first but when i came to his remembrance he seemed as much transported as if i had been his own son he was confounded to find me with such company in a place so little expected but i soon let him into as much of my story as i thought proper i must own said he when i received a letter from the governor yesterday desiring it as a favor to give passage to england to some gentlemen ladies and their servants i did not intend to comply with it through the inconveniency it would put me to therefore gave orders to set sail early in the morning knowing there was another vessel now in the harbor that sails for england in a few days neither could the governor take it ill as he only directed his letter to any captain that should chance to be in the bay but if i had known my passengers i would have staid a fortnight to oblige them and myself too i returned him thanks for his civility and begged him to set sail with the soonest why then this moment if you please answered the captain  upon the instant he took leave of his company at the tavern and though we were all very much fatigued went on board his ship where he gave immediate orders for weighing anchor and we were under sail before break of day the captain resigned the great cabin to the two ladies and accommodated every body as well as he could  i retired to mine hoping i should meet with a little repose being something calmer in my mind knowing a few days would put a period to my misfortunes by death for i had made a firm resolution to punish the perfidy of isabellas husband or fall by his hand or if i survived to find a way to die beneath her feet  these thoughts lulled me to taste the pleasures of refreshing sleep but my senses were hardly locked up before i was awaked with the groans of a person not far off in one of the cabbins i arose up in my bed and listened when i heard a man cry for heavens sake take off my irons that i may die at liberty another answered you know i dare not do it without the captains order and he is now gone to sleep as soon as he is up i will go and acquaint him dear tom replied the other take pity on the miseries i feel and step to him now i know he does not want humanity or goodnature and though i deserve not the least favor from him yet when i am going to give an account to heaven for all my crimes i am assured he will release me from these heavy irons that even a man in health can hardly bear  i own i was touched with the persons deep sighs therefore called for my servant put on my gown and went to enquire into the melancholy affair when i came to the cabin where the wretch lay i was shocked to see a man stretched at his length upon a poor flockbed on the ground without any covering meagre and pale with at least a hundred pounds weight of irons about his body to me he seemed as if his last moments were approaching compassion took possession of my soul though i was convinced by his own discourse he deserved but little  a sailor that was walking upon deck came up to me and judging by my countenance that i seemed to pity the unfortunate wretch cried out what is he going let him go and be d  nd friend said i let this poor creatures crimes be what they will i must own i think his condition deserves compassion therefore i shall be very much obliged to you if you will free him from his irons that his soul may take its flight with the more tranquillity sir replied the sailor if you were acquainted with that rogues wicked heart you would believe no punishment in this or the next world could be bad enough for him o sir cried the unfortunate wretch i deserve every thing that man says but i have heartily repented of all the ill actions i have committed and only beg to die without this load upon my body some of these irons have eat my flesh from the bones and as i wear the form of a man dont let me be treated in my dying moments worse than a mad beast tied to the stake  i used so many persuasions with the rhetoric of a guinea to the person that seemed to have the guard of him that he was going to awake the captain and acquaint him with the poor wretchs condition and my request to have him released from his fetters but the captain that moment came out of his cabin being disturbed with our conversation and at my entreaty ordered his irons to be taken off as soon as he was freed from them he gave me thanks for the service i had done him and rising slowly from his bed whereon he lay seized upon some of the irons he was released from and struck the sailor that was talking to me before the captain came out of his cabin with such violence that we all believed he was killed then made a blow at the captain which he happily avoided by starting aside but perceiving the sailors running from all parts of the ship to seize him he threw himself overboard maugre all they could do to prevent him crying he had in some measure satisfied his revenge and was never seen more  all this was done so suddenly that i stood quite confounded imagining i was in a dream but when we began to recollect ourselves we went to see if the sailor was alive or dead we took him up and i must own i was very well pleased to find he was only stunned with the blow in a little time he came to his senses and the first words he spoke were g  d d  n him for a son of a b  h who would have thought he had so much strength left but i will prevent him giving another blow upon saying this he ran up and down the deck with his cutlass drawn he being one of the centries at the great cabin door to seek for him to make an end of him but when he was informed of his rash catastrophe he seemed to be uneasy that he had not the killing of him with his own hand  by this time my brother clerimont and the ladies were alarmed and came about us to know the cause of the disturbance i told em twas the first time i ever found compassion a dangerous virtue we begged of the captain to let us into the affair he told us at dinner it should be our desert instead of fruit while this combustion happened the man at the helm had disregarded the steerage so that the sails clapped to the masts and the ship staid some time but even this seemed the providence of heaven for had we continued our course it being a very hazy morning we should have run upon the shallows of the great sark the great sark is a small island about three leagues from guernsey it formerly belonged to the french but the english took it from them by stratagem there is but one small town and three or four little villages on the whole island it was given by the crown to the carteret family who are lords of sark   thank heaven said the captain this wretch after endeavoring to frustrate our voyage by the most wicked designs could ever enter the mind of man seems intended by providence to be the means of saving us and like jonah in the ship of joppa now he has abandoned our vessel we shall have all dangers cease  when the ship had her true way again the captain ordered the wretches bedding and clothes to be examined and thrown overboard in searching the pockets of an old pair of breeches they found a written paper with a pencil which he read to the company as follows if heaven forsakes me hell will receive me with open arms i have endeavored to repent but still find my mind bent on revenge and i will hazard my body and soul to accomplish it if ever i can by any cunning method get rid of my irons i will if i have strength be the death of captain brooks tom burgess tom wingfield dick hammond and robin norton for using me so ill i write this to leave behind that if i should die in my confinement those villains may know what i intended to do but if i fail of my intended purpose it will grieve me in my state of perdition     this terrible declaration made me very much repent my goodnature i could hardly think there had been such a wicked villain in the world  after dinner we begged captain brooks to relate the history of this wretch which he did in the following manner  sir said he directing his discourse to me having some small knowledge of him you know my cousin bridgford the old acquaintance of your good uncle made me captain of the elizabeth in consideration of some services he was pleased to own i did him this wretch who is gone to the other world to answer for his crimes in this through my entreaty was made chief mate and behaved honestly as such during our tradingvoyage to the indies in our return near the latitude of st helena where we were bound for some refreshment in the middle of a dark night we heard some guns fired that seemed to us as if some vessel was in distress i ordered our ship to steer the course from whence the fire came but in an hour afterward we heard such a terrible report that we all concluded the unfortunate vessel was blown into the air however i kept on my course to see if i could assist any of the unfortunate wretches that no doubt had either got into their boat or had thrown themselves into the water to avoid the flames hanging out lights about several parts of my ship that they might see where to come for succor  in less than an hour more some of our crew could perceive a boat rowing toward us full of men as soon as they came up with us they begged for heavens sake to be taken on board i who had no other intention moved by compassion considering it might have been our own case invited em kindly on board when they were a little recovered from their fright they informed me they belonged to a ship bound for cork in ireland from the coast of coromandel and had by a violent storm been drove out of their course that in the beginning of the night a fire broke out in the gunroom burning with such fury that all their endeavors to extinguish it proved fruitless therefore they hoisted out their longboat and with one barrel of water and two casks of biscuit abandoned their ship and in half an hour after they left it they saw it blow up several pieces of the vessel falling within twenty yards of em  there were seventeen men in the boat their master being one of them whose name was cox but observing he was very much wounded in the head i ordered our surgeon to dress him immediately who informed me his skull was fracturd and he thought it seemed to be a blow with a cutlass but the sailors that came with him in the boat told us he arose up hastily at the first noise about the fire and hurrying down the ladder that goes under deck fell with his head on the edge of a bucket when he came to his senses for the pain of dressing had flung him into a swoon he told us the same story yet still the surgeon insisted it could be no such thing and began to instill i know not what notions into my mind that these men might be villains i own he a little staggered my faith at first but when i considered their condition i thought it impossible however i determined to leave em all at st helena because indeed there were too many mouths for me to maintain in our voyage for england i gave em all the refreshment my ship could afford and they returned me thanks in so sincere a manner that quite obliterated those notions the surgeon had of them the captain i put in my own cabin using him as i thought an honest unfortunate man in his condition deserved and such as i should have been pleased to meet with upon the like unfortunate accident  in two days after this we arrived safe at st helena the island of st helena was discovered upon st helens day in the year   0  by john de nova a portuguese it is now in the possession of the english it is st surrounded with rocks and reckoned the farthest island from the continent of any in the known world it is about    miles in compass and though mountainous is very fruitful there are four very pleasant valleys and as many springs of good water all sorts of poultry sallading roots and fruits as well as hogs flesh are so cheap that it is almost a miracle when we consider the many east india ships that touch there every year it is very well inhabited but they dwell in the valleys except when the ships arrive when they repair to the fort with their provisions for the ships every trader having a warehouse in the town where they barter with the sailors for necessaries seldom any money passing between them when the ships are gone the planters retire to their houses in the valleys that are delightfully situated breathing a healthful air and subjected to few diseases they are governed by the same laws as in england  where i put all the unfortunate sailors on shore with this reason that my ship was too deep laden to be encumbered with so many superfluous men  i went to wait on the governor on shore and contracted with him for what fresh provisions i wanted intending to set sail in eight days but the governor advised me to stay longer assuring me that several ships would arrive before that time that would accompany me in our voyage home on that account i resolved to take his advice i sent on board for some necessaries because i intended to take a lodging in the valley for a fortnight to enjoy the air of the country but my surgeon being informed of my intention came with my servant in the boat with the things i had sent for importuning me so strongly not to lie out of the ship tha i returned on board with him purely to make him easy for i must own his apprehensions did not give me the least inquietude  homes the name of the wretch that is so lately gone to perdition complained he was very much troubled with the scurvy therefore entreated the favor of going on shore for a few days i could not refuse him neither had i any apprehension of an ill design from him having ever behaved in the voyage like a downright honest man entirely in our owners interest we staid twenty days in the harbor without the appearance of any ship from the east therefore i made a resolution of pursuing our intended voyage if no vessel arrived to bear us company in four days accordingly i gave notice to the governor of my intention as usual that the inhabitants if they had any demands might be satisfied before we set sail  i went to rest that night with a tremor upon my spirits and an unaccountable melancholy that seemed a foreboding ill omen about midnight the surgeon came into my cabin and awaked me with a very great surprise in his countenance his looks i own very much alarmed me what is the matter with you mr westwood said i that is the name of my surgeon you seem in some disorder sir replied mr westwood here is a man has swam from shore in the middle of a stormy night to give you notice of approaching danger and i must own i have been in such a continual lowness of spirits that i am well assured some ill designs are hatching against our welfare therefore pray rise and hear what the person has to say for he will not communicate it to any one but yourself i arose upon the instant and desired him to bring in the man he brought him into the cabin naked as he was as soon as i saw him i knew him for one of the persons that came to us in the boat sir said he i have something to inform you of that requires your private ear my friend i replied this gentleman is one whom i can entirely trust therefore what you have to communicate to me he may hear if so sir replied the man i shall proceed however sir said i i beg the favor since you came naked for my service as i suppose that you will put on this nightgown sir returned the man i will accept of your favor though i feel nothing of the inclemency of the weather because my concern for you has filled up all my thoughts i therefore will proceed to tell you what i know that you may be prepared for the event mr homes your chief mate has formed the blackest design that could ever enter into the soul of the most profligate in less than two hours he will seize your ship and put to death you and mr westwood with every sailor that will not come into his black design i own myself one of the confederates but with no other motive than to use my utmost endeavors to prevent it if heaven will permit therefore acquaint your men with the danger approaching arm em immediately and prevent em if possible at least sell your lives like men that have deserved a better fate i was eager to enquire about this affair but the man told me i had no time to lose first arm your men said he and when you are in readiness to receive them i will acquaint you with the conspiracy against you  i then ordered the watch to awake those that were gone to rest and when they were all upon deck with their arms in their hands i called the man and desired he would communicate the story to the whole crew which consisted of fiftyfour men we made a circle round him upon the quarter deck and he began as follows  gentlemen you all know me i believe to be one of those men whom the humanity of your captain saved from imminent death therefore i think he has a right to my life and fortune every person beside myself that his compassion gave means of life to have deserved the halter more than once their number was much greater their crew consisting of   0 men when they set out from the coast of guiney but the day before the night you saved us from the devouring waves we had a terrible engagement with a dutch man of war in which we lost above half our men homes the captain mistaking her for an indian trader that we had advice of from the guiney coast our ship taking fire by what accident i know not the dutch man of wars men that had boarded us and would have certainly taken us left us fearing as we supposed they might suffer by us if we blew up and sailed away the fire was so sudden that we had but a small time to hoist out our longboat the captain and sixteen of us got into it but many other of the wretches endeavoring to get in were barbarously murdered by the other sailors we rowed as fast as we could from the burning ship but the cries of the wretches we left behind methinks are still in my ears it was no small joy to us when we perceived your lights hung out but the wretch the captain though so dangerously wounded declared if he thought he should have met with a ship so soon he would have taken all the men he could that he might have been able to have taken the ship that was coming to his rescue but since it is as it is said he we must make the best of a bad market and wait for some opportunity to get another ship then we consulted how to impose on you with a false story and trumpd up that they told you for the wound the captain has upon his head was given by a dutchman in the fight pray said the surgeon how came you among such a crew of villains why sir i will tell you replied the man i belonged to a coast sloop in the river of gambo where all my crew were murdered but one by the negroes who had inviegled them up into the country the poor man that made his escape had but just time to tell me the fatal news ere death overtook him from the wounds he had received i had scarce time to cut my cable and drive out to sea favored by the wind and tide of ebb when i perceived about twenty boats coming down the river in order to seize my sloop and no doubt to make me partake of the same fate with my unfortunate men which i certainly should have done for they would have overtaken me in a couple of hours if both they and i had not perceived a ship in the offin which proved to be this wretch and his crew i made them a signal of my distress which they perceiving made up to me and took me on board but the negroes left their pursuit as soon as ever they discovered the ship  i soon found to my sorrow what company i was got into but it was to no purpose to complain for the captain seized my vessel took out every thing that seemed useful and sunk her with this pretense he feared his men might take it into their heads to leave him and set up for themselves though i must own he promised to pay me for my cargo and give me my liberty the first opportunity but those were but words and what i verily believe he never intended to perform  i often observed your mate during the time we were sailing to this island after you kindly took us in caballing privately with our captain and several of our men but had no notion of their wicked intention to seize your ship till yesterday morning being at a planters in the south valley where i was treated with some palm wine and not being used to drink in a morning it got into my head finding myself inclined to sleep i laid myself down under a hedge but before i had closed my eyes i was interrupted by the voices of our captain and your mate by their discourse i found out their black design and their business to that plantation was to communicate the affair to me but i understood if i did not come into it it was their intention to murder me i immediately arose from the place full of unquiet thoughts which brought me out of my drunken fit i took care to get as far from the hedge as i could that they might not suspect i had overheard em it was a full quarter of an hour before they found me out and in that time i had composed myself as well as i could when they came up with me they asked me if i would take a walk to the next plantation where two of them lodged i answered very willingly yes  when we came to the bridge that was built over the river they stopped and opened the whole affair to me i made no hesitation but entered into their design with a seeming joy for if i had not i dont doubt but it was their intention to throw me into the river nay their very looks declared as much  at three of clock this morning your mate with the rest are to board you armed every man with a cutlass and two brace of pistols secure the watch and kill every one that will not take part in their villainous undertaking then weigh anchor and sail for the bermudas where they will dispose of the cargo and then set out upon the pirating account  when he had finished his short but terrible relation the sailors cried out they would have the longboat and meet them with such a reception that should make em repent their undertaking but the surgeon and i persuaded them it would be better and safer to counterwork them we therefore agreed to charge all our guns with musketball and if they offered to come on when we ordered them to return the sailors should fire upon em however eight of my men prevailed upon me to have the longboat ready to pursue them and bring em prisoners in order to be punished for their treacherous intention  in short we provided against every thing and in half an hour after we were prepared to receive em we heard their oars in the water we let em come within three ships length of us and then called to em to proceed no farther as they i believe did not expect to be hindered in their boarding us they lay upon their oars and asked me what i was afraid of homes was the chief speaker who i soon gave to understand i knew his vile intention if it be so he cried out we have no time to dally come my lads well soon see who are to be masters they or we upon that they rowed toward us with all their strength with their cutlasses drawn and pistols in their hands but before they reached us we fired upon em with our double and round which killed four of their number and wounded several their confusion was so great at this unexpected reception that they rowed ahead of us where our guns could not bear upon them while i was ordering my men upon the forecastle to fire upon them i perceived the ship driving for that wretch homes had cut my cable  the tide by good fortune was ebbing for had it been tide of flood we must have drove upon the rocks before we could have cast another anchor in the confusion the boat rowed to board us but my men fired upon them once more in the same manner as at first which put em in much disorder our ship still driving i ordered em to cast anchor however they took so much time in doing it that we were a quarter of a league from the pirates before the anchor fell in the mean time our longboat with the eight men got up to the pirates and a desperate engagement followed what troubled me was that i could not assist em for if i had fired my guns with ball which could easily reach em i might have destroyed my friends with my enemies my men were swearing cursing and banning at this unforeseen accident nay some of em were for stripping with an intention to swim naked to help em never once considering the tide of ebb would prevent em but what was the more extraordinary in this confusion not one of us for some time thought of our yawl upon the booms but as soon as i mentioned it they got it into the water in a moment threw themselves into it with so much precipitation that their haste had almost overset it and rowed away with so much strength that they soon got up to the assistance of their comrades in good time for two of em were killed and the other six very much wounded their firing we observed had ceased some time having discharged all their firearms and if the yawl had not arrived as it did the other six of my men had certainly been cut to pieces but this reinforcement soon put an end to the fight by the death of all the pirates but two and homes who were very much wounded  when they were brought on board my men were for tearing them to pieces especially homes but i pacified them a little by telling em they should be reserved for the punishment due to their crimes when we arrived in england  my surgeon dressed their wounds and by good fortune all my own men recovered but the two pirates died in our voyage home the vile wretch homes while his hurts were healing used to utter such blasphemous imprecations that shocked all the crew when he was fully recovered i ordered him to be manacled leaving his legs at liberty with two men to guard him he often attempted to throw himself overboard and was as often prevented  about a month ago as he was walking upon deck with his two guards he observed mr mullart the person that swam on board to give us notice of their design standing upon the gunnel of the ship to look at a dead whale that was floating near us he goes up to him unobserved and pushed him into the sea as it fell out the sea was very calm though we had wind enough to fill our sails otherwise though a good swimmer he might have perished we brought to with all the celerity imaginable and not without some difficulty saved him  one of the sailors upbraiding him for the cruelty of the action he struck him in the face broke his jaw and beat out three of his teeth with his handcuffs i seeing this vile proceeding ordered him to be seized and fettered but it was with much difficulty for he laid about him with such agility and vigor that a carpenter was obliged to knock him down with a handspike when he came to himself for the blow had stunned him for some time he swore he was sorry for nothing but that mullart was not gone to hell by water  as i was giving orders how he should be used for the future he grinnd at me gave me several hearty curses and spit in my face which i own provoked me to strike him he was then laid in the manner you saw him this morning  about a week ago he began to think of his crimes and seemed so penitent that i ordered his irons to be taken off had him bathed shifted and cleaned when his clothes were on again mr mullart being upon deck he very submissively approached him telling him he was very sorry for what he had done to him but as soon as ever he got within his reach he flew upon him got him down and in his fury would have strangled him if if he had not been taken away by main force  we all thought it high time to make him as secure as possible for such an infernal wretch never more could deserve compassion for these last three days his centries have thought him near his death but it was only his artifice to get clear once more that he might do more mischief in his last moments  when mr brooks had ended his story we all thought it impossible nature should furnish out such a villain and yet said the captain this wretch has made more than one voyage with me and ever seemed a man of integrity an open and free countenance that discovered no rancour or baseness in it but as shakespeare says there is no art to find the minds construction in the face  we sailed on with a favorable gale bending our course for the bristol channel where captain brooks was bound on the fourth day after our leaving guernsey we discovered the chalky cliffs of our native country which gave a sudden alteration to the features of every one of the company all but myself wore a pleasing contentment on their countenances but for my own part my mind felt so many vicissitudes that the wisest physiognomist i believe would have been puzzled to have known my thoughts but no wonder for i knew em not myself all the passions of love duty hatred jealousy revenge and death mixed in such a general tumult that all within was wild anarchy and uproar the thoughts of seeing my native country which filled every one else with the utmost transports gave me no other satisfaction than the hopes of death to put an end to thought and all my devouring sorrows  in two days more we came to an anchor near the landingplace of the island of lundy the island of lundy is an island five miles long and two broad surrounded with rocks in the middle of the severn sea near the coast of cornwall thinly inhabited and although seated in the salt ocean yet there are many springs of excellent fresh water and prodigiously stocked with wildfowl  where we found a small vessel bound for monmouth as that place was but a days journey from most of our dwellings we took leave of captain brooks and embarked in that vessel for monmouth the captain parted from us with very great regret but with a promise to see us in a few days after his arrival at bristol we weighed anchor together and kept company till we arrived at the mouth of the avon that leads to bristol and then parted after receiving several guns from the elizabeth by way of salute we arrived that night at chepstow upon the river wye where all the company desired to be set on shore for they were very much fatigued particularly the ladies  as soon as ever we landed i sent one of my servants to acquaint my uncle with my arrival and of my intentions to wait on him in three days at the farthest with orders to my servant to meet me at monmouth the next day where we arrived by noon i found my servant waiting for me who informed me that my uncle and mrs betty had been gone to london four days before to wait my arrival there i own i was both grieved and pleased grieved that i should not see my dear uncle so soon as i expected and pleased to know that he had received my letters and had strength and health enough to travel  now despair with all its black train of horrors fully possessed my soul yet gave me light enough to see i should never possess my dear isabella all hopes were banished and the nearer i drew to the residence of my adorable fair one the farther i drew from all thoughts of happiness what pains what miseries what anxieties and what inexpressible tortures was my broken heart torn with treading upon the same earth and breathing the same air with my dear love for ever debarred my arms only added to my various torments  i went to rest but alas the fatigues of the sea the weakness of my body and the want of sleep were overbalancd by the tortures of my mind  i arose in the morning without ever closing my eyes which had made such an alteration in my countenance that i was hardly known by my friends they were too well acquainted with the cause yet notwithstanding endeavored to comfort me but alas they might as well have stopped the fury of a tempest or the swiftest current in its rapid course as give advice to heal my wounded soul  my friend was inconsolable well knowing my ruin was the work of his unlucky forming and maugre my ill fate i was compelled to smother my heartbreaking sorrows in order to comfort him who now was dearer to me than any thing on earth since i had lost all hopes of my divine isabella  the tortures of my mind preyed so violently on my body that i was once more hurried to the dark confines of death a special messenger was sent to my uncle at london to inform him of my unhappy state and my newconverted dear friend would accompany him maugre all my entreaties to the contrary i was so very weak it was dangerous to remove me to my uncles though but a short days journey from monmouth as i thought my last moments approaching i took a resolution of writing the following letter to isabella  what envious stars divine isabella have wrought this murder on my love but why do i tax the stars when it was the work of false malice and treachery you i know through the excellency of your soul will love the man you have given your hand to and bury all your vows to me in oblivion pray heaven for your peace of mind you may this is i firmly believe the last pen i shall ever take in hand the hours i have to live i hope will not be many since i have lost all in this world i wished to live for will thou when i am dead water my grave with one pitying tear and lament my unhappy destiny i have no wish now remaining but that if it was possible thou were present to close the eyes of the heartbroken unhappy  vaughan p s i have sent you a few trifles that i hope you will accept since they were purchased in my unfortunate travels for you it can be no breach of duty to your happy husband sure to look upon em sometimes oh how happy should i have been if i had never embarked from my native country but it is heavens high will it should be so and i wish i could not complain it would have been too great a happiness to have been blessed with thee i could dwell for ever on this melancholy theme but my weakness obliges me to leave off and gives me just strength enough to say  farewell for ever    my spirits with my tears and sighs had left me and it was some time ere i had strength enough to fold the letter and direct it to the divine isabella  i ordered my servant that had accompanied me in my travels to find her out and if it was possible to give it into her own hands observe said i her countenance tell her the unhappy condition of thy master i will if it be possible keep life till thy return that i may have the pleasure in dying to hear she has dropped a tear for all my misfortunes he promised to execute his commission with the utmost diligence  the next day he returned with a dejected countenance and informed me that isabella her mother and aunt had been gone some days from their house but none of the servants could inform him whither he also inquired of the neighborhood but to as little purpose  this struck me into the last depth of despair insomuch that i resolved to put a period to my life i refused all physic nourishment and rest and despised the entreaties of my brother and his friends i informed em no one upon earth not my dear uncle should destroy my resolution of dying if he arrived before i expired they pressed me with their tears and sighs but all in vain till at last they prevailed upon me to hear the prayers of a worthy clergyman who so effectually cured me of despair by laying before me the neverforgiven sin of selfmurder that i submitted to all their desires the physicians prescribed i took their medicines received what they intended for nourishment and addressed myself to sleep yet all to no purpose death glard me full in the face though all his terrors could not fright me i looked upon him as the only cure for a broken heart the conversation with my good priest had i thank heaven settled my conscience i expected deaths approach as that of my best friend and hoped to see him before my uncle that i might not be a living witness to all his heartrending griefs they gave me medicines to make me sleep but alas the agonies i felt in what the apothecaries call composing draughts and that seem to lock up the senses to soft slumber are hardly to be expressed the mind was still awake though my body seemingly was at rest and fancy represented to me my hard fortune with redoubled terrors  i was ten days in this languishing deplorable condition fluctuating between death and life when news was brought me of my uncles arrival though i wished to sink to the silent grave for the reason i just now mentioned yet my heart felt some gleam of pleasure that he was come to close my eyes and bless me ere i died when my uncle entered the room where i lay he ran to me tenderly embraced me and wept over me o heaven said he is this the joy i proposed to myself in thy precious conversation no my dear boy thou shall not leave me forget isabella and turn thy eyes to another beauty i have brought with me that loves thee for thy virtue and thy merit and if that can have any effect upon thee she is the very picture of thy lost isabella since she is now anothers turn thy eyes upon this lady and let her charms cure those wounds the other gave alas sir said i fate is not to be controlled and my passion is as irrevocable will thou not live replied my uncle to comfort my feeble age who have no other joy in life but thee i have been industrious to provide this match for thee and contrary to the rules of the sex have prevailed upon her to accompany me do not let thy hopeless passion make thee forget good manners thy slights will break her heart never poor wretch had such a conflict in his soul i thought it would be the highest ingratitude not to see a poor young lady that had given me her heart without seeing me after much argument i told my uncle if he pleased he might bring the lady to see what a wretch she had placed her unhappy love upon and all the satisfaction i could give her was to expire before her for i told my uncle i found death approaching  he immediately went out and returned with my friend who led a lady by the hand i then called to mind weak as i was he had often told me of a beautiful sister of his that he wished i could love that he might make me some recompense for the loss he caused of my isabella and i out of good manners seldom said any thing against it  madam said i your good brother has brought you to see a wretch though young old in misfortunes one who is flying to the grave to seek a refuge from em one who  what interrupted the lady and has my dear vaughan in reality forgot his isabella the chamber having but little light in it i could not distinguish the features of my isabella but i knew full well that soft voice whose tone was ever in my ears it had such an effect upon me that i could only pronounce her dear name then sunk down speechless in my bed it was a full half hour ere they could restore me to sense but when i saw the dear image tenderly weeping over me that i ever carried in my heart i could not help crying out am i awake or do i dream of such imaginary bliss art thou indeed my isabella mine really mine and not wedded to that wretch who would rob me of all my soul can love in this world i am thine replied the charming isabella ever will be thine nor ever was or ever will be any others i have my mothers my aunts and thy good uncles consent to join our hands as well as hearts together and they are here to ratify what i say upon this the mother and aunt entered who tenderly embraced me calling me their dear son and nephew  these tender transports were too strong for my weak frame and joy was near doing what my griefs would soon have done my speech forsook me and every one about me thought i was gone for ever it was many hours before i was brought to life and when i recovered i found my dear isabella almost in the same condition but kind heaven that is watchful over those that tread in the paths of goodness in a few days recovered us to taste the bliss of happy virtuous love in our chaste conversation it was some time before i had leisure to enquire concerning my unbounded joy when my friend informed me of it in this manner  when i saw you my dear vaughan plunged in sorrow by my means i had often thoughts of putting an end to my wretched life but reflecting it would be a nobler piece of justice to punish the villain that was the cause of all our misfortunes i was resolved to seek him out to take away his life or give up mine to pay for the injustice i had done you through his wiles i found a fitting pretense to leave you when you supposed i was going with your servant to london in order to acquaint your good uncle with our miserable state but i parted with the messenger the morning we set out giving him directions to call upon me in his return with your uncle to receive advice from me if fate had ordained i should not fall in the attempt or if they heard no news of me to conclude i was no longer in this world when i came within a few miles of the residence of isabella a violent storm arose which made me take shelter in a neighboring village but guess my surprise when i saw a coach and six stop at the church door which by the liveries i knew belonged to that vile man sir eustace i formerly called friend the sight at first almost took away my senses but recollecting my scattered reason i set my self to observe all passages the wretch came out dressed like a foppish bridegroom leading the lovely isabella trembling pale and wan followed by the mother and aunt i inquired of a standerby if he knew that gentleman and the ladies he answered no but that they came to be married at their town for more privacy hope then began to revive in my soul for i was resolved to put a stop to the wedding or lose my life  i followed em into the church where as soon as sir eustace saw me he cried out in a transport of joy fortune i thank thee thou have sent the only friend i have in the world to be witness of my joy upon that he come forward with open arms to embrace me hold said i pushing him from me i abhor all friendship with a villain and kind heaven has sent me at this happy moment to prevent thy imposing upon this betrayed young lady and her relations through thy villainy and my mistaken folly but know the hand of heaven by me shall punish thee for all thy villainies he stood like one aghast while i had time to go up to the young lady madam said i if you ever did love the unhappy vaughan love him still for he is innocent and ever was so but betrayed by that wretch who is more eminent in vice than title  the lovely isabella i thought seemed to listen with an eager transport in her eyes at what i declared i gave her my hand and led her out of the church followed by the parson who seemed in the utmost amazement at this wonderful proceeding but i told him his disappointment should be no loss to him for i would pay him as well as if he had finished the marriage for heavens sake sir replied the parson dont imagine i am such a mercenary wretch to think of the loss of what i might expect for doing the holy office i am ordained to by heaven and my superiors no i am i own very much surpised at such an adventure that never happened to me before or any one of my holy function that i ever heard of yet i am convinced there is something very extraordinary in your proceeding and i own i think by your appearance and the confusion of the other gentleman you are in the right i took a distaste against him the first time i saw him when he came to me about the license what a brave trade you would have doctor said he if you could grant a license to undo what you have done this way in your time ah how happy should we young fellows think ourselves if such a thing could be brought about but when i reprimanded him for his ludicrous manner of speaking he cried prythee old tackum dont be so musty i warrant you have had many a wench in your time i own i was so very much offended with his ridiculous jests that i told him the lady he was going to marry i feared would have but an indifferent time with him and if i had the happiness of her acquaintance i should think it my duty to inform her of the poorness of his imaginations when he found i was a little scandalized with his mean notions of marriage he began to excuse himself and beg my pardon  i forgot to tell you as i led isabella out of the church my false friend stood like one thunderstruck in his amazement villain said i as i passed him if thou think i have injured thee in the discovery i shall make to this lady and her relations thou know where i may be found in a few days where i will be ready to chastise thy persidy to this lady and the infamy thou have thrown on me he gave me no manner of answer but let me pass on without interruption  when we came to the parsons house i related not without blushing the base and infamous contrivance between sir eustace and me my repentance and the terrible effects it had on you also the history of your brother and the fair fatima with clerimont and his lady as i had learnt em from your own relations the charming isabella shed a torrent of tears at the repetition of all your sufferings it was easily seen she loved you with an unbounded passion the mother and aunt seemed as much transported with joy as the fair isabella how shall i punish myself cried the fair one for so easily believing my dear vaughan false his good uncle too what shall we say to him to excuse our ill treatment i comforted em by telling em the proofs were too artful and plain to be doubted for truths in short never were any persons elevated from dismal sorrow to the extremest pitch of pleasure as these ladies and myself were raised to but that joy was tempered with fears when i informed em of your cruel indisposition and sorrows we resolved to set out as soon as possible to the place appointed to meet your uncle and if we found him not there immediately to repair to monmouth but upon enquiry we could get no coach to carry the ladies therefore a servant was ordered to isabellas mothers for hers  while we were mingling our tears hopes sorrows and joys together the clark came to inform me the gentleman begged the favor of speaking one word with me in the churchyard i did not doubt but he had mustered up courage enough to call for satisfaction for his supposed injury i therefore took my sword and maugre the entreaties of isabella her mother and aunt went to meet him when i came near enough to him to be heard i told him i was ready to repair the injuries i had done him with my sword if he had spirit enough to require it no sir said he i have had time enough to recollect myself and find i have been to blame in my conduct but notwithstanding i find love like fate is not to be controlled therefore i conjure you by our former friendship to forget what is past and assist me honestly to gain the fair isabella i love her more than life and would even part with it to gain her heart and your forgiveness hearing him talk so reasonably i began to lose some part of my resentment but yet laid before him the impossibility of his ever gaining his desires we argued some time and our discourse had insensibly led us out of the churchyard along a narrow lane that led to a gate in the fields which i observing was for turning back hold said he you are not to return so soon as you imagine upon saying this he whistled through his fingers and i was upon the instant surrounded by six of his footmen who immediateiy seized and bound me now take that hypocrite and do as i ordered you know thou fool cried he looking me full in the face i have taken all the time i had before i sent to thee to think how i should punish thee for thy breach of friendship and the loss of isabella with that taking a whip from one of his servants he gave me several severe lashes then spitting in my face ordered his footmen to tie me to the gate and leave me fury and shame had tied up my tongue at this indignant usage therefore i could not utter a word and if the tears had not gushed from my eyes i believe my heart would have burst with passion my struggles to get loose were to no purpose and my strength failed me with my fruitless efforts which the villain perceiving repeated his indignities i know you will endeavor cried he to seek me out in hopes to revenge this affront but be assured fool whenever thou come in my way expect to meet with the same chastisement upon this he and his fellows left me almost dead with boiling rage it was not long however that i continued in this condition for isabella sent the clark after me to observe our motions who on the other side of the hedge heard how i was used but durst not appear till the villain was gone for fear of tasting the same bitter cup  as soon as i was at liberty i ran without speaking a word got upon my horse and flew after the villain but my rage had so blinded me i had not put the tongue of the buckle of the girt as i suppose firm in its place for i got ready my horse myself not having patience to wait for any one so that i came with the saddle between my legs upon the ground over the crupper of my horse though without any hurt but it was so late ere i could catch him again that i was well assured the wretch had reached his dwelling though thirty mile from the village where i had left isabella however i went on with my pursuit not considering the poor beast till he was so tired i could hardly get him along therefore i went into a little by alehouse resolving to stay till the morning i never went to bed for my furious passion was too violent for rest my time was spent in casting about how to be revenged on the injurious villain at last i fixed on this expedient i procured a disguise ombred my face and appeared as a gypsy i got the next day to the villains castle which is seated upon an eminence that overlooks a plain of two miles round and not one house but his own in that circuit it was a good while ere i could see any of the family but at last a little black boy came out with a bow and arrow to shoot at a mark he put up against a tree but as soon as he perceived me he ran back as if in a fright while i was looking after him i saw the villain meet him who took him by the hand and encouraged him to come toward me first looking circumspectly about him when he came to me he cried here you gypsy tell this black young devil his fortune no villain i replied i am come to tell thee thy fortune behold this injured face disguised as it is he knew my voice and was for running back but i got between him and the house drew my sword that i had concealed under my greatcoat and intercepted his passage he seeing no hopes of escaping drew his and as despair makes cowards valiant he made several violent thrusts at me but to no purpose for at last i sent him breathless to the ground with my sword through his body as soon as he fell i flew over the plain without being pursued took off my disguise wrapping some stones in it and sunk it in a pond on the skirts of a wood as i passed along unperceived by any one i got to the alehouse in my own person and that night came back to isabella and her relations who spent the time of my absence in great inquietudes i have not let them yet into the whole affair neither have i considered with myself whether to own the deed or not pursuit i know has been made after the gypsy but no enquiry after me if i surrender myself to the law i do not fear a pardon for the flagrant usage i received from that bad man will plead for me the clark nay even his own servants will be sufficient witnesses of it how would you advise me to proceed my dear vaughan i told him i thought it would be time enough to ward against it when he was called upon to answer but it was my opinion he would not have any farther trouble about it since he was not suspected  we had scarce ended our discourse when a servant came in very much surpised and told us there were several officers of justice with a great crowd of people with em armed enquiring for my friend crying they had a warrant to apprehend him for murder i own i was rash enough to advise the opposing em but he declared he would surrender without resistance and rely upon his innocence and provocation while i was arguing the affair with my friend the officers came into the room where we were accompanied by my uncle my brother and clerimont my friend surrendered without the least show of resistance as i was going down stairs to accompany him to prison he stopped me begging it as a favor i would not go with him consider said he you have not recovered your strength and i know your friendship so well that it will but disorder you to see the place where i am going my uncle joined with him come come billy said my uncle the sick must be used like old age you and i will stay behind and fear nothing i have interest enough in this country to have your friend well used and i have not the least fear he will suffer for an action no man of honor could avoid think of the happy moment that is now approaching isabella my boy the charming isabella will be your own in a few days my dear uncle i replied though i think every minute an age till my angelick isabella is mine yet i cannot think of that happiness while my dear friend is in misery thy friend replied my uncle will be free from trouble before the marriageceremony can be finished there are writings to be drawn settlements made and several things to be in order before we can enter upon that affair besides i would not come too abruptly into a business that must last for life you must approach your happiness by degrees  my dear uncle i replied the thought of my coming bliss is so great that was it not qualified by some fear i could not bear my transport i have felt the malevolence of that blind disposer chance so often i must own i am still in doubt even when i am in full possession of all my joy i shall tremble for fear of losing her sickness and death visit the youthful as well as those sunk in the vale of life and if that grim tyrant who rudely thrusts even to the beds of monarchs should intrude with his icy dart to that of my divine isabella alas with what terrors must i bear the remaining hours of life since my religion will not suffer me to put an end to it  these imaginary ills replied my uncle wrong thy understanding would you think of shipwreck in the port or refuse refreshing sleep for fear of melancholy dreams no no the world of happiness is in thy view the lovely prospect stands before thee free from the storms of fortune  whatever my good uncle could say to me on the joyful subject gave me but a gloomy satisfaction my dear uncle did all in his power to settle my thoughts in joy and by degrees my heart was so full of it that my eyes oerflowd with transports and i appeared all air and spirits  my dear uncle said i be so good to relate some passages of the unfortunate end of my good father and wicked motherinlaw that the sorrow may alleviate this mighty joy  my letter replied my uncle informed thee of every thing concerning that nevertobeforgotten catastrophe but searching that evil womans cabinet i found this copy of a letter she sent to wigmore with his answer to it which convinces me that he was not that penitent he pretended to be upon this my uncle took a couple of letters out of his pocket and gave em me to read the first was that of my vile motherinlaws as follows my dear dear wigmore i had counterfeited repentance so well for our past loves that i almost believed i could forget thee but alas that is not in my power why should we not love on am i the only woman in england false to her husband the court and the city ay every town village and hamlet in this wealthy island have sufficient numbers to keep me in countenance  nay my love is a virtue if constancys a virtue for i can love none but thee you ever reign triumphant in my heart and ever shall what are these bonds of matrimony that tie two people together against their inclination but the imaginary line that crosses the globe it is true we are coupled together by law like two hounds in a slip often tugging different ways but their joys are unbounded when those couples are unbuckled that keep em together but what law does love obey  i have read somewhere it is a law or custom stronger than a law even in many nations at this day that when a man even a stranger comes to stay all night in a place the goodnatured husband civilly abandons his house for that night leaving his new guest in full possession of his house and wife as the greatest compliment he can pay him oh if that custom was but in use here i should wish my husband abroad for ever and my dear wigmore my amiable traveller every night in the year in my arms  i need not tell thee that the romans were the conquerors of the universe and the wisest of all nations and yet one of their greatest orators lent his wife to his friend and received her again to his bosom without any stain to virtue however i have some hopes my housholdplague is upon his journey to heaven for he has been long lingering with a happy illness i own i have some thoughts of providing him posthorses to carry him to his journeys end oh how happy should i be then in the possession of my beloved wigmore without the fears and terrors that imbitter my life of love and joy in thy endearing company  i have with great difficulty prevailed upon the old woman to continue our emissary but if i had not informed her my soninlaw william was gone upon his foreign travels she would never have consented  i will meet you this evening in the summer house and let you in myself i have provided you a key of the backgarden gate that after tonight you may take all opportunities of seeing me without danger of being discovered our gardener is turned away through my means who i thought began to be a little too observing my husbands illness curse on that name will prevent his coming into that part of the garden and i shall take care of every body else by locking the door after me  i shall think time has no wings till i am happy in thy loved embraces yet though i see thee not with my corporal eyes thou art ever present to my mind and shall ever possess the body and soul of  thine entirely j v     when i had read the letter my uncle cried surely this woman had impudence enough to bestride the there was a custom in the manor of east and west enborn in berkshire called freebench that is if the husband dies the widow shall have his free bench in all his copyholdlands but if it is proved she has had during her widowhood criminal conversation with any man she forfeits her estate but if she will come into the court of justice riding backwards on a black ram with his tail in her hand repeating the following lines she may have her estate again here i am riding upon a black ram like a whore as i am and for my crincum crancum have lost my bincum bancum and for my tails game have done this worldly shame therefore i pray you mr steward let me have my land again  black ram without changing color heavens how were we deceived with this vile womans false penitence whenever i think on it i am pierced to the heart but come let us after these letters are destroyed bury all thoughts of this pernicious woman and all her vile machinations  but to the other and then commit them both to the flames wigmores answer was as follows my adorable i am prevented seeing you this evening by the violent attacks of an ague and fever your epistle pleases me and vexes me your continuance of love compels my heart to adore your goodness but the thoughts of using violence toward your husband raise such indignation in my breast that any future thoughts upon that subject will i am assured make me hate you for i have loved too well to despise you do we not injure him enough in our criminal conversation my soul and conscience those dreadful monitors tell me it is criminal though my heart filled with love has no room to entertain the terrible idea  i promised your good brotherinlaw and that worthy young gentleman that once detected us in our crimes to go to some other part of the world but was disappointed against my then inclination but our fatal loves pray heaven they do not prove fatal hang upon me worse than my ague and i must submit to their allpowerful force but if you would have me love you long banish all thoughts of injuring your husband farther than our loves the very mentioning of it in your letter made my body shiver and my blood run cold and i am convinced brought this fit of the ague upon me which prevents my seeing you till tomorrow evening if i have any intermission my body is yours but do not load my soul with any farther guilt for should you mention that horrid deed again i would fly you as i would the most spreading contagion whatever my heart would suffer never to see you more weigh well what i here write for it is the advice of a friend and one whom irresistible fate has made  your entire and affectionate lover wigmore p s send the key of the garden by the bearer of this sealed up that she may not know all our secrets  if you have any of the cortex by you pray divide it into eight equal parts and send it me that i hope will prevent the return of my fit       these two letters said my uncle when i first met with em gave me infinite pain when i considered our credulity in trusting that vile wicked woman had drawn this fatal sorrow on our heads  i thought it wisdom to conceal this tragical story from the world therefore gave it out thy worthy father died a natural death his long indisposition giving it credit but there was no concealing the end of that miserable woman therefore to screen her ignominy we reported she had given her son johnny by mistake physic so strong that had purged him into another world this with the loss of her husband we gave out had turned her brain so that she was forced to be secured in her closet but in endeavoring to get out of the window met her fate though many i fear judged the true cause of her death  but now my dear child turn thy thoughts from every melancholy subject and look upon the lovely isabella who was then entering the chamber who shortly shall be thine i was ever his replied the charmer of my soul and if i had wedded that ridiculous wretch whose end has brought us into some trouble it was only out of an obstinate revenge for your supposed falsehood but that revenge would have fallen upon myself for death would in a few days have ended my miseries  in the letter the base sir eustace sent to your converted friend concerning the fatal consequence of your persidy he told him of my being brought insensible out of the garden but he could not describe the terrible agonies heartbreaking sighs and dark despair my soul was filled with i read the fatal letter a thousand times over examined well the hand and though the direction was not in the same character i found the seal and the letter were yours  nothing gave me greater proof of your infidelity than your silence i would often cry ungrateful man have thou then forsaken me i even studied means to excuse you but could not find one no i could not find the least glimpse to hope the contrary  i discovered to my mother and aunt the progress of our young amors whose goodness never rebuked me for my weakness but thought as i did that you were false my mother removed me to a neighboring ladys of her acquaintance that i might not have in mind even the place where you first uttered your false vows  with much persuasion of your rival and my friends i fixed the day of our nuptials and to say the truth his behavior was much mended he seemed to wear a more solid air and expressed his love with so sincere a freedom that i often wished i could give him that heart you held so fast  the night before the morning intended for my nuptials was spent in the utmost grief of heart and when my mother and aunt came in the morning to dress me for the solemnity i had not strength to rise without help i was seized with a violent fever which confined me to my bed for near three months the intended bridegroom spent his whole time at my chamber door and appeared inconsolable i must own to you i began from his behavior to give him some part of my esteem but my heart was not in my power to give him though i often wished it had i thought it was a most unbecoming weakness to lament one who paid my sufferings with disdain therefore once more the day was fixed and if alljudging heaven had not sent your friend that very moment what but my death must have followed when i had understood that my dear vaughan was innocent  o heavens i replied the very thought fills me with the utmost agony well well replied my uncle when you are once wedded you will begin to talk like your reasonable people at present your senses are in a hurry and every faculty bewildered in a maze of i dont know what but time and marriage will restore you to your understandings  we were interrupted by my mans telling me mrs betty was arrived and begged to see me when she came in she looked wistfully upon me and burst into tears what betty said i are you grieved to see me again she could not utter one word but ran up to me took me about the neck and almost drowned me with weeping the poor creatures love filled my heart with a grateful tenderness when she had found the use of her tongue she cried o my dear master the sight of you gives me more pleasure than ever i did feel or can feel i have not known one moments joy since your absence she said so many kind things that i could not refrain kissing her tenderly  my dear isabella said i you must allow mrs betty some small share in my heart with you whose faithful friendship though a servant i shall never forget and will make it my future study to recompense her uncommon fidelity that sir replied my uncle shall be my care one woman is enough for one man to take care of you are in the right replied the divine isabella but now i think on it i have left fatima and eliza preparing to follow your brother and clerimont to the prison and i came to you my dear vaughan to lay my commands upon you to stay with your uncle till our return my uncle myself and betty were uttering the fullness of our hearts with the utmost contentment when a person that belonged to the inn came running up stairs in the utmost confusion for heavens sake sir said he run into the garden and lend your assistance to a lady that some villains are hurrying away into a boat against her will  my uncle and i ran down upon the instant with our swords in our hands but o heavens what was my terror and surprise when i discovered my dear isabella in a boat held by force in the arms of a person a stranger to me and six men rowing down the stream with their utmost force the unexpected sight took away my senses and had i not leaned my back against a tree i must have fallen to the ground  there was a small boat at the landingplace in the garden which when i could recover my strength i got into so suddenly that my uncle could not prevent me when i had pushed it off with my foot i found too late i had neither oar nor pole to manage her so that she drove down the stream without my being able to stop her  my fury and impatience almost took away my senses the boat drove for two hours before it stopped against a bank and then it was so dark when i got out of it i could not see my way i thought it to no purpose to put off the boat again and notwithstanding my impatience i was forced to grope about to find some path but all to no purpose therefore i was wandering about till daylight and then had the misfortune to find i was got upon a little island in the river wye i then endeavored to find the boat again but all to no purpose  i was now plunged into the utmost despair a thousand times i formed resolutions fatal to my life i accused heaven fortune and unlucky stars i could not help saying to my self what sins have i committed that my punishment in this world must be beyond human nature to bear how happy did i think myself after all my misfortunes but twelve hours ago could mortal man imagine after running through so many various scenes of unfortunate incidents and then to have the cure of all my sorrows within my reach to have her snatched from me in my own native soil a country famed for her wholesome laws by a stranger for i own i could not remember i had ever observed the face of the villainous ravisher i sometimes imagined it was all a dream but to my cruel grief i was too well assured i was awake  i waited till the sun had made a full three hours course upon the island in hope my uncle and my friends would find some means of following me but to no purpose i could hear people talk upon the shore behind the willows but when i called to em for their assistance could get no answer my mind was so disturbed that my reason seemed to fly me and my spirits were so low and faint that i had not strength to walk however i took the resolution of plunging into the water to swim to the opposite shore but the weight of my clothes the rapidity of the stream and my weakness hurried me to the bottom and if i had not been assisted by two fishermen who were mending their nets on the shore and saw me throw myself into the water i must have inevitably perished they drew me into their boat deprived of sense for some time and carried me to their cottage stripped me of my wet clothes and put me to bed when i came to myself i bewailed my misfortunes in such a manner that the fishermen imagined i had thrown myself into the river to put an end to em upon that supposition they began to comfort me and inquired into the cause of my sorrows but when i had informed em one of em cried out to the other as sure as can be the woman we heard last night calling for help was the very person this gentleman is in quest of  they told me about an hour after day was shut in last night they heard a lady cry violently and a man comforting her but the boatmen rowed so fast down the stream they were soon out of hearing this knowledge roused up my spirits and the thoughts of vengeance gave me new strength i got my clothes dried with the utmost expedition and dressed myself but inquiring after my hat and sword they replied they knew nothing of them i did not doubt but i had lost em when i was in the water yet was distressed how to get more the fishermen offered to carry me in their boat to chepstow chepstow in monmouthshire a market town seated upon the river wye very near where that river falls into the severn with a large wooden bridge over it there is a natural fortification of rocks and mountains though it has been formerly fortified there is still the remains of an old castle built by julius caesar as the inhabitants will have it the tide flows here fourteen yards high  where i might accommodate myself i accepted of their offer and we got into their boat upon the instant however i borrowed a hat of one of em and an old pair of horsepistols the only arms that belonged to them the boat was a very old sluggish one that did not answer my impatient desire of getting to the town and it was with much persuasion i did not go on shore to walk they told me about a mile farther there was a little creek where i might land and walk to chepstow sooner than the boat could get there when we came into the creek we perceived a boat with a man asleep in it and i strongly imagined it was the very boat that the ravisher had rowed away in with my dear isabella my blood at that thought thrilled through my veins and i was just ready to shoot the poor wretch as he lay asleep in the boat  i ordered my two fishermen to row up close to the other boat but the noise of our oars awaked the man who started up to look at us as soon as i came near enough to lay hold of the fellow i seized him by the throat and clapped a pistol to his head the man was so scared at my manner of proceeding that he was ready to die with apprehension villain said i if thou do not this moment declare where thy vile master has carried the young lady he took away by force yesterday this moment is thy last for heavens sake replied the fellow dont murder an innocent man that has done nothing but by the command of his master whom he is obliged to obey as for the lady you mention i know no more where she is gone than you do all that i do know i will tell you with all my heart  sir eustace landed at this place late last night with the lady and his servants my master the owner of this boat attended him telling me he would return by break of day this morning and ordering me to take care of the boat in the mean time i own i am very much in fear some accident has befallen him i do suppose he went last night to chepstow with sir eustace and his lady whom he seized at monmouth monmouth the capital of monmouthshire seated upon the river wye is an old town of great antiquity as appears by the ruins of its walls and castle it is surrounded with hills this place is famous for the birth of our henry the fifth who conquered a great part of france as also for our british historian geofrey of monmouth though a writer full of the monkish tales of those times  he informed my master that the day he married her she ran away with a young gentleman which i suppose to be yourself but dear sir blame not me i am as i told you before but a servant to the owner of the boat sir eustace i cried is that villain still living or do you abuse me really replied the man i know no more than that my master called him so and if it is the same that you mean he is lately recovered of a dangerous wound he received about a month ago by a gentleman in disguise  i could not help crying out with the utmost transport of fury yes it is the same and heaven has permitted the wretch to live that i with my own hand may take sure vengeance on such a villain for all the misery he has heaped upon my head i then informed the man in short of the villainy of that infamous traitor sir eustace my two fishermen and he seemed thunderstruck at the relation my fishermen were afraid to assist me any further they did not doubt they said if such a base man should hear of it he would not stick to have them murdered for they had often heard of his vile actions in the country but when i informed em my uncle naming his name had as many powerful friends in that country as he had one of the men cried what sir are you the nephew to that worthy gentleman when i answered in the affirmative he told me he would run the hazard of his life to serve me upon his account nay and answer for his companion we owe both our lives to him notwithstanding my own unhappy condition i could not refrain asking the man which way my uncle had been so serviceable to them  sir replied the man my companion and i were taken up for a murder and robbery and though innocent as yourself yet the jury found us guilty nay we must own the appearances were strong against us i will give your honor the story in as few words as possible  about three quarters of a year ago as my partner and i were fishing in this river we perceived a hat floating down the stream which we took up we waited some hours imagining some body would come to claim it but no one appearing my partner gave me half a crown for my share being in more want of a hat than myself he wore it generally sundays and holidays without any one claiming it about the time we found the hat a young fellow frequented a by alehouse in the neighborhood for two or three days where my companion and i used often to drink one day while we were there he offered to pawn a gold medal to the landlord of the house he not having money enough to spare came to me and desired i would lend him three guineas upon it the medal weighing at least five guineas i made no scruple but let the young man have the money with this agreement that if he did not redeem it in a fortnight i would dispose of it for i told him i could not be out of my money for a longer time he consented and the next evening disappeared of a sudden  the following day as we were drawing our nets we perceived something very heavy but we were very much surprised when dragging it ashore to find a murdered body in it with several wounds upon the head in a lightcolourd suit of clothes trimmed with a small silver edging we acquainted the country with it and the next day it was owned to be an old ladys son who had been missing some time the corpse was buried by the sorrowful mother and no enquiry could find out the murderer  a few days after this the easter holidays came on and my partner and i went to see some friends at monmouth but my chief reason of going was to dispose of my gold medal my companion went to have his hat done something to while i went to a goldsmiths to dispose of my medal when i offered it to the man of the shop he examined it very narrowly then looking me wistfully in the face asked me how i came by it when i had informed him he replied very well i will carry it to a person in the neighborhood that perhaps will give more than the weight of it i seemed very well satisfied  the goldsmith went out but returned in a quarter of an hour with the constable and several assistants and in short charged me with the murder and robbery of the widows son i was instantly carried before a justice and examined and before my examination was over my partner was brought in by the hatter who swore the hat he brought to him he sold to the young unfortunate gentleman that was murdered these circumstances meeting thus together it was agreed on all hands that we were guilty of the murder and what confirmed peoples opinion was that the landlord of the alehouse where i had the medal denied the fact  upon this we gave up ourselves for lost i having some small share of education drew up our case to be presented to the judges but it did us no good for we were condemned to die for the guilt of another person  your good uncle was at the trial by accident and whether by our countenance or some proceedings in our trial i cannot tell but he seemed to think us innocent he examined us strictly about the young man i had the medal from as to his age shape size and what dress he wore when he had done that he left us desiring us to recommend our selves to heaven though he owned he thought we died for an act we had never committed  we prepared ourselves for death not having the least hopes of life the morning that was intended for our execution your good uncle entered our room in the prison first preparing by degrees our spirits to receive the unlookdfor change in our condition he informed us we were at our liberty and brought a surgeon with him whom he ordered to let us both blood  i was said your uncle convinced of your innocence but what made me more assured of it was that i had seen a young fellow taken up at hereford where i had some business for offering to sell a gold watch that he could give but a slender account how he came by it i came into the court at monmouth just as your trial came on after you were found guilty i informed the judges of my suspicions and i thought it the duty of every gentleman to use his endeavor to clear the innocent i immediately returned to hereford after enquiring of you all the circumstances of your defense and dealt with the prisoner so effectually that he confessed every thing he informed me that he had been long a companion to the widows son and both living a disorderly life he prevailed upon him to rob his mother of a sum of money and imbark for the west indies but the devil put it into his mind to murder him which he did by first stabbing him with a pointed hanger and after cutting him over the head with the same weapon for fear his groans might be overheard by somebody by accident he took from him a purse of sixtyfour guineas the fatal medal a diamond ring and the gold watch he was taken up for in endeavoring to sell it at hereford the poor wretch was assured that heaven would not let murder be hid for as he intended for ireland he might have disposed of both medal and watch with safety there but he knew the devil infatuated his mind  your good uncle continued the fisherman made him sign his confession and he took such farther measures with the judges that he procured our liberty and not only that but made a gathering for us among the gentlemen of the country that amounted with his own bounty to an hundred and thirty five pounds  now sir since you are nephew to that noble gentleman to whom we owe our lives and fortunes command us what you please as far as honesty and our power may carry us and we will instantly obey you  while the fisherman was relating this short story his companion spied a hat floating against the bank of the creek which i knew to be my own but both the men were so very much startled at the sight of it that neither of em would take it up however i got the young fellow in the other boat who was not so scrupulous to get it for me who understanding the villainous treatment i had received from the wretch that hired the boat of his master was resolved to join with the other two  while we were consulting how to proceed the owner of the boat came down to the creek my blood rose at the man though i knew he had been imposed upon by that base villain sir eustace however i resolved to be silent in hope i should learn something from him as soon as he came near enough his man asked him how he could leave him all night in such a place without victuals drink or rest z  ds replied the man you have had more rest than i i dare swear never was poor wretch so ill used as i have been when i came within a quarter of a mile of chepstow the villain ordered his servants to bind my hands and feet and throw me into a ditch which by good fortune proved a dry one the reason why my friend cried the brute i part with your good company is because i would not have you know where i intend to lie tonight perhaps in a little time i shall find some method of satisfying you for the trouble you have been at upon my account and so friend i wish you a good nights rest  upon saying this he and his wicked crew walked away although i begged to be released promising i would return to my boat without following them but he replied no no that is one reason why i would have you lie there all night  pray friend said i in what condition was the poor young lady that he forcibly carried away why truly sir replied the man i cannot well tell for she had mourned so much in the boat that when we landed she did not utter a word but suffered herself to be led by her husband without any resistance  i soon undeceived him in that particular by acquainting him with the truth of the sorrowful affair and is it so replied the master of the boat if i had known that no recompense or threats should have prevailed upon me to have lent him any assistance in such a base action  after a short consultation i resolved with the master of the boat to go by land to chepstow while the two fishermen and the other man carried the boats there  accordingly we parted but as soon as we entered the town the first persons i saw were my dear uncle my brother my friend and clerimont with four servants all well armed in search after the ravisher and me they hired a boat at monmouth with all the expedition imaginable thinking to overtake me at least and as we all supposed mist me when the boat i was in fell in with the little island where i remained all night they were going when we met em down to the creek to endeavor the finding the man that was bound and thrown into the ditch being informed of it by the very person that had released him in the morning  we came to a resolution of separating my brother and i with two servants to get horses and go into wales in pursuit of them my uncle my friend and the other two servants to follow by water my governor to stay at chepstow or monmouth just as he thought convenient  my brother and i with two servants set out well armed for our purpose without taking any formal leave of my uncle and the rest for i was too much concerned to mind ceremony as we passed the mountains that environ chepstow the horse of one of my uncles servants fell downright lame which gave me some little uneasiness but the fellow being runningfootman to the last master he served told us he would be at the next town before us and provide himself another horse accordingly he left the lame one at a cottage in the road and flew away as swift as a greyhound the roads were so bad for our horses that he was soon out of sight after riding about four miles we came to a small inn where i was surpised to find him drinking with a footman at the door as soon as we came near enough for him to be heard he called out to me sir for a small matter i can have a horse of this man who is a servant to sir eustace and as we are to go within a mile of his masters house i am to leave the horse at a place where he has appointed his business not being urgent he says he will walk the rest of the way  the name of that villain sir eustace and the manner of the servants speaking to me convinced me there was something to be understood by it i therefore endeavored to compose myself from the ruffle the villains name had caused in my soul i soon observed the fellow was very much gone in liquor therefore was in some hope of learning which way my dear isabella was forced he did not seem to have any notion of us or our business therefore i told him i intended to make a visit to his master at my return hark ye sir replied the fellow to tell you the truth if you do you will lose your labor for my master is not at home at present neither can i tell you when he will be at home nor does he much care interrupted my uncles man for i find his master and he dont set their horses together  i must own i did tell you so returned the man but you are to blame to let all the world know it there is no harm done i replied he knows i want a servant therefore if you intend to leave sir eustace and he will give you a character i will take you into my service a character sir cried the man hastily i am afraid his character will be but small encouragement for me to get another master i must conceal if possible my ever living with him sir i must beg your pardon when i tell you as one of my masters acquaintance he is so wicked a man that i think no one that is not as wicked as himself would live with him  in short i soon found the fellow was too honest in his principles for so impious a master and yet one would think continued the servant he should take warning it is not above six weeks ago when a gentleman he had ill used in disguise run him through the body we all thought he would have breathed his last but he recovered in less than a month the wound not being through any mortal part he ordered his servants and the surgeon to conceal his recovery from the country but we were soon let into the meaning of it for he went disguised two days ago to monmouth under pretense to take up the gentleman for his supposed murder but it was only to take his opportunity of running away with a young lady whom he says he is contracted to which he did and is now gone to bristol for more secrecy and security where he intends to force the lady to marry him or perhaps worse  i was so much disordered with what the man said to me my passion overcoming my reason that i declared aloud i would be the death of him the poor fellow began to suspect something and the apprehension of some ill usage threw him into such a fit of trembling that he soon became sober he begged for heavens sake he might not suffer for the evil deeds of his master  no my friend said i i have some regard for thee for thy honesty because i think by thy discourse thou do not approve the wicked designs of that base villain therefore if thou will receive me for thy master be assured it is in my nature to use every one well that has any dependence upon me  sir replied the young fellow you seem so far different in your behavior from my present master that i shall think myself got out of purgatory into paradise we soon made an agreement to the satisfaction of us both  he then informed me his master had dispatched him to his castle in wales for several necessaries for himself and the servants that were gone with him to bristol which were privately to be brought in a wagon for he apprehended it was not safe to bring the lady home immediately not doubting in the least but the gentleman that wounded him before would pursue him with the company he had so much exasperated by his villainous proceeding  upon the knowledge of this we returned back to chepstow in order to get to bristol with the utmost expedition when we came back to chepstow we were informed my uncle with his party had hired a vessel to go for bristol which made us imagine he had gained some knowledge of the place where they were gone  we only staid to give our horses some small refreshment and set forward by land for bristol though we were two hours ferrying over  when we arrived at bristol my new servant told me his old master was at captain  in radcliff street over against the church my brother and i disguised ourselves in our servants clothes and went to the house where we were informed sir eustace and my dear isabella were the door was shut some time but after half an hours waiting we saw the villain coming out with a gentleman that we supposed to be the master of the house my blood flew with such violence through my veins that it was with much persuasion of my brother i had not shot the villain through the head but he advised me to use stratagem  let us said he send for your new servant and by the time he comes well think of something to compass our ends without bloodshed when the servant came we instructed him to go to the lady as from his master and with a ring as a token for his passport which i gave him which was my dear isabellas i did not doubt but she would know it again and come more willingly  my new man did his business dexterously he found the chamber of isabella guarded by two of his old fellow servants who made no scruple of letting him pass when he acquainted them he had orders to conduct the lady to his master in order to be married that night  when he came into the room where the divine isabella was lamenting her condition in tears and sighs upon the floor he without ceremony gave her the ring telling her the owner of it waited for her in the street if she could give credit to that passport she might be in the arms of her devoted husband in a few minutes she looked upon the ring some time with the utmost transport of joy as the man told us afterward and at last said though my terrible misfortunes make me suspect every thing and every person yet whatever hands i fall into i cannot fear worse usage than from those i have the misfortune to be in at present  she then gave my new servant her hand who led her down stairs telling the two centries at the door to order a handsome supper for their master would be back in less than an hour  when we perceived him coming with the divine isabella i trembled so much i had not power to stand but my brother fearing my transports might discover us led me some distance from the house but when my lovely isabella came up to me neither of us could utter a word my brother would not let us stay to open our hearts but took hold of my dear isabella and hurried her along while i followed not knowing what i was doing  as we were crossing the bridge we met my uncle and his party they not expecting to meet us by the light of the shops upon the bridge knowing isabella they drew their swords and had not my brother discovered himself that instant some of my friends had probably lost their lives for in the heat of my fury i mistook them as they did us and drew my pistols but the first flashing in the pan prevented my doing an action that i should have for ever repented  we had not time to congratulate each other upon our unexpected meeting but my uncle and friends finding we had regained isabella led us back to the boat they came in and notwithstanding the darkness of the night we set out from bristol so eagerly that we forgot my uncles two servants at the inn who were found watching about the house where isabella was confined by sir eustace who by threats got out of them who they belonged to a fellow that saw our rencounter upon the bridge had followed us to the boat and hearing sir eustace threatening my uncles servants declared what he knew concerning us  upon this he got his men together took a boat and followed us with such imprecations that the two servants of my uncles were so frighted for my safety not knowing their master was with me that they got a guide to conduct them along the waterside to give us notice of our approaching danger as they told us afterward  while we were in the boat my dear isabella and i mingled our tears of joy together she told me when the hated villain first seized her she had recourse to tears sighs and reproaches which drew nothing but threats from the worthless wretch but at last she thought it would be more to her purpose to dissemble her sorrows therefore she seemed by degrees to dry up her tears and listen more favorably to his odious love  this method deceived him so effectually that he did not doubt but she would give her consent to the marriage in a few days she had prevailed upon one of his men to bring a letter to me and he was to set out on the following morning  we landed at weston and ordered our boat to meet us at thornbury the next day where we were obliged to go altogether in a wagon not meeting with any better convenience but having the company of my lovely isabella with my uncle and friends i was in as much joy as if we were riding in our coach and six  when we came within half a mile of thornbury the fields being pleasant we all got out to walk i with my charming isabella led the way full of the delightful hope of possessing for ever that beauty who was the treasure of my soul  just as we crossed a style that led into the horse road i observed four or five men run into a thicket that led into the fields on the other side of the road this alarmed me very much and i made a full stop till my company came up  by ill fortune expecting no danger we had left our pistols in the wagon and the shorter cut being over the fields the wagon was a quarter of a mile behind us while we were disputing what to do the five men came running cross the road with that infamous villain sir eustace at the head of them my friend knowing him ran to oppose him unarmed as he was the villain fired a pistol at him which brought my friend to the ground the sight raised such a rage in my soul that i rushed upon him just as he presented a pistol to my breast and so opportunely that i clapped my hand between the flint and the lock just as he drew the trigger and with struggling to wrench it from him the flint cut the back of my hand very much i at last with much difficulty wrung it from him and shot him through the head with his own pistol  as soon as he fell his companions in villainy ran away without once looking behind them and i flew to my friend who thank heaven was only wounded slightly on the temple  this was all done so suddenly that it looked like a dream when the confusion was over we went to examine that impious wretch who notwithstanding his villainy i wished in my soul he had life enough left to repent but alas he was gone for ever with all his sins about him  when we came to thornbury our boatmen met us with a crowd of people armed with several weapons coming to our assistance the unfortunate sir eustace overtook them in their short voyage to thornbury and by threats made them though unwillingly confess where they were to take us up as soon as sir eustace parted from them to put his wicked intentions in practice the boatmen alarmed the town which we met coming to our assistance though too late  i went to a neighboring justice and declared what had happened who took bail of my uncle for my appearance at the sessions but i was never troubled about it his servants were found who took up the body which was interred privately by his younger brother a worthy gentleman that proved as much an honor to the family he sprung from as the other strove to disgrace it  the next day we embarked for chepstow and the same evening arrived safe at monmouth to the comfort of my governor elvira and the amiable fatima from thence we set out for my uncles  in a few days after my brother with the fair fatima after receiving at the font the christian name of maria at my uncles request clerimont and his eliza and my dear isabella and i joined those hands with the assistance of the priest whose hearts were united long before and that we might be witness to each others happiness all dwelt in the same house with my uncle  thus after so many storms of fortune we arrived safe in the harbor of delight and tasted joys beyond expression long may our years continue in all the harmony of connubial love all our wishes are to go step by step together and when the hoary winter of our age approaches to sink hand in hand into the grave and rest in peace
