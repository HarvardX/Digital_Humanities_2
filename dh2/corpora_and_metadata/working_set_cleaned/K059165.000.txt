memoirs of some transactions during the late ministry of robert e of oxford  london printed for t warner at the blackboy in paternoster row       price one shilling  memoirs of some transactions during the late ministry etc when there is such a general expectation of some great matter to be made appear against the person these sheets relate to and much pains is taken to calumniate and misrepresent him to the world it may not be amiss to give the world some true state of his case that none may be imposed upon through ignorance how far soever malice may carry some  the matter draws toward a crisis the question will soon be transferred from between party and party to a bar of justice and the blood of an english nobleman is to be the subject of the pleadings and defense  the earl of oxford seems to resolve to appear and to stand in his own defense i advance one thing without doors in defense of his case in general before the particulars come to be enquired into if it be just to say of my lord bolingbroke that he knows himself to be guilty why else did he fly it will be as reasonable to say of my lord of oxford he is satisfied in his own innocence why else does he stay  besides the opinion his lordship has of his own innocence it must be acknowledged his lordship pays the greatest honor to the british nobility that is possible to do and perhaps more than was ever done before that however the turns of the government since his administration may have given impressions of things very different from what were in his time and as it might be suggested very much to his disadvantage nay however interest may seeem to run even in a very strong stream against him yet that he pays such a profound respect to the unspotted honor of the peerage as to cast his life into their hands at a time when thoughts less generous might be apt to entertain some fears of the impressions which party might have made on the minds of the nobility at a time when it is scarce to be said that any other set of men in the nation are entirely free  either my l o  must have some surprising evidence in himself of his own innocence and not only so but of his being able to set that innocence in a clear light to the world or else he makes the greatest compliment to the nobility of britain that ever man made he supposes their lordships untainted with the prejudice of the times and that nothing can byafs their minds nothing artfully prepossess their judgments that they cannot be blinded by any humane infirmities moved by any passions imposed upon by the persuasions or affected by private views of any kind that they cannot be hurried by popular winds or storms from whatever corner they may blow whether of faction tumult envy or ambition but that they will move in a direct path of justice guided by truth without the least deviation or inclination one way or other either from parties persons interest or power of any kind whatsoever  besides this his lordship seems to pay a most dutiful and honorable regard to the personal justice clemency and honor of his majesty declaring by thus putting himself on his trial at such a juncture as this that he firmly depends upon his majestys royal virtue that nothing will on the kings part be offered or encouraged to bias or lead to awe or any way influence the judgment that shall be given in his case that shall not so much as be imagined that the votes of the peers one way or other shall in the least affect them in their interest or in the favor of his majesty  it must be acknowledged that in this his lordship acts from a principle of great justice and duty as well to his majesty as to the house of peers and no man can say without manifest injury to his majesty or to that honorable house that he so much as believes his lordship will be the worst treated for that dutiful and generous behavior  without doors we cannot say it will be the same it were to be wished the people who show such a warmth in their desires to bring on the trial of this lord would show the like disposition to having him fairly acquitted if his innocence shall appear as they seem to show for his destruction on a presumption of his guilt  it is now come to the great question nothing less than his life or his death is the case if we were to make a judgment of him by the opinions and tempers of men without doors it would be easy to conclude what should be his fate and his courage must be thought greater than his discretion to put himself upon his trial which makes the honor done to the justice and impartiality of his majesty and the peers of which mention is made already be the greater  yet we would hope that seeing it is now brought this length men will begin to be more serious and forbear to importune the justice of the nation by their invectives and indecent treatment my lord has appealed from the clamours of the people to the justice and honor of the peers and being thus in the hands of justice what is there that men can desire more they who occupy their pens or tongues now to blacken defame or reproach him openly challenge the house of peers reproach their justice and villify that august assembly as if not disposed to do justice in the case when it comes before them as his lordship has thrown himself upon the honor and justice of the peers and put his life and honor into their lordships hands so should we do and not either lead or direct them which would be in the grossest manner to suspect their proceedings  the clamours which have hitherto been made on this account have been as the authors pretended only to have men impeached and we have seen writers tell the government they expect it it is now done we hope they will be satisfied and not tell the house of peers whether they shall acquit or condemn this must be left in their own breasts and there is no doubt but they will act as justice and their own honor shall direct and of this we must all wait the issue  that we may attend this great event with less curiosity and impatience it may be proper to state the facts of this noble lords conduct as they appear at present in those very cases wherein he is so much impugned and attacked that when people have cool thoughts about them they may be disposed to read them over perhaps when they have done so they will be the backwarder to blame the house of peers if they should not find it as they may expect  in the latter end of king williams reign we found mr harley chosen speaker of the house of commons he was in the session before one of those members who stood firm to the resolution of disbanding the army having always an opinion that the security of the prince was sufficiently provided for in the affection of his faithful commons and that all the dangers which as was then pretended appeared from the growing power of france were far less and easier to be struggled with in any incident which might happen than those which might proceed from a standing force of mercenaries to be kept up in time of peace by which very thing this kingdom had more than once been in great danger of having her liberty overwhelmed and the worst of slavery entailed upon her and that therefore the war being over the nation ought to take effectual care of their own liberties and to limit the number of the forces to such and no more as might be thought sufficient for the public safety  it was not altogether so agreeable to his majestys thoughts at that time as could have been wished and especially the regiment of dutch guards were exceedingly desired by the king but it could not be the members declared that it was not from a jealousy or disrespect for the person of his majesty who they were thoroughly satisfied would neither himself or by his permission ever suffer an army to oppress them but that the precedent would be dangerous to posterity when the successors of his majesty might perhaps make a fatal use of that advantage of which he would make no advantage at all  it was reported at that time that mr harley was chosen against the measures of the court and that the king was disobliged by him to the last degree on account of the aforesaid breaking of the forces but his majesty himself removed the scandal of that rumor by assuring mr harley that he was very well satisfied with him and indeed the principles upon which the english gentlemen went at that time were so evidently essential to the preserving their liberties that the king himself who was a great patron of liberty was perfectly satisfied with the thing afterward and likewise with the persons expressing a very particular esteem for mr harley to the time of his death which happened soon after  at the accession of the queen to the crown her majesty was pleased to choose her ministry among a set of men who there was some reason to have expected other conduct from them to her majesty at least the queen expected it but they who knew them better were not so much disappointed in them as her majesty was  it imports not to record their failings farther than thus to let posterity know they began to precipitate the crown in many cases to a degree that must in time have been fatal  in all these cases mr harley signalized himself by that famous stand which he made in behalf of the liberties of his country of which those who shared in the advantage cannot entirely forget the particulars those who were nearest the queen and most faithful to her interest finding the influence he had in the house was of use to them on many accounts began about this time to see he was a person necessary to keep a closer correspondence with and having found the queen of the same opinion he was received into the cabinet measures and the nicest affairs communicated to him  in this station he obtained upon the opinion not only of the persons who he necessarily was embarked with as the late e of godolphin the duke of m  and some others but of the queen more especially who with my l godolphin had a singular esteem for him  it was easy for mr harley in this situation to convince her majesty of the absolute necessity she was in of changing her measures and of dismissing a furious faction who began to be odious to the people by their pushing the government upon such things as tended to embroil her majesty with her best subjects and make the war abroad which was then newly entered into be either impracticable or unsuccessful by reason of the discontents at home which were rising to a great height among the people and sometimes between the two houses of parliament themselves  in the pursuit of this council the advantage whereof the whole kingdom feels to this day the queen was pleased to dismiss sir edward seymours party so they were called and fill up the household with such a ministry as the present age pretends to be very well satisfied in the prime ministry as it is called resting in the late lord treasurer godolphin the army in the d of m  h and mr harley was made secretary of state in the room of the e of n  m sir charles hedges keeping the seals as the other secretary of state as he was before  thus the introduction of that ministry was the work of mr harley and it was to his counsels that they owed their being established in the full administration of affairs which whilst they carried on with unanimity of councils and without jealousy of one another were administered with great satisfaction to her majesty and all her people at home as well as with glorious successes abroad during this time the animosities among the good people began exceedingly to abate the remembrances of occasional bills tackings etc wore much off of the minds of the people and the court generally discouraging the breaches among the queens subjects an open and free administration was carried on by which room was left for all her majestys subjects of whatever party to restore themselves to her favor by their merit and to wipe out the remembrances of any miscarriages by a future dutiful behavior a method of government exceedingly agreeable to the queen as it would had it gone on have been in time healing to the nation  but this happy scheme was not alike pleasing to all and some who had cravings in nature to satisfy which were not so consistent with this disinterested manner of management began to be uneasy at the apprehensions of letting in the mob as it was called into their affairs the interest in her majesty which as it was called was not a thing of so little value to be laid open and her favor and confidence to be made common to the people they found that as they had made it a property so their success gave them an advantage above all that went before them by seeming to make themselves necessary to her majesty this point was carried on to such an extremity the sweetness of governing even their sovereign alluring that finding mr harley inflexible and that he would not join in such narrow measures but desired that the queen might reign for her self and all her subjects have access to her that she might be fully apprized of all her affairs and act as well by knowledge as advice finding this was the scheme he had laid and that it was directly opposite to their own and would in the end overthrow it they from that time entered into measures either to supplant him in her majestys favor or in his employment  the first notwithstanding many misrepresentations and mean steps taken they could not effect the last they brought to pass for a season  it seems that they brought the last to pass with difficulty and it was evident to them as also to others that as her majesty parted not with mr harley without great reluctance so that although he was dismissed from the office of her principal secretary that yet he had access to her person and had opportunity to communicate such councils as occasion offered having the honor from that time of a confidence with his sovereign which those who had power to displace him had then no share in  this favor of his prince was much increased by some foul things which had been discovered to her majesty to have been practiced upon him in order to render him suspected to be concerned in the treason of mr gregg and more especially by some steps which were privately taken by some persons in order by fear of death or hope of mercy to induce the said gregg when under sentence of death to accuse mr harley and as her majesty received the account of those designs with tokens of great displeasure and even of detestation so the declaration which the criminal gave even just before his execution of the innocence of mr harley as it was a particular satisfaction to the queen so it confirmed the opinion her majesty had conceived of mr harley as a person proper to be entrusted and fit to be employed in her service  it might have been useful to have descended to the particulars of this matter and to the persons likewise but another time may be thought more proper this suffices to show that there was at that time a horrid conspiracy against the life of this noble lord how far it has been carried on or revived since and whether it be by the same hands or not will likewise appear the time being approaching when there may be reason to lay the blackest part of this transaction open to the view of the sun  mean time it is worth notice that as the persons concerned would not have failed to have accepted the evidence of mr gregg against mr harley if he had either known any thing whereof to accuse him or had been prevailed with to have forged any accusation in order to have saved his life yet some of them were not backward to depretiate the dying words of the same man when it appeared they tended to clear the person who they desired rather should have been accused discovering thereby such a partiality as her majesty was pleased to take notice of to be as criminal in its degree as the design aforesaid against his life it is strange said she once upon that occasion that they would not have us believe the man now he acquits mr harley when they would have believed him if he had accused him and that they will not believe the mans dying words when it is evident they would have laid great weight upon them if he had lived her majesty was pleased likewise many times when this affair was upon any occasion mentioned to her to express her concern that any methods so unchristian and unjust should be taken by persons so near her to destroy an innocent person  yet could not this put a stop to the enemies of mr harley who it seems were restless in their own situation while they observed his to be so near her majestys person as would upon all occasions interrupt the farther designs which they had calculated for their own advantage in being single and uninterrupted in the administration and therefore though they could not impose upon her majesty in the case abovementioned of mr gregg they left not any stone unturned to keep the people of their own party deceived and to have it by pamphletwritings and private emissaries suggested throughout the kingdom that mr harley was guilty of greggs treason though nothing could be proved that ever justified so much as a suspicion and although gregg himself who could never have been convicted but by his own confession had been induced by mr harley to make that confession so that mr harley seemed that way to have been the very instrument of detecting him more fully and by consequence of his death a provocation sufficient to make any one expect that if he could have saved his life at mr harleys expense he would have made no difficulty of the exchange and not a little the reason of that low step some persons otherwise persons of honor took to bring it to pass which it may be believed they would not for their own sakes have been seen in if they had thought it could have failed of success  but gregg though a traitor would not be a murderer whether they were not so who endeavored to make him so will be tried at another tribunal  as these things concurred to improve that interest which mr harley had in her majestys favor so it made way for and not a little contributed to the breaches which followed and the impressions they made in her majesty in prejudice of those men who were concerned were such as were not easily wiped out her majesty who was a princess of exceeding piety believing that men who could stoop to such wicked and even bloody methods to remove a person out of the way of their administration would stick at few things that could occur and were ill qualified to bring about the blessing of her reign in the felicity of her people which was her utmost desire  but things were not yet brought to maturity nor the grievance of the administration come to its height and several things were yet to happen which should concur with the impressions her majesty had received before to lessen the pleasure she took in the services of some about her and consequently make way for their remove but as these do not concern mr harley they shall be no otherwise mentioned than as they served to introduce the revolution which followed  it was in the year   0  when mr harley was dismissed from the office of secretary of state and mr boil now lord carleton succeeded him in that place a modest inoffensive gentleman and concerned neither one way or other in the brigues abovementioned and now it was thought they who had the administration would have gone on in their business without any interruption that they had none to disturb them but that he who they pretended would have supplanted them being laid aside they were out of danger and it may be said of them that they were weak enough to think thus themselves but they soon found themselves deceived and that the very persons who had pushed them upon the breach with mr harley on pretense of supplanting them with the queen were in a strong confederacy or plot to supplant them with the people and by the consequence thereof with the queen and wanted nothing but to remove mr harley from them to make way for the execution of their design as the person whose interest in the queen as well as his capacity to disappoint them they above all other thought to be dangerous to them  it is with the more reason that it is said they thought by the consequence of supplanting the ministry they should effectually supplant them with the queen because having made the experiment in the case of mr harley that the queen might be prevailed on by their new method of treating her majesty to part with ministers though she was not dissatisfied with them they concluded they might take the same method and bring her majesty to the necessity so they undutifully called it of parting with others and that this is true in fact that this was their view at that time is proved by a letter written by a noble lord then in the ministry who when their plot broke out had the weakness or want of decency to write a letter to the d  of r  into scotland wherein he treats her majesty and ministry both in the words following i would not have you be bullied by the courtparty for the queen her self cannot support that faction long  this was strange language from a secretary of state actually in office and eminently discovered that the charge publicly laid against mr harley of a design to supplant the ministry should have been laid on another hand who now publicly viewed a design not only of supplanting the ministry who he called a faction but of bringing the queen into such a condition as not to be able to support them  it became soon evident that the persons who this noble lord called a faction were no other than the late earl of godolphin and his grace the d  of m  the one at that time at the head of the army the other of the treasury as by their farther open declarations in the election of the next parliament appeared in which the juncto to the whignoblemen embarkt in this design were called openly joined with the malecontented party so the high church were then nay even with the jacobites against the ministry villifying and exposing the said lord and duke and especially a certain duchess in a manner far exceeding all that unjustifiable rudeness that has been made use of since that time  this however obliged her majesty to concern her self in the matter and to let the juncto see that she was able to support her servants and that she would not be reduced to the necessity they boasted of the consequence of this was that they were effectually disappointed and afterward made no difficulty to make their separate peace with her majesty and her ministry to which transaction fame refers us for an eminent original of abandoning allies etc for it was observable that when they made their own peace they left all their confederates to the discretion of the ministry  but this matter had another effect for which reason it is made a necessary part of this account  viz that in the interval of this breach much was discovered of the infirmity to say no worse of it of both sides and while they were villifying one another to render their designs black in the view of the people they really as it often happens in lesser cases made the persons on both sides look less in the esteem of the world than they did before there was much dirt cast on both sides in the quarrel and it cannot be said that it was all wiped off in the reconciliation nor did the breach leave either side in the same station of her majestys esteem as it found them  her majesty was a strict observer at that time of every article of the conduct of either side and it made no small impression on her mind that she found both sides were to make a property of her authority and that she was to be reduced to a necessity of acting their measures which side soever prevailed from which just observation though her majesty sound it needful to support the ministry then in her service against those who so openly affronted her administration as well as her person in opposing them at that time yet from that time her majesty entertained thoughts of a general change in her measures and resolved to set her self free as soon as might be from the unhappy necessity which it seems it was so easy to reduce her to  viz of not being able to support her own administration  this was perfectly agreeable to the scheme formerly proposed by mr harley to the lord godolphin and often explained to her majesty before that time  viz to restore her majesty to an entire freedom of acting that all her affairs should be explained to and laid before her majesty that she should no more wear the crown without the scepter that the doors should be opened to all her subjects and a free access to her person be given to all that cases of consequence might not come covered with the representations of the ministers but every thing be laid fairly before the queen that she might act with open eyes see for her self and give to not receive commands from her ministry her majesty had with some regret received the former importunities of some about her in the case of placing or displacing of persons and especially that unpleasant uncomely as well as undutiful expression of i cannot serve your majesty unless etc and began to be tired with some peoples personal conduct whose services were otherwise very acceptable to her and their fidelity entirely unsuspected  there were two other things which her majesty could not avoid taking a particular notice of in this breach and the future conduct of these very persons make it very much to the present purpose to mention it here viz   that the said juncto made no scruple in order to displace the said lord and duke to bring the most known prosessd jacobites as well of the nobility as of the commons as well in scotland as in england into their confederacy and even to vote for them in the election of the parliament then choosing and many of them were actually elected by the interest of the said whig juncto the names are easy to be given   that they made no difficulty of displacing the d of m  h from the command of the army and thought there would be no danger to the confederacy in it at all and her majesty was informed that they went so far as to sound the dutch either to see how they would approve of a change or to prepare them not to be surpised at it the like things having been censured in such rude terms by the same persons who then for their own private ends engaged in them her majesty could not but call to mind the circumstances and look on the persons with some resentment when they came to speak of the same things as traiterous ungrateful perfidious and the like  these and such as these were the things which paved the way for the new turn which soon after happened in which mr harley acted consonant to what he had from the first proposed laying before her majesty such measures as were calculated for quieting not disturbing the administration not proposing such change of parties and such turnings out of persons as afterward happened no such thing being in view till the combinations of certain persons in places and who acted upon the old principle of reducing the queen to the necessity of acting as they desired obliged her majesty to do it  it is not needful to enter into the detail of the conduct of others but this passage cannot be omitted viz that the evening of that day when the treasurer the earl of godolphin was displaced a general meeting of the persons in that interest was held at mr b  house where it was laid down as a maxim that the new managers could no way support the undertaking that they could never be able to keep up the public credit raise money or carry on the war but would soon plunge the queen in such inextricable difficulties as that she would be forced to come back to them and therefore it was their business one and all to resolve not to come into the queens measures in order to distress her new ministers and so oblige her to dismiss them  how openly they pursued this resolution is well known as also how mr harley now made chancellor of the exchequer and one of the commissioners of the treasury surmounted all the difficulties which they cast in the way supplied the money kept up the credit and run into no plunges as was suggested by which they were no less surprised than disappointed all this is recent and known  it is named here to show where began the mischief of the change this meeting of the late managers was neither more or less than forming themselves into a faction against the queen and her new measures which though it did not produce the necessity upon the queen of changing her ministry again as they expected yet it did put the new managers upon making use of other hands than they intended to which point of circumstance all that has since happened may be traced back as to its proper and only original for had that faction not been formed or had they not when formed absolutely rejected the queens offers of accommodation and of keeping them in their places nothing is more true than that all things had gone on in the usual course of the administration by the same methods to the same purpose and almost by the same persons as before but satan hindered and the conduct of the outed party was very singular on that occasion  it occurred to them naturally that the parliament in being would take some step in their favor and that they should be able to spread the uneasiness much farther if not throughout the kingdom and it offered as a foundation of forming a new interest in their favor this passed a while and their friends in the city falling upon the new ministry with some attempts of another nature it was evident they supported those attempts by their dependence on their interest in the parliament and so open they were in their politics on this occasion that they were not backward to say the parliament would unravel the new measures and the queen could go on no farther than the next session the ministry were too vigilant not to see the design nor was mr harley ignorant how far they might probably go to make good their threats this made it absolutely necessary to dissolve the parliament the inclination of the people also to the change now beginning to appear more than it had done before and the new elections appearing to be generally on the side of the change the resolutions of the party mentioned above began to waver their interest separate and in fine the new ministry after this met with less difficulty and obstruction in their affairs though not with less ill treatment from particular persons and from the party in the city especially where the ferment went too high to be spoken of in a narrow compass and where the measures taken to ruin the public credit were such though unsuccessful as has not been ever practiced before and gave her majesty great cause to resent them even on the whole party  in this juncture mr harley was snatched from the administration by an unparalleled attempt upon his life at first it surpised every one as it began to be thought the attempt of the aforesaid party or some set on work by them but it soon appeared the single act of an enraged frenchman the marquess de guiscard made desperate by being detected of a treasonable correspondence with france who assassinated mr harley at the council table stabbing him into the breast with a penknife and repeating the blow a second time not knowing that the penknife was broke and the blade left in the wound he gave him a contusion with the handle by the next blow more dangerous and painful than the first what moved this scelerat to such an horrid act the apprehending him wounding him his imprisonment and death in the prison of newgate are needless in this account being also made public at that time by other writers  none could be blamed for being of the opinion till the particulars appeared that this blow was given by the procurement of the other party because it suited so exactly with the language given publicly the person of mr harley at that time as well in the city as elsewhere that it was confessed by themselves the suspicion was just but the horror of the fact so touched those who had a sense of humanity that the generality even of the enemies of the new ministry could not refrain expressing themselves with some warmth against it and it assisted for some time to the treating him with something less indecency than before and not only so but the affairs of the government gaining upon the opposers every day the new measures began to be better relished among the people than before  soon after the recovery of mr harley and his conduct in the public affairs having satisfied her majesty that his qualifications for the employment were equal to the weight of such an employ the commission for the treasury was dissolved and mr harley was made lord high treasurer of great britain her majesty doing him the honor to give him the staff with her own hand and at the same time to sign a patent creating him earl of oxford and earl mortimer and soon after created him also knight of the garter  these things are needful to mention because they are the sum of all the advantages which he can be said to share out for himself having not his enemies being judges accumulated honor or profits as has been usual by persons in great posts and this may be said without boasting that no personal avarice no aggrandizing of his family no getting of grants either to himself or to his family has been or with justice can be charged on him though by the share he enjoyed of his royal mistresss favor it might be supposed that he could not want opportunity for many things which might have been as profitable as the most craving temper might be satisfied with  the new parliament being met the lower house appeared inclined dutifully to oblige her majesty in every thing consistent with their liberties and with the public good and the queen never desiring any thing of them which shocked their affections to their countrys safety and advantage this mutual rectitude of principle created a perfect harmony between her majesty and the house every thing offered by the house to her majesty met with a gracious reception and ready grant and every thing laid before them by the queen was so just and so clear that the house with an entire confidence came into her majestys measures cheerfully and with the greatest alacrity imaginable  this harmony was a great disappointment to the party who opposed the ministry and was chiefly owing to the exact adhering to such measures in the administration as could admit no substantial objection for it could not be said that the other people were not vigilant to take hold of every thing that might have given them any just advantage the treasurer as far as he directed any thing took care to keep it within the ordinary rules of business and particularly knowing what men he had to do with took care to have every thing transacted in full council and to be duly minuted in the books he kept to the principle first laid down of having the queen see with her own eyes and after duly debating things in her presence to have every thing directed by her majesty with consent of her own knowledge that her majesty might have no occasion to say as had been too much the case formerly that she left things to such and such persons and had been ill served  the treasurer likewise took especial care to have all business transacted in the proper offices and signed by the hands whose province it was thereby restoring the administration to its natural course and delivering the government from the grievance of a prime minister and this is evident now even to the surprise of his enemies who having supposed that the treasurer transacted every thing as had been the general belief and for which all along the party loaded him with infinite aspersions find now that he really managed nothing separately and rather employed himself to preserve the economy of the administration and see the public business distributed into the proper hands and then leaving those hands to discharge their duty than interposing his own authority or encroaching upon the province of the ministers  perhaps this truth is so new and the contrary has been so generally received that it will not immediately meet with that credit that ought to be expected to a thing so manifest but when it shall appear that in unravelling the administration of those times nothing can be found transacted by him but what was the particular duty of his office as treasurer and that on the contrary every minister of state did the duty of his place and acted to the full what was his particular province to act and that consequently they cannot fasten such things upon the treasurer as it was hoped he might be charged with i say if this should not be the case it will be a full confirmation of what is said here that he rather directed every man to his duty than acted in their province himself it was his complaint during the administration of others that they engrossed the business into their hands that the secretaries and privy council were but agents and were made use of for form only and that the queen being surrounded by them all access to her person was cut off and it was his professed intention that it should be otherwise in his administration and if this is not made sufficiently evident to those who are now so narrowly inspecting his conduct by the manner in which they will find all business transacted there is another proof which will occur to every understanding  viz the power the other ministers of state and men of intreigue obtained hereby with the queen by which they afterward took upon them to oppose his councils and at last effectually supplanted him  if it had been true that every thing had been done by him as it was unjustly said by his enemies it could not have been true that his management was ill approved of by the queen and other men entrusted distinct from him and who when he opposed them appeared to have a greater interest in her majesty than he had till at length they obliged him either to come into their measures which in regard to the good of his country he could not comply with or to withdraw from them and quit the administration which he very happily for himself chose to do  in this conduct consists so much his present safety that we see some of his enemies very much disappointed in that they cannot find him in several parts of the management of things which they thought were all his own and it is surprising to find how far this opinion of his being the fac totum in all the administration had prevailed and the enemies of the treasurer are under some confusion by their not finding all business directed by him it is manifest that they had entertained a notion that the queen was wholly governed by him that she did nothing her self and nothing but by his direction which is so evidently untrue that it appears her majesty not only acted without him but even contrary to him in many things till at last she was pleased to enter wholly into the measures of other men and when he could not be prevailed upon to join in those measures thought fit to act quite without him this however unexpected will show that what has often been said to the queen her self is now confirmed  viz that the treasurer bore the load of many things which he had no concern in and indeed this was evidently one reason why he drew out of the administration of which and of whose mistakes though he did not approve he was sure to bear the scandal  it is not to the purpose to enter here into the reasons why the treasurer rejected the measures proposed to him by these new men whether they were consistent with the public good or the queens safety and honor is fitter for them to defend than for him to enquire into it suffices to say they were such as the treasurer thought were not for her majestys service and that therefore he declined the public affairs rather than go on upon those foundations it is effectually proved by the circumstance of his dismiss also that the administration consisted of several parts and was not engrossed as was suggested by the treasurer in an arbitrary manner the discontents of other men having been carried to such a length as to affront him even in the execution of his office and to reject all the offers of an accommodation or reconciliation which the treasurer frequently made to them that the public business might not be hindered it is likewise to be observed that in these offers of reconciliation the treasurer always represented the absolute necessity there was of having every office do its own business and the administration to run in the due course according to the ordinary administration without any suggesting the superintendency of a prime minister or so much as claiming any reserve to himself being willing to confine himself to the sphere of his office with more strictness than any of them desired  it was not the least affliction to the treasurer that he found the avarice of some men in office and the ambition of others to be made great sooner than ordinary began early to offer obstructions to the public business and that he was frequently ill used by those who he thought had reason to treat him otherwise particularly by a certain esquire that he was not made a peer so soon as he was willing to be so as also that when he was honored with the peerage it was but a viscount and yet more that when some garters were disposed he was not gratified this was the more afflicting because that when this person was at first by the treasurers interest recommended to her majesty for the office which he was entrusted with the treasurer believed he would have acted from principles of zeal for her majestys service and a generous concern for the church and nation in all he did without making his private advancement the sum of his desires and pushing that particular so far as to insult his friends for the delay however necessary that delay would be to the queens service who found it necessary to make use of his service longer in the house of commons and gave him assurances at the same time that the delay should be no detriment to his rank so that it only affected his impatience not his ambition which was an exceeding aggravation of his mistake showing at what rate he esteemed his mistresss service and the public good which to a minister of state should always go before his own advancement  the treasurer failed not upon all occasions to represent to this person and to his friends the evil consequences of dividing from the queens service by dividing against one another but was always treated with disrespect and with much passion the necessary concerts in public matters were much hindered by these things and it was scarce possible to go on in the execution of matters determined in the council to be done all confidence being hereby destroyed and the harmony necessary in carrying on so much business where so much opposition was to be expected being thus broken it is not to be wondered at if it gave infinite advantages to those who made that opposition of which the treasurer failed not in making just representations as well to the persons themselves as to her majesty likewise who often spoke of the same with regret  but it was all to no purpose the treasurer found the heat increase rather than abate and that it particularly bent its fury at such things which although they were particular to the province of treasurer he had thought fit to do without communicating his schemes to him though at the same time they thought fit to carry on the negotiations and treaties abroad in many cases without communicating their measures to him and sometimes hardly to the queen herself the treasurer has been loath to mention the mean reasons given for their quarrelling with him about the scheme for payment of the great debt the nation was engaged in  viz that they should have gotten money by it but since the secret committee have thought fit to publish that part of it which the treasurer formerly laid before her majesty whereby it is no longer a secret it may serve to convince mankind that the disinterested conduct of the treasurer in the administration and his resolving to make no private gain out of the ruins of his country was not the least part of his management which those men disliked or the least reason why they behaved so uneasily to him  but to dwell no longer on this part those who knew the difficulties with which the treasurer struggled in the matters of credit and of money and the opposition the party whom the queen had dismissed made to every step that was taken to restore it could not but wonder that these men who at the same time confess themselves unequal to the work should not be content to contribute no assistance to it but should on the contrary so much obstruct things and encourage the opposition of others as their breaches one with another were known to do  the treasurer had baffled the designs of those who had endeavored to prevent his remitting money to the army and the establishing the credit of the public and notwithstanding at his entrance into the office he found the exchequer exhausted the bank refusing to advance money upon such securities as the government was able to offer had the army at the same time in the field which some people were not ashamed to own they expected should mutiny for their pay yet he had mastered all these difficulties and gave good reason to believe that he would have gone through every other obstruction and it was not a little afflicting to him to find his opposers among those who he had by his interest and recommendation brought into business  yet as things are now like to go it is no little satisfaction to him that if there has been any criminal negotiations set on foot any favoring the pretender any measures entered into to the prejudice of the succession of the house of hanover these things must be found among those parts of their conduct which they were pleased to transact by themselves and to which they did not vouchsafe to admit the treasurer as not being so much at that time in their confidence and as they acted these things by themselves so they must answer for them by themselves if the present government think fit to call them to account for it the treasurer having had no concern in any thing of that nature and is persuaded that no man had the assurance to make an offer of any thing of that kind to her majesty and that if they had that the queen would have resented it with the utmost indignation  the obstruction these things gave to the public administration had diverse other effects and particularly it gave encouragement to the outed party in their vigorous opposition of all her majestys measures which they carried up to such a height as to expect the house of peers would be brought to their side and though the treasurer had a firm satisfaction in the peers that they would not be imposed upon in these things yet seeing the numbers appeared something equal and that the party discovered some assurance of carrying their point her majesty resolving not to run the venture chose to make a number of lords for ballancing his enemies a practice allowed by the law and undoubtedly in the prerogative however clamoured very much in the present case and notwithstanding which as was evident by the sequel the treasurers opinion appeared to be founded on a right judgment of things  viz that they were safe in the votes of the peers who were already in the house the question being carried in the house by one voice more than the number of new lords then created the warmth of those people who at this time pushed at the new ministers may be judged of by that other incident which attended at this time  viz that the occasionalbill was at this time brought in by them which they had always opposed before and which it seems was now submitted to in favor of the e of n  s scheme who declared himself against the administration from this time for reasons so mean as  requires not to be remembered and who however forgot not to  a good capitulation with those  surrendered to and to gain this point of the whiggs which they had always till now withstood but neither the e of n  insisting on such high terms for so mean an advantage as the best service he could do them nor the easiness of the whiggs at that time to part with the dissenters on such cheap terms were by far so wonderful as the satisfaction with which the dissenters stood and looked on while the fetters and mannacles of this new law were fastened upon them it cannot be doubted that secret engagements were entered into between the parties to take off this law again by parliament when an occasion should offer when that occasion shall be said to offer time must show all the use which her majesty made of these things was to see to what a length those who resolved to oppose her measures were come and what sacrifices they would make to bring about their schemes but these things moved her not at all  it was far more afflicting to her majesty to see her servants clashing with one another in the execution of her commands and to see the endeavors used by herself and those who adhered to her pleasure ineffectual to the putting a stop to it yet even these evils though dangerous to the administration had their effect for the bringing about the great event which now came on the stage concurring with the measures of the whiggs so far as to make it be still more and more her majestys opinion that it was absolutely necessary to put an end to the war  the treasurers opinion was not material on the subject of a peace the queen having declared that it was her firm resolution if possible to be done upon just conditions to put an end to the war but the treasurer was more convinced of the necessity as well as justice of her majestys said resolution when he saw not only the warmth wherewith the opposite party opposed the ministry even in carrying on the war but the divisions apparently breaking into the administration by the power of those who set up a new faction in the ministry and by the influence they had not only upon the queen but upon the members of parliament and upon some useful people in most offices under her majesty  yet the treasurer took no steps in the affair of the peace till the french having made proposals of peace to her majesty it came before him to consider whether those proposals were such as might lay a foundation for a solid negotiation the treasurer took nothing from them otherwise than ad referendum neither entered into any secret negotiation without her majestys direction and knowledge what any other person might do being employed or directed by this new faction the treasurer accounts not for any more than he does for many of the orders and directions given to the persons employed abroad to carry it on in which he had no concern  the treasurer cannot but hope that the present enquiry which is making into these things will serve to his vindication in that part wherein he suffers in the general scandal of other mens actings as if all things had been directed by him the contrary is evident in many other cases besides that of the peace wherein his part of the negotiations seemed rather to be to set to rights the mistakes made by others and to put them in the way of a regular negotiation after the most remiss and disconcerted conduct had brought them into confusion as was many times the case if the treaty suffered by those steps and if the french were vigilant to make advantage of the people who they found acted with less regularity than in a case of such consequence they had reason to expect the treasurer has the satisfaction of seeing that the advantages so made are the less by the part he acted in that matter and not the more  the truth of what is said of the treasurer not being master of the measures by which the said new faction then acted was evident from their obtaining without his consent or knowledge an order from her majesty to pay the sum of twenty eight thousand thirty six pounds five shillings for arms etc on the account of the expedition to canada which sum the treasurer scrupled to pay for such reasons as are well known to be just among which one was that he had reason to believe the said demand was a fraud that the money was to be applied to private use and that the greatest part if not all was not to be employed in the service for which it was pretended to be asked which reason likewise caused the treasurer to withdraw himself out of that matter and to refuse for some time before to meet with those who transacted it  neither will it be of any force to say that the breaches did not take effect till toward the end of that administration and that the treasurer was the sole director for the first three years as some insinuate to take off the force of these remarks for it is certain that though the open discovery of these divisions and their breaking out into a flame did not appear without doors till after the peace was finished yet the fatal influence of them began even at the beginning of the ministry the interest began to divide in feb    0   and the treasurer refused to meet in several congresses of their allies because he found them carrying on criminal intreagues for the defrauding the public and enriching themselves by the spoils of their country  it would expose the new faction aforesaid should it be made public how they treated the treasurer for refusing to corrupt his hands and stain his integrity with betraying his sovereign to those who he foresaw would betray all to their voratious avarice how he was never to be forgiven the omission of such a step and that they would by no means be thought to have justice from him if they were hindered from making a prey of their country  it is because he strives not to load any man much less those who he fears have already too much guilt to answer for that he forbears to enter into the detecting those practices which he then abhorred it is enough to mention what those men too well know the truth of  viz that from the beginning he found their measures too much calculated for private advantage without that disinterested aim at the public service which the duty of ministers of state required and that according to his duty he with plainness and sincerity told them his thoughts of it in order to their reforming the principle from which they acted told the queen of it in order to prevent her majestys being imposed upon and being able to do no more withdrew from them in those things which he did not approve as in particular that affair of the money demanded for the expedition to canada  in which affair the treasurer has the satisfaction of making it appear that he did not come into the fraud and that notwithstanding the importunity of the persons he resisted their demand of the money till such repeated orders were sent him to comply with it from her majesty as he had no power to withstand and likewise has had the satisfaction to find that since these things her majesty had an opportunity to see the cheat more openly detected by his means and to know that whatever was suggested by the treasurer of a designed fraud in that case was true  but what was yet more wonderful was that the persons concerned were not ashamed to vindicate themselves in this practice and to suggest that they ought to be allowed to do such things signifying also their great resentment at the treasurer as if they were wronged by him in being restrained from those things which no honest man could allow  the peace having been effectually set on foot in the year      met with unexpected opposition at home and as it was thought that those of the allies who seemed to appear most active against it abroad were moved to do so by the impressions which they received from hence it was by her majestys command made his province to set on foot such negotiations in such foreign courts as were necessary in order to undeceive the princes and states abroad as often as they had received ill impressions of her majestys intentions and to set her measures in a true light before them that no misconstructions might be made of her sincere desires to act in concert with them and for their interests and consequently no fatal misunderstandings might happen in which might separate the allies one from another which would be a means to make the advantages which might be obtained by an unanimous treaty either less in themselves or difficult to obtain and it is not to be wondered if the treasurer should afterward in the account of these things which he laid before her majesty in the year      say that during the first year of the peace his hands were full of negotiating the peace in all courts abroad seeing the conduct of these men and the mistakes they made made it often difficult as well as troublesome to reconcile their measures and to distinguish between what they had done and what her majesty intended to have had them do  as to what was offered at home against the negotiations of the peace her majesty took little notice of nor did it make any other impression on her than to convince her more and more of the necessity she was under of finishing the war and confirming her opinion in the reasonableness of her negotiations the opposition made about that time to the public administration as well of the treasury as of the military affairs gave her majesty still less disturbance for the treasurer having been supported by the needful funds which the parliament with great duty and application dispatched to her majestys satisfaction easily surmounted the difficulties which some endeavored to cast in his way in the procuring money to carry on the public affairs and the queens business now began to be on a better foot than ever the party who from the beginning had opposed her majestys measures at home and embarrassd them abroad began to lose courage and to give it over finding the queen resolved to pursue her just designs and her servants in a capacity to support her administration which they had been very positive in their assurances to the foreign courts in alliance with the queen could not be brought to pass and on the miscarriage whereof the sum of their affair depended  as the said assurances to the foreign courts had created much difficulties to the ministers and had made the negotiations very precarious so when the failure of those assurances appeared as it did very evident by the withdrawing of some persons from the kingdom and by the submission of several active people at home and by the dutiful and cheerful concurrence of the parliament then sitting in which all the difficulties which could be started by the malecontent party were cleared up to the full satisfaction of the said parliament who evidently came into the peace and even into the manner or terms of it i say on the failure of those assurances given from hence to some foreign courts and such necessary steps as were taken by the treasurer to assure those courts of the sincerity of her majestys intentions many of those courts appeared satisfied and things went on in a free and open negotiation abroad for a while with more success and less difficulty than before  yet even in this part in which they could contribute so little did the persons abovementioned give the public affairs all imaginable obstruction and make the treasurers work thereby exceedingly difficult by their frequent breaking in upon measures acting rashly and without concert and perhaps sometimes without sufficient directions or orders in things of the nicest nature in which the treasurers interest with them was so small as that whatever he could say to them on that head was to very little effect and for that reason as likewise because he was willing to do nothing which should render her majesty uneasy or obstruct her service he gave them as little obstruction as posssible  but as men who agree but ill in the right management of their office are likely to agree worse with themselves so the treasurer had frequently his hands full with the lesser broils which they raised one among another and which either by their own application or by her majestys order it was often made his province to reconcile  it would take up much time to speak of these matters and especially of the conduct of the secretary then mr st john before at and after his having the dignity of the peerage granted him by her majesty in which many are witnesses to the treatment the treasurer received from the passion of that gentleman and his friends as it relates to the delay of his advancement at first and his being ill satisfied with the degree of it when granted the particulars of which though her majestys conduct was so just and supported with such reasons as could not but be submitted to by all his friends yet were received by him with such resentment at the treasurer as it has not been usual for men of like station to meet with or for ministers of state to give to one another  it cannot be doubted but this conduct as it obstructed the public affairs on one hand so it exposed them much on the other lessened the esteem of the persons as well as the power of her majestys servants and brought the administration into contempt both at home and abroad and which was still worse exceedingly disturbed her majesty divided her esteem this way or that as her majesty found to day this person to morrow that acting up to or below the duty of their station distracted the public councils and oftentimes caused her majesty to shift her service out of one hand and into another which gave much dissatisfaction to the queen in several things and her majesty failed not oftentimes to signify her displeasure at these things which it was much more easy for her majesty to do than to find a remedy for them  this caused the treasurer after things were brought to a length not to be otherwise accommodated and after he had in vain by long letters as well as by frequent speaking to the other persons pressed them to a stricter and quieter application to their duty to represent these things to her majesty in the plainest and best terms he could giving her majesty an account of the distinct circumstances she then stood in with reference to the said uneasy persons as also of the situation of her affairs at that time and how her administration then appeared by their management to be encumbered with difficulties not easy to get through but yet ending with proposing due remedies for the evils which attended it  it is true one of the best remedies for the said evils had been an unanimity of councils and adjoining all the queens servants together in a strict friendship to one another and a mutual discharge of their duty to her majesty that each acting in their proper sphere or particular province with a clear and disinterested view to her majestys service might go on in a good understanding with one another and a perfect harmony of desires for the public good and a just subservience to her majestys pleasure  to this purpose the treasurer as well in his letter to the lord bolingbroke as in several papers and schemes which he gave in by her majestys command to regulate these mischiefs always adhered to the first opinion which he had professed in the time of the former administration and of which mention has been made viz that every minister should confine himself to his especial province concurring therein to the general interest of the sovereign and endeavoring always to lay before her majesty a true state of her affairs should then act with subservience to her commands and in concert with one another for her interest and service this the treasurer always backed with just representations of what was the particular province of the person he wrote to and not without earnestly pressing him to enter into just measures for the discharge of the matters immediately before them and with schemes for the carrying on the public business so as to make it easy to the queen and to themselves  instead of just returns to these he was continually attacked with quarrels and complaints new and private schemes of their own some of which were formed upon principles that he could not in duty comply with and upon his rejecting such schemes but especially upon his prevailing with her majesty to enter so far into the redressing these things as to make a nomination of officers different from their proposals by a scheme of the treasurers upon thi step i say he was treated ever with outrage nor could they be ever brought to any rules or mesures in concert with the whole ministry ever after till the treasurer to his great satisfaction withdraw out of public business and obtained the favor of her majesty to be dismissed from an administration in which he had so little influence as not to be able to do his duty and yet so great an unhappiness as to be charged with all the mistakes which other men made  the treasurer cannot but think the timely dismiss he received being the last favor his royal mistress lived to do him was the most happy turn from heaven that befell him through the whole course of his life seeing it will testify for him in any examination which may hereafter be made into these things that the mistakes which may have been made in the time of his administration have happened rather from the want of power in him to prevent them than from his having the governing influence in the ministry as has been suggested that his part of the negotiations abroad has been rather to rectify what they had done amiss than to act by himself and that no irregular steps have been taken by him no unwarrantable practices no evil council given by him and that his only misfortune next to his having been supposed to be the author of evil councils has been that he has not been able to prevent the effects of them or to deliver the queen from them whose illness many cannot but still believe received not a little increase from the trouble these things gave her majesty and the grief of seeing the irreconcilable clashings of her servants  but to go back to the peace it seems in all the speeches about the transaction of that affair the objections lie rather against the methods taken to bring it to pass than against the illegality of the ministers being employed to bring the war to an end which nevertheless seems to be the previous question and here we find that the proper enquiry was as to the treasurer whether he has acted legally in obeying the queens commands or not if any of the ministers with or without his knowledge and consent entered upon measures in carrying on the treaty unjustifiable by the laws of the land their separate management will questionless appear the plainer and the treasurer when every man shall answer for himself will still be the more openly vindicated from the aspersion mentioned above of having the direction of the whole affair in himself  as her majesty found reasons to resolve to put an end to the war her minister whether there entered into her majestys reasons or not would find themselves obliged to enter into her measures for the bringing it to pass whether the reasons which moved her majesty to this resolution were her own or were raised from the counsel given to her by any person in whom her majesty reposed so much confidence as to be prevailed with by their advice whether her majesty was moved by the tendency so natural to her and the compassion moved in her breast by the expense of the blood of her people some having said this was the first and only motive but supposing it was by the counsel of her servants from other motives and be those motives what they will it seems no part of the present defense of the late treasurer unless there appeared some ground for a charge upon him as being the person who advised counseled or moved her majesty to it or to enter into any measures with france for that purpose which on the strictest view of all that yet appears in public does not seem to be so much as pretended to  while then it remains unenquird into who first moved her majesty to enter into measures for making a peace and the queens undoubted prerogative empowered her majesty to enter into and finish negotiations to that purpose it seems that all the enquiries into the correspondence between her majestys first resolutions and the subsequent measures will necessarily be placed to the account of such intervention of accidents as caused her majesty to change her thoughts and that the ministry cannot justly be charged to bring to pass those resolutions and those changes by way of intriegue or with design to carry on the treaty with the more disguise this would be to make the queens servants guilty of betraying the queen in the most infamous manner and exposing the honor of her majestys word in a most gross and unjustifiable manner and if any such thing could be proved the treasurer would have no other work before him than to publish his detestation of such practices and wash his hands of the guilt  on the other hand it is humbly conceived that all such expressions as are insisted on by some in the queens letters messages or speeches to the allies or their ministers in which her majesty declared her resolution to carry on the war to make no separate treaty to procure just satisfaction to her allies etc are to be expounded by the grand alliance and to be built upon the supposition that her allies acted according to all their engagements with her majesty in the said alliance otherwise her majesty would be understood to oblige herself to all that might be contained in those expressions whether her allies continued to discharge their part or no and in the consequence of such an opinion the queen might at length be alone in the war under the literal obligation of those letters speeches etc  but it was the opinion of the queen at that time and of many of her servants that the allies particularly the states and the emperor had not done their part in the war and had not discharged their engagements to her majesty and even the parliament themselves in the representation of the house of commons to the queen reference being had thereto did confirm that opinion nay her majesty found that no complaint from hence had the desired effect to oblige the said powers to act in another manner but were productive only of memorials and letters extenuating or justifying themselves and in these things are said more particularly to be formed her majestys first resolutions  nor was this a transaction of that day only it had been thus before and this her majesty had long been acquainted with in the time of the earl of godolphins administration when as has been credibly said his lordship having frequently pressed those allies to perform the conditions of the grand alliance and to furnish their quotas and contingents as by the several conventions and stipulations subsequent to the said treaty of grand alliance they were obliged to do received for answer more than once and that to her majestys great grief that their state was empoverishd that they were able to do no more and that unless his lordship meaning the then treasurer would supply the extraordinary charge they could not carry on the war and must make their own peace on the best conditions they could or to this effect if these things then were justifiable on the part of any of her majestys allies they were much more to be defended on the part of her majesty and her servants though they were led by these things in the method they were to take with the same allies even by a natural return  likewise in the methods taken by some of the allies to reject and render ineffectual the treaty for a peace when it was set on foot at vtrecht and to put an end to it by the operations of the campaign her majesty thought she saw so resolved a combination not against a peace only but even against a treaty without enquiring whether it might have been concluded to advantage or no which combination her majesty thought was not only inconsistent with but contrary to the express declaration of the states of their being desirous of peace that her majesty and likewise her servants were of opinion that her majesty was justly disengaged from all that had been said promised or stipulated between them before and was not at liberty only but bound by the strictest of all the obligations which a good prince could be bound by to provide for the safety and ease of her own subjects by a peace whether in conjunction with or separate from those allies in the mean time nevertheless providing as well as possible for the satisfaction of all her allies if they thought fit to come into her measures for their own and the general satisfaction  this may appear more especially from the instructions given to his grace the duke of ormond when he went over general of her majestys forces wherein his graces orders begin thus  you are with all possible diligence to repair to the hague and to acquaint the pensionary that having appointed you to command our army in the netherlands we have given you orders to see him before you go to put your self at the head of the troops you are to express to him the resolution we are in of pressing the war with all possible vigor until the enemy shall agree to such terms of peace as may be safe and honorable for us and for our allies  you are farther to say to this minister that you are prepared to live in a perfect good correspondence with all the generals of the allies and particularly with those of the states and that you hope you shall find the same inclination on their part to which his the pensionary good offices will extremely contribute you are after this introduction to desire the pensionary to inform you what plan has been agreed upon for the operations of the campaign  the duke it seem is of opinion that when his grace came to the hague and pursuant to these instructions communicated the queens pleasure as well to the pensionary as to the deputies of the council of state they declined him received the proposals in a manner less obliging than her majesty thought she had reason to expect and it is evident that they refused to communicate their measure to him but referred him to the deputies in their army as may be seen in the account given to the public by his grace in his book entitled vid page   or   the couduct of the duke of ormond  this quotation is needful in order to state the case as it then appeared to her majestys servants at the time when proposals came over from m de torcy in the king of frances name in order to set on foot a negotiation for a peace and which by the grand alliance her majesty was not prohibited receiving and consequently the ministers could not be blamed for receiving it in her majestys name if in the pursuit of the negotiations which have followed they have acted illegally that must appear upon due examination and must lie upon those who it can be proved by good evidence were guilty  the treasurers part in these things can lie only in the general transaction  viz the approving of the entering upon the treaty the particular negotiation not being his province except that his share abovementioned which seemed to be rather the necessity he found sometimes to rectify the mistakes which some by their private divisions and their other practices had run themselves into than that he managed any part of the treaty but the whole affair was transacted in the council or by the secretary of state or by the queen through them both  moreover it recurs back to what is observed before that such was the growing breach among the queens servants at this time that not being in terms of peace with one another they were ill qualified to consult one another in the affair of making peace abroad it is hoped for their sakes they have made no slips if it should be otherwise their enemies will not fail to make their advantage thereof but as to the treasurer it is evident that as it was not his province to correspond with the ministers abroad so he is not to answer for those that did  it may seem strange that in carrying on this account of the conduct of this minister who fame has so often spoken of as at the head of all affairs it has not yet occurred to speak of the pretender or so much as once to mention such a person but that he seems to lie out of the question as much as if there were no such person in the world and this is the more wonderful because of the pains which has been taken in the world to load the treasurer with the guilt of this among the rest and even to assure the world that this among other things would be proved upon him as clear as the sun at noon day notwithstanding which some of his enemies acknowledge now that even in all the examinations into that matter that they do not see that one step in favor of the pretender can be proved upon him neither do we find yet that those appointed to examine into it have charged him with any thing of that kind  the most which the examinations which have been taken of that matter seem to import amount to no more than this that some people in the ministry knew of or connived at his being permitted to reside in the dominions of the duke of lorrain but all of them grant that in all the negotiations they were strictly enjoined to insist upon his being obliged to quit the dominions of france so that they do not pretend to any thing done in the treaty in his favor or of that kind that could be useful to his design nor is it alleged that the obligations laid on the french king not any ways to aid or assist him or to admit his return are not as full and as pungent as words could express which treaty therefore being so calculated to remove the pretender from the assistance of the french and from his dominions seemed to answer all the ends of the most fixed and resolved enemies to his interest not valuing whether he might think fit to go seeing if the french king kept his word inviolably his near residence in lorrain would be of small advantage to him and if otherwise his remoter residence could have been no more obstruction to him than the difference of a few days in his journey when he should have been recalled adding withal that at the remoter distance of rome or venice he would with much greater ease have removed without notice and been able to have passed incognito whenever he had any design so to do than he can do where he now is  so that on the whole as in the treaty they took effectual care to tie up the french king from giving any assistance to the pretender and put the necessity upon him of banishing him for ever from his dominions the queen seemed to have done all that was of movement to be done and if any one connived at the place of his residence in favor of his pretending to the crown of great britain such an one was so far guilty of a traiterous confederacy with the pretender  it is observed by some that the affair of the pretender was the province of the abbot gautier who was a french minister residing here during the negotiations but it dose not yet appear or at least we do not find that any thing was transacted for him but what related to the place where he should go and that so as he might not be surpised by the emperor and even this seems to have been left undecided and that the queen afterward finding it was the occasion of uneasiness among her people did earnestly press to have him removed all which can afford but small ground to suggest as is done that the ministry had a reserved design to make him king of britain  this however not at all affecting the treasurer had not been mentioned in this place but to remind the reader of the injury the treasurer received during the time of these negotiations as well as since in being openly reflected on as in the interest of the pretender whereas upon the narrowest scrutiny it is believed it will appear that not one step has been at any time taken by him or that the least shadow of any thing will be found that looks like favoring that persons interest on the other hand it is apparent that the treasurer has all along been hated and malignd by the jacobite party here as their greatest and most dangerous enemy that they openly rejoiced when he was dismissed from the high station which he acted in before and that as soon as the first division among the ministry appeared they eminently showed themselves against the treasurer and in the interest of the other which was a testimony of the best kind namely of the enemy in behalf of the treasurer and signified that if they had any hopes of their interest in any side it was in those who were now opposing the treasurer to the utmost these things if any thing will do it may open the eyes of some men to see the injustice they have done to the treasurer in these things and how injuriously he has been all along treated by them  the treasurer standing in this posture with respect to the ministry at home in cannot be supposed but that many things in the transaction of the peace were actually done not without his consent only but that he entirely declined to intermeddle with those things which he did not approve it was no doubt the duty of the plenipotentiaries to leave such articles as they could not legally adjust to the parliament of great britain to ratify or reject and therefore the viii and ix articles of the treaty of commerce which related to the taking off of duties on several merchandises imported could not be finally concluded or otherwise settled than by referring them to the parliament by whom the several duties being appropriated to particular purposes could alone be taken off but when these things came to be laid before the parliament it seems it was subject of great complaint against the treasurer that he was unwilling or declined to have the ministry espouse the making those articles effectual whereas it was the treasurers opinion that the ministry should entirely leave the merchants to act as they thought fit and leave the house to act at the merchants requests and as their own wisdom should direct them the ministry standing entirely neuter  but this likewise he was overruled in and the rest of the ministers thinking themselves obliged to support at home what they had transacted abroad brought in their whole strength into the debate and making it a party affair lost it in the house of commons by that very means and no other in all which matter the treasurer remained passive and unconcerned though with this injustice also on him viz that he suffered the reproaches of the whigs for espousing the bill of commerce and of the other part of the ministry for not espousing it  it would be endless to go through the detail of these particular cases in which the province of the treasurer was no other than to bear infinite calumny for those follies which he had no share in but had not power to prevent and this made him frequently say that he was out of office near a year before he was out of place and indeed for some of the last months that he remained in the place he had little to do in the public affairs but to complain of this injurious usage viz that he was obliged to see things done that he could not approve of and then to hear them called his doing  under these unhappinesses he became an humble petitioner to her majesty either to deliver him from these men or to dismiss him from the service at first he prevailed to their great uneasiness to have a new settlement of great officers made which as he knew it overthrew the schemes which the other people had laid so he had hopes it would at length put the affairs in a course of management as would retrieve the confusion they were at that time in this was when her majesty appointed the duke of shrewsbury lieutenant of ireland lord finlater to be chancellor of scotland the earl of mar third secretary of state lord dartmouth lord privy seal and mr bromley secretary of state in lord dartmouths room sir william wyndham chancellor of the exchequer and the duke of ormond to command in chief in britain  it is impossible to express the outrage of the other persons who now owned they looked but like a faction in the ministry but gave out threatening speeches plentifully that they would soon destroy this new scheme the trouble likewise which this gave to the queen herself cannot be spoken of without grief especially when it must be remembered how near it was to that fatal distemper which removed her majesty to a throne incapable of such perturbation and dissatisfaction  it was not indeed very long ere her majesty perceived that they would never cease attacking her on these heads and began something to yield to their importunities which the treasurer perceiving renewed his applications to her majesty to the same purpose as before and in this interval it was that he received her majestys command to lay before her a true state of her affairs which command he cheerfully obeyed in hopes the doing so might either fortify her majestys resolutions in the model of administration lately entered upon or replace himself in that recess from business and from the scandal of other mens mistakes which he so much desired  this account the treasurer laid before her majesty the  th of june the title whereof was as follows  a brief account of public affairs since august the  th    0 to this present  th of june      to which is added the state of affairs abroad as they relate to this kingdom with some humble proposals for securing the future tranquillity of her majestys reign and the safety of her kingdoms  together with this account the treasurer sent her majesty the following letter and in a few days after the queen did him the honor of granting his humble petition  viz of laying the staff at her majestys feet the letter as follows  may it please your majesty i presume in obedience to your royal commands to lay before your majesty a state of your affairs though i have very much contracted it from the draught i made and the vouchers from whence it is taken yet i find it swell under my pen in transcribing being willing to put every thing before your majesty in the clearest light my poor understanding can attain to it was necessary to lay it before your majesty in the series of time from the beginning to this present time and when that is completely laid before you it remains only for me to beg god to direct your majesty  and as to my self do with me what you please place me either as a figure or a cipher displace me or replace me as that best serves your majestys occasions you shall ever find me with the utmost devotion and without any reserve  madam your most dutiful most faithful most humble most obedient subject and unworthy servant oxford   thus ended a troublesome administration of a few years in which the treasurer may truly say he enjoyed the place but never could execute the office and though it is true that he had all the envy and bore the weight of all the evil conduct of other men yet nothing can be truer than that they not only influenced the public affairs distinctly from him but that they carried every thing their own way even over the belly of the treasurer and had the particular direction of those things of which he had the scandal for all their ill management lies at his door in the esteem of his enemies and is to this hour improved to his hurt as much as some men are able  it was as has been said but a short while after this representation to her majesty that the queen thought fit to accept the treasurers cession of the staff a certain evidence that their influence had a prevailing force with her majesty who would never else have consented to admit such men into her administration who it had been proved had defrauded the public of above  0000 pounds in money but just before and who had so evidently been detected in that fraud by him who her majesty suffered to lay down  from hence it is argued that the knowledge of these things was one reason why the queen after the treasurer was actually displaced had yet such a prepossession against those men that to their inexpressible mortification her majesty gave the office of lord treasurer to his grace the duke of shrewsbury a person in the last scheme of the treasurer and therefore hated mortally by the new faction so we must still call them and a person in whose advancement they were more confounded than before  had the queen immediately entered into the measures of those men who persuaded her to dismiss the treasurer she would certainly have likewise received their friends into such places as they had determined for them and then a few months longer would have discovered what they aimed at the treasurer how ill an opinion soever he had of their capacity had nevertheless this hope that they would not take any step in favor of the pretender but always kept himself in readiness to have detected them in the first steps they should have made that way  but her majestys distemper and death intervening surpised them all put an end to all their projected schemes at once and among the rest had this one unhappiness that it prevented the late treasurer and deprived him of the opportunity of convincing her majesty by the consequences of the fatal tendency of these councils and how naturally they would embroil her affairs both at home and abroad  upon the present enquiries made by the authority of parliament into these matters it seems that some of these men have not confidence enough in the justice of their own measures to defend them in a parliamentary manner but have retired for the present whether it shall be construed to signify their pleading guilty to the charge shall not be entered into here but certain it is that they must know the treasurer may have something to say to them which they are not very well disposed to hear  the treasurer not doubting the justice of those who the laws of this nation have made judges of these things appears and manifests thereby his readiness to cast his life his honor and his fortunes upon the honor and impartiality of the peerage of great britain as being assured that nothing shall be there laid upon him which cannot be fixed by the testimony of good witnesses and that he shall not be censured by their lordships for those transactions which have been the work of other hands and that he shall not only have full scope given him for clearing up his innocence in all the points charged against him but likewise a liberty to bring to open view the steps which have been taken by his enemies not only toward the ruin of their country but also toward vindicating themselves by laying their own crimes at his door in which defense no question not only all these things will be placed in a fuller and clearer light but many other things be brought into view which have hitherto been either concealed or very ill understood  finis
