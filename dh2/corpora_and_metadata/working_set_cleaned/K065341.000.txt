following essay was written to instruct all sober and serious persons how to preserve or regain their health but chiefly to direct and relieve my fellow sufferers the scorbutic gouty consumptive or nervous valetudinarianlowlivers to make them pass their lives the most comfortably the degree of their distempers the time of life the nature of things and the secret orders of providence will permit and since they must be deprived in some degree of the grosser sensual pleasures since all sentient and intelligent beings are made for happiness will by mere instinct seek it somehow and somewhere since their necessary lowliving will naturally in time at least make them highspirited and their intellectual organs more acute penetrating and delicate i have endeavored by the following discourses to supply them with some suitable entertainments and amusements such as i have often agreeably diverted my leisure hours with    true philosophy is the science of living the most happily through the whole period of our existence the nature of things will permit physic is but one branch of this philosophy and regards but one part of our composition and but for a small period of our duration true philosophy takes in the whole extent of our being from its most distant beginning to its most advanced stages possible or conceiveable true physic is that only which directs how the body may be preserved the most healthful the intellectual organs depending on the body the most acute the senses the most perfect and the limbs the most active not for a while only and by fits and starts but uniformly as long as they were made to last and as the original frame and texture will permit any thing less than this is but as a part to the whole an imperfect and unfinished sketch of such a philosophy and such a physic their theory and principles was intended by the following essay and discourses    they were composed at different times and on different occasions but one general scheme and one manner of free philosophizing and easy conjecturing runs through them all one to wit where the fundamental truth or proposition in general is supposed either allowed revealed or already demonstrated but the why the final causes the moral consequences and the particular detail is only here conjectured about from probable or philosophic principles this necessarily makes them more loose unguarded and immethodical and the same things to be often repeated but i had neither leisure relish nor strength of application to remedy these faults it would have cost me more trouble than the first composure all i could obtain of myself was to make a short more distinct abstract of the whole and join a few explications to prevent cavil and all mistakes not wilful and disingenuous if possible    i am very sensible by this work i shall make myself obnoxious to two very different kinds of men the stiff rigid and precise and the licentious unguarded spurious freethinkers the first very probably will censure my conjectures and sentiments as dangerous and presumptuous and myself as being wise above what is written and arrogantly prying into the secrets of infinite wisdom it is very possible i may have been faulty in this particular i am sensible that some even undoubted truths that may hurt the weak ought to be concealed or enjoyed only in secret the same degrees of light not being equally luminous and perceptive to all eyes but since old men and valetudinarians especially become as it were children a second time and in their second childhood those must have their rattles as well as these i thought it safer as i am sure it is much more entertaining to play with ideas philosophic conjectures and such amusements how weakly soever founded as tend to make virtue and its source amiable justify the conduct of providence and mend and rejoice the heart without hurting the head than to dwell on the dark side of things that lead to pyrrhonism fatalism infidelity and despair if i thought i had advanced any thing derogatory from the amiableness of infinite perfection contrary to the doctrine of the earliest and purest times of christianity contradictory to the analogy of faith and the form of sound words i had committed these sheets to the flames with the hand of their author before i had published them but on the contrary i hoped they might agreeably entertain my valetudinarian who being placed by his low health in the middle state between both worlds the old and the new must unavoidably at some times figure to himself some sort of a map of the next world i was therefore willing to try to illuminat it the best i could and to trace some of the outlines of the passages from this to that mansion by endeavoring to illustrat from not so common a set of principles and philosophy some great and fundamental truths established on more popular proofs viz that there is no possibility of happiness here or hereafter without purity of heart and life and that the true reason of the present darkness both in providence and revelation is the difficulty of recovering this purity of heart and life to its utmost perfection in free lapsed intelligences consistent with their liberty and the harmony of the divine attributes which infinite power and wisdom will not i might say cannot counter act    i apprehend less quarter from the opposite set of men who may honor me with enthusiasm romanceing and castlebuilding without any solid foundation all i have to say is that perhaps my manner of explaining some great and fundamental truths and a few of the consequences i draw by my method may be defective and perhaps from some of the links being dropped and from faults in the wording the chain of the reasoning may not be always clear and strong but i am sure the foundation is solid and just and allowed to be such by all true philosophers and without it all general and abstracted reasoning on these imperceptible subjects must be vain i mean without admitting analogy for without supposing the evidence and probability of it it being in things only what proportion is in numbers and its progressions being only like the higher and subsequent terms of a series in algebra from some of the first and simplest terms being given no general laws nor universal propositions can be found out in mathematics philosophy or morality for induction either in experiment observation or calculation must be always particular and limited perhaps the method when managed by a clearer head and a more solid judgment may become a noble source of divine knowledge and a sublime philosophy mathematicians well know that there are several different methods of investigating the same propositions in algebra and geometry and there is scarce a geometer but has his own method of investigation the same conclusions drawn from different demonstrated truths give a sensible pleasure and a stronger conviction to an honest heart and a lover of truth and i could not but be delighted with the universality simplicity and luminousness of the method of analogy and the other principles i have laid down in the following discourses not having met with an objection difficulty or even a puzzle almost in nature providence or revelation which had not an easy consequential or probable solution from them which is at least a prejudice in their favor i had nothing to do but to try the difficulty in its most simple and obvious cases as i used to do in algebra to find out universal canons and attentively to observe the conditions of the progression till the higher terms involved the complication    there are some persons made so by nature that they are slow dark gloomy joyless puzzling and perplexing and they pass for the wise prudent guarded men of the world they may attack error but seldom find out truth by themselves like the scuttlefish they spout out their own black liquor on the pellucid element if they are honest and sincere they are much to be pitied and are to be treated with humanity and charity being in the state of those born poor and blind and so destitute of the necessaries and conveniences of life they must do the best they can and be charitably supplied and with docility be willing to be led by others and thus though their trial might be hard and severe yet their victory would be meritorious and glorious but on the contrary it often happens that licentiousness selfsufficiency and a supercilious contempt of others are the true causes of their darkness and indigence and that they have themselves by wrong or no culture stunted the organs of their faculties and by a perpetual malregimen have distorted them    i take common happiness in our natural state at present to lie in the pursuit of the general measures of thinking acting and living followed by the greatest part of the middling rank of our species as it is in their order in other animals and common sense as it is distinguished from cultivated and refined sense to lie in assenting and conforming to the truths and manners agreed upon explicitly or implicitly in the community where providence has placed us without some irresistible that is miraculous evidence or a peaceable silent and not intermeddling selfconviction to the contrary and he who pretends to be happy as to his outward circumstances out of common life or wise as to intellectual endowments out of common sense in things on a level with his occupation and education i take him always to labor under some undiscovered chronical nervous distemper be the other appearances what they will and have been seldom mistaken in a particular case for though a sound mind be not the only sure evidence of a sound body yet it will always show that none of the great organs of life is entirely spoilt or greatly damaged however tender and delicate they may be it is more difficult than perhaps most men are aware of to determine with any degree of exactness the limits that separat wisdom from folly wrongheadedness from intellectual sanity the most perfect man here has a mixture of both optimus ille qui minimis urgetur certain it is that true wisdom and a sound mind consists in first pondering and then doing every thing as near as we can with order number weight and measure but since precision is incompatible with finitude if we endeavor to be constantly progressive toward perfection though by gentle steps neither stopping nor turning aside but doing the best we can without scrupulosity and generously hopeing and believeing that infinite wisdom and goodness has or will supply the rest in his own time and manner we cannot fail    were i to choose for myself considering the many certain miseries and temptations of this state of probation the few uncertain antidotes and much fewer sincere durable and real pleasures i had much rather have the weaker than the stronger system of nerves within the extremes i had rather choose to be contented with the slight and slender than covet the strong and pungent pleasures i had rather be happy in a dream than miserable awake in a word i had rather choose to be an innocent benevolent though weaker and more credulous person than a malicious critical spurious freethinker even with regard to this life only they most certainly are comparatively unhappy and joyless in themseves and are unharmoniously framed in body as well as mind who can delight and employ their talents on throwing darkness and doubts even on the imaginary happiness suppose it such of their fellow creatures nothing but rancour and acrid juices could be pleased with tearing and destroying childrens playthings and the wisest man here is comparatively but a child    as to myself i can honestly affirm i have had but one uniform manner of thinking in philosophy physic and divinity in the main ever since my thoughts were fixed and my principles established they may have had alternatives of greater light and darkness occasionally and transiently according to the state of my spirits knowledge and experience but in the heart of my soul so to speak i have been uniform and under the same convictions as to the fundamentals of these sciences and always thought spurious freethinkers active latitudinarians and apostolic infidels it being a contradiction they can be certain in their negative opinions or by them when propagated should do any good to their fellow creatures but an infinite deal of hurt under some obstinat bodily distemper and much more proper subjects for medicin than argument and that a low diet long and obstinatly persisted in would at last cure both their body and their mind so far as it depends on the body especially where vice and infidelity have not become habitual as they certainly have in old sinners as i firmly believe and am as much convinced as i am of any natural effect that waterdrinking only will preserve all the opulent healthy from every mortal distemper bateing accidents hereditary and epidemical diseases and that a diet of milk and seeds with waterdrinking only duly continued and prudently managed with proper evacuation air and exercise is the most infallible antidote for all the obstinat diseases of the body and distemperature of the mind so far as it depends on the body the present state of things will permit and that it will cure every disorder in the body cureable and render the distemperature of the mind more tractable and that in all events it will make both more tolerable than they can possibly be otherwise this regimen i have for these twenty years first and last pursued and shall with the divine aid persist in it to my last moments hitherto i thank god with as much vivacity health and activity as can be expected at my time of life under such a gouty scorbutic and nervous habit the state of my intellectuals will be best known by the following discourses which were designed to illustrate the principles theory and moral uses of philosophical medicin the practical inferences and

quality order and choice fittest to preserve health prolong life and produce equal good spirits in persons of all ages and constitutions    there is not a more pernicious error in physic or one more opposite to the expectation of patients  viz the preservation or recovery of their health than that very common and universally received opinion that there are bodies in nature or in the materia medica or such as may be found out by art by dividing compounding or altering them by the tortures of the fire which will suddenly or in any great degree change or destroy the malignity of the morbid humors of animal bodies or will entirely alter the nature qualities figure size and laws of cohesion of the particles that compose their fluids and solids from an unsound and unhealthy state to one of a kindly and benign nature a wild notion at first introduced and propagated by enthusiastical chemists quacks and symptomdoctors an animal body is nothing but a compages or contexture of pipes an hydraulic machin filled with a liquor of such a nature as was transfused into it by its parents or is changed into by the nature of the food it is nourished with and is ever afterward good bad or indifferent as these two sources have sent it forth the primae viae or the alimentary tube is as it were a common sewer may be fould or cleaned in various manners and with great facility it is wide open and reasonably strong in most animals but from the intestines into the habit which only ought to be reckoned the body or the vehicle of the soul and into the sanguiferous tubes into the glands and bowels the passages from thence are so straight and narrow that they are but infinitesimal pores rather than orifices strainers and searches rather than mouths of tubes and are scarce ever visible or perceptible in a healthy state and the supply and nutriture of the fluids and solids must pass under the form of a steam or vapor through them and not in the form of a liquor either for food or physic either to increase the quantity or alter the quality of the blood and juices and the solids which concentred consolidated and condensed into their real or first formation size would not equal a grain of sand are permanent and dureable and continue pretty much in that state of elasticity and firmness they were first created with and they are strong or weak small or coarse firm or lax loose or elastic blunt or sharp as they were first made by the supreme artificer or are altered somewhat by the original dyscrasy or distempers of the parents the mother can only mend or spoil their juices which might be easily perfected by long continuance in a sweetening diet during their younger days which if they survive they generally grow stronger as they grow older become the genii and the governors of the world because the solids thus purified come from the father alone and continue much the same all the time of their duration on this globe except so far as the small temporary and fugitive alteration that diet exercise or evacuation or mild ponderous medicines long continued may make on them so small a matter it really is that physic or the materia medica can perform on the habit on the solids at least and yet it is only in and by them that health long life and serenity are to be had the most that physic or physicians can do is in and by the primae viae or alimentary tube through these fine lacteal searches into the habit     what is it then will it be said that art physic or a philosophic physician can truly do to relieve the miseries pains and diseases of their fellow creatures a great deal if judiciously and honestly directed and obstinatly and exactly pursued viz by mending the juices in the manner nature the distemper the age and the habitudes of the patient point out these the juices are the only things in an animal body in the power and under the dominion of a physician if the principal intentions of the physician be to mend the blood and juices they will in time and by the wise mechanism of nature rectify and confirm the solids into their proper situation and tone for it is out of and by the juices that the solids are nourished figured and clothed air and exercise will give them the proper firmness and degree of elasticity and then the animal functions will be performed with facility and pleasure and thereby the person will enjoy health and serenity art can do nothing but remove impediments resolve obstructions cut off and tear away excrescences and superfluities and reduce nature to its primitive order and this only can be done by a proper and specific regimen in quantity and quality by air and exercise and by welljudgd and timeous evacuation and prepareing the morbid juices for easier elimination by means which i fear lie in a narrow compass and depend mostly on the mild mineral medicines which were never originally designed by nature to be introduced into an animal body and always rend tear and wear them out faster like spirits and chemical medicines but in bad cases are at first at least necessary judiciously managed with proper dilution     phlebotomy will directly let out a part of the bad and vicious juices to be immediately supplied with good ones from proper regimen by making the vessels more roomy and thereby enabling the circulation to make her fuller rounds for when the blood vessels are too turgid and full or the juices too thick gross and sizy to tumify them the natural secretions and discharges will be too small to admit into them new fresh sweet juices from food or physic which welltimd partial and frequent phlebotomy will much assist vomits drive forcibly out of the upper part of the chyliferous tube not only its noxious contents but strongly squeeze all the glands which are infinite of the abdomen dissolve and fuse by its convulsions and internal compressure their contents and that of the universal mass of the fluids and promote their expulsion and frequently repeated are of more use and efficacy than all the other evacuations joined together for they not only truly reach the habit supply the place of exercise cleanse the internal viscera and glands which can by no other means be reached but compress squecze and drive out the most distant obstructions by setting the whole system and the most remote fiber in violent action and play and where the solids and natural strength will admit are i think the most universal remedy known to art if obstinatly and long persisted in in chronical and obstinat cases especially for most infallibly they bring out all the latent most remote morbosities in the habit dissolve and fuse them and mix them with the universal mass of fluids in the trunks of the great vessels to be more readily and easily thrown out of the habit but they are a hard work and few can bear them purges clean and empty the lower part of the chyliferous tubes leave the glands situated there more freedom to part with their obstructions by subsequent repetitions but this evacuation though much easier yet is a great way about and of slow and small efficacy in great diseases unless the malady be situated in the lowermost regions of the body and even then vomits do it sooner and more effectually and in weak habits and nervous distempers purges ruffle extremely diaphoretics i think do little in these our northern climats unless they be very gentle and are useful only in acute cases where nature tends toward a crise in chronical cases they heat and inflame and only spend the thinnest and most aqueous parts of the fluids which are generally most innocent diuretics scour and clean the urinary passages and carry off scorbutic and nephritic salts but to be innocent or efficacious they ought to consist of the thinnest softest and coolest of all liquors that is the purest water just softened and acuated by the meal or salt of some proper vegetable blisters are mostly topical they melt fuse and draw forth the viscid serum from the capillary vessels and leave room for a freer circulation and when promoted and effected by cantharides have a sensible effect on the most distant fluids and solids and in acute cases they are indeed the greatest and most effectual remedy these are most and chiefest of the evacuations used in the practice of physic and judiciously and properly pursued are of the greatest consequence to lay a solid foundation for a cure     mercury and antimony alone with their milder preparations judiciously managed and united with the specific juice of vegetables that experience has determined proper for the distemper upon all the reasoning and experience i have ever had bids fairest for attenuating the juices and opening the obstructions in the small vessels and glands and so fitting the morbid particles for elimination but they are a twoedged sword and destroy weak persons in unskilful hands but i have occasion to speak more explicitly of their nature and effects in another place nitre and its preparations especially the animal preparation of it in woodlice has been thought by all antiquity the most innocent and yet most effectual of all the saline tribe of medicines to cool deterge and open obstructions and its sensible effect in dividing the bloodglobules in the lungs and giving it thereby its scarlet color and its efficacy in propagating and quickening fire and light in both which effects it has undoubtedly a great power if not the greatest show its energy and in febrile exacerbations especially of the symptomatic kind from malignant ulcers and an inflammatory state of the blood when plentifully diluted with pure water and long continued i think and have found it the best if not the only remedy sufficient to justify the great encomium on the natron of the ancients when the blood is sufficiently fusd and the glands made sufficiently open and pervious by evacuation and diet then steel bark and bitters judiciously prepared and fitted to the original strength of the solids of the patients will be found the most effectual to wind up the springs of life and to give a tension due tone and proper degree of elasticity to the solids the fibers and nerves but especially the membranes which i think are the true and only seats of spring and elasticity and the proper immediate instruments of motion and the functions in an animal machin long and great evacuation and a thin cool diet while they are pursued to fuse thin and attenuat the juices must of necessity relax and let down the spring of all the solids when the juices are sufficiently thind and attenuated which bloodletting will always discover then to give strength vigor and activity to the patient that all the secretions may be duly made the sole intention to perfect the cure i say is to wind up the solids again as far as art can which i fear is not far at least i have never found it much nor very dureable for all astringents are of the nature act by the same laws and have the effect that wine and spirituous liquors have and are not unlike the buckling upon pipes and boiling soft broken hair they will give them a new tension and proper figure for a short time but their efficacy and relief is only fugitive and transient and never dureable and they effect at the same time a thickening incrassating and sizeing on the blood and juices while they are winding up braceing and contracting the solids for the effects of the qualities and powers of all bodies both liquids and solids of food and physic are always in a duplicat proportion of the distance from the center of their component particles there is indeed this difference between bark bitters and steel and that of strong liquors that the sides of the vessels especially their fine close membranous coats imbibe attract and preserve the astringent virtue and qualities of bark bitters and steel and such astringents and bracers longer by reason of their innate attractive virtue on the particles of such bodies their greater solidity and closer texture than the blood globules and the circulating fluids do which are in a perpetual flux and spirituous liquors mixing more immediately fully and by closer and larger contacts with the circulating juices spend their efficacy on them and thicken them faster for these causes and reasons i say strong liquors must have a more immediate and stronger effect on the blood and juices for condensing and thickening them than steel bitters and bark and suchlike astringents can have and so spirituous liquors much indulged must necessarily have a much quicker and more deleterious effect on animal fluids than steel and astringents can but still they both act in one tenor and by one general law and steel bitters and astringents improperly and intemperatly used and overdosd will have the same kind of bad effects and produce the same symptoms and diseases that intemperance in strong liquors will only they are sooner felt are less grateful and bewitching are much less or not at all craved and consequently are sooner given over     it is diet alone proper and specific diet in quantity quality and order continued in till the juices are sufficiently thinnd to make the functions regular and easy which is the sole universal remedy and the only mean known to art or that an animal machin without being otherwise made than it is can use with certain benefit and success which can give health long life and serenity there is an innate degree of strength and elasticity in the solids to circulat the liquors and promote the secretions and carry on the vital functions with which one comes into the world which they derive from their birth and parents which is ever after but little altered even either by art or diet growth enlargement of the body and crusting over the original solids and maturation only fills the linear and infinitesimal original tubes and vessels with a proper liquor to stretch extend and plump them as a sack is filled with grain or a bladder with air or water from that liquor their coats the fleshy and nervous fibers of the muscles tendons and membrans and other solids of the body is thickened crusted over and condensed the spring elasticity and motive power lies solely and entirely in the original primary divinely organisd linear fibrils and the membrans made of them the incrustration and incrassation from the fluids in the tubes superinduced on them but weakens their original spring and elasticity both by its weight and incommensurat vibrations as we find by the elasticity of twigs the sharp notes of fine small hairs and the agility of young animals the elasticity consists mainly in the original degree of attraction in the component elementary particles of the linear fibrils primarily fashioned by the author of nature and it is in this elasticity alone the force power and pleasure of life and of the animal functions consists if the elasticity of these solids be such as easily readily and pleasantly to overcome and slide over all the rubs impediments and letts in the functions whatever state the fluids be in then the animal is healthy active and gay otherwise if they are performed with labor and struggle and from too great efforts of the selfmotive principle on the primarily divinely organisd vehicles and its load of crust which is laid on it to defend it from the injuries of this element and ruinous planet we are now confined to for as a surgeon lays a plaster on a sore to defend it from the air and the touch of hard rough bodies if this plaster itself should be hard rough corrosive or stimulating it would become a pain and incommodity instead of a pleasure or defense it is out of the juices that circulat in the tubes that this plaistering is made on the primitive sensible elastic fibrils and it is therefore of the last consequence and indeed the one thing necessary that these juices be the sweetest lightest and most lenient possible and this we can only bring about by diet soft sweet cool mild diet     some persons have industriously and designedly spread it about that i was of opinion that a sole strict vegetable or milk and seed diet was the best and fittest for all persons climats and ages without exception or limitation and the only one proper approved by the author of nature and specific to cure all animal distempers advised my patients no other or pretended to cure them no other way be their distemper what it will my opinions are of little consequence to the world and i hope i have too little value or regard for them as they are mine to be any degree sanguin or concerned for their reception i have and i hope have always expressed so great a regard for the wisdom fitness and propriety of things as discovered by revelation from whence the patent for animal food is derived not to set up my opinions or ideas in opposition to those of holy writ and the divine spirit speaking in it the wisdom of man even that of the highest cherubim is but foolishness when compared with the omniscience of god and his wise providence he that made us and sent us here knows best what is fittest for us to answer and bring about his own designs of love and mercy but i am thoroughly convinced from reason experience philosophy and revelation that in our present state in this our probatory transitory situation on this ruinous globe sensibly and evidently spoiled a second time by the deluge on which we are now situated that animal food their juices and integral particles are the fittest and most proper to produce most quickly and more immediately the firmest hardest human flesh and warmest strongest blood there is a similarity and homogeneity between the muscular flesh of tender sweet animals and that of the human body the integral particles of the solids of the first and the component globules of their juices are ready formed figured and adjusted to build up the flesh and cloth the solids and furnish out the juices of the latter they are at hand adjusted by square and compass directly to be laid together to rear the solids and their juices are inured and familiarisd to perform the meanders of the circulation and with facility to perform all the animal functions with the least labor or struggle less than those of vegetables in general as a mason will sooner and more strongly build the walls of a house who has hewn plain rectangular stones at hand than one who has rough stones only sand and mortar all which must be first figured or prepared for a solid dureable building all this i think is true just and philosophical and while youth and tolerable health continues none ought to alter the common temperat diet of the middling rank of those among whom he lives for a particular or artificial one without a particular call and the best advice nay i think such a change unnatural out of the order of providence and in some degree immoral when a person is tolerably well and not far advanced into life to change an animal for a vegetable diet to avoid mere possibilities and future contingencies is arrogantly prying into the divine decrees and insolently criticizing the conduct of his providence if gods design is to purify us by pains and penalties here ours ought not to be only the mere enjoying the kingdoms of this world and the glories thereof if his be to shorten the time of our sufferings by rendering them more intense ours ought to be to bear them as long as by his assistance we possibly can in the common course of nature and providence for if we cowardly fly from them on one side he has power and skill enough to double them in another in this particular whatever is is best but if we should find our pains and sufferings so intense that they are no longer tolerable but hinder instead of promoting what is our duty and vocation and what we are convinced is best for us then he has advised us when persecuted in one city to flee to another then and only then when animal food will no longer do we are to try what milk and seeds can do to ease our pain it is only the cross of gods appointment and which he declares his by natural causes and in the course of his providence unforeseen and unavoidable which we are to take up daily and with all the joy alacrity and resignation that the meaning of a cross can imply that is the best we can with the aid of his grace and if suffering punishment pains and penalties and shortening the duration of our imprisonment here be the very best for us in our present situation and state and if animal food and fermented liquors naturally necessarily and mechanically produce these effects more readily than vegetables milk and seed foods and aqueous liquors then was it with infinite wisdom kindness and fitness that the holy spirit permitted animal food and enlarged the materials of our aliment even though his first intention for man had been vegetables only which could only be in a paradisaical state or on a better unspoild planet but the real truth is nature our globe the various unkindly climats the different ages states conditions and circumstances under which man is at present render it utterly impossible and impracticable that man should be advised ordered or commanded by infinite wisdom to live only on vegetables it is not and it cannot be by bread alone that man can live at present it cannot answer the ends uses and occasions men are now necessitated to pursue great and sudden efforts of prowess and strength cannot be answered or executed by vegetables and water only they are too thin weak and poor youthhood vigor robustness and great action would be tortured and languish under bread and water in ever so great plenty milk fruits seeds and vegetables in any perfection are of much greater expense and labor to procure than that the poor and necessitous now can afford them especially in northern climats they have lost their vigor energy and balsam since the deluge milk is appropriated for children and not grown men to answer the ends of providence but to explain my thoughts on this matter as a physician only as clearly and precisely as i can as they flow from natural philosophy the animal economy and my own experience i say   that after a fever or any acute distemper is over and had its perfect crise and the person is not past the meridian of life the blood and juices by the strong and violent labor of the solids being sufficiently ground effete and languid a milk seed or vegetable diet is by no means long and obstinatly to be continued in it would continue the party too languid the juices too thin and vapid and the spirits too low and therefore he ought absolutely to be directed to an animal diet and temperatly strong liquors of the lightest most nourishing and balsamic nature to be gradually and cautiously entered upon especially as he begins to be capable of air and exercise   if upon taking away a few ounces of blood only out of a large orifice the curd is found too thin tender watery and too readily fusible or dissolvible in warm water and the serum too clear whiteish or in too great a quantity a milk seed and vegetable diet is by no means to be longer continued in but is to be altered gradually into light sweet and young animal food and temperat fermented liquors   if after two three four or five years the disorders for which a low cool diet was advised and entered upon with sufficient strictness and precision is not cured or greatly relieved the party may conclude that a low cool diet will not make a perfect cure and must with patience and a general regularity enter on common life and not be longer scrupulous or anxious about regimen in the quality but in the quantity and submit to the order of providence and use the means that experience or the best advice suggests to alleviat the symptoms and do the best he can taliter qualiter if he is under fifty   to such as have an original hereditary weakly scorbutical or scrophulous habit and are far advanced in life who have mesenteric glandular obstructions with feeble solids and little strength and vigor a milk seed and vegetable diet with aqueous liquors is by no means to be advised for as the case is absolutely incureable it were in vain to torment and restrain them more cruelly than their distemper itself does they must not be forbid but rather indulged the common comforts and gratifications of life it is to such that st pauls advice to timothy is just as well as kind to drink a little wine for their stomachs sake and their often infirmities a general moderation and an observation of the juvantia and laedentia is only to be advised and the use of these means known to art to alleviat symptoms   in all eruptive cases in all acute and periodical cutaneous cases in the actual fits of the gout in the second fever of the smallpox in fevers verging toward a crise to drive out from the center to the circumference any changeable disorder and universally in all cases where the vital indications languish and labor and nature is in a struggle to throw outward morbosity she is most certainly to be assisted by generous cordial and warmer medicines and higher diet to further the end nature points at these are some of the cases where too low and cool a regimen is by no means to be advised or pursued   and lastly whenever the end of a low diet is obtained viz the sweetning and thinning the juices and the symptoms are abated or cured the diet is to be heightened and gradually and cautiously raised at least if the party be under fifty i will now suggest as plainly in what cases i think it is to be advised and tried as to the healthy and well i have nothing here to say sufficient for the day is the evil thereof     it is only to those whose stomach and digestion is so weak and relaxed that they cannot concoct without extreme suffering any such proportion even of tender animal food and fermented liquors as may be sufficient to nourish and support them to those whose blood and juices are evidently so thick gross and viscid that it fills and obstructs the vessels so tumidly that they cannot receive a sufficient quantity of either medicin or food to cure or preserve them the circulation and perspiration being entirely at a stand to those who are subject to perpetual haemorrhages inflammations or constant small acute fevers to those who are after the great meal toward midnight hectical or consumptive to those laboring under a scorbuticonervose atrophy and wasting to those laboring under hereditary early knotted disabling and painful gouts or stone to those who are highly hereditarily and early scrophulous or scorbutical to those who are leprous and universally crusted over with cutaneous blotches and scabs to those who are epileptical early in life with a thin cacochymic habit to those who are constantly hysterical or hypocondriacal with frequent fits and convulsions under a weak thin habit which threaten a consumption for i have always observed these obstinat violent hysteric and hypocondriac fits in young slender persons to be the first stage of a real phthisis pulmonum or at least of a nervous atrophy and if it was not cured or prevented in this its first stage by the same means and regimen commonly the refuge of the subsequent stages they were not to be ever after remedied they being sure presages of tubercles in the lungs to those that are plainly cancerous in short to those chiefly who after they have long and strictly followed the best advice and the most effectual remedies still labor under some atrocious painful and dangerous distemper to such and such only have i ever advised a total rigid milk and vegetable diet with aqueous liquors but no longer to be continued than till the symptoms were extremely mitigated or entirely overcome and then if it was after the meridian of life to be persisted in obstinatly if long before it to be gradually and cautiously altered into common life with great temperance and i know all honest and experienced physicians ancient and modern are and must be of the same mind     the great and essential difference between animal and vegetable food is much the same as between chemical and galenical medicines chemical medicines are the supposed at least their most active virtues and qualities of plants metals and minerals contracted and concentred into a small volume by the tortures of the fire their useless or destructive parts separated and thrown away and their useful and sanative qualities compacted and united into an immediate contact and condensed they would be of admirable use and convenience if these supposed facts and such mentioned virtues were just solid and true or if an animal body could bear them without greater or more fatal future injuries than their present benefit how great soever or convenience can compensat but it is most certain that such medicines drugs or bodies are the most destructive to animal bodies if long and in great quantities thrown in that malice can invent beyond gunpowder itself and even spirituous liquors for not only nature has provided none such but as poisons in venomous creatures to kill their enemies or cook them for their food but that the particles of fire the most destructive of any are so closely impacted and transubstantiated in as never to be afterward separated from them and that their component particles are so minutely divided by the tortures of the fire as to acquire such a force of attraction toward the particles of animal bodies such a polarity as dr lister observed in all calcinations both of vegetables and minerals so constantly to answer the magnet that they become iron bristles nails and lancets darting directly and perpendicularly into the solids so as quickly to tear rend and destroy or fix them and so can never be proper for food or physic whereas galenical medicines consisting of the integral particles of vegetables metals or minerals dissolved only by gentle heat and moisture in a watery menstruum have none of these deleterious qualities on animal bodies but become their food as well as physic and naturally take the places of the morbid particles of animal habits which time and the natural functions mechanically throw off just so animal food and fermented liquors are the smallest most elementary and attractive particles united and concentered like the rays of the sun in the focus of a burningglass their delicious flavor and savor consists in their greater abundance of oil and salts which are the most active and consequently the most destructive to animal bodies if they are sufficiently diluted and their volume and quantity increased by the more innocent and unactive particles of fine earth and water they may be safely used approaching thereby very near to vegetables juices and fermented liquors much diluted with water become the nearest approximation to pure water the only beverage designed and fitted by nature for long life health and serenity and the whole study of the patient and intention of the physician ought to be to find out this just mediocrity of animal and vegetable food when combined for aliment and of fermented and aqueous liquors mixed for beverage which is the most proper for preserving his health or curcing his disorders for there is very little in the specification of the diet whether it be all vegetable or partly animal partly vegetable some vegetables being more deleterious to animal constitutions than some animal substances and there is but a very little difference between pure warm water and cold water warmed with a very little wine the just mixture and proportion suited to the constitution and distempers of the patient is by far the greatest affair though in the distempers by me just now specified that are painful and dangerous too great exactness both in quantity and quality is never to be slighted for in a true statical balance such as the constitutions under the mentioned diseases are a few grains or spoonfuls thrown in will destroy the equilibrium of health and ease     the benefits a person who desires nothing but a clear head and strong intellectual faculties would reap by religiously drinking nothing but water tepid or cold as the season is while he is yet young and tolerably healthy well educated and of a sober honest disposition are innumerable as   that he would live probably till toward an hundred years of age that being the term of life appointed by the design of the creator even after the deluge and after that eating of animal food was permitted before as it is believed fermented liquors were invented at least if we have any regard for mosess history which yet cannot be denied to be one of the justest accounts of these early times   that he would thereby constantly enjoy a clear head calm at least governable passions a facility in intellectual applications and in the acquisition of virtue and so having a longer duration secured to him and all impediments removed he might make surprising and wonderful advances in both   he would thereby be secured against all the great atrocious and frightful distempers such as melancholy lowness of spirits wrongheadedness lunacy and madness the bane of the finest best and most penetrating spirits in great britain for i defy any man to give an instance of any furious madness or great and obstinat lunacy or melancholy in any one who soon after twenty entered on water drinking only let him eat what he can for it is fermented liquors only that inflame the membrans and membranous tubuli the nerves which are the bodily organs of intellectual operations it is the fire sulphur and volatile tartar of fermented liquors that inflame corrugat and stimulat these membranes and their linear threads into violent succussions that break and tear them which are the immediate cause of these frightful and overwhelming distempers as they are of the painful tortureing ones gout stone cancer and consumption for though gluttony will thicken the curd of the blood and thereby cause obstructions in the glands and capillaries from whence many and various distempers may arise yet will they be of the obtuse slow lingering kind and in which nature will always give a timeous and early warning by inappetency nausea vomiting purging sweating spitting or rheums which will opportunely stop the progress and while water is plentifully then craved and given it will carry on distance in the circulation and dilute this too viscid curd to prevent an entire obstruction of the animal functions or destroy life and hinder the generation of gout stone cancer and consumption which are solely produced by the hard salin concretions of fermented liquors but   the most signal benefit a man will reap from early waterdrinking solely while as yet in tolerable health is being preserved from the acute sudden and mortal distempers as apoplexies suffocations fevers of all kinds pestilences and pleurisies it is to fermented strong or spirituous liquors solely that these quick and destructive distempers owe their true cause which give no warning and admit of no cure at least waterdrinking solely is the only preservative i am certain known or knowable to art accidents epidemical causes a constant neglect or a total inability to guard against the dangers of the other nonnaturals absolutely necessary toward perfect health and life may produce some degrees of these mentioned grand distempers but then under sole waterdrinking they will neither be so painful nor dangerous for it is certain waterdrinking dilution and thin diet is the only mean known to art and experience to cure them when persons are already seized with these distempers joined with strong and proper evacuations and whatever will cure will prevent as water poured on will extinguish fire so it will prevent its being kindled or beginning if these frightful painful and mortal distempers happen sometimes in eastern or southern climats where fermented liquors are not much in use it is because they wallow and indulge in some things almost equally as pernicious and inflammatory as these strong liquors as high in aromaticks eastern gums and juices opiats the volatile cepacious roots fruits and seeds of the poisonous soporiferous or stimulating kind with which those climats abound which is the sole cause of all their inflammatory distempers and unnatural and dissolveing lust for these are all but dry drams of a more dureable and adhesive nature than some of the liquid ones for fire is still fire whether solar or culinary natural or chemical whether it is transubstantiated into liquid or solider matter and water is its only extinguisher    0 i have said that the quantity of aliment meats and drinks is of much greater consequence in general than the quality for the preservation of life health and serenity if a man study the least light or heavy will not so much incommode him the great end and use of a low diet or one of milk seeds and vegetables is to mend the juices to cool attenuat and sweeten the circulating fluids whatever diet does this must mechanically relax unbend and let down the spring of the solids it is true the superiority of the force or spring of the solids must be always greater than the resistance of the fluids else the animal could not live at all that is the animal functions could not be performed and this superiority must be continued in some proportion whatever regimen the animal uses so long as it lives but it is certain a cool thin sweetning diet attenuats the fluids in a greater proportion than it relaxes and unbends the solids because   all the secretions are from the fluids and not from the solids and they spending and wasting faster must be sooner supplied and altered by the proper food   because the immediate action of food and physic is upon the fluids and they absorb and consume most of their virtue and efficacy and the solids are never acted upon by them till the fluids are fully saturated and transubstantiated into their substance and   because all fluids by their nature are sooner and more readily acted upon and altered into foreign qualities than any solids possibly can and hence it comes to pass that a person on the immediate change and for some considerable time after in passing from a high to a low diet will find his health wonderfully mended for the better because the resistance of the fluids is immediately lessened which will again even under the same diet in quantity and quality wonderfully and as it were unaccountably totter and alter for the worse which happens on the despumation of the glands capillaries and solids while they are spewing out and disgorgeing their morbid contents on the primae viae but which by proper and specific evacuations exercise and astringents afterward will generally be set to rights again if the person be at a proper time of life that is under fifty for after that there is little encouragement from any mean but gentle evacuation and a perseverance in the regulated regimen nay even he must proceed lessening it in quantity at least if not in quality by proper degrees and at proper periods descending out of life as one ascends into it viz by milkporridge water gruel panada and the like but the great benefit and advantage a man reaps from a low cool thinning sweetning regimen of milk seeds and vegetables above what he can have under any diet of animal food and fermented liquors is that he can keep the stretched and extended bowels and blood vessels always fuller and plumper and in their natural tension and situations and consequently will make the secretions more plentifully and all the functions will be more natural and easier than under a spare cautious and anxiously guarded starving regimen of so little animal food as is absolutely necessary as a weak person will walk more easily in stays than loose some lame persons in a boot than a stocking and a defensive plaster will keep a sore easier than when it is bare and excesses are neither so painful nor dangerous under the first as under the second regimen and the same person may safely venture on at least four times as much vegetable seed and milk food as he dare of animal food of any kind at least of dense hard or fullgrown animal food      i think the natural order and progression in regimen for those who are ordained to or for those whose vocation and occupation is sedentary and studious who by the order of providence and situation of life have been signaturd to intellectual professions and for all those who would cultivat and maintain clear heads and quick senses to the last is from their birth till fifteen to persevere in a gradually increasing temperat diet without fermented liquors from fifteen to fifty to be only temperat in animal foods and fermented liquors after fifty to give up animal food suppers and fermented liquors after sixty to give up all animal food and then every ten years after to lessen about a quarter of the quantity of their vegetable food and thus gradually descend out of life as they ascended into it and that all persons subject to inflammatory distempers gouts erisipelass hot scurvies leprosies asthmas jaundices colicks nervous lownesses violent headaches haemorrhages and haemorrhoids anasarcas ruptures or white swellings though otherwise strong hearty hale and of a seeming sound constitution ought to give up meat suppers and all fermented liquors and that the children of all fathers for mothers are not here to be minded who have died before thirtyfive of any natural distemper whatever and all the children begot of fathers after sixty ought to live without meat suppers or fermented liquors and that all persons whatever whatever age they be of or of whatever nature their complaints and disorder may be if upon repeated small phlebotomies and without transient accidents as colds damps blasts and bruises they constantly observe their blood sizy viscous and glutinous ought directly to be put on a low diet either of milk seeds and vegetables only or at least of one without meat suppers and fermented liquors and this regimen with proper attenuant alterative and sweetning medicines which in the nature of things ought to be of the mild ponderous and mineral tribe to be continued till at least this size and glue be broken and dissolved else they can never expect uniform and continued health for such a regimen and such medicines must do this in time else nothing in nature possibly can      unphilosophical and unexperienced persons though they know and observe the great critical alteration that happens in the sex in or about fifty and that without a special care both in the regimen proper evacuation and alterative medicines they are in great danger either of their lives or of some chronical and obstinat distempers that make their lives ever after miserable and uncomfortable after that period yet think this misfortune peculiar to females and that the males have a privilege and security to be luxurious and sensual to the last which is the true reason why so few die natural deaths and that most pass as really and truly out of life in a violent untimely manner as a felon who suffers under public justice the matter of fact and order of nature is this fifty was designed as the meridian of life in this our lapsed state and duration on this ruinous planet from this solstitial point it is a descent out of life from the birth upwards to this point the solids were developeing expanding crusting over and hardening to their utmost extension firmness and density and thereby their elasticity beginning then at fifty to weaken and unbend and they to ossify the digestions become grosser and more imperfect the secretions lessen and all the animal functions labor and then if due care is not taken to obviat these effects the chronical distempers naturally arising out of these causes and that lurked in the original constitution begin to emerge and sprout out the viscera to tumify and obstruct the glands then swell and press on the circulating blood vessels the capillaries to coalesce become full and dense and the nerves and membranes are interrupted in their play and vibrations and all the animal machin labors and the functions are performed heavily with pain and struggle this is the true time and season of life for attention consideration and care of a wise man and a philosopher the hyperbolic curve of life is at the point of its return downwards again and if then proper care be taken by some few evacuations alteratives and a regimen to put a drag on the wheels of life that they may go down gently calmly and serenely these become more useful to themselves and others than in the first ascending part of life and this happens equally to both the sexes for it is not from this season being the common period of the fertility of the female sex that these appearances happen but is a general law of nature to both sexes from the causes assigned for all the difference of the sexes lies in the different configuration of the superinduced crust or shell laid over the primitive ethereal body which in both is probably pretty near of the same figure size and materials originally      it is not an unpleasant speculation to contemplat the order of nature in its progression toward reducing this our tabernacle of clay into its original dust from its cradle to its coffin especially in those who live the whole duration of the natural life the diseases of infancy are generally scabs blotches and blains over the face head eyes and ears sometimes fits and convulsions and such cephalic and head distempers and these are certainly constitutional and parental disorders communicated by the morbid juices of the parents the colicks vomitings and diarrhoeas succeeding come from the improper nourishment in quantity or quality of the mothers or nurses the measles and smallpox are also original and parental impurities conveyed to the blood and juices in the birth from too high and too much animal food and are most of them the diseases of the upper region of the body when nature has struggled by these to purify the juices by such despumations then come the distempers of the breast and lungs in coughs catarrhs consumptions asthmas pleurisies or peripneumonies after these come pains in the stomach heartburnings colicks bilious vomitings jaundice and diarrhoeas then succeed gouts stone and gravel palsies rheumatisms and fixing of the joints and very often ruptures piles or mortifications in the bowels feet or toes the diseases of the lower regions all i would insinuat by this reflection is that nature seems to aim and would certainly if not interrupted by accidents obtain and pursue a kind of a regular and uniform progression in her course of dissolving and mouldering into dust this adamical crust of clay by distempers topical and local from the head through the viscera to the feet and joints till like a dying vegetable she has fixed it in the earth from whence it sprung this is certainly her general law if not interrupted by original parental diseases or accidents hurting some of the organs before it was born or by accidents proper and peculiar to the party itself or a general bad regimen which may quicken this progress or throw it out of its natural progression on a weakened part that may discompose the general law of nature      for perspicuity and brevity i distinguish four orders and degrees of regimen of diet that is of meat and drink viz   the common diet of a reasonable proportion of animal food and fermented liquors common to the middling rank of the healthy temperat and sober in every climat or country   a diet of plain fresh animal food once a day without any fermented liquor only plain water or toast and tepid water for beverage or one of one day meat without wine and another day a little wine without meat which i would call the trimming diet   a diet without any animal food but one of milk seeds fruits and vegetables any thing where the life of no animal is wanted to compose or dress such as eggs gravey and the like   a total strict milk and seed diet only without any other materials of these i intend to say something in general and in this order both as to their times and cookery but first as to the order or time of changeing any one of these different kinds of regimen one for another      when a person is tolerably well and is subject to no painful or dangerous distemper i think it his duty and the order of god and providence to let well alone and with general temperance without solicitude anxiety or scrupulosity to persevere in the common regimen of the middling healthy temperat order of men in the country and climat where he was born or long habituated to follow st pauls advice in another case to ask no questions about what he should eat for healths sake or rather our saviors counsel not to be solicitous or take anxious care about what he should eat or what he should drink or wherewithal he should be clothed but without curiosity or nicety take a share of whatever is presented for to live at such a time and in such a circumstance medically is truly to live miserably and propter vitam vivendi perdere causas it is enough for a wise man and a christian philosopher to stop and attend to diet and regimen when by the order of providence his natural and providential course of common regimen is barred up by some disorder or distemper and then wise nature will give him timeous warning by inappetency a nausea reaching vomiting a flatulence fullness or pain in the stomach for all distempers begin first at the stomach or bowels and then ascend to the head which is the language of the god of nature saying to the person man take care and then and only then ought a christian philosopher mind his regimen and by evacuation moderat fasting or exercise endeavor to relieve or remove the grief or apply to some honest experienced physician for advice      if the case is acute the party is not generally at least for any time in a condition to observe or direct for himself but seldom any notable errors are committed in regimen then for on the slightest attempts to any great excess either in quantity or quality nature immediately revolts and the party suffers to such an extremity by the exacerbations of his symptoms that any notable progress in such an unnatural regimen cannot possibly be received or persisted in and yet i have seen and felt by the indiscretion of friends or the officious sedulity of nurses the poor patient suffer to mortal agonies and sometimes to death in acute cases by improper loads of high foods or liquid or solid drams and cordials and many have suffered more from high and hot drugs than ever they could from the distemper in acute cases seldom any thing that is given either for food or physic passes the primae viae unless it be extremely light and liquid in such the wiser ancients scarce ever administered besides proper evacuation any thing but tepid water simple oxymel or water softened or sharpened by the flour or meal of some proper or specific vegetable long obstinat fasting continued even ad deliquium with plentiful dilution and the evacuation indicated by the nature of the distemper was their most universal remedy but it is not of regimen in acute cases that i here intend to speak my sole business is with chronical cases      but since chronical cases are only acute cases diluted and drawn out into a longer time with weaker paroxysins and a more protracted crise since nature has a general law and type by which she governs and signatures such acute distempers especially in those who follow her laws and simplicity and not disturbed by spurious art or accidents since fasting proper evacuation and dilution are the great remedies indicated in acute cases it is natural and highly probable to suppose that proper evacuation abstinence and thin cool soft regimen longer persisted in will be the single intention pointed out and the great and cardinal remedies in chronical cases and therefore when a person under common life is seized with a chronical distemper which by prudent abstinence and lessening the quantity of this common diet is not removed he ought to apply to the proper directors of health and follow their advice religiously in the use of medicines and regimen they order and if in three months time in chronical cases by rigorously pursuing the ordered medicines and regimen their symptoms are not totally removed or greatly relieved and mitigated he may i think fairly conclude the regimen was not low cool and thin enough for the end proposed and therefore ought to resolve to sink his regimen both in quantity and quality and enter upon what i call the trimming diet      but before any person resolves to sink or alter his regimen of diet or any prudent physician ought to advise such an alteration he ought always to premise a gentle partial phlebotomy out at the largest vein and from the largest orifice commonly opened for a small trunk of a vein will only send out such blood as is much different from the crase of the whole mass the circulation being slower in the small branches the viscidity is generally impacted into the smallest in a greater proportion and the serous part by the slowness is perspired or run off by the lymphatics and lateral branches and a small orifice either compresses and breaks the texture of the curd of the blood disunites and separates the globules so that the observation cannot be fairly or with any degree of accuracy made but by comparing the blood so let out with other sound healthy blood for example that of a healthy person or of a bullock or sheep if the difference in taste color cohesion of the globules and curd and the proportion thereof to the serum be in all or most of these distinctions greatly different from those of the sound blood it may fairly be concluded that the regimen of diet both in quantity and quality is to be sunk and lessened and that proper and specific alterative medicines to thin and sweeten the blood are indicated especially those of the mild ponderous nature at first with the galenical vegetables which universal experience has assigned as specific in a distemper of such a denomination and the evacuations of the primae viae by gentle vomits and domestic cathartics as the symptoms exasperat for though a person may still suffer even when the blood thus let out for experiments sake mostly appears on such gross experiments tolerably good and not differing greatly from sound blood in the size the bad juices being confined to the capillaries glands and great viscera yet these will never be opened and rendered pervious till the blood in the great trunks of the vessels be first attenuated thind and sweetened and he will never be long or uniformly well who has bad juices circulating in these greater vessels it is a certain symptom that it must be much worse and more sizy in the small lateral branches the capillaries and the glands of the viscera and it is diet alone and it chiefly joined with mild ponderous remedies at first evacuation air and exercise that can at last alter or antidote these morbific symptoms and if after three months use of the medicines advised in chronical cases by an honest experienced physician the blood on such a trial continues bad that is sizy liverish with either too little serum though clear or too much but muddy then i think the trimming diet ought to be tried viz one of white meat in a moderat quantity once a day with milk seeds and vegetables for the other meals and aqueous beverage or one day a little plain meat of any kind once a day with aqueous beverage that day and the next day only milk seeds and vegetables with about a gill of some sound old wine with or without water and this regimen with a due care of the other nonnaturals proper evacuation and due exercise i think ought to be continued for one whole year or two in obstinat hereditary chronical cases for i think acquired ones will scarce require so long time or such severity of regimen to be cured or at least greatly alleviated unless their excesses have been violent or that they are far advanced in life      but since such cases do daily happen both in hereditary distempers and those acquired by an obstinat malregimen long continued in that after a full twelvemonth or more of a trimming regimen of diet with proper evacuation and specific alteratives the blood on making the trial as above described continues still bad and sizy then i think all medicin except domestic evacuations or alteratives may be fairly cashiered and laid aside as of little or no use and the whole stress and hope laid on diet and regimen only by sinking it in quantity as well as quality and confineing ones self to milk seeds fruits and vegetables well dressed or much dissolved by culinary fire to evaporat the wind and drinking only tepid water or some specific mineral water as the case requires and wine only as other persons use spirits on dangerous symptoms as a cordial and on extremities and this method and regimen ought to be continued for two years more at least and i think in persons of a tolerable constitution and where some of the great viscera are not entirely spoiled and irremediably consumed this method and diet cannot fail of having salutary effects of a perfect cure or a very considerable relief and then if the party is not past the meridian of life the person may without fear or danger gradually and by slow degrees rise again to the trimming diet and from it return back again by the same steps he descended into common life and only on exacerbations and stated seasons sink into his lower regimen for a preservative    0 but after all this care and perseverance in a milk seed and vegetable diet with aqueous beverage if on a trial after the manner mentioned the blood be still sizy as it often is in bad constitutions and obstinat cases and the symptoms still severe and depressing the only thing remaining for such a person with any reason or expectation of success of a total cure or any notable alleviation of his symptoms is for the person to enter on a total rigid strict milk and seed diet only without butter eggs or any other vegetables but wheat barley rice oats sago and the like seed meats and even to make his milk the thinnest possible skimd milk sweet buttermilk sweet whey or the whey made with a mixture of sour milk or orangewhey or whey made with the juice of some specific vegetable especially in scorbutic gouty pulmonic and icteric cases which is the base of most of the chronical distempers in england and bread or seeds dressed made with milk only for seeds are young vegetables and are neither so hard of digestion so windy nor abound with the essential salts of plants roots and fruits and even the quantity of the regimen is to be minded little at a time but oftener never either to load the stomach nor compress the nerves membranes and fibers fullness and compression even by such foods like stops in musical chords will interrupt their easy regular and harmonious vibrations and play and so will sink the spirits and make the functions labor this regimen ought at last to be tried all other methods not succeeding one would not buy gold too dear but health and free spirits are more precious than gold and a wise man would give up every thing else for them this regimen will infallibly have one of these two effects it will either totally cure him if the great viscera are not quite consumed or make him lie down more easily and will infallibly give him longer time and better spirits to settle his temporal affairs and give all the attention to his future state the nature of things will then admit      most people that enter on a low diet for health and spirits entirely counter act and defeat its beneficial effects i have known some men of quality and gentlemen of fortune who have been advised a low diet have their vegetables of the highest and rankest flavor dressed high with burnt butter hot spices aromatics onions eggs and salt so that they were infinitely more deleterious and hurtful than a moderat quantity of plain animal food once a day could possibly be the meager fasting and lent times among the catholics in french italian and spanish cookery with their high fish sauces will much sooner inflame the blood produce gout stone and fevers than a bit of chicken veal lamb or any white meat plainly dressed possibly can all the beneficial and salutary effects of a low and vegetable diet i have ever observed have been owing in atrocious obstinat and painful distempers to milk and seeds only and even these the thinnest and the least the person could be tolerably easy under from the pain of hunger and it is not easily to be credited what wonderful effects even in the most desperate and universally condemned to death distempers i have seen performed by such a regimen duly and obstinatly persisted in especially in persons under fifty epilepsies totally cured hereditary gouts almost eradicated universal lepers made clean stones in the bladder and kidneys laid quiet cancers healed or palliated ulcerated lungs made sound and schirrous livers made pervious but all this has been constantly brought about by a total obstinat and continued milk and seed diet only but in all such incurable cases the diet is to be persisted in to the last day of life for i have always observed when such returned to a high or common diet only their distempers always returned with greater violence as in reason and true philosophy must have been expected for the solids being brought down and relaxed to a level and equilibrium with such a diet become infinitely sensible delicat and tender and such strong aliment becomes an universal stop and obstacle to their play and vibrations like sticking down a musical chord all along with pins and interrupts marrs and confounds the whole animal functions and economy and brings on all the old symptoms enraged      it is true to live thus poorly anxiously and attentively is a most miserable kind of life to which the brave the bold and the unbeliever will brag he should prefer death itself but i who give little credit to such bounces know selfpreservation to be the great law in nature never met one but the true practical and habitual christian among my many patients and even scarce these who was truly willing and pleased to strip and lie down and only him who was always resigned to the order of providence either in life or death and even not him at all times and in the dark moments of trial or any but the extremely miserable in life but here the case is not mere dying but living a dying life perhaps for many years here it is in two evils  violent pain or extreme lowness and languishing or tolerable good spirits and sufferable pain at the tax and charge of a transient momentary sensual gratification choosing the least on the other side it is a voluntary and a resolute withdrawing from the orders and future unknown designs of providence over us when a very certain mean at least in due time of escaping or at least greatly diminishing these miseries is offered in short not to take up with a low regimen here is a plain rebellion against the orders and designs of providence manifested by nature the relations of things philosophy and experience for the mere gratification of vicious morbid appetites in a word it is deliberat suicide the greatest of all rebellion and sin      in lowness of spirits want of natural rest great anxiety involuntary dark and terrifying thoughts ideas and imaginations there are but these three infallible immediate reliefs or remedies   a vomit that can work briskly quickly and safely and experience and use can only determine what that one shall be for it is not the evacuation or quantity of the discharge that is to be so much minded as the internal action the strong convulsion the internal exercise and the cleaning squeezeing and compressing the knotted and tumified glands of the primae viae warm water chamomile or carduus tea and without drinking any thing i have often effected a present perfect relief by mere urging and tickling the throat and glands with the finger or a feather by bringing the muscles of the abdomen into repeated efforts and kecks and so have frequently discharged loads of phlegm and thin rheum which always greatly relieved and this method frequently nay sometimes daily repeated and with greater safety and less trouble pursued will answer the ends in tender and delicat constitutions under a regimen of formal and artificial vomits and i earnestly recommend the trial and frequent practice of it to all tender lowliving valetudinarians as what they will find infinite benefit from and much easier and safer than artificial apothecary vomits when they have made the practice of it easy and familiar the strong and robust whose fibers are firm and callous will require stronger for a present relief and they must be repeated whenever the symptoms exasperat   great frequent and continued exercise especially a horseback because this exercise by the frequent succussions opens all the glands of the abdomen of the mesentery and liver where the evil generally lies walking because of the universal action of all the solids and its forceing the perspiration is the best exercise to preserve health and good spirits but riding is best to recover them to this the fleshbrush for half an hour morning and night ought to be joined to uncork the plugs and concreted recrements that stop the mouths of the perspiratory glands and then washing with tepid water in winter and cold water in summer the whole skin to scour off these impurities and drying well after and having always a large broad soft girdle of leather quilted with cotton to wear about the loins like a stay or swaith to keep the viscera in their natural situations the lacteals and intestines in their natural curvatures and the bowels from being too pendulous especially in thin and wasteing persons   religiously to study and practice the lightest and the least of food they can be tolerably easy under the least unnecessary burden compressive constriction or ligature on the tender delicat fibers nerves or membranes hinders their easy pleasant and natural play and vibrations which is the immediate cause of lowness and anxiety it is like nailing or sticking down with pins or stops the play of a musical chord whence discord must necessarily ensue in short to preserve or obtain good spirits in very low cases a man must be in a constant course of selfdenial as to aliment and make as it were hunger his greatest and only pain but nothing but experience and constant observation of the juvantia and laedentia is sufficient to determine to each individual respectively how far this is to be carried prudence is the first of all natural as well as christian virtues gold may be bought too dear but wise nature always tells us how far this method ought to be carried by the intenseness of our cravings when gone too far and then a person under no unnatural or vicious passion or lunacy will obey her calls by giving her what she craves so as to make her tolerably easy but these are the most general certain antidotes against extreme lowness and anxiety known to me the reliefs of art and medicin are not my design at present here      some persons have found great relief on lowness a bad constitution and nervous distempers on change to a southern and warmer climat from a northern and colder but i never observed that benefit dureable or in any degree perfect unless the party continued all the rest of his days in that climat and country and though proper air and warmth be a most comfortable and cherishing thing to animal bodies yet it is observing the diet liveing in the manner of the country that contributes most to the cure or relief for it is well known that in warm countries and southern climats the diet there is not only exceeding spare and light but almost altogether vegetables the heat and rarefaction of the air and constant perspiration make a full high rank diet certain pain or death and even the materials of their food there the animals and vegetables are lighter and less rank and destructive in their nature and more stimulating the natives scarce ever taste fermented or strong liquors and indulging in them is the sole notorious cause of the sudden deaths of all our soldiers seamen and traders it is true eastern and southern nations use many and the highest aromatics with their vegetables and they are but dry drams of as pernicious a nature almost as our liquid ones and this is the sole cause of their unnatural lust and leachery of their acute distempers and short lives but when a valetudinary person goes to a southern country for his health and lives as he used in his northern country he rather grows worse for the climat and if recovered by the air and traveling and observing the regimen peculiar to the healthy in that climat if he returns and does not continue the regimen of diet by which he was recovered he falls back again and the second error is worse than the first and in truth to travel through or live even a few months or years in a southern climat and afterward be obliged to pass his life at home in a northern climat is but only roasting at the fire or going strait out of a very hot room into the cold air to freeze and chill the faster and more intensely for reaction is always equal to action      as to the quantity of foods of any kind strong middling or weak fittest to prolong life and prevent or cure diseases the most proper for each individual there is no possible way to determine it to any precision it must be different according to the size strength age constitution habitude acquired or hereditary distempers of each particular which are as various as their faces wise nature had so contrived us had we followed her simplicity and order in our diet that our appetites and craveings should be a sufficient rule but having by long habitudes and example spoiled corrupted and disordered her laws sensations and order she is not now in all cases sufficient to determine this affair the best rules i think a wise man can folfollow are   to use the plainest most tender least poignant and savoury meats fully dressed he can find and to abate in quantity what he is forced to increase in the quality of his food   to take the least possible he can be tolerably easy under from the pain of hunger   to observe for some time and with some care what foods in quantity and quality he is easiest under and the natural rest the natural secretions and the animal functions labor least and are most pleasantly performed under   to observe the quantity after the great meal he can apply his head his attention and his body to their proper offices with the greatest facility and pleasure under   to follow the quantity and quality of those foods that give him regularly one figured stool a day only   for one month to try double the quantity or at least one third or less more than he used of the same kinds of food and observe what difference this makes in his functions intellectual or animal and by some repeated trials of this kind summing up the whole and taking the half of this quantity divided by the number of days as the medium between the least or greatest quantity   to try by a sanctorian chair the quantity and quality of those foods that perspire the most and soonest and reduce the body to pretty near always the same weight or   lastly without care anxiety or perplexity to study and pursue the lightest and least of food he can possibly be easy under for without all doubt nature will to a man of a sober mind and in his right senses by acute and intolerable pains from hunger apprize him at least in some time if he has underdosd her so far may suffice to an honest prudent person as to the quantity of food or the materials of the curd of the blood as to the liquids or the materials of the serum i am perfectly convinced nature never intended any thing but pure water water being signaturd by its greatest fluidity and insipidity for carrying alimentary particles readily and pleasantly through all the strait meanders of animal life and having designed fermented liquors and the juices of fruits and vegetables for physic only and they are when used with intemperance or as common beverage the sole universal and adequat natural cause of most acquired distempers and waterdrinking only the proper and adequat antidote for such but if a man will drink vinous and fermented liquors then the best are those that are of a middling strength the lightest oldest and ripest which have spent or dropped their saline tartarous and grossest particles by age and maturity on which account the old rhenish or hock ripe claret or burgundy neat old port and madera will be preferable and the rich fat fiery oily and gross wines are only to be used as cordials and drams on necessity and extremity but always the least is the very best of all fermented liquors whatsoever      whoever can resolve in bad spirits a bad constitution and in advanced life to go into a regimen may i think fairly be manumitted from drugs that is from any kind of alteratives even the preparations of mercury steel antimony sulphur and all those of the ponderous and mineral kind they will only tear and rend his tender bowels and vessels and even from every sort of the violent and active kind and trust simply to nature and domestic evacuation as the symptoms exasperat viz little bleedings gentle and weak emetics stomach purges mineral waters of a proper kind gentle air and exercise and a regimen of the lightest and least no regular meals but a little at a time and oftener for as nature will not now on its decline bear the violent and active remedies without being torn to pieces so there is not sufficient time in life remaining for strong health and they must consider what nature can bear and do and follow her by their feelings rigidly and treat themselves as children the second time by giving her barely the lightest and the least she can be tolerably easy under and always endeavoring to lessen the quantity and quality of the diet as her active and digestive powers weaken and decrease for one day tolerably easy by the strength of nature only will be better than two such by the help of art for her recovery and prolonging her life      in a low regimen even when upon necessity and under prudent counsel and advice when a person has entered upon it and has continued in it for a long time they may have many plunges discouragements and exacerbations especially as the peccant matter becomes collected from the mass of blood by the greater glands and is now soliciting to be pumped off or driven out by the commonsewer besides accidents the inclemency and alterations of the seasons especially spring and autumn when animal as well as vegetable nature undergoes some notable alterations none ought to be so scrupulously nice as not at such a time to lay aside their low milk and seed or vegetable diet and take to a little white meat and fermented liquors upon nausea inappetency and transiently to brace the solids to get strength to throw off the still remaining load of morbosity and viscosity this is but like standing to take a little breath in ascending a steep mountain but then they ought as soon as this periodical paroxysm is removed by proper evacuation and this temporary braceing regimen to return to their cooling soft sweetning and thinning diet in order to purify the juices totally this interruption will only retard the cure a short time and will give strength to perfect it at last as far as the nature of things will permit for it is to be believed as a certain truth without which no patient will be encouraged to proceed that it is to a low cool thin diet alone with proper and indicated evacuation that the blood is to be at last mended and the highest health the constitution will permit is to be obtained      to conclude this tedious detail of the two animal food or fermented liquors either of any kind that is in use if my opinion were to be asked which of the two is most pernicious to animal bodies or in which of the two mistakes or excesses are most pernicious fatal and most productive of the severe distempers i would not hesitate a moment to ascribe to fermented or distilled liquors of any kind the whole blame of all or most of the painful and excruciating distempers that afflict mankind it is to it alone all our gouts stones cancers fevers high hysterics lunacy and madness are principally owing it is the true pandoras box and he who would timeously give up while he is tolerably well fermented liquors and drink nothing but pure tepid water need never seek nor want any other cure or medicin but gentle and proper evacuation occasionally be his distemper what it will he may then freely give up any concern about what he should eat let him without fear follow nature and his appetite in whatever plain meat is presented he can be in no danger from any fatal or dangerous distemper waterdrinking to those that are already tolerably well begun early at least under thirtyfive or after when no chronical hereditary mortal distemper is rooted is the true and universal panacea and the philosophers stone god has not only permitted but by a wife appointment of his providence has in many cases made animal food absolutely necessary and indispensable and for great high health and spirits warm and strong blood bodily prowess and great labor it is the only proper food but for fermented liquors i know no command counsel or example certainly wise nature who has provided liberally supplies for all our wants has furnished us none of it it is the invention of spurious and luxurious art and it is present death to many and the natural aversion of all animals who follow pure nature it certainly shortens the duration of life to all that use it even with moderation and is the alone adequat cause of all the mortal painful and atrocious distempers as a medicin present relief and as a bitter chalybeat potion on occasions and extremities it might be a tolerable medicin but as common beverage it is a slow but certain poison  for a conclusion i will from the whole set down a few aphorisms that may perhaps instruct and ease the memory of the valetudinarian  aphorism   a constant endeavor after the lightest and the least of meat and drink a man can be tolerably easy under is the shortest and most infallible mean to preserve life health and serenity  aph   he that would preserve a clear head and equal spirits must keep his stomach clean his bowels moderatly empty and uncomprest  aph   on bad nights lowness flatulence and oppression of spirits of any continuance the only certain reliefs are a small phlebotomy a gentle vomit a domestic purge rideing a horseback and a regimen of the lightest and the least persisted in  aph   small frequent phlebotomies are the quickest and most effectual mean to mend the blood and to cure cacochymy if a regimen of the lightest and least be joined  aph   gentle and repeated evacuation upwards and downwards especially and perhaps only vomits by the medicines most familiar and experienced the action and exercise of vomiting is its chief use are the surest quickest and most effectual mean to prevent or remedy the ill effects of gluttony overloading and repletion that is almost all chronical distempers provided the lightest and the least be joined afterward  aph   diseases are always to be cured by their contraries the high diet by the low the hot by the cool the sapid by the insipid the thick and gross by the thin and poor repletion by fasting inactivity by exercise health acquired and possessed lies in the middle regimen between these two extremes  aph   perfect health and good spirits depend chiefly if not only on the easy and pleasant play or performance of the animal functions viz the digestion circulation respiration perspiration muscular motion and the secretions  aph   he that would be soon well must be long sick that is treat himself as a valetudinarian in most things  aph   exercise and gentle evacuation will supply the place of abstinence and abstinence will supply the place of evacuation but the first two are still preferable because they damage the solids least  aph  0 quantity in food will supply quality and quality will supply the place of quantity but in very bad cases it is most secure to join both  aph    there is but little in a specific regimen of diet to remedy or antidot a specific distemper abstinence in general or a constant endeavor after the lightest and the least will constantly supply the place of any specific particular regimen of diet but in very bad cases a particular choice of the most specific regimen that art experience and philosophy show to be most proper is not to be neglected  aph    the regimen of diet by which one is cured of a particular distemper ought to be coninued at least in some degree especially if the person is not much under fifty else the distemper will return with more severe and worse symptoms than at first as experience has constantly showed  aph    every wise man after fifty ought to begin to lessen at least the quantity of his aliment and if he would continue free of great and dangerous distempers and preserve his senses and faculties clear to the last he ought every seven years go on abateing gradually and sensibly and at last descend out of life as he ascended into it even into the childs diet  aph    he that is old when he is young that is treats himself as a wise old man does or ought to do by great temperance air and exercise if he lives past thirtyfive will be young when he grows old in years  aph    no person of any fortune ever died or suffered acute pains or mortal distempers by the too cool too little or too insipid in diet all by the too hot high and savoury but virtue and health lie in the golden mean so difficult to be found and only to be secured by the lightest and the least a man can be tolerably easy under  aph    the eternal law of nature by intense pain in craveing and hunger will never suffer a person in his right senses to go on long obstinatly and to his hurt in the too little  aph    water pure clear and insipid is the sole beverage that can procure or continue health and a clear head being the sole fluid that will pass through the smallest animal tubes without resistance next to it are aqueous or weak fermented liquors  aph    water tepid or cold or impregnated with the specific vegetables or minerals that experience has found proper to antidot a given distemper is the true panacea in both acute and chronical distempers nature has prepared no other medicin for us but water impregnated with vegetables in their juices or natural mineral waters on the surface of the earth  aph    milk is the only food prepared by nature for young that is weak and tender animal bodies and there is no real difference between a young tender animal body and a diseased grown animal but that of the two the last is the worst but it will cost labor and patience to make milk agree in bilious cases  aph  0 milk and sweet sound blood differ in nothing but in color milk is blood which almost directly comes from the chyle into the teats of the animal and blood is milk which has gone many rounds in the circulation and is ground a little in the lungs where being mixed with the nitre of the air it receives its scarlet color it is a medium between animal and vegetable food  aph    whey sweet or medicated with the juice of any specific plant sage balm or orange or antiscorbutic vulnerary or pulmonic plants will supply the place and are preferable to most decoctions of plants infusions apozems and dietdrinks whatsoever except those of the strong detergents as horseradish mustard seed and the like where necessary  aph    goats whey being a natural infusion from gentle heat and gentle triture of the fine aromatic and nitrous vegetables on which goats feed only is one of the very best diluents detergents cleansers and sweetners of scorbutic and salin cacochymies  aph    friction morning and night and in winter washing with warm and drying before a fire and in summer with cold water is an excellent mean to facilitat and promote the perspiration to clean the cuticle and cure cutaneous uncleanness and defedations cold batheing is excellent and preferable to every washing in cases where the blood is sweet and thin the solids too lax only  aph    cincture with a broad quilted belt about the loins to keep the bowels in their natural situations and the chylous vessels in their best locality and in flabby constitutions weak bowels and atrophies is of great benefit  aph    rideing is the best of all exercises to get health and to promote the digestions especially in nervous distempers where the abdomen and the meseraic glands are principally affected but walking is best to preserve health already got because it is the most natural and the most universal promoter of all the excretions  aph    in nature or art there is no such immediate cure for low spirits anxiety and want of sleep as rideing a horseback long journies with fasting or rather a very soft light feeding with warm thin liquors at restingplaces but that the least possible that actual fainting will permit  aph    next to rideing is either a vomit or fasting almost to faintness and then only a little spiced wine and water warm and a mouthful or two of dry biscuit every  th or  th hour with continued friction with a coarse cloth warm flannel or a fleshbrush especially on the spine in faintings and extreme lowness  aph    to procure natural rest nothing is like four or five middling pills of true assafoetida with four or five grains of pure succatrine aloe taken going to bed  aph    the only way to secure tolerable spirits in very low cases is a constant endeavor to make hunger the greatest pain and to cheat the appetite and craveing with little warm light liquors at large intervals  aph  0 good hours will be always a most beneficial mean to preserve health and spirits to go to bed by ten and rise by six  aph    whosoever would preserve his health and spirits to the last even when he is in possession of it ought to pass through the great operations of physic in the spring viz to bleed vomit and purge whether he have apparent necessity or not for seurvy or scorbutic juices is the great chronical and fundamental distemper of britain all the rest are but sprouts and branches of it and therefore  aph    vomits often repeated at least as often as the symptom of any ail aggravats increases or exasperats are the sole universal antidot and panacea of britain an ailing person cannot repeat them too often they will always prove beneficial and salutary  aph    in cold feet nothing like batheing them in tepid water a little before going to bed  aph    a low diet seldom extirpats or totally eradicats any hereditary chronical distemper unless it be in the young the middlingaged or the strong and healthy who have otherwise tolerable stamina in the very puny delicat and slender in the old and far advanced in life even after fifty in the strongest it only abates the violence of their symptoms makes them less severe and the returns seldomer and only prolongs the duration of their lives  aph    the natural diseases of the poor and necessitous are generally owing to a bad unwholesome unsound diet and the want of due care of the other nonnaturals cleanness and shelter and are generally cured by their contraries viz a good wholesome plain diet and a due cleanness shelter from the inclemency of seasons and an easy mind  aph    if it happen that the poor and those having no property of their own by stealth robbery or unlawful means enter on and pursue the luxury of the rich and opulent not having the other necessaries and conveniences of life neglecting or not being able to afford or being inured to want the necessary care of the other nonnaturals their diseases are then the most atrocious painful and miserable of any which is the reason that the acute and contagious distempers begin first spread faster and are more mortal among them than those of the better sort  aph    diet a proper well regulated and parsimonious cool diet is the far greatest article of long life and health but the other nonnaturals are to be carefully attended to and guarded against else it will not avail alone which is the case in monasteries deserts and long sea voyages  discourse i philosophical conjectures about the nature and qualities of the original animal body and of its progressive state in its several stages of existence   cor xv    there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body discourse i philosophical conjectures about the nature and qualities of the original animal body and of its progressive state in its several stages of existence    there are animalcules which being endued with life and motion must consequently perform animal functions that are less than any object perceptible by our senses  this is beyond all doubt from microscopical discoveries in pepper water spring water vinegar sperm the urine and fluid juices of almost all morbid animals and mr lewenhoeck has shown that there are animals many thousands of which would not equal a visible grain of sand and that there are tubes in animals of which several hundreds would not equal a common hair and the smallest animals to carry on life must necessarily have all the chief organical parts of the greatest animals at least analogically     an organized animal body could not possibly at first have been formed nor can its functions be now accounted for or explained by mere mechanism or the laws of motion which now obtain without the sagacity and agency of a primary selfexistent cause nor can the functions be continued without the superintendance and influence of a selfmoving selfacting secondary agent informing and acting on it continually  this is not only demonstrable from the inertia and passivity of matter from the obvious contradiction of a perpetual circular motion which is the case of all animals the motion of the heart and the muscular force of the blood vessels being the cause of the circulation and the circulation being the cause efficient or occasional of the motion of the heart and of the muscular fibers but that mere mechanism acts only according to the surfaces of bodies and yet it is probable that animated bodies act according to their solidities and that every atom of an animated body is constantly in action for the preservation and wellbeing of the whole machin and also for exerting that particular animal function which its figure situation and use in the animal requires besides natural and simple mechanism can act only from one center of motion or impulse in one single direction only whereas curvature requires different direction every moment and consequently various centres of motion or impulse now if we consider the varieties of motions and directions in the joints and muscles of animals but especially the infinite variety of curvatures in the arteries veins and nerves and particularly in the glands we will readily perceive it to be utterly impossible and a contradiction that an animal body could have been at first formed without a supramechanical organisation or that it should continue to live and perform animal functions without the continual agency and superintendance of a secondary selfactive and selfmotive principle     it is highly probable that the first elements of bodies or the least and last particles of matter are solid hard and indivisible by any finite power or force whatever because by friction collision and use they are not worn out and lose not their original figure and size since they are still fit for the ends and purposes of their first institution     god and nature do nothing in vain and since body must necessarily be always endued with some figure being neither infinitely small nor infinitely great where figure may possibly be thought to evanish the three most simple figures of all solid bodies viz spheres cubes and equilateral triangular prisms might possibly at first have made all the diversities of the primitive original particles of specific bodies these figures with the particular laws of attraction and union thence arising together with different diameters and various combinations may have made all the differences of bodies     the several elements or the several aggregats or masses of the different original particles now commonly called elements as water air light salt and earth have each some specific qualities which distinguish them from each other and which they never entirely lose in any state whatsoever but which may be swallowed up and rendered unactive when blended and combined with other particles as they are in the integral particles of natural bodies as these are constituted in this our system  water has its incompressibility the rotundity or at least the spheroidity of its constituent particles its transparency or refractive power its admission of salts into its substance without greatly increasing its dimensions at least in a certain quantity and proportion nay sometimes lessening them  air has its elasticity its repulsive force its acid and nitrous spirit and its vivifying quality to fire and animal life  light has its activity velocity tenuity of its particles and its fitts of easy transmission and reflection and probably a greater gravity or byas on one side than the other of its particles  salt has its solubility in water only its penetrating virtue on bodies and its stimulating quality on animal fibers a greater degree and particular law of the attractive force of its particles on one another whereby its clusters are generally of regular and nearly similar figures terminated by plain surfaces  earth has its greater gravity loose connection and less attraction of its particles its friability and irregular figure being probably the ramenta or abrasions of the other elements  perhaps the primitive animal body might consist of the first pure specific and sublimed elements harmoniously combined and elegantly ranged in their original natures of which our present patched gross bodies are only the confused dense kind as our present globe of earth its water salt air light and earth are but probably the putrified carcass of the primitive planet but both may continue to have some remote analogy to one another as a carcass has to a living beauty or an egyptian mummy to a living cleopatra  according to this analogy then may not the matter and substance of the original firstcreated vehicle or animal body be of such elements of the original kind of a celestial and spiritual nature so to speak infinitely more subtle and refined than the matter of light more elastick than the finest ether and whose particles might have had as it were an infinite power of attraction even at finite distances and consequently might pervade all gross bodies of our system without resistance or pain     on such an analogous supposition or conjecture the fineness elasticity and law of attraction in the particles of such a spiritual animal matter might admit of degrees as all finites must necessarily do and the degree might be in proportion to the natural and moral powers of the spirit conjunctly  it seems highly probable that all finite created spirits have and must have material vehicles of purity and fineness in proportion to their natural and moral powers conjunctly not only to limit and direct their energy and efficiency but to commerciate with other animals and inanimat created natures none but the supreme spirit the father of spirits being absolutely and entirely an infinitely pure immaterial spirit acting by his power and energy with equal facility at all possible distances and the vehicles or original bodies of all created spirits might possibly be of some such nature as this described matter which may be called spiritual matter or element     this spiritual animal body at first divinely organized may be rolled up folded together and contracted in this present state of its duration into an infinitely small punctum saliens into a miniature of a miniature in infinitum lodged in the loins of the male of all animals for it is highly probable the female was but a secondary intention or a buttress to a falling edifice and proceeding in a diverging series and progressive gradation that in due time it may be fit to be nourished and increased by the juices of the proper female and thereby enabled to bear the coarseness and injuries of this ruinous globe and gross element to which it is to be condemned for a certain period     it would seem that this spiritual body of this refined subtle matter divinely organized by an infinite degree of attraction to its particular informing spirit and by an individual fitness and congruity to the specific immaterial inhabitant is so intimately united with it in its original creation that they are never after to be separated whatever future state they may go into by any finite power whatsoever no more than the firmness and solidity of the primitive original atoms of of matter can be broken or divided by any natural power so that in whatever afterstates it may exist or whatever plaster or vehicle of a denser and coarser element may be superinduced the spiritual inhabitant and the primitive creationbody go inseparably together and as this refined spiritual body might have been the creation primitive body so it may purified developd and mundifyd become the last resurrection and glorified body     it seems highly probable analogous to the other appearances of nature and congruous to rational agency if we suppose the first being rational intelligent and wise acting with designs and purposes that the confining of intelligent or sentient beings for so long a time to so dark and strait a prison in the origin seeds and eggs of animals on this ruinous globe must have been for some wise and good end and purpose in gods moral government of his int ligent and sentient creatures perhaps for punishment correction progressive purification and painful sensation  a body have thou given me was said of our savior to make him passive feeling and experience being the most effectual mean to admonish and teach finite wandering and heedless beings at least this seems one part of the design    0 that in our present scene of existence our natural powers are tied down sopited and fettered by the manner of our origination and coming into rational life is selfevident the wisest and best man on the earth as to rational and intelligent living was first like a mere vegetable or plant afterward a mere animal or brute and but at last very late and only for a short time the rational and complete man and this truth might be further illustrated and even demonstrated from the qualities of matter which are contrary to and destructive of the qualities of spirit now this progression must have some end and purpose in the intention of a wise and good cause and may suppose that by the abuse of liberty and idolatrising the creatures the moral powers  justice goodness and truth being erased and cancelled in the spirit the most effectual mean and expedient to restore them was to tie down contract and sopite the natural powers of the soul  living perceiving and willing to a level and equality with these defaced moral powers that by the use of the proper means they might without letts or obstacles from these natural powers gradually improve and grow up together in the same degree and order at least this may be one not improbable end and design of providence in this progressive growth of the natural powers of the human spirit since it is evident in fact that where the natural and moral powers of the soul rise to any degree this progression is observed      the works of god are without repentance the true unbodied spiritual substance in intelligent and sentient natures being an emanation efflux ray or spark or if i durst use such figurative language an infinitesimal miniature of his substance and of his living perceiving and willing or whole nature who is selfexistent after flowing from him can no more perish or cease to live perceive and will than necessary selfexistence can cease to be so that living perceiving and willing i e cogitation can never be totally extinct in any intelligent and sentient being never in the root faculty or power though they may be and often are in the acts like fire in ashes annihilation is contradictory to and destructive of infinite wisdom and power and unworthy of infinite perfection requiring the same omnipotence that creation does reaction being always equal to action and selfactivity being an infinitesimal miniature of necessary existence and omnipotence the first being might as justly be supposed capable of destroying himself as his miniature images besides it were neither wise nor good even in a man to suffer the heir apparent of a great kingdom to destroy or annihilate himself if it were possible by correction restraints time and due culture to fit him for the possession and sure every thing that is wise and good is possible to the best of beings these natural powers may be sopited contracted and hindered from issuing into action as we see they are in sound sleep in some diseases syncopes and many other cases by obstacles of and resistances from gross matter by bonds fetters and chains made of these our elements and the coarser and straiter these fetters and chains are the straiter and closer the prison may be and the weaker and fewer may be the acts of the natural powers till this prison become almost dead matter and a dungeon or a mere point now infinite wisdom and power being as it were necessitated by the infinite benevolence of his nature to lay out all the energy of his omnipotence and omniscience to recover and restore his miniature images consistent with the harmony of his own attributes and with the usage of their natural powers neither of which he could force or offer violence to seems to have contrived this wonderful expedient viz to tie down sopite and restrain the acts and exertion of the natural powers of lapsed sentient and intelligent beings for a determined space of time by chains and fetters made of the elements of this ruinous globe in order to punish and purify them and so to vindicate his sovereignty to repair the indignity done to his purity to warn and deter the other orders of his standing hierarchies and at the same time by lessening the strength and activity of the natural powers in their full vigor to allow freedom and uninterruption from them for the restoration and advancement of the moral powers      were the natural powers of a free lapsed and intelligent being greatly and eminently higher than the moral powers in the present state they must necessarily clash with interrupt and greatly hinder the acquisition of the moral powers for example unerring evidence irrefragable demonstration absolute certainty must necessarily interfere with humility dependence resignation faith and trust and consequently with all merit gratitude and love what faith what resignation what merit is there in believing the propositions of euclid in this we are as much passive in our immaterial principle as in our material we trust our lives and fortunes to a seaman or coachman not on demonstration and absolute certainty but because we believe them to be honest able persons in their several vocations faith and hope must eternally exclude mathematical certainty perfect demonstration and absolute certainty would exclude choice election and preference in finite dependent creatures it is probability alone verisimilitude analogy and final causes or revelation that can be the proper evidence to produce faith and to give merit choice election and preference to the actions of finite lapsed and dependent creatures and this whole present scene of providence and the darkness obscurity and seeming deformity on the face of nature and the works of an allwise allgood being seem only contrived and calculated to preserve the natural powers of lapsed finite intelligences inviolate and at the same time to harmonise with the divine attributes for had the natural powers continued in their perfection and full extent while the moral powers were cancelled and extinguished they could never have been restored consistent with the harmony of the divine attributes and the natural unperishable and inviolable powers of free intelligences liberty to do good or evil preexistence abused universal restoration and final confirmation consistent with the harmony of the divine attributes and the natural powers of lapsed intelligences well explained will remove all the possible difficulties and obscurity in nature providence and revelation      to comprehend ascertain and demin with precision and mathematical or metaphysical certainty the real nature or substance of any thing small or great is incompatible with finitude and the sole incommunicable attribute of the deity and if lapsed finite creatures such as we of the human race are supposed to be could attain to it it would destroy our liberty to act whose very essence consists in doing any thing or its contrary and determine us infallibly to one tenor of action as certainly as one impulse or one center of motion in a body would determine it to one direction or in a right line and consequently would counteract our recovery and restoration and render it impossible and the most perfect cherubim in heaven to perpetuate and eternise its happiness must necessarily have made a surrendry and sacrifice of its will to infinite goodness and its understanding to infinite wisdom and though all that are admitted to the beatific vision see god face to face or see as they are seen yet it can be only pro modulo suo and though the faith and trust necessary to us here in our uncertain lapsed probatory state when we come to glory shall be done away yet naked faith or a faith founded solely on the ipse dixit of infinite perfection as well as pure love or love of infinite perfection for itself or for its own amiability is indispensibly necessary even in heaven to perpetuate and eternise the felicity of the most perfect seraphim as our bodily eyes are utterly incapable of perceiving the real and positive magnitude dimensions and distance of material objects nothing but their relative ones so is the most sublime and perfect created understanding for ever incapable to discover and comprehend the precise nature essence or qualities of the first being or of any of his lowest works objects are perceived or comprehended not according to their own absolute precise and positive nature by created understandings of any order and degree but respectively and relatively according to the degree and extent of their faculties and yet a miniature may be truly a picture and as just an one in small as one at length and between the first being and the absolute nature of his works as conceived and comprehended by creaturely faculties there will be allways the proportion of infinite to finite and when jesus christ said he was the truth the absolute truth he as really affirmed his divinity as when he said he that has seen me has seen the father or i and the father are one for the absolute precise metaphysical truth of real positive things is inseparable from the divine nature and he could not be honest and sincere even as a creature if in such a momentuous and and fundamental point he could lead creatures into a mistake an honest person would have trembled to come so near plain blasphemy and yet he says his words are spirit and truth but i beg pardon for this digression out of the sphere of philosophy      the subjecting material bodies the outward creation and perhaps spiritual natures to general and invariable laws the continuing these under the lapse which were and must have been established in the state of innocence i say the continuance of these seems to be another expedient of infinite wisdom to preserve liberty in the recovery of the moral powers of lapsed intelligences and to conciliate the harmony of the divine attributes without these general laws discoverable only to any degree by just observation calm attention accurate experiment extensive induction and calculation there could be no room for correction amending for choice and election or for moral good and evil but things would happen in the intellectual and moral system as they are supposed to happen in the natural system on the epicurean scheme by chance casualty fits and starts or fatal necessity which is absolutely to deny the first being to be a rational intelligent and free agent for infinite wisdom can do nothing but for wise ends and purposes and must contrive means which have a natural and necessary tendency and fitness for these ends if these means be not seen by us or being in some measure seen may seem not to attain their ends it is because being finite lapsed creatures our narrow capacities cannot reach them or because all the conditions requisite to make them effectual were not present in a particular case for infinite wisdom must act uniformly with order number weight and measure all which nothing but general laws and canons can effect as is well known to geometers and plainly exemplified in the universal canons of algebra if these general laws be duly investigated cautiously guarded and all the necessary conditions be taken in they can never fail of obtaining their end and effect unless infinite wisdom and power suspend them for a limited time to manifest his power or for moral ends and purposes or unless they are kept from attaining their natural ends directly by the voluntary and free agency of imperfect human intelligences      the only thing worthy of a true philosopher is with attention to draw up and collect as many as he possibly can of these general laws of the divine agency in the natural moral and intellectual world for his own use or that of his fellowintelligences for without all doubt they must be some few of the most obvious of the laws of infinite wisdom laid down as the plan by which all his works of wonder were at first formed and are still governed and though in him all this great affair was but one single act of wisdom and power yet in regard to us his infinitesimal miniatures now in a lapsed state they must be considered by parts in different acts and divided sections and viewed separately in proportion to our weak and limited faculties for certainly general laws and universal rules are the method of divine agency and of his wise providence      the general laws of motion the laws of simple mechanism the laws of refraction and reflection and many more such general laws both in natural philosophy civil society and human policy are pretty well known and adjusted in all the polished nations of the world and it is not improbable such general laws may obtain in other systems at least analogically and they actually do so as far as our observation reaches and it is very probable that similar and analogous general laws have place in the moral spiritual and intellectual world for god is the same yesterday today and for ever his nature attributes and agency uniform and since he acts by general laws in material agency it is highly probable and conformable to his infinite wisdom to act in the same uniform manner in all his operations ad extra and as far as just observations have been made and wellgrounded conclusions drawn by analogy we shall find it so in all the systems moral spiritual or divine though these last have been but little studied and timorously applied to by persons of a proper spirit and genius out of dread of the odious designation of enthusiasm or superstition but future ages may perhaps get over this terror for the method has a solid foundation in the nature of things      these general laws of the divine economy in creation and providence or the rules of consummate wisdom and fitness which the supreme being has chalked out and laid down are without all doubt inexhaustible and incomprehensible to such an order of beings as we are in our present state and undiscoverable to any degree of perfection for who can search out the almighty to perfection perhaps the discovery of them may be a part of the happiness and perfection of another state of existence and some small portion of the employment of happy contemplative spirits in other regions and there the works of the lord will appear wonderful to them that delight therein for if the first being be rational intelligent wise and good as doubtless he is infinitely so there must of necessity be in all his works conduct and actions ad extra one perpetual analogy and one continued harmony through the whole and in every single part each individual organ and law must be fitted to this great end viz the perfection of the whole and of each part and he who considers the economy of nature providence and restoration with greatest attention and humility will most clearly discern this wisdom fitness and divine order in them      suppose an infinitely wise powerful and good being did intend to produce something new that he had no pattern or model of before him as the first intelligent cause could not possibly have in creation as an artificer for example to descend the lowest in a similitude he could only express in sensible images the genius nature and ideas of his own mind and fit the parts and organs of such a machine to the end and use for which it was designed with number weight and measure and so to compare great things with small supreme wisdom having nothing but himself his own beneficent nature and attributes before creation to copy forth and represent could in all his works of wonder delineate nothing but his own substance nature wisdom goodness justice and truth so that all nature all creation all the worlds the material moral and spiritual can possibly be nothing else but the supreme immense and infinitely perfect being displayed portrayed and made sensible and perceptible mundus universus nihil aliud est quam deus explicitus said a learned man to think otherwise is a sort of blasphemy and degrading of infinite wisdom and perfection below finite lapsed human intelligences for there is no possible work of any man but which in some degree is a picture of himself of his own idea or of the constitution and complexion of his mind at that time      if then there be a perpetual analogy running through all the works of god natural moral and spiritual if all his workings ad extra be representations pictures and hieroglyphics stronger or weaker more general or more particular of his own nature complexion and attributes if the material inanimated system of outward things being contrived with infinite fitness justness propriety and delicacy do represent his infinite wisdom and power in a more sensible yet in a darker and weaker manner and if the economy of his universal and particular providence and the amazing economy of the restoration of every individual lapsed being be stronger and more irresistible evidences and representations of his infinite penetration so to speak benevolence and power then it must be acknowledged that through all his works there runs one perpetual progression one continual analogy and uninterrupted harmony of his own nature wisdom and power and that as proportion is the medium and true logic of material natures and beings so analogy is the true key and analysis of spiritual natures and qualities and as the data of the first is in sensation or the notices from our senses or accurate experiment so the data of the last is in attention and reflection upon our own spiritual natures and their operations and experience of the qualities sentiments and passions of our own hearts and souls and carrying these to as great a height as possible for i can conceive no clearer or more distinct manner to give a child or an ignorant person an idea though low and imperfect of the first being than to tell him he is like the soul or living nature of the best and most amiable person he ever knew infinitely exalted without his imperfections but who has life and being from himself only whereas all his creatures are emanations from him and the works of his power and what is this but a true analogy just such a one as when we give an infant or ignorant person an idea of the sea by showing him the nearest great lake and telling him that the sea is of the same nature but vastly bigger      it is plain from the natural civil and sacred history of the whole human race from the visible and perceptible state of our globe its surrounding atmosphere kindred planets and their influences upon ours that pain suffering and misery is as natural and necessary to us here in this present state as existence is it is utterly unavoidable but in degree none ever lived but felt it it some kind or degree or other the extreme tenderness and delicacy of our lumbaginous and spermatic state subject us to the distempers and sufferings arising from the indiscretions and bodily diseases of our parents the weakness and helplessness of childhood and infancy expose us to innumerable accidents and distempers the imprudent and improper nourishment in quantity or quality given us by our mothers or nurses bring naturally on us suffering and misery the grossness coarseness and inclemency of the element we live and breathe in mechanically infects us with its noxious and deleterious qualities ignorance bad example contagious custom and popular errors and prejudices continue the hazards and dangers of childhood strong passions and appetites a wrong turn of head or heart a corrupt and degenerate age strengthen and confirm our miseries and misfortunes in youthhood disappointments misfortunes cares want of or the bad usage of the necessaries and conveniences of life luxury or intemperance famine or scarcity epidemical diseases or unforeseen accidents one or other or perhaps all together make the complexion of manhood and old age the cardinal disease of human life finishes the dark scene of human misery with perpetual aches sores and infirmities of body and mind a more sensible dotage and childhood a taedium vitae with a desire of dissolution which is yet accompanied with a terrible dread of it all these conclude this climax and progression of misery through which the very best and wisest that lasts out the natural duration of life must pass for his punishment expiation and purification not to mention the remorse and internal crucifixion of those who feel a law in their members warring against the law of their minds in a perpetual strife and conflict it is only in and through the economy of the restoration by the knowledge of the gospel that these natural necessary and unavoidable pains punishments and miseries can be turned may be reckoned and are really mercies blessings fatherly corrections lose their stings and become righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost    0 pain punishment and suffering then would seem to be a natural necessary and as it were a mechanical mean of expiation purification and perfection to all sentient and intelligent beings in this present state of existence which virtue attention and care can only lessen but which none can totally but only in a small degree avoid if not by and through the means just now mentioned as rubbing hard bodies against one another is the only method to polish and finish them and the harder and longer the friction the finer the polish and the more perfect the figure so pain in sentient and intelligent beings arises from resistance to action or from reaction which in spiritual as well as material agency is always equal and contrary to action sentient beings naturally necessarily and as it were mechanically recede from and exert a principle of resistance and reaction to the cause of pain intelligent beings caeteris paribus necessarily fly from it with greater velocity from the united force of sensation and reflection sensation and perception begin the aversion and reluctance to the cause or occasion of pain and reflection turns it into an abhorrence and detestation      consciousness of the reasons and effects seems in no wise absolutely necessary toward purification in general at least toward the first degrees of it as we see in brutes children and idiots pain and punishment in such a degree and often repeated will naturally bring them to abstain from that for which they suffer consciousness of the end and design of it seems only necessary to accelerate perfect and turn into a habit the aversion and abhorrence of what has caused pain and to strengthen that habit into a second nature as wood is made straight first by softening it by fire and then keeping it by cords and weights in a situation contrary to its curvature pain and punishment soften and melt down the subject consciousness fixes and hardens it and gives it an habitual contrary nature consciousness attends single acts only and not habits when the habit is perfected consciousness vanishes and dies away as a perfect musician while playing on an instrument reflects not on single strokes distinctly so that consciousness seems necessary as a check or bar to prevent relapses and seldom takes place till the end and design of punishment is in some degree obtained      from what has been said it is evident that this our planet and its appendages is really and literally a prison or gaol a place of banishment of pains and punishment for a certain period of time to lapsed sentient and intelligent beings like siberia among the ruffians the bastille or the pierre incise with the french or the plantations or newgate among us and the inhabitants of both kinds sentient and intelligent are without a figure prisoners slaves and felons under a state of expiation and purification our whole creation our entire system in regard to our defaced and spoilt planet labors like slaves at the oar is in travail in a perpetual fermentation and effervescence as in a malignant fever working for a crise and delivery some individuals may be delivered sooner some later according as their expiation and purification is perfected and at last the whole system and all its inhabitants must naturally and necessarily but harmoniously or analogically and according to general laws undergo some great and violent crise and an universal jaildeliver will be brought about but when and how this will be accomplished is beyond conjecture a thousand years are but as a day here and the ways of the almighty are past finding out it would seem as if the only problem or difficulty to speak so in regard to omnipotence where no real difficulty can happen worthy of infinite wisdom to solve were to recover perfect and establish in perpetual and unrelapsing order and purity free and lapsed intelligent beings consistent with the harmony of his own attributes and the natural powers with which he has endued them how infinite wisdom and power will bring this about we can only conjecture in a few general hints from such of his general laws as are obvious from final causes which are plain and must include some part of the ends in rational agency and from dark sketches of the analogy of things not impossibly thus      an infinitely wise good and powerful being having created this system we cannot suppose but it must have been as perfect and blissful as its nature could admit and his sentient intelligent creatures as happy as their natures and order could allow and that he must have furnished them with means and power to perpetuate if not increase this perfection and happiness but from the very nature and essence of liberty whoever has a power to continue or increase in a state must also have a power to fall back or decrease whatever is finite must necessarily be fallible now suppose such finite fallible beings actually lapsed the same wise and good being must have ordered things so not only that they should recover and rise again but that their fall and lapse should at last be a mean not only to strengthen confirm and fix them in happiness ever after and this seems the only mean by which fallible free lapsed creatures once actually fallen could be brought to an illapsing state of stability but even to increase the degree of their happiness and perfection and this i think would not only be the full and plenary solution of this infinitely difficult problem but one worthy of its allwise and allpowerful author only and this he has effected i think by these three expedients or means   by continuing general laws of agency in material moral and spiritual actions plainly intimating that the concurrence of the same causes and conditions will always produce the same effects and so leaving room for consideration amendment improvement choice and the discernment of moral good and evil and thus securing liberty and the other natural powers of lapsed intelligences   by tying down sopiting and suspending the natural powers of the soul for so long a time as is its duration from the first original male till the bonds and chains by which their exertion is restrained be broken and untyed by death that during this time the benefit acquired by the progressive parentage if they happen to return to order and habits of virtue or have their moral powers recovered may operate on these infinitesimal miniatures by mending their natures that they themselves may have time given to recover into order and that the interruption from the natural powers arrived at their perfection might not prevent the acquisition and recovery of the moral powers and   by the economy of redemption by a savior which doubtless was projected before the creation of the world or this system and when the proper disposition to receive it and to reap the benefit of it is acquired and which may in some time or place explicitly or implicitly be revealed to finish the work of restoration but that not being my province in a philosophical disquisition i proceed      it is the grossest absurdity and contradiction to suppose that an infinitely wise and beneficent being would make either sentient or intelligent beings suffer merely for sufferings sake he must have had just good and kind reasons for this his strange work and since it is certain that both sentient and intelligent beings do and must unavoidably suffer and are in a state of punishment misery and banishment here it necessarily follows that they are in a state of expiation purification and progressive perfection in their respective orders and will at last be set free made happy and perfected and confirmed in that state for ever omnipotence surely can and infinite goodness i hope will do all this      if all is not deceit and illusion it must be evident to a demonstration that nothing imperfect or unhappy in its order can come out of the hands of infinite perfection and yet it is fact that all sentient and intelligent beings here are universally more or less miserable and imperfect and that there never was any human creature in his right senses which in a whole duration of human life felt not and thought not himself unhappy miserable and imperfect at least for some time if not for the most of his rational life and wished not himself earnestly better wiser more perfect and happy it is impossible that infinite wisdom and goodness can punish sentient and intelligent creatures or make them miserable but for some wise and beneficent end and purpose from whence it will be evident to a rational person that of necessity there must have been a state of existence prior to this present wherein all those sentient and intelligent beings while in a collective mass which have been or shall be on this globe had misbehaved rebelled and run into disorder probably by idolatrising creatures and self and preferring them to the creator and the account of this rebellion and lapse in revelation may refer only to the last scene or act in the tragedy or the new modelling this secondary state or partially lapsed system when the slightest trial of faith and obedience was made for certainly nemo repent fit turpissimus finite creatures can naturally acquire habits of virtue and vice or indeed of any kind only by degrees or single acts repeated certain consciousness or clear distinct knowledge of this preexistent state would only feed idle curiosity and might hinder and counteract that implicit trust dependence and absolute resignation in every thing so absolutely necessary to relative perfection and happiness for the point in view of infinite perfection is to bring all the finite sentient and intelligent creatures to an absolute voluntary surrendry and trust of themselves and every thing relating to them in time and eternity to his will and pleasure implicitly nothing less being sufficient to establish and perpetuate the divine sovereignty harmonise his attributes and eternise the peace happiness and relative perfection of universal nature which different willing would eternally confound and perplex anew and bring on a second or perpetuate the present lapse      it is not impossible that there are other states mansions and probatory celestial regions proper and peculiar to the several imperfect degrees of the moral faculties of spiritual intelligences with their creationbodies or vehicles according to the several remaining degrees of imperfection even almost in infinitum in an ascending or descending progression infinite wisdom and goodness may have appointed in general a certain limited period beyond which the incrustation of their creationbodies cannot last things being in such a state but the actual approach may be quicker or slower according to certain terms and conditions which we know to be the case of our present mortal tabernacles and according to the bad or good usage of our liberties in the use of the means afforded us for acquiring the moral virtues and affixing the moral powers in confirmed habits we may ascend into more pure more happy and more perfect regions or descend into more gross miserable and dark dungeons almost in infinitum but it would also seem that sentient and intelligent creatures could suffer pain and misery only to a certain finite and limited degree though the time may be eternal all spirits being immortal by nature all the activities and passivities of such beings being necessarily finite and limited and when they come to that point they must necessarily return wish for deliverance cry for mercy pity and freedom and endeavor it with the whole natural powers of their spirits and to this point only it would seem an infinitely wise beneficent and powerful being can intend to bring his lapsed wandering miniature creatures now under the gospel and that he should be ready to receive them into mercy and allow them the means for restoring and recovering their lapsed moral powers but how long time it may require to bring them to this absolutely necessary point no reason or philosophy whether an indefinite that is a creaturely or relatively infinite time can determine and revelation has not made it plain and explicit but on the contrary has left it not only dubious but seems to point otherwise to be sure not before all are brought to this indispensable point of returning the economy satisfaction and sufferings of the godman jesus christ could be only sufficient to render that expiation and restoration of the moral power in a finite time which in its own nature and the nature of god and of his purity must have been infinite and eternal the repairing the indignity and affront done to his sovereignty and purity and the deterring his other standing creatures from lapse and rebellion is not perhaps left in their power to prevent that may be done by the necessary and unavoidable pains and sufferings they must undergo from the painful and leprous incrustation of the several elements they must pass through their returning into order their acquisition of the moral powers of the soul and fixing them in these and consequently in permanent happiness entirely depends on themselves and the use of the means afforded      it is no easy matter to form any precise limited idea or notion of substance either material or spiritual all we certainly know of either is that they exist are realities and are the base or subject of real qualities but we can no more penetrat into the substratum or support of these qualities by the natural activity of our spirits than our eyes can see objects at a certain distance such is the nature frame and limitation of our order and rank of natural powers we certainly know that material substance is the substratum of extension impenetrability passivity and figure and spiritual substance of living perceiving and willing that is of cogitation or thinking and also of beginning motion in bodies and giving them a particular direction the aggregate or sum of all these respective qualities most of which are contrary to the others may be bound together or united by some bond of union which we shall never have any direct or immediate conception of till we throw off this material incrustation that intangles and fetters the full exercise and penetration of our natural powers and therefore if we dropped both substances as unknown and unknowable things at present or rather if we supposed both only mere capacities recipients canals or passive subjects of contrary qualities as they flow or are derived from the primary source and selfexistent cause of all activity qualities and realities whose whole end and use of these capacities was to receive and contain these qualities limiting contrary and destructive of each other respectively or lastly if as geometers use the method we make the one positive the other negative this way of considering this dark subject might perhaps throw some light on it and then imagined that matter or body was analogous to but yet nowise the same with but quite contrary though not contradictory to spirit infinitely condensed concentred or incrassated and that spiritual substance was analogous to matter infinitely rarefied refined or sublimed then in the geometrical manner of considering such respective qualities and their subject body infinitely rarefied refined and sublimed would at last terminat in limited space or expansion and limited space or expansion infinitely condensed contracted and inspissated would end in solid indivisible points or monads the common idea of the component particles of body and yet that body should be rarefied into space or space condensed into body is an absolute contradiction and impossibility only this manner in which geometers consider infinitely little or infinitely great quantities is here suggested as an illustration of material and spiritual substance so difficult to be explained but we not being able to conceive or comprehend infinitude or infinite agency its effects and consequences it may perhaps be said that this is only explaining one obscurity by a greater it may be so all then we are absolutely certain of is that these essential qualities of matter and spirit respectively viz in matter extension impenetrability divisibility mobility passivity and figure and in spirit living perceiving willing selfactivity selfmobility and the power of beginning motion and giving direction to bodies must necessarily be uniform and always the same in degree whatever state or circumstances they may be in these respective substances are always in their own nature and essence so contrary and destructive of one another in their qualities that they become a perpetual bar obstruction and obstacle to the exertion of these their essential qualities they are not indeed contradictory or destructive of one anothers qualities in every degree they are not incompatible and unallyable as we know by fact but they are contrary and one degree of the qualities of the one destroys a relative equal or proportional degree of the qualities of the other and the sum total of these qualities in the one destroys the sum total of the qualities of the other equally or proportionally like light and darkness and an infinite degree of the one may sopite or totally obstruct the sensible actions of the other though not annihilat or absolutely destroy the other in its root or nature but infinitude being above our capacities we can only speak of the effects of their contrariety and opposition in their finite degrees and pronounce nothing of the effects of infinite operations only we are certain that no less than an infinite power and operation in the one can totally extinguish and annihilat the nature and operations of the other reaction being always contrary and equal to action we may have a fine illustration and analogous resemblance of this infinite contrarv action from the nature of an infinite converging series in which from the next immediate step in the progression by passing through infinitely little of that order the terms from positive become negative and likewise from some particles of matter which after having got without their sphere from attractive become repulsive in respect to a particular center these hints are far from an affirming or any endeavor to prove that matter is only infinitely condensed spirit and spirit only infinitely refined matter as to their several substances for the fact i think false impossible and contradictory for matter however refined and sublimed is still matter and has the opposite qualities to spirit and have their essential qualities in direct contrariety and were it otherwise in this manner of illustrating the subject the proof were absolutely impossible because the effects of infinite power and agency are known and knowable by him only whose attributes are infinite power and might if the proposition and effect was true and real no finite agency could effect it nor finite understanding evince it but these instances are adducd only as an illustration to remove the seeming shocking absurdity and terror in most good persons minds from affirming any resemblance or analogy between material and spiritual substances for these evidently show that similar and analogous effects are realities in the nature of things though their manner and process be inconceiveable to us finite beings and also as much as in me lies to take off any mistakes and misapprehension as if i advanced any thing in the philosophic explication of these mysteries of nature inconsistent with revelation or religion as the reverend dr brown bishop of cork has done in his divine analogy not fully having understood my manner of explaining the subject or perhaps i had not made my meaning sufficiently clear and plain as the subject is in itself almost inexplicable and ought to be guarded with all possible precision if at all handled      in my poor way of conceiving and conjecturing from the obvious appearances in nature subjected to sense from the final causes the supreme rational being may possibly have in such external operations from the analogy carried from the things that are seen to those that are invisible and only intelligible the most probable and satisfactory account that can be found of the economy and plan of the restoration of finite lapsed intelligences seems to be this at least these may possibly be some of the prominent lines of this plan some finite free intelligences of the several orders in the living hierarchies having by the abuse of their liberty and committing idolatry by too inordinate commerce with the creatures and habitually turning away from their source the creator destroyed and cancelled the moral powers of their spiritual natures infinite wisdom and power by the necessity of his beneficent nature employing the whole force of his omnipotence and omniscience to restore and recover them without committing violence on their natural powers or on the harmony of his own attributes first ties down and contracts their natural powers with chains of gross matter from a purposely or mechanically ruined and defaced elementary globe such as our present habitation is chains which the natural powers of the spirit are necessarily obliged to endeavor to be unloosing all the time from the original creation of this gross body during which time means opportunity and leisure is allowed for the acquisition and restoration of the moral powers as felons and robbers are tamed and mended by working in the mines and tugging at the oar by the toil labor and suffering from this working off and melting down the gross and leprous plaster superinduced on the primitive creationbody by fileing purifying and breaking these chains which fetter the activity and free agency of the natural powers of the soul on this creationbody first reparation and an amend honorable is made to infinite purity and sovereignty and the bad example to other intelligences removed and in the mean time outward and inward means may be offered and bestowed by external providence suprahumane and imperceptible aid and grace and the light and internal operation of the divine word and reason the messiah for recovering the defaced moral powers of the soul some are under this operation a shorter some a longer time according to the wisdom and designs of the sovereign reason and the mansion they are to fill in the new jerusalem even till the last scene which in the nature of gross corruptible matter can last but a finite time either in the nature of the elementary planet itself with its appendages or in the incrustation on the primitive creationbodies made of this elementary matter which must crumble and dissolve into dust within certain limits of time by the established law of nature the first possibly from the expense and fixation of water as sir isaac newton insinuates and the other necessary fluids the others for want of nutrition and chylification and both by natural and general laws but still within certain limits less than real infinite but both must at last be perfectly purified the earth and its appendages possibly by an universal conflagration the particular gross plaistering by being dissolved into its original dust that the primitive creation body may be disincumberd and made supple and pliable to obey the dictates of the informing immaterial spirit and the spirit by the acquisition and habitual fixing of the moral powers for there cannot be a more certain and indubitable truth than that nothing imperfect in its order could come out of the hands of infinite perfection and that nothing impure or imperfect in its order can return to live and commerciate with or be united to god perfectly finally and immutably      this infinitesimal particle of celestial matter this miniature of a miniature in infinitum decreasing in a continued analogical progress and stored up in the seeds of all animals and vegetables from the first to the last animal and vegetable this divinely organisd vehicle or corpuscle in which the immaterial principle was inspired in its creation and to which it is so intimately united by a particular law of union and an individual fitness and congruity is inseparable from it in all its future states and circumstances of duration at least by any degree of force less than infinite the immaterial spirit the spiritual inhabitant of this celestial vehicle is in its own nature immortal and imperishable being an infinitesimal miniature of the divine nature and substance which is selfexistent i say then the spirit the immaterial substance that informs this ethereal creation body is of its own nature immortal and imperishable but the material vehicle though of a refined and ethereal substance is only eternal by the divine order and appointment and comparatively in respect of other grosser and more dense compounds of which time and use may alter the form though not destroy the substance and perhaps their perpetuity may be continued by a divine primary or secondary spiritual influence from both these immortal principles i am sensible these strong figures may be exposed to ridicule and interpreted profanely by light persons but when they understand and can explain with precision what the force of infinitude small or great is their raillery and levity may be tolerable such of necessity must be the language when we attempt to express perceptible only and spiritual things i hope i have a due sense of the purity and perfection of the divine nature and spiritual things not to expose them maliciously and designedly to contempt and ridicule my whole design is to help honest and sincere persons to some ideal knowledge which at best is but a poor affair that may possibly comfort and mend the heart without hurting the head    0 if there is any verisimilitude or consistency in this sketch it will follow from it that the lighter and thinner while sweet and healthy the crust and plaster from this elementary system that is laid over this creation body the more the natural powers of the spirit will be at liberty to exert their functions and acquire the moral ones the sufferings and miseries of the present state of our existence will be fewer and less intense and the total disengagement of the spiritual inhabitant from its prison and load will be more easy and perfect and we shall shake off our chains and fetters as we do our clothes to go to bed the universal law of nature for every sentient and intelligent being that is brought on this elementary planet is first to have its spiritual and its celestial body tied down and concentred by chains and fetters of this element into a miniature of a miniature then into a punctum saliens and at last into a sensible elementary body during all this time the spiritual nature is working like a slave in the mines or at the oar to extend this celestial body to its original analogous figure and dimensions by breaking all its elementary fetters while yet at the same time it is crusting over more densely the primitive celestial body by nutrition and the animal functions with a gross leprous plaster when the creation body is entirely developd by giving a facility to its organs of all kinds by culture and use in their several ways its intellectual faculties get power and liberty to exert themselves during which time the acquisition of the moral powers may and ought to take place and by degrees and in a nearly determinable period this plaster dries hardens and at last crumbles into dust and then the spirit with the celestial body if but partially purified passes into other states elements and mansions as its degree of moral virtue or acquisition of moral powers require      from this representation of the state and progress of sentient and intelligent beings in spirit and body during their banishment to this ruinous planet it follows that the root faculty and capacity of the spirit or its natural powers continue potentially and radically the same or that living perceiving and willing as to their essence power and capacity are in all states radically and invariably the same though their exercise acts and exertion be restrained and sopited by gross matter whoever considers the invariable nature of spirit must be convinced that its giving motions with their several modifications must always radically and potentially be the same and uniform however their acts may be suspended sopited or destroyed by gross matter and the immechanism of bodies and that all the functions of the body all its voluntary and involuntary motions all its living and vital actions all its internal and external operations all its sensations passions and willings that depend on the body are all but cogitation or thinking in some degree or other and its several modifications as really as intense fullgrown thinking with reflection or meditation is in a word that the soul spirit or living principle is really the true and only intelligent being and the body only is its organ instrument or tool and but a passive adjunct of the living intelligence and consequently that   our acquired knowledge is but remembrance   that a moral sense and faculty   that innate ideas of god and virtue of moral good and evil that   spiritual sensation and spiritual senses and that   the soul uses material organs though not of gross matter only in all its operations all these are as much philosophical realities however ridiculed and exposed by ignorant persons as the same things are when sensibly and outwardly transacted on our finished and perfect external senses and that   all our culture study and labor to acquire sciences and knowledge or to perfect our natural powers terminat only in fileing off melting away and scraping down those chains and crust superinduced upon them and are only removing superfluities reducing excrescences and rendering the gross patchwork superinduced on our spiritual body pliant supple and correspondent with the least resistance to it that the creation body may be at liberty to extend and disincumber itself and lastly that the shortest and readiest way to true and solid knowledge is to endeavor with the utmost vigor and strongest effects of our spiritual nature to recover and acquire the moral powers of the soul defaced and cancelled by the lapse viz justice goodness and truth or in the revelation language faith hope and charity to which these will be found when justly explained entirely analogous and consonant for it could only be to allow time and uninterruption from the natural powers had they been always in their full extent and force that they have been thus tied down and sopited so that now they can only rise and extend in proportion as the moral powers are acquired      the activity sensibility and penetration the voluntary and involuntary motions of this our elementary body the animal functions the more material acts of thinking and cogitation such as sensation memory imagination attention etc are all radically and primarily performed by the selfaction and selfmotion of the immaterial spirit on this creationaethereal body principally as sulphurous inflammations raise mountains and as springs and weights move clockworks with this notable difference that the first has an internal immortal spring of selfaction the other only a temporary and transitory one perhaps for example toward voluntary and involuntary motion or toward the exertion of the animal functions i say perhaps there may not be wanted any foreign independent and perplexed subtle fluid of whatever nature if the animal appearances and functions can be more simply as clearly and fully explained by the action of a selfactive and selfmotive spiritual substance informing and influencing a fitly and divinely organized ethereal body and thereby immediately impressing its action and energy on the gross earthly plaster laid over it a true spiritual substance of the very lowest order must necessarily have in itself a spring of selfaction a principle and faculty of selfmotion from its own internal nature and essence i can have no notion of a spiritual substance that has not a power of beginning and impressing motion on matter or body fitly disposed there seems no distinction so essential between spirit and body as activity and passivity it is true this activity in created spiritual substances is finite and limited and may be further restrained by gross matter to any degree but it will be always sufficient to begin and impress motion on body so long as the inertia of body is not greater than the selfactivity of such an order of spiritual substances else it could not in any sense be called selfactive and to produce muscular motion and the animal functions and appearances there may be nothing more necessary than selfactivity and selfmobility in a greater or lesser degree and divine organisation fitness and not insuperable resistance or rather a ready facility in the primitive ethereal vehicle which may overcome the load of plaster and rust laid over it i say perhaps this may be sufficient to account fully for all the animal appearances a foreign subtle fluid may be necessary to explain the appearances of inanimated matter but seems here superfluous and looks perplexed and operose and unlike the operations of the god of nature which are always from easy and simple causes and by one such cause produce various and beautiful effects and i think there is scarce accounting for the infinitely different degrees of sensibility the degrees of stature and growth and the degrees of penetration and of quick and slow thinking memory and solidity both in sentient and intelligent animals without allowing the plaistering and soder on the creation ethereal body to sit lighter thinner and less incumbring on some than on others and the ethereal organs to be more at liberty in the vastly sensible and quick thinkers and feelers than in the slow      it would seem in this progressive state of purification of lapsed sentient and intelligent beings that when one crust or plaster from the element to which they are confined is worn off another may grow on of the nature of the celestial or terrestrial mansion which they inhabit fitted to the degree of the acquired moral powers and this in a continual ascent or descent till the moral powers are perfected and confirmed into habits and the ethereal or spiritual body is purified and refined from all the dross and rust it had contracted and then will be accomplished their last permanent and eternal state suited to their order      the specific law of attraction fitness and similarity of the element or planet to the degree of the moral purity or impurity in sentient and intelligent beings may as naturally and necessarily determine and attract them to this their specific region or mansion as the eggs of insects and seeds of plants scattered and blown by the wind are directed drawn and adhere by electricity to the leaves of those plants and trees only which are fittest and have the most proper juices for their adhesion incubation and vivification and for crusting them over to defend their delicacy and sensibility while young and tender from such injuries as would put an end to life for a law of attraction fitness and similarity will be found to hold good either simply or in some kind of proportion or analogically through all creation as well in spirits as in bodies in the natural moral and celestial worlds till the first and supreme being become locally and finally all in all and that all be in him with perfection and analogous similarity in their several natures as the fish or rivers are in the sea and that he acts and influences and gives perfection and happiness to all things he has made  conclusion this rude and unfinished sketch may possibly be thought by some an imaginary and enthusiastical romance and so perhaps it may be it is innocent if a fable and if thought otherwise by proper and competent judges i should renouce and disclaim it but on the most intense anxious and mature observations and reflections on universal nature on allowing the supreme being to be a wise good powerful and rational agent admitting final causes when they are obvious and analogy when plain and simple the outlines and groundwork of this system may be just and solid however faulty the detail and execution may be i can be answerable for nothing but the honesty of my intention in it  end of the first discourse discourse ii philisophical conjectures about the preference of vegetable to animal food and of the end and design of providence in appointing the first and on trial permitting the latter genesis i    and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be given for meat genesis ix   every living thing that moves shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things ver   but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof you shall not eat discourse ii philosophical conjectures about the preference of vegetable to animal food and of the end and design of providence in appointing the first and on trial permitting the latter    it is certain that by our make by the frame of our organs we are now fitted as for vegetable so for animal food the form of some of our teeth the liver the pancreas and many other of our internal bowels and conglomerate glands seem primarily and chiefly designed and fitted to antidote the mischiefs arising from animal food and fermented liquors at least for some time and in the days of our youth and vigor for certainly a part of the designs of any intelligent agent may be known by analogy justly drawn and by final causes and is the best evidence finite and lapsed creatures seem capable of receiving in the designs and contrivances of the creator till they come to converse with him face to face they may be mistaken in them as well as in every other kind of evidence being finite lapsed and consequently fallible creatures but this seems to be the only evidence they are capable of at present in such matters and may show evidently the design of the author of nature as a unequal screw of any number of spires shows that it was designed to fit some concave one of the same number of spires and diameter chance is only a technical word to denote our ignorance of the true and physical cause of order and design and yet admitting the existence of chance that through the whole human race there should have been in the infinite number of their organs a perfect similarity by chance only and not design may by a fair calculation be shown to be as infinite to finite that is mathematically impossible but the question i design to treat of here is whether animal or vegetable food was in the original design of the creator intended for the food of animals and particularly of the human race and i am almost convinced it never was intended but only permitted as a curse or punishment and a cure for a malady or as the french term it a pisalle and because infinite wisdom and power could make no more of his corrupted rebellious free creatures in their present state and for this infinitely wise and paternal end he seems to have permitted it   to let them feel and experience the natural and necessary effects of their own lusts and concupiscence by painful and cruel distempers feeling and experience being the surest means by which a finite lapsed creature can know and learn   to shorten the duration of their natural lives that sin misery and rebellion might not increase infinitely   to produce naturally and in a manner consistent with liberty and the other natural powers of the soul which being derived from him and being his miniature images he neither could nor would force or destroy those sufferings and miseries and dislike of inordinate lusts and enjoyments that might make them think ponder and return to order love of virtue and its source and original and   to sink and contract the natural powers of the soul viz living understanding and will by means of such frail bodies into a level with the decayed and lapsed moral ones  viz justice goodness and truth which by this rebellion were greatly corrupted and degraded the reasons that incline me to think in this manner are these following       whatever be the true primogenial and last principle of bodies beyond which it is impossible to analyze or divide them these are incontestably found in all animal and vegetable bodies as has been before observed   sulphur oil or material heat from whence spirit and activity   salt or hard angular particles highly attractive and dissolvable in water   air or small elastic particles   water or phlegm from whence alone fluidity and lastly earth the base and substratum of these others in the due and proportional union of these do the variety and difference of animal substances consist now it is past all doubt in philosophy and in philosophical chemy that animal substances of most kinds possess in a much greater proportion the two first of these principles viz salts and oils than vegetables which partake more of the last viz air water and earth but from many undeniable experiments the two first principles are known to be the most active energic and deleterious and tend more by their activity to the division dissolution and destruction of the subject than those others when they enter in any great proportion   the jelly the juice or chyle of animal substances is infinitely more tenacious and glewy vide memoirs of the academy royal for      and    0  and its last particles more closely united and separated with greater difficulty than those of vegetable substances this is evident from the experiments made with them in joining of wood and is known to all artificers and may be made manifest to the senses in the difference between the tenacity of campjelly or fishglew and that of paste made of flower or barley or from the strength of ropes or cords made of catgut or leather and those made of tow or hemp of the same diameter and therefore animal food must much sooner more strongly and irremediably make viscidities in animal fluids and more schirrously obstruct the capillaries and glands than vegetable substances   but the far more pernicious and destructive part is the salts and oil abounding more in most animal than in vegetable substances of which there are so many and convincing demonstrations that none can have any doubt of it that has the least acquaintance with natural philosophy for our blood and juices being nourished and supplied by such substances as abound most with these active elementary principles must necessarily be stored and saturated with salts and sulphurs and these being always in a state of action are the true original and the most adequate causes of the most excruciating distempers   when to these strong fermented and spirituous liquors are added as a vehicle or diluting mixture and join to the salts and sulphurs of animal substances not only their inflammable spirits and tartarous salts but their condensing and hardening quality on the food in the stomach the digestion is by that means hindered and stopped and the food not being sufficiently divided and comminuted but broken only into gross particles does more quickly and obstinately thicken the juices and obstruct the glands and capillaries than vegetable substances   animal juices and substances before they were turned into flesh must have been strained through infinitely smaller and more numerous tubes such as the last and extreme capillaries are some of which are not bigger than the six hundredth part of an hair by which means their particles must be rendered extremely smaller and finer and consequently have a much greater degree of attraction than those of vegetables which pass through fewer strainers and have no other motive powers but the heat of the sun whereas those of animal substances have besides the sun the force of muscular digestion and of the motion of the heart the flesh of animals i say must upon this account necessarily consist of smaller particles and so be united with a greater force and endowed with a greater degree of attraction and consequently must with far greater difficulty be digested and separated than vegetable substances possibly can and hence it is that carnivorous animals are much more deleterious food being endowed with much finer and more pungent salts and sulphurs than those animals that live on vegetables only as both the higher savor and deleterious effects of the first abundantly show from all which it is plain to a demonstration that animal substances must naturally and necessarily incrassate the juices and produce obstructions in the glands and capillaries and consequently create pains and diseases much more readily than vegetable substances   it is plain by weight that the substance of most animal food is specifically heavier than that of most vegetables commonly used for food sometimes in the proportion of three to two the fibers and juices of animal bodies are not only more compact and closely united and have fewer vacuities than those of vegetables whereby the digestive powers have less difficulty in concocting and grinding equal quantities of vegetable than animal food but by the less flavor and savor of vegetable than animal food the appetite is sooner satisfied and is under less temptation to excess in the first than in the latter and it is consequently better and sooner digested circulated and secreted especially by tender and delicate digestive powers and so cannot so readily cause viscidities and obstructions lastly infinite experiment and the best natural philosophy confirm to a demonstration that those substances which have least of salt and sulphur of spirit oil and hard pungent particles and most of soft earth water and air are the fittest to circulate and be secreted through animal tubes create least resistance to the motive powers tear rend and wear out the tubes themselves least and form less obstinate and powerful obstructions in the smaller vessels and consequently that vegetable substances which consist of a less proportion of salts and sulphurs i e of pungent and fiery particles and of a greater proportion of earth water and air i e of less active and cooler particles will be less ready to create diseases and shorten life than an equal quantity of animal substances which have all these in an inverted proportion in a word vegetable substances are more rare less compact less coherent more easily dissolvable and digestible turn into a lighter chyle have less salt oil and spirit and consequently are less heating and inflaming than animal substances and so obstruct and tear animal tubes less     if this account be just and philosophical and if it be lawful at all to enquire into final causes which if the first being be rational and intelligent and acts with design and for some end is not only lawful but laudable when done with modesty and humility then certainly one part of his design in permitting animal food must of necessity have been to shorten the duration of human life to create or at least to permit us by it to multiply and enrage diseases misery and sufferings since it is evident to a demonstration that it must always produce this effect and will always have it preferable to vegetable food and whatever is naturally and necessarily is and is permitted by the first being we may with the utmost certainty conclude was at least one part of his design and if suffering pain and misery here be necessary for our purification and recovery out of this degenerate state then very probably that might be his design in this permission this phenomenon in providence the permission and use of animal food and fact in revelation is not accountable any otherwise than that pain suffering and diseases being a natural and necessary mean of expiation and purification in the economy of restoration infinite wisdom permitted it though unwillingly as his strange work against the grain as it were for that end solely as a kind father suffers his unnatural and perverse son to be carried to gaol to suffer hunger cold pain and confinement there as the only mean to make him sober considerate wiser and better for that animal food and fermented liquors will more readily certainly and cruelly create and exasperate diseases pains and sufferings and sooner cut off life than vegetable food will there can be no more doubt than in any proposition of euclid if reason philosophy the natures of things or experience have evidence or force in them and it is very observable that this indulgence for animal food was not granted till the era of longaevity was expired or at least they took place together and not till the spiritual corruptions of pride tyranny malice revenge murder and brutal commerce so universally raged that infinite wisdom to begin a new world was forced to destroy by a deluge the whole race of mankind except a few of the most innocent and least depraved individuals such as they were far from perfect but the least bad of the race this seems so if any credit be given to the jewish history of nature     it will be no difficulty to one acquainted with revelation to find the like permissions in the divine economy nothing is more plain and demonstrable from nature and its eternal laws and from justice and equity than that in the original intention one woman was designed for one man and no more for there being no difference between the sexes but in their outward frame and the configuration of the shell or tabernacle their essential nature and spiritual permanent form being of the same degree constant and invariable different culture and form making all the real difference infinite wisdom might then with the same wisdom and propriety have given the male more eyes stomachs or heads as more wives and yet for the hardness of their hearts god permitted plurality of women to the jews this same people though they had not only gods general and imperceptible providence as we now have for their government and direction but his miraculous sensible and visible presence to instruct and guide them yet they wanted a king as the other nations had and he gave them one in his wrath infinite goodness intending always by the whole power of his omnipotence and omniscience to restore his lapsed and rebellious creatures consistent with their liberty and the natural powers he had given them and the harmony of his own attributes descends below his first intention and drops the primary and original perfection of his commands to them for a time to condescend to their weakness and infirmity in order afterward to bring them up to it again as a kind father who to wean his rash and giddy child from the fire holds his finger near a candle till he begets a sensible fear and dread in him of being too familiar with that dangerous element     upon the foot of natural religion only and from the strict rules of natural justice and equity how any one can justify the taking away the life of a fellow creature out of wantonness luxury and riot and not from necessity and selfdefence so long as there may be found sufficient store of vegetable food to carry on the expenses of living and the more agreeable performance of the animal functions to give a living creature the greatest pain it can possibly receive and take from it the only happiness it is capable of viz its life which none can restore or recompense merely to scratch callous organs more sensibly how i say to account for this barbarous and savage wantonness on the foot of mere natural religion and natural equity only without revelation i can by no means conceive that the infinitely wise author and lawgiver of nature who sees through the whole system of intelligences at once and perfectly knows for what ends and purposes he has made them and sent them here and is the sole proprietor of life and happiness may dispose of them how he pleases knows when they have finished their probatory and expiatory course and is able to recompense the loss of a lower life by the gift of a higher for it is not impossible the animals may have been a lower order of rational intelligences who lapsing less are sooner and with less suffering recovered and since they suffer with us they may be restored with us the apostle says the whole creation travelleth together that is probably the whole system of saturn the goal of gods creation for him i say to give up the lives of a lower rank of beings for the expiation instruction or admonition or other benefit of a higher may be an act of great justice wisdom and goodness and if it might be allowed us to conjecture one wise end and purpose in this permission of animal food might be to punish admonish and correct us by bodily distempers so as to bring us to reflect repent and amend or even to shorten the time of our sufferings here and by the violence of our diseases and a nearer prospect of death and a future reckoning to reclaim us sooner and more effectually and at the same time to advance these victims to a higher state of being and happiness probably for these mentioned but to be sure for wise and good ends and purposes has god by revelation given us a permission or patent for the use of animal food but for fermented liquors he has given us none that i know of neither are they natural or proper nor were they ever approved or recommended for common use or as proper and ordinary drink but only as physic or a cordial on festivals or at sacrifices on sickness or in extremities in the early and innocent ages of golden simplicity no hint supposes them commonly known or tried and if fermented and spirituous liquors were used only as bitter draughts cordials and chalybeat medicines to brace and wind up the stomach and alimentary tubes and solids transiently for a short time on sickness lowness fainting fatigue and inclement seasons as they seem to be intended by the author of nature they might be blessings and great temporary and transient reliefs but as they are now used constantly at meals as common beverage to dilute solid food and to make persons easy under a load of high rich animal food they become the efficient causes of most diseases and upon the most serious enquiry i could never find an adequate natural cause for the frequency of nervous and atrocious chronical distempers now from what they were formerly nor of the stuntedness punyness and feebleness so conspicuous among the better sort from what they were before the conquest and in our gallic wars but the free and frequent use of strong and spirituous liquors and rich and high foods with foreign cookery at that time introduced first and living in great towns and using only coaches and chairs and sedentary employments and diversions and drinking water only and living low is the only adequate antidote and remedy for these distempers thus produced for no axiom is so certain in physic as that diseases must be cured by their contraries     the hurt and damage all fermented liquors do an animal body is evident from many considerations as   that it hardens constricts and binds up the fibers and strongly unites the particles of animal substances so that they are with much greater difficulty separated and divided i e digested a piece of meat will continue sweet and sound for many years in wine or strong beer or in any strong fermented liquor the liquor cementing and pinning together the parts of the meat and the same happens when they are mixed in the stomach by which the digestibility and easy dissolution of it is obstructed so that in such a mixture mutton is turned into beef and beef into shoeleather   there is in strong liquors a crisping corrugating or caustic quality workt on the fibers which burns and dries them up and destroys their elastic and ductile virtue and consequently renders them unfit to be broken and divided in the stomach this is evident from the use commonly made of strong beer as the best plaster for sprains relaxations and strains and that brandy will really stop haemorrhages and ruptures in the blood vessels by burning and wrinkling the tender fibers and capillaries and so by this crisping quality must keep food from being readily and perfectly digested   the fire and heat in strong liquors by stimulating and twitching the fibers and coats of the blood vessels and nerves and consequently bringing them into quick and frequent vibrations and elastic efforts will break and tear the fibers of the alimentary tubes and separate their union and continuity so as at last to wear out these organs at least much sooner and with greater pain and suffering than water or aqueous liquors possibly can lastly it is a common and wellknown experiment that to stunt the growth of young animals as dogs and cats they need only be frequently rubbed over with brandy rum or any spirit this stops the ductility and extension of the young animal fibers that they cannot be dilated and developd by the force of the circulation and so stunts their growth from all which it is plain that strong but especially spirituous liquors are really poison to an animal constitution and their ill effects not only in shortening the lives but in stunting the growth and stature of the lower rank of people from the late frequent use of gin punch and other spirituous liquors have become so flagrant as to call aloud for the just indignation of the legislature and it is to be wished that an effectual remedy may be found out for so destructive an evil and i am fully convinced that the primary and original design of the author of nature for the solid food of animals was nothing but earthy particles mixed with water and air finely divided and cemented only with the least oil and salt possible as they are found in seeds fruits young vegetables and farinaceous or pulpous roots with water only for drink which alone would make the animal last the longest and with the fewest pains and diseases but this diet must be only tried and begun with the young while their fibers are tender and sweet     that all sensitive as well as intelligent creatures are in an expiatory purifying and progressive state here and going on to a greater degree of perfection and a nobler state of being in their several orders is demonstrable from the utter contradiction and impossibility there must be that an infinitely wise and good being could create sentient and intelligent beings to suffer for no other reason but for the sake of suffering or that he should make creatures to suffer for any other end or purpose but for expiation purification and progressive perfection of being and to establish and confirm them in their acquired state of perfection neque enim sub justo deo miser esse quisquam nisi mereatur possit says st augustine most divinely most of the animals are martyrs for the human species in food or sacrifice some of them are food for one another all of them are subject to epidemical diseases and casual misfortunes a few of them pass their time much more comfortably than others all of them but unhappily at best and go through death at last all this must be for some wise purpose and none can be nobler than that of expiation purification and progressive perfection of being and silent admonition and teaching us their superior order of beings consciousness of this end either to them or us might retard this effect childhood idiotism and many cephalic and nervous distempers can bring no consciousness of the divine end and design of this economy along with them even to intelligent beings it is sufficient that consciousness come when the end is accomplished or the designed perfection attained at what time animal food came first in use is not certainly known he was a bold man who made the first experiment illi robur et aes triplex circa pectus erat to see the convulsions agonies and tortures of a poor fellow creature whom they cannot restore nor recompense dying to gratify luxury and scratch callous and rank organs must require a rocky heart and a great degree of cruelty and ferocity i cannot find any great difference on the foot of natural reason and equity only between feeding on human flesh and feeding on brute animal flesh except custom and example i believe some rational creatures would suffer less in being fairly butchered than a strong ox or red deer and in natural morality and justice the degrees of pain here make the essential difference for as to other differences they are relative only and can be of no weight with an infinitely perfect being did not use and example weaken this terror and make the difference reason alone could never do it perhaps it may be conjectured that since sacrifices were certainly an original revealed or traditional institution and that no nation under the sun hitherto known was without them they being it would seem a chief part in the grand economy of the restoration sacrifice i say might have been originally instituted   to admonish and inform the sinner silently and without committing violence on his liberty what he deserves and implicitly to tell him that he deserves the same death he makes the poor brute undergo for the liberty of mankind seems so precious being the root of intelligence that it is wonderful in how many shapes infinite wisdom and goodness has put himself in the conduct of providence and nature to preserve it inviolate and at the same time to instruct and admonish his free lapsed intelligences i believe a good natural philosopher might show with great reason and probability that there is scarce beast bird reptile nor insect that does not in each particular climat instruct and admonish mankind of some necessary truth for their happiness either in body or mind and   to continue the expectation of all ages of some more noble and meritorious sacrifice some time or other to be celebrated and it is not impossible that the rude and untaught mob who were employed in the lower servile offices about sacrifices might have been the first who ventured on animal food if it was not instituted before as a sacrament with the same intention as the eucharist was afterward their station habituating them to bear with less pain the sufferings of their fellow creatures while sacrificed and they finding it palatable and luscious might recommend the use of it to others perhaps i say this might have been the original institution of animal food among all nations however as this is only a remote conjecture to account for the early commencement of animal food so contrary to the original nature of man and the design of the creator and has no regard to those concerned in our unbloody sacrifice i proceed now to observe how cautiously and with what an evident forbid the jewish law directs this permit of animal food viz absolutely and positively not to eat the blood of the animal in which not only its life but its most delicious savor and most deleterious qualities chiefly consist and because blood globules by their rotundity volubility and elasticity resist trituration that is digestion now this in reality and by insinuation and moral is to say that since for the hardness of your hearts and your present unconquerable lustings you cannot be brought to abstain altogether from animal food yet because in the blood is the life thereof and all its deleterious morbific and noxious qualities you are to drain it as much as possible of all its moisture and juice for the serum as well as the grume mostly consists of globular particles and eat it plain roasted or boiled to drain it still more by this method animal food will be much less pernicious and will approach very near to vegetables there is no understanding this permission any other way nor is it otherwise to be reconciled to common sense or rational conception however both jews and christians have at present dwindled and diluted its true import out of luxury     this doctrine is further confirmed by this surprising circumstance in the permission that there is a very particular and otherwise unintelligible distinction made between clean and unclean beasts either to be sacrificed or eaten for food and a distinguishing mark assigned how to know the last and since it comes from the same source with the permission of animal food these two must have some material difference in the nature of things and that can be none other but that the flesh of these last cannot be so readily digested and squeezed from their blood but that it will have sufficient remaining of a more deleterious nature to inflame and mortify the juices of those who use it freely and to enrage and madden their passions and he who is deeply acquainted with natural philosophy and the history of the unclean animals will be sensible of the justness of this prohibition and observation from whence it is natural to conclude that though for the hardness and perverseness of mens hearts animal food was permitted and indulged yet it was with such various clogs and exceptions as might make it as little pernicious as possible for the same reason likewise was the fat of the sacrifice forbid to be eaten and all this to show that it was with great reluctance and in mere condescension and contrary to the original intention it was thus permitted and though under the new dispensation st peter was informed by a miraculous vision that nothing was now common or unclean yet it was not till selfdenial poverty of spirit and mortification or abstaining from the lusts of the flesh were established as the fundamental doctrines of this new system which when sincerely believed and strictly followed would leave no room for difference of food or ceremonial distinctions which served only as a schoolmaster to bring them to these purer and more universal doctrines of christ it is certain at the creation there could be no such thing as an indulgence for animal food if only pairs of each animal were created at first     i must however own that i think some vegetable food of much salt oil or luscious juice and poignancy as much or more deleterious inflaming and incrassating than some mild animal substances for example onions shallot mustard horseradish all the nutkinds eastern gums balsams raisins pickles spices aromatics strong fermented sours rich and fat late fruits as dry yet plump grapes much sugar and the like these are in some delicate constitutions more poisonous and hurtful to an human body than a bit of the muscular and lean flesh of chicken veal lamb rabbit partridge turkey and the like white and young animal foods whose whiteness and tenderness shows there is little or no red blood globules in them and are consequently more easily digestible and less deleterious these vegetables may be allowed in small quantities as a sauce or relish to otherwise insipid and unpalatable vegetable food to sickly appetites but in great quantities and without caution they will hurt heat and thicken the blood and juices of tender constitutions which is the sole cause of the acute distempers of all the eastern and southern nations who do not deal or but very sparingly in strong fermented liquors without doubt plain milk the genuine soup prepared by the author of nature and of a middle nature between animal and vegetable substances boiled or raw or prepared with seeds as rice sago barley wheat millet and the like is the best and safest of all foods for such tender constitutions as being in itself blood that has not as yet often passed through the lungs to give it its scarlet color and deleterious qualities but is drawn almost directly from the stomach and lacteals from an emulsion made there and cookery of nature of grass and vegetables with pure water and designed by the author of nature for the cure and nourishment of the young tender and delicate and i can see no difference between a young or tender and delicate animal by nature and one made so by a disease but that such a diet is still more necessary for the last than for the first the mealy roots and early fruits are next to these such as potatoes turnips carrots skirrets and the like strawberries cherries currants etc and only in the last place and degree is the saladin colworts and latter and richer fruitkinds and winter vegetables as containing too much air or wind and the author of nature has with such a profusion of kindness secured against want or famine that in inclement seasons and bad years if the earth cannot produce plenty above ground it secures it under ground in bulbous knotted or mealy roots even in snow or frost    0 against this doctrine that animal food was permitted for a punishment and that fermented liquors are not an institution of nature and its author those who have regard for revelation whence the patent for animal food is drawn may object that our blessed savior who was without sin eat and drank of what was set before him that his first miracle was supernaturally producing wine to celebrate the marriage of cana in galilee that he was accounted a winebiber that he eat and drank with publicans and sinners that he wrought other miracles to produce animal food to a multitude that st peter had a miraculous vision to instruct him that no sort of food was unclean that the eucharist is celebrated in wine and that st paul advises timothy to drink wine for his infirmities to all which i answer   that the question is not what is now best and fittest in the present ends of providence in order to restore and recover man from his lapsed and fallen state but what was probably the first design of our creator in our primitive unlapsed state before we and our habitation the earth with its atmosphere and appendages were thus spoilt and disordered   one sort of repair props or support may be proper or necessary for a habitation in one degree of ruin and decay that would by no means be necessary or proper in another or lower degree   there is neither virtue nor vice in abstaining from one sort of food more than another but as it is commanded by lawful superiors all that is here considered is which of the two vegetable or animal food in the nature of things by the animal economy and as human creatures and their food are now constituted is physically and experimentally fittest to carry on and prolong life with the least pain fewest diseases and for the longest time virtue and vice are of quite another consideration and depend on the internal principle and disposition the quantity manner and order in which these necessary supports are taken not on the things themselves but if it be asked which of the two diets is most conducive to virtue or vice which of the two is most likely to facilitate the acquisition of virtue what is abovesaid plainly determines it in favor of a low diet for by it the bodily passions being made cooler and weaker the blood and juices being sweetened the intellectual organs thereby rendered cleaner more agile and penetrating reason and the spiritual nature of man has more liberty to act and meets with less difficulty and resistance in its operations   as to our blessed savior he having come to seek and to save what was lost was obliged to take the world as he found it in order to raise it from that degree of perdition in which it was then plunged he took upon him the form of a servant he took not the nature of angels but the nature of the seed of abraham he was in all things like unto us sin only excepted those to whom he came and among whom he dwelt and conversed could at first neither receive nor understand his sublime doctrines he had many things to say even to his disciples which they could not then bear and yet this doctrine of the preference and greater advantages of vegetable than of animal food is virtually and implicitly contained in the general doctrine of selfdenial and poverty of spirit in the sense of the evangelic counsels that carry quickest into perfection where celibacy is preferred to marriage for in the kingdom of glory they are neither married nor given in marriage but are as the angels of god so strongly and preeminently inculcated in the gospel as any who reads and considers it must plainly see   i readily grant and have given the reasons and philosophy of these things that in our present lapsed state in the present infertility and insufficiently nutritive qualities of the vegetables in the present curse on the earth and the necessity of labor handicrafts mechanical force and martial prowess while wickedness is so powerful and the wicked so numerous there is a necessity for high animal food and fermented liquors in some cases and to some persons to secure against and remedy these evils but the sole question here is whether this diet will prevent diseases or lengthen life so effectually as the other or whether providence has not designed and appointed vegetable food for the cure and antidote of the pains and diseases naturally and necessarily arising from animal food and fermented liquors perhaps god in his moral government of the world has designed animal food more readily to punish those who will not be drawn by love and beauty ie to purify some sorts of men by pains and sufferings   i willingly allow that fermented and sometimes spirituous liquors are excellent remedies temporary filips whips or spurs in faintness sickness labor or festival occasions for joy and promoting of friendship and on necessities and in extremities but i contend then and then only they ought to be used and that there is neither precept example nor encouragement from reason experience or revelation to use them otherwise or as they are now used for common food and daily beverage whence they become one cause of all the great diseases of the present age from these general considerations all the mentioned difficulties have an easy solution to the candid and ingenuous i am not fighting prizes nor making articles of a creed that infinite wisdom foresaw and laid in provision and the necessary precaution and antidote for the most deleterious effects of animal food and fermented liquors for a short time seems to me evident for these reasons   in that he provided the liver the pancreas and other internal glands in animals these vastly strong complicated and elabourd organs to draw out the most poisonous parts of strong meats and drinks the stronger the liver and the larger that organ grows the more bile it throws out on the commonshoar the intestines to deprive the chyle of its churlish salts and acrid sulphurs and thus makes the liver an useful medicine to promote the animal functions digestion chylification and the peristaltic motion and then throw its useless parts out of the habit   by the createing mineral and ponderous medicines  mercury chiefly to open obstructions break saline concretions and dissolve the tenacity of the globules and serum and   in providing mineral waters of so various and complicated natures for the same ends and purposes which they will wellchosen effect at last as certainly as those formerly mentioned now it is plain to a demonstration that under a vegetable diet all those have little or no use in medicine nay any one who is acquainted with the delicacy tenderness and sensibility of the internal and infinitely minute parts of an animal machine must know that they are not only in a great degree useless but hurtful and tend to tear dissolve and destroy the infinitely minute fibrils of which the solids of an animal machin are formed so that their final end and design in providence must have been to antidote the ill effects of animal food and strong fermented liquors to a certain degree and for a certain time probably till some time after the meridian of life while the organs had attained their utmost extension and firmness for it is not improbable that none of the mineral waters existed under the form and in the manner they now appear till after the deluge the era of animal food fermented liquors and the shortness of life      to the appearance of the present state of nature that seems to clash with this doctrine viz the vast nay infinite mass of life or living creatures generated by heat and moisture the many millions of organized seeds of plants and animals destroyed every season the impossibility of having any sort of food or even pure water without destroying and devouring millions of animaculs that here almost each animal devours and lives upon another and that both in the sentient and intelligent creation there seems to be a natural and unconquerable appetite and craveing desire of animal food and an insatiable thirst of blood to these and suchlike prejudices i cannot call them objections it may be answered i first that these facts are not denied but are of no weight against the propositions here chiefly asserted viz   that it is philosophically certain that animal food is in its own nature more ready to produce distempers than vegetable food   that it is therefore highly probable that an infinitely good and wise being would not appoint in his first intention animal but vegetable food at least to his intelligent and rational creation and which accordingly is confirmed from revelation and   the chief assertion here made is that in consequence of these two propositions it follows that vegetable food seeds especially must be the proper antidote and cure of the diseases brought on by animal food but ii it may be considered as st paul asserts that this whole creation the whole system but chiefly this our globe with all its inhabitants labors and is under a mortal distemper and in travail like a parturient woman to throw off this present load of corruption deteriority and lapse that it may regain its original spirituality purity and liberty it is at present in a state of expiation purification and progressive perfection every thing is out of its natural order the system is as it were in a fever and every part and particle is in action like the body of a man in a febrile fermentation to throw off its peccant humors and to bring the whole compound into order regularity and perfect health but iii these very appearances on which the objection is founded confirm to a demonstration what i assert viz that all animal life here is in an expiatory purifying and progressive state toward its original perfection for it would be the grossest contradiction to suppose that an infinitely good and wise being should give pain to any of his creatures for any other end but to reclaim and perfect them that he alone knows when his justice purity and the amend honorable and the infection of impurity are perfectly answered and cancelled in their present state of melioration and so knows when and how it is fittest to put an end to it by death that is by the rupture and dissolution of their gross and earthy prison formed out of this our ruinous planetary system now spoiled and defaced to set the indwelling spiritual inhabitant free into some more pure and refined system and that animal life of all kinds and degrees does and must necessarily suffer here by bodily wants and infirmities by the injuries and inclemencies of seasons by the rapacity and ferocity of their fellow creatures besides a thousand other accidents and at last most intensely by their death and the rupture of their outward shell or tabernacle from all this is a plain demonstration that they are in a state of suffering expiation and progressive purification and that at last they will all be set at liberty and become the sons and children of god in some degree or order or other according to his original intention and the plan of this his universal monarchy and kingdom laid before the foundation of the world and all this darkness sufferings and unintelligible play is only to save human liberty and produce at last pure love and naked faith iv no body ever denied that animals of all kinds might be destroyed even intelligent as well as sentient when it is done for some wise or useful purpose as in selfdefence or even for moral purposes implicitly to admonish and teach others their duty what they deserve or what they are to believe and hope these purposes with all their particular circumstances are under the moral government of an infinitely wise being the only question here is whether they may reasonably and justly be put to pain unnecessarily and wantonly or for no wise end or purpose but only to scratch callous pallates when other means of health may be had more effectual and no less pleasant v it is not altogether fact that animals devour one another from any other reason but for want of sufficient plenty of proper vegetable food as seeds tender plants mealy roots and the like which even the most carnivorous animals will brouze on when they can meet with it in plenty as is well known in natural history and even the fish which of all animals are the most voracious will readily feed on balls of meal and milk without offering to devour one another as the ingenious mr andrews of norfolk has found by experiment for having put several sorts of small and great fishes together into a large whitened pond of clear water where they might all be easily seen and numbered and feeding them with balls made of milk and flower which were put into pervious troughs he found at least thought that they did not offer the least violence to one another vi allowing animals to be actuated by a spiritual or immaterial principle of the same nature with intelligent creatures yet they are not of the same degree and order with them they may be intelligent creatures of an inferior order beginning lower and verging more slowly toward their intended perfection they may be under different conditions of purification and may pass the whole of their duration here in the state of infants who dye before they are born or before they arrive at the use of reason and yet in other states of being may grow and advance to a much higher perfection of sensation and intelligence than we can readily imagine for to me it seems utterly incredible that any creature whether sentient or intelligent should come into this state of being and suffering for no other purpose than we see them attain here and it is equally incredible that any creature should spontaneously exert animal and muscular function ie should live and feel without some degree of an immaterial immortal and selfactive spirit matter and its laws can never account for such appearances there must be some infinitely beautiful wise and good scene remaining for all sentient and intelligent beings the discovery of which will ravish and astonish us one day moderately wise ends purposes and means are unworthy of infinite perfection whatever god does must be every way worthy of himself his working may serve many wise and good ends and purposes here but the last and great end of all must be of dignity and majesty worthy of him though we cannot yet a great while comprehend it      to conclude   it is plain from revelation that animal food was permitted and fermented liquors not forbidden and consequently that there is neither virtue nor vice in the use of them absolutely but in the order time quantity and other circumstances of their usage   that in our present situation and under our present circumstances for some persons and in order for some purposes a reasonable quantity of animal food and fermented liquors may be absolutely necessary   it is plain from reason philosophy and experience that excesses in high animal food and strong fermented liquors are the true efficient and most general cause of most atrocious and dangerous distempers and consequently that vegetable food and unfermented liquors are the true and natural antidote of such distempers   that animal food and fermented liquors will more probably and more naturally cause distempers and shorten life than vegetable food and unfermented liquors   that a moderate and small quantity of animal food and generous fermented liquors will naturally tighten harden and strengthen give firmness and force to animal solids and fibers and enrich warm and invigorate the blood and juices and consequently is safest to all subject to eruptive distempers as gout erisipelas etc in the fits but at the same time that it hardens and tightens the solids it condenses and thickens the juices and renders the animal of a shorter duration of life and more subject to diseases   lastly that for bodily strength animal food and fermented liquors seem fittest but for intellectual exercises vegetable food and unfermented liquors seem appropriated and that consequently the best way to secure the golden mediocrity between bodily strength and spiritual force the state fittest for the generality of mankind is for the healthy to confine themselves to about a pound at least half a pound of animal food and a pint at least half a pint of fermented liquors daily but for the unhealthy valetudinary and studious to sink below this medium in both these till by experience and observation they find that quantity of either they are easiest under and to stick to that should it even be to descend totally into vegetables milk and seeds with unfermented liquors  end of the second discourse discourse iii a philosophical theory founded on experiments of the nature and laws of minute inanimat bodies and their systems in general romans viii    for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain till now discourse iii a philosophical theory founded on experiments of the nature and laws of minute inanimat bodies and their systems in general preface that the curious and philosophical reader who possibly may be entertained with such speculations may have in one general view what has been or will be incidentally hinted in my preceding and succeeding works concerning the nature of minute bodies their systems and laws i have collected into a few propositions what i have found scattered in the works of philosophers and mathematicians of most note on that subject particularly those of sir isaac newton these i have connected the best i could and in some particulars have adventured to supply with conjectures by analogy from their general nature leaving every one to judge for himself according to his taste and liking there being nothing of what is here laid down very material to the practical part of these discourses  proposition i the elements or least and last particles of matter are of various sizes densities and figures those of the first order or the very least are almost infinitely small hard and elastic pervading all bodies but pervious to none such as are probably the particles of the etherial or newtonian fluid the particles of the second order are composed of these and consequently are of a greater size but less dense and elastic being pervious to the particles of the first order and themselves pervading all others of this kind are probably the particles of light the particles of the third and last order are composed of those of the second order bearing such proportion to them in size density and elasticity as they do to those of the first order  scholium it is beyond all doubt that the quantity of solid matter in this material system is very small in respect of the interspersed vacuities it is demonstrably certain that a solid cube or sphere of a mile or furlong or even a yard in diameter being divided sufficiently small and its parts ranged in a proper order would furnish solidity enough to answer all appearances suppose the particles all cubes and to be so united by the contact of their angles as to make cubical interstices then the vacuity would be equal to the solidity and since matter is divisible in infinitum this vacuity may be increased to any proportion of majority we actually find that water and mercury will pass through the pores of gold and sir isaac newton has demonstrated that gold must have many times more pores than solid parts and yet it is the heaviest of all bodies light passes through the most opake bodies when shreded sufficiently thin it scarce meets with any resistance in its passage through clear glass and ether pervades all bodies with very little or no resistance from all which it manifestly appears how small a proportion there is between the solidity and vacuities in our system  prop ii the elements of bodies or the least and last particles of whatever order are solid hard and indivisible at least by natural and created powers else it would be in the power of natural means and created agents to alter the present constitution and nature of things for a world made up of particles broken and worn out would be quite different from what it now is and altogether insufficient to answer the ends and purposes of nature  prop iii analogous to of the same nature and probably from the same cause with gravity in the great bodies of universe the sun planets and fixed stars which acts as the squares of the distance reciprocally there is in the least and elementary particles of matter a principle of attraction and repulsion whereby they attract and repel one another according to some constant and invariable law whatever that may be  schol i what this law is by which the particles of matter attract and repel each other no observations or experiments hitherto made have been sufficient to determine only thus much is certain that in receding from the point of contact it decreases in a greater proportion than that of the duplicate ratio of the distance reciprocally for by that law the force of attraction at any small assignable distance would be nearly the same whereas it is manifest from observation and experience that it is exerted only at or near the point of contact sir isaac newton has calculated from the inflection of the rays of light that the attracting force in the point of contact is  0000000000000000 times greater than the force of gravity and the ingenious mr hales has shown by a great variety of experiments that the repulsive or elastic force which probably arise from one and the same cause in some sorts of particles are likewise immensly great  schol ii if particles mutually attract each other as the cubes of their distances reciprocally the force of attraction in the point of contact will be infinitely greater than at any assignable distance according to this law which seems to obtain at least very nearly in the smallest particles of matter if the force of attraction in the point of contact be not infinitely greater than the force of gravity it will be infinitely less than that force of gravity at any assignable distance but though the force of attraction in the point of contact is very great yet it is not infinitely greater than the force of gravity seeing the parts of any body may be separated by a finite assignable force and therefore at a given distance it must vanish or become infinitely small  schol iii repulsion begins and goes on where attraction ends and o constitutes the middle point in the progression between them or o i e infinitely small of the same order is the last term and limit of attraction and the first of repulsion and they probably go on according to the same law and progression though with contrary directions for as sir isaac newton observes those particles which recede from one another with the greatest repulsive force and are with the greatest difficulty brought together cohere most strongly when brought into contact  prop iv the cohesion of the small particles of matter is in the compound proportion of the quantity of their cohering surfaces and the quantity of their attractive powers and their attractive powers are caeteris paribus as their densities or the quantities of matter they contain  corol hence it follows that the less the cohering surfaces are caeteris paribus the less will be the degree of cohesion and that the least degree of cohesion is when the surfaces touch in a point only or are spheres or spheroides  prop v the power or force of attraction in small particles of matter increases as the size of the particles is diminished for as this force acts only in or near the point of contact it will be proportional to that contact or in the compound ratio of the density of the particles and the largeness of their surfaces but the surfaces decrease as the squares of the diameters while the solidities decrease as their cubes and therefore the smallest particles of matter having the largest surfaces in proportion to their solidities and more of their points coming into contact will have the greatest attractive force in proportion to their bulk  prop vi the gravities of particles decrease as the cubes of their diameters for their gravities are as their quantities of matter which in homogeneous bodies are as the cubes of the diameters  corol hence it is that mercury from the smallness and divisibility of its parts is so easily raised and that bodies may be suspended in fluids specifically lighter than themselves  prop vii if the parts of a body immersed in a fluid are more strongly attracted by the fluid than they are by one another they will mutually recede from each other with a force equal to the excess of the one attraction above the other and will be equally diffused through the fluid and hence the nature of solution separation and diffusion  prop viii if particles suspended in a fluid and attracting each other are elastic after their collision they will resile from one another and meeting with other particles they will be reflected till by such actions and reactions a fermentation effervescence and ebullition is produced  prop ix if particles suspended in a fluid and attracting each other are not elastic they will not be reflected from one another but coalesce into masses till their gravity exceeding that of the fluid they will sink and be precipitated the same thing will be produced by increasing or diminishing the gravity of the menstruum in which the particles are suspended  prop x the figures of the elements of all pure unelastic and incompressible fluids must necessarily be spherical or at least approaching thereto for were they of any other figure their surfaces would touch in more points than one and consequently they would cohere and the elements of solid bodies probably may be of the figure of some one or other of the regular solids as cubes triangles prisms etc so that their surfaces coming into contact they may attract each other with the greater force  schol what may be the figure of the elements of elastic fluids as the air and the newtonian ethereal fluid is not material to enquire since their fluidity does not arise from the figure but the repulsive force of their particles  prop xi the elasticity of solid bodies is the effect of the attracting force of their particles for when the small contiguous and cohering particles of a body are by a stroke or any external violence separated from each other to extremely small distances if this force is taken off the separated particles will by the force of attraction rush back into their contacts with an accelerated velocity and the body will recover its pristin figure but if the particles are so far separated as to be without their spheres of attraction they will remain in that disjunction and the body will be incapable of recovering its former state  prop xii that bodies under a rotation fly off in the tangent is only a consequence of that general law by which they persevere in the same state of rest or moving uniformly in a straight line unless they are made to change that state by some external force impressed for the direction of a body moving in the circumference of a circle is in the tangent and it is made to describe the circle only by the central attraction which ceasing to act the body will proceed in its proper direction or will fly off in the tangent  prop xiii the figures of bodies and their actions on one another arising from the principles of attraction and repulsion together with the motions impressed on them by living and intelligent agents will probably account for most of the appearances of the material world if mechanically adjusted and treated according to these mentioned laws  prop xiv air is a system of particles endued with a repulsive force which being fixed in all animal vegetable and mineral substances are by fire fermentation putrefaction dissolution or any other intestine action or reaction set at liberty and thrown off into an elastic state and carrying along with them ramenta or abrasions of the bodies they were fixed in they compose our atmosphere which is a chaos of such particles of various solidities gravities and attractive and repulsive powers acting by the established laws of minute bodies and hence its compression weight elasticity and various degrees of density  schol the density of the air is proportionate to its compression and therefore the centrifugal or expansive force by which its particles endeavor to recede from one another must be in the reciprocal proportion of their distances or in the direct subtriplicate ratio of their densities  prop xv earth is only a loose collection of the different elementary particles of matter of all the three orders thrown together without any regular combination or cohesion as whiteness is a blending and mixture of all the differentlycolourd rays of light  prop xvi water is a collection of the solutions of tasteless and insipid salts originally fixed crystalisd and dispersed quite through the globe but kept in fluidity by heat like melted lead and different salts are water united with a little air and some earths acid or sulphurous in a crystalisd state as ice is water congealed and water is ice dissolved but this is not intended as a definition but only as an illustration all salts are soluble by water and all water evaporated drops a saline substance mixed with earths  prop xvii acids seem to be composed of such elementary particles as are endued with a very great attractive power whence by insinuating themselves into the pores of bodies and attracting their particles more strongly than these particles attract one another they thereby separate and divide them  schol possibly the figures of acids may be triangular prisms or such like to facilitate their entry into bodies and to separate their particles like wedges for all matter must have some figure  prop xviii heat as it is a property of bodies is only the brisk vibrating action and reaction of the elastic repelling nitre of the air and the ethereal fluid with the strongly attracting acid sulphur which sulphur by its analysis is found to contain an inflammable oil an acid salt a very fixed earth and a little metal  corol hence the affinity between light and sulphurous bodies and the true nature of oils and inflammable spirits which are nothing but a great deal of sulphur a fine or light acid salt a very little water and earth  schol since it has been found that a thermometer in an exhausted receiver will rise and fall as much and almost as soon as another thermometer placed by it in the open air it seems to follow that heat is conveyed and propagated from one body to another by some subtle elastic fluid pervading all bodies and it is not improbable that the vibrations of this medium in hot bodies contribute to the intenseness and duration of their heat and since smooth polished bodies with plain surfaces cling together as strongly in an exhausted receiver as in the open air it is not improbable that their cohesion may be caused by this same medium both experiments go a great way to ascertain the existence and necessity of some such ethereal fluid  prop xix light seems to be the vibrating particles of a hot body driven off by the repelling force with an immense velocity which is continued and augmented by the ethereal fluid and the attraction of the bodies it meets with in its progress  schol i since as sir isaac newton has observed light is convertible into bodies and bodies into light and that it is probable that light is only the particles of a hot body thrown off with an immense velocity it would seem that these particles which constitute light are the elementary particles of the second order with which sulphurous and oily bodies from the great activity attraction and elasticity of their parts appear to be saturated and abound for these being smaller and more elastic than the particles of the third order will be thrown off with a very great velocity which we know to be an essential property of the rays of light and they will likewise pervade all bodies which is also a property belonging to the rays of light there being no body however dense or close in its texture which by being shreded thin does not become transparent  schol ii the rays of light seem to consist of particles of different sizes that being necessary to produce the various colors and different degrees of refrangibility the least of which make violet the weakest and darkest of the colors and are most easily diverted from the right course by refracting surfaces and the rest as they are bigger make the stronger and more lucid colors as blue green yellow red and are with more and more difficulty diverted  schol iii the sun and fixed stars are immense globes of matter saturated with these particles of the second order and so being heated red hot are kept in heat by their intestine motion and the action and reaction of their parts with the ethereal fluid their dense atmospheres by their compression keeping their parts from flying off or consuming too fast  schol iv it is not impossible that our earth with its satellit the moon the other planets in this our system with their satellites but especially the comets should be all of them betteringhouses according to the dutch manner of speaking prisons dungeons and places of punishment for trial expiation or progressive purification of the several sorts orders and degrees of lapsed sentient and intelligent beings that they are not and cannot be permanent or eternal in their present state philosophy and astronomy furnish innumerable arguments to convince any thinking person most of their orbits are elliptical which certainly is not so simple or perfect a figure as a circle the planes of their orbits cut one another at irregular various and vastly different angles which at least in our present way of thinking is not so harmonious besides the unaccountable oddnesses in most of their diurnal and annual revolutions the nutations of their axes their rings spots and girdles which at least savor not of that simplicity perfection and beauty conspicuous in most of the other works of the author of nature moreover as to our planet in particular it has so many untoward marks and oblique symptoms of a designed deteriority that it would require a volume to enumerate those daily observed by astronomers and natural philosophers besides those now mentioned which are common to most of them our earth has in particular barren and unfruitful climates unhospitable and uninhabited regions unhealthy and mortal seasons tempests thunder and lightning vulcanos plagues and epidemical or infectious atmospheres all which could never proceed from an infinitely good and wise being if his design was not to punish and correct but all these seeming deformities are kind and fatherly designs of wisdom and have infinitely beautiful final causes and motives and are strong and amazing instances of his being love and wisdom if they are reckoned only correction and bettering mansions of no durable or permanent stability but verging and growing into some progressive beautiful and final state by general laws which state in due time will appear and emerge and then he may as he did at first say of all his works they were good and perfect in their order and then the son shall give up the dominion to his father in a much happier and more perfect condition than it was at first made as he said of himself that he came that all gods creatures  sentient and intelligent and consequently their habitations and mansions should have life that is have perfection and happiness and have it more abundantly  prop xx flame is the sulphurous or oily smoke of a hot body agitated to such a degree as to be ignited  prop xxi those bodies are transparent whose pores are sufficiently small to attract the rays of light and rectilinear to transmit them thus paper is made more transparent by having its pores filled or lessened with water or oil  the following propositions are manifest from experiment vide boil the philosophical transactions and the memoirs of the academy royal     mercury consists of smaller particles than any known fluid for it will pass where no other fluid can   the particles of mercury in all their divisions preserve a spherical figure from the strong attraction of their parts as is evident by fine glasses and the smaller the particles the more perfect the spheres as the same glasses demonstrate   mercury is the heaviest of all natural fluids being    times heavier than water   the particles of mercury attract some bodies the most of any as gold and fly from others the most as oil of vitriol and all acids corollaries   therefore the particles of mercury are the most easily raised by heat being divisible into the smallest parts which though not sensible yet are known by their effects in silver water mercurial steams and exhalations and their ready passing through all animal substances   therefore the particles of mercury have the greatest momentum and force being the heaviest of all natural fluids   therefore the particles of mercury by their smallness sphericity and weight being actuated and raised by heat readily pervade all animal fleshy substances which are but spunges with communicating cells as is evident from the effects of fumigations and the palsies of those who silver glass or dig in the mines of that mineral medical corollaries   therefore the particles of mercury are the fittest to break the cohesion of all viscosity and divide its substance by its weight in animal tubes from which viscosity all the cold chronical diseases most probably proceed   therefore the particles of mercury are fittest to open all obstructions in the small capillary or lymphatic vessels from their smallness weight and sphericity   therefore the particles of mercury from their smallness weight and sphericity are fittest to make the circulation whole and entire quite around   therefore mercury is the only proper antidote for such palsies whose cause is the tenacity of the juices in the small blood vessels pressing upon the nerves and fibers and so interrupting their vibrations and actions   therefore mercury is the best antidote for the scurvy in the first intention by its smallness its weight and sphericity breaking the salts and larger concretions obstructing the lymphatics   therefore mercury is also the best antidote for the gout in the first intention readily opening those small vessels which are the most difficult to be dilated by reason of their compression betwixt bony articulations even though their smallness should be such that  00 of them can make up but the thickness or bulk of one hair but a thin cool diet must continue them pervious when mercury has made them so   therefore mercury duly prepared and judiciously managed is the only proper antidote for the diseases produced by excesses of any kind especially of animal food and fermented liquors   mercury by its weight and sphericity will infallibly burst those vessels whose obstructions cannot be dissolved or opened driving the substance of these obstructions through the sides of the slender lymphatic vessels and will infallibly tear the small vessels whose sides are very rare and slender or whose pores are made very large by putrefaction   therefore mercury is a divine antidote or real poison according to the person prescribing or the case it is prescribed in  0 the best preparation of mercury is that wherein its particles are most minutely divided and kept at the greatest distance from one another    that preparation of mercury is the best where after a due division into its smallest parts the mixture is made with that body which has the most specific virtue against the disease thus the aethiops cum sulph is best for inflammations piles the gout the erysipelas etc and that with antimony against cutaneous distempers that with volatiles and foetids in nervous cases that with bark and bitters in intermittents and so in others    therefore the aqua mercurialis is the very safest general deobstruent in very weak persons did it not require too long time to produce any salutary effect mercury alcalisated or killed with any calcined body given often and in small doses is the next cinnabar next to that and then aethiops etc    all mineral medicines ought to be infinitely divided before they are sent into an animal body they never having been intended by the author of nature to enter there but in their minutest particles and divisions as we may see by natures preparing in this manner mineral waters of all kinds fitted for the cure of almost all chronical diseases if joined with a proper regimen except perhaps some few of those begot by unnatural cramming with mixtures of salts spices oils and inflammable spirits or those begot by contagious venereal diseases    mercury with the salts such as calomel the turbith sublimat red white and green precipitate are of all preparations the most prejudicial and injurious to animal habits these saline mixtures tearing the small vessels where diseases are mostly generated and in whose integrity all the delicacy of life consists but they are thereby of the quickest effect in cases that depend on expedition as the hydrophobia inflammatory rheumatism and the like general medical corollaries   as water alone bloodwarm is the best diluent so mercury is the best deobstruent but as water alone may be too sluggish so mercury alone may be too active and ponderous for tender and delicate animal solids especially in its fluid state or mixed with salts or too active bodies and therefore the absolutely best preparation of mercury is when being divided by the utmost possible art it is joined with the most specific vegetable medicines against the distemper that it can conveniently be united with and fixed in   as the fineness or smallness of particles together with the largeness of their surfaces make hardness or the greatest cohesion in bodies as has been shown by proposition iv and v and may be seen in finewoven cloth gold marble crystal shells salts and diamonds and as earths water milk watery fluids and vegetable substances consist mostly of water and rare loose fine earths with a little grosser salts and sulphurs of small or no cohesion it is evident that such substances are fittest for weak tender and valetudinary persons as affording all the materials of nutrition and being more easily resolvible into their integral particles and are most proper food for intellectual purposes which depend on the easy performance of the animal functions as nervous distempers arise chiefly from their labored performance compressing by their weight and hardness the too tender and delicate membranous tubuli of the nerves and so stopping or retarding their vibrations and oscillations though they are not so proper for mechanical strength and force general scholium in these few propositions are contained the principles of all the natural philosophy hinted at in my medical treatises if it is just or approaches the truth as i hope it does then it must necessarily follow   that soft mild and cool foods are fittest to carry on the animal functions the most readily freely naturally and lastingly   that spirits salts chemical oils which are but spirits condensed and every thing that has passed the tortures of the fire abounding with particles small hard caustic for calcined antimony will be increased one fifth in its weight and highly attractive are most pernicious to animal habits not only burning and tearing the delicate fibers and vessels like caustics and lancets but by their attractive powers violently corrugating and contracting the fibers so that in habitual drinkers drammers and high feeders their tone and elasticity is entirely destroyed by their sudden and alternate contractions and relaxations vide haless haemostaticks  while at the same time the juices are thickened and coagulated by the spirituous mixture and so disposed to form obstructions and concretions in the smaller vessels and therefore they ought never to be used but as spurs and whips to push on and stimulat the sluggish organs for a time and make them carry off the overload with a short vigor and so are only proper in extremities as a present filip   that animal foods whose parts have been first divided by animal organs and afterward attenuated and refined by those of other animals and mixed with great quantities of animal salts and oils when again taken into animal habits for food where they undergo a third subtilization or milling or the flesh of animals that live on animal food are so minutely divided as by proposition iv to acquire the greatest degree of attraction and therefore when introduced into the small tubes and capillary vessels in great quantities they must form obstructions of the strongest cohesion and tenacity   that mercury in some shape or other is the only proper deobstruent and dissolvent in all chronical cases and in those acute ones that come nearest to them especially in those who have fed much and long on animal foods and fermented or distilled liquors   that milk and vegetables are not only the sole rational and proper food of tender or diseased animals but from the grossness of their parts and their small degree of attraction and cohesion consequent thereupon being dissolved by a less force than animal food are fittest to carry on the most pleasantly all the functions in which health serenity and free spirits consist   that therefore milk seeds fruits and mealy vegetables with waterdrinking are undoubtedly the most infallible means to preserve the faculties clear and acute and to acquire activity and long life whatever mechanical force and strength may require for sudden strong efforts   on the whole as water with a little fine vegetable earth salt and sulphur seems to me to be the proper food intended by nature for animals and as it is water alone which conciliats that fluidity absolutely necessary to juices circulating in tubes the more it partakes of this element the fitter it is for the animal functions mercury seems to be the only other fluid that has the qualities fitted for circulating and destroying viscosity so that in fine the two proper antidotes intended by nature for chronical animal diseases especially those of the worst kind seem to be mercury somehow prepared and water naturally or artificially impregnated the one for animal and the other for vegetable feeders  discourse iv philosophical conjectures on spiritual nature the human spirit in particular genesis i    and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness  ver    so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him discourse iv philosophical conjectures on spiritual nature the human spirit in particular    the natural faculties properties or attributes of all rational spirits and human intelligences and indeed of all intelligences of whatsoever order or degree are incontestably these three   perception or understanding   willing choosing or freedom   memory reflection or attention out of these three all the operations of a human spirit may be deduced and suppose living or actuating some vehicle as their base and though they may be and are justly considered separately yet in wellexercised and duly cultivated spirits they are sometimes so instantaneous as to seem one and the same act of the mind and are called by the general name of thinking or cogitation when either in separate acts or instantaneous and all spirits differ chiefly in the degrees of these natural powers     however uncommon the expression may seem yet to those who admit a deity or supreme spirit of infinite perfection the author and first cause of all things finite spirits of all possible orders can be conceived philosophically no otherwise than as miniatures effluxes emanations infinitesimals or infinitely small sparkles of this infinite source of living intelligence action perfection and happiness voluntarily emitted lighted up or created by this infinitely perfect being and endowed with his radical and essential qualities and attributes of life activity and intelligence so that all spirits are in their own natures diminutive or infinitely small deities and necessarily now they are created and have a derivative existence from him must partake of his immortality intelligence and freedom or his divine nature and image and consequently can never be annihilated forced or deprived of the powers of perception intelligence and willing no more he can     these faculties and powers of all spirits are not only to be felt but distinguished in every human mind duly exercised and cultivated by attentively considering its nature and operations but necessarily follow by analogy from the nature of the first cause that being of infinite perfection the deity who being of infinite wisdom and power could find nothing without himself before creation to be a model or pattern for his intelligent creatures and therefore stamped them with his own most glorious image creating them little divinities resembling himself in his radical and essential attributes so as at last to become similar to him in perfection and happiness in their several orders gradations and ranks for infinite perfection wanting nothing and to whom no happiness nor perfection could be added could have no other end or view in producing rational intelligences into being but to make them happy by partaking of his essential happiness in their several orders and ranks that is in becoming similar to him in his natural as well as moral attributes his natural ones as has been said being life intelligence and activity his moral ones justice goodness and truth in which two united consists the perfection and happiness of all intelligent creatures     in a mere philosophical disquisition though no argument is to be taken from revelation yet to express my meaning so as to leave no room to be mistaken by such to whom revelation is familiar i shall represent it in the words of the scriptures it is said in genesis on the design of the creation of the human soul let us make man after our own image and again in the image of god created he him and elsewhere you are gods images and to show the human rank david says he was created a little lower than the angels and our savior speaking of marriage says that in heaven they are neither married nor given in marriage but are like the angels and the same manner of describing the human spirit frequently occurs in the scriptures both of the old and new testament     it is a frequent and common opinion of all pagan and christian antiquity that all created intelligences have bodies or vehicles of one kind or another fitted to their order rank degree of purity habitation and situation it is highly probable and philosophical to think there is no perfectly pure and immaterial spirit but the supreme spirit the father and creator of all spirits and that all created spirits how high and sublime soever have proper and peculiar bodies and organized cases not only to circumscribe and limit their powers and their extension and expansion but to enable them to communicate and commerciat with to contemplat and admire the contrivance of the material world to converse with the lower ranks of intelligences that we certainly know have material vehicles such as we of the human race are but also to execute the orders of the divine economy and providence over the whole system of intelligences and material world and accordingly we find mention made in holy writ of a natural body and a spiritual body and of the sun and planets having a particular glory in their bodies peculiar to themselves and of the glorious appearance and radiation of our saviors body on the mount and it is very absurd and almost blasphemous to think these myriads of stars and luminaries that appear in a winter night in the heavens and its milky way to be nothing but twinkling tapers uninhabited and designed only to be stupidly and ignorantly gazed on by us     what a spiritual substance or of what nature the substratum of these faculties of understanding and will or of thinking is we shall never perfectly know till we arrive at the world of spirits and drop this coarse earthly tabernacle indeed we know nothing of the internal substance of any being all we know or can know is their sensible qualities and the effects of them on us and something in general we learn of inanimated bodies and their laws from the uniformity of these effects and we may be certain that spiritual substance is in most if not all its qualities contradictory at least contrary to body or material substance and vice versa for example we know that matter is absolutely passive and equally susceptible of motion or rest and that spirit or spiritual substances are selfactive and selfmotive and the immediate productive cause of all motion in body and consequently is endowed with freedom or liberty we know that matter is impenetrable and that two bodies cannot possess the same space at the same time but spirits may and can pervade and penetrat one another at least by their spiritual virtue and energy as is evident from persuasion conviction reasoning and compassion and suchlike spiritual actions it is true the sphere of their activities is limited and circumscribed but we also know that the spirit acts in every point of that circumscription as we find by our bodies every part of which is more or less sensible by the membranous mouths of the nervous tubuli being spread over all the solid parts of an animal body and we know no body or mere matter that is so matter is certainly divisible in infinitum and may be actually divided into very small parts but spirit having no sensible parts is neither divisible nor discerptible persons of light understandings and gross conceptions may dispute or ridicule these truths but they must be poor philosophers who can think them not highly probable and have a mean notion of the extent of nature and its author four of the greatest philosophers of this or any other age to wit sir isaac newton mr leibneitz mr hugens and mr fatio when they describe the matter which they suppose to be the cause of gravity consider it as infinitely small in its particles infinitely rare infinitely elastic and moved with an infinite velocity and the first of these by a very strong figure calls it spiritus quidam subtilissimus what these four infinitudes may effect on matter to destroy at least these gross palpable and sensible qualities we observe in it such as sensible extension impenetrability and passivity i will not take upon me to determine but all the notion we can now form of spirit is to divide refine sublime and exalt body and matter ad infinitum so that we be sure it can have very little of the sensible qualities and this i fear is as far as philosophy can go while we have only gross and palpable vehicles of clay for by analogy to infinitely divided subtilizd sublimed and refined material substance we form the only idea notion or perception we can now frame of spiritual substances and that is but a gross one and neither just nor true     living sensation or actuation of matter is not easy to define or describe existence or being belongs to matter as well as spirit but life sensation or perception and their consequences belong only to some one rank of spirit or mind and i may defy all the philosophers and mathematicians that ever have been to explain consistently from matter and mechanism alone as it now obtains the life growth and fecundity of the lowest plant or vegetable at least its seed or seeding much less of the least insect or animal and least of all of a rational sentient and percipient being so that wherever there is any degree of life vegetative sensitive or rational there is probably some degree of a soul or spirit immaterial immortal and progressive so that life or animation in all creatures in general is indeed matter organized and actuated by a spirit or soul of some one rank or degree or other i mean only created life or life derivative as it is in creatures for in the creator life is without matter without body or vehicle and without limits or possibility of nonexistence or not living the best notion idea or perception we can frame of created life is that of a nice delicate finely contrived machine of a vast variety of organs set in motion by the first cause and continued by an internal selfmotive spring which spring is this spiritual substance     as we have some notion of what extent the bestformd and most cultivated human spirit is there may be myriads of a lower rank of the same species and that as under the human species there is an almost infinite variety of the brutal and irrational species and under these a like or greater variety of the vegetable kind from the moss on the wall and the coralline seaplant up to the highest divine philosopher or mathematician of the human race and that all the several species from the highest to the lowest sink so gradually into one another that it is impossible to determine where one degree ends or the next begins so it is also highly probable that above the human species there are orders ranks and hierarchies rising gradually and insensibly without limits and without end this the dignity power wisdom and goodness of the first infinitely perfect being and the analogy of things seem to oblige us to conjecture or hope and the infinite variety of systems fixed stars which we known to be suns and very probably have primary and secondary planets analogous to ours and the infinite expansion of space makes it probable and philosophical and as an angel is only of a little higher and more noble order than the human race and all created intelligences have vehicles or bodies of an order and purity analogous to their rank and degree in the scale of intelligences we may fairly and philosophically define a pure original not lapsed angel of the lowest order a spiritual substance of the next immediate order above the human actuating a divinely organized body of a purity and sublimity analogous to their order and the perfection of his informing spirit     we have a pretty clear perception of what the human race is at present both in their body and spirit he that has a just though not an adequate idea of infinite perfection that is of infinite power wisdom and goodness can find no possible reason or motive why such a being should create intelligences imperfect in their order unhappy and perishing when the same power wisdom and goodness could either have totally abstained from creating them at all or have made them to be at last happy in their order and rank consistent with their natures and his own malice and difficulty having no place in such a being but any one who considers this ruinous disordered globe and the miseries darkness and wretchedness of the whole system of intelligences that inhabit it cannot but conclude one of these two either that their author had not power to make them otherwise or that they have wilfully forfeited their rank and his favor and protection by transgressing the terms and conditions on which they were entitled to it and so being left to reap the fruits of their own labor sunk into a lapsed disorderly condition    0 infinite power wisdom and goodness could primarily and originally bring no intelligence into being with rational and intelligent spirits actuating divinely organized bodies or vehicles but under these two conditions   that the organized body should be supple pliable and joyfully obedient to all the dictates and commands of the free intelligent spirit and   that the spirit should be supple pliable and obedient to the dictates and influences of the eternal and infinitely perfect spirit its author and creator and in these two its original innocence happiness and perfection must necessarily have consisted and this was and must have been the true original and paradisaical state of both body and soul of the human race and must be the constitution and complexion of the unfallen angelical state and of all the hierarchies of unlapsed spirits which two conditions i think necessarily infer a preexistent state to our present one since we do not find them in ourselves now      all created intelligences being free and finite must of consequence be fallible and liable to run into disorder as well as capable of obeying order for they could not be free unless they had the power of choosing either side selfactivity being of the essence and root of intelligence and perhaps the source from which it springs so that all created finite free intelligences were naturally capable of falling of rebellion and disorder an infinitely wise and intelligent being of sufficient power could not make another intelligent being with desires impressions and pantings after a state which was according to order to his nature and the nature of things unless at the same time he had appointed means and proper objects to satisfy these just and natural desires no beneficent and good being could act so now that we at least many of us of the human race have yet a notion and idea of a better state of being and acting than we find ourselves in and wish and pant after it is most certain and undeniable every honest and thinking person must find a law in his members that wars against the law of his mind and wishes and desires to be freed from the one that he may conform to the other now this is what is called the lapse or fall and if this state of imperfection last for ever so must the fall and till this desire or panting be satisfied the intelligent creature cannot be completely happy and for this end was the economy of jesus intended      how and by what steps the lapse was brought on is of no consequence for us precisely to know the design and point in view of all the economy of providence and of jesus is to restore us with the consent concurrence and integrity of our three radical attributes of living activity or freedom and intelligence which he cannot do violence to they being immediately derived from himself whose images and miniatures all intelligences are and the means that alone can effect this without intrenching upon these essential and radical qualities are pure love naked faith and universal resignation which means we could not perfectly use if precise truths particular and specific steps and the naked nature of things were always pointed out to us this at first at least would infallibly weaken our faith and trust counteract our resignation and destroy our liberty and therefore all that is revealed concerning this and the other truths of past future and invisible states is general undetermined and indefinite and the precision is promised only on our advancement and progress he that does the will of my father shall know of the doctrine our first lesson is just what is absolutely necessary to begin our return the knowledge of more truths and greater precision is to reward our progress the next immediate step or what is to be done daily and hourly we are never ignorant of in our duty and that is all that is necessary the rest are all wisely put out of our reach and do not belong to us now till we advance that step and when we come into the proper disposition of body and mind to benefit by the just and precise knowledge of these mentioned and suchlike divine truths though absolute precision be inconsistent with finitude we shall admire and adore the wisdom of our teacher for having concealed from us what would then have hurt us as much as for these general truths which serve sufficiently to animate and encourage us in our now traveling and probatory state for both are directed with equal wisdom if we are ignorant it is because we are not come into the proper disposition to benefit by knowledge or that more precise knowledge would hurt us and draw us out of our orbit or shortest road      if we may be allowed to conjecture with humility and modesty about such unreveald and indefinite truths and states we may reasonably think that this lapse was not brought about all at once but step by step by many machinations plots and contrivances of the superior lapsed intelligences on the inferior nemo repent fit optimus aut turpissimus finite intelligences must form and acquire all their habits by repeated acts and step by step so that in all probability the fall might have been a long time in bringing about and innumerable numbers of all the several ranks and orders and some of all the different hierarchies might have been brought into this general rebellion and have gradually departed from that pure love naked faith and universal resignation which alone made the essence of their perfection and happiness though in the brief contracted account we have of it in revelation it is comprised in a few general words which is all we in our present state it seems could bear without violence being committed on our liberties our universal resignation obstructed and the merit of pure love and a generous trust and confidence in infinite perfection destroyed more explicit and detaild accounts might have nourished pride presumption and selfsufficiency and so sunk us deeper      our senses were given us to commerciat with material objects and to perceive and enjoy the beauties of the inanimate creation as well as to limit the extension and expansion of our powers and faculties and by them all our sensations ideas and pictures of bodies and inanimate creatures are conveyed to the sentient and intelligent principle the key and mean of all our natural knowledge of them is experiment or observation performed by our senses simply or improved by art and the logic of all human and natural knowledge about them is proportion justly applied for syllogism and formal argument is but proportion expressed in abstracted terms or the ideas meant by these terms and this is the true and only mean of natural knowledge about bodies and their natural qualities and laws in spiritual truths imperceptible and immaterial beings  viz about their nature qualities and ranks can know nothing naturally and humanly unless it be infused and impressed by some other spirit but by analogy similitude allegory trope metaphor or figure referring them to and comparing them with our own intelligent and sentient spirit and its manner of operation and then clothing them with such terms or referring them to such knowledge as we have received from sensation or from proportion and this is the only mean and instrument of human knowledge we can possibly have in the nature qualities and moral relations of spirits spiritual and moral actions and duties the sentient and intelligent principle or soul is the spring or source of both keys or kinds of logic without which both would be equally useless culture and experience is in spiritual knowledge what experiment and observation is in sensitive knowledge analogy is to the first what proportion is to the second similitude allegory trope metaphor and figure all the appendages of analogy or a more distant or near approximation to it are what a more or less accurate a general or more particular experiment and observation or juster and clearer proportion applied to material objects is in sensitive knowledge and a close simple full and cogent analogy is as just and coercive a demonstration in spiritual knowledge as a mathematical or geometrical one is in sensitive knowledge scripture revelation and our own inward feelings of the operations of our soul give the data  viz the general propositions the accurate observations on them analogous to mr flamsteads or dr halleys observations of the appulses of the moon to the fixed stars from sufficient numbers of which the great orbit of the lunar revolution is determined by comparing them with the general law of attraction here revelation gives us the observations the knowledge we have of the nature of the operations of our own spirits gives us the general law and analogy may answer to algebra and calculation in astronomy and mixed mathematics and we may err and blunder in the first for want of care and attention as we may in the last being ever finite and consequently fallible      the account we have in revelation of the lapse may have a literal natural and material meaning as all the words and works of god have a natural or literal spiritual and divine meaning and use else he were not god that is a being of infinite perfection and these meanings may only develope and unfold themselves and appear to different persons according to their different degrees of purity and perfection the literal and cortical meaning and use may be fitted to elementary and initiating persons and be just and true in its degree and the others proper only for the more advanced and this with infinite variety justness and property now in mosess account of the lapse the tree of life of the knowledge of good and evil the serpent paradise and all the scene and group of this mysterious affair was certainly literal material and real as there represented and described but perhaps happened not till the last act of this tragedy paradise was certainly a most delicious and enchanting place of material and bodily delights the tree of life and its fruit was designed to perpetuat the life and health of the then newmodelld though not perhaps ethereal vehicle the tree of knowledge of good and evil certainly communicated by its fruit pain diseases and death to this partially incrusted body the serpent no doubt was a lapsed spirit embodied in this then more beautiful animal now as all this scene may have also spiritual meaning as well as a literal and elementary one of more consequence to our happiness and perfection to be known and believed as the spirit is of more value than the body why may not paradise mean in this sense the three original and fundamental powers of the soul living activity or liberty and intelligence or its original and immutable nature and constitution entrusted with us finite intelligences to cultivate improve and exalt the tree of life be him from whom all life and being proceeds the father of us all the tree of knowledge of good and evil the primary image of the deity the son of god by whose economy evil known and felt could only be done away and erazd or his divine nature justice goodness and truth which image was in the human nature defaced by trusting it to his own spirit and liberty the serpent the grand deceiver or lapsed spiritual nature in general or one of the highest order of the lapsed hierarchy and so the whole scene of the lapse may be more properly and feelingly allegorizd or explained in plain terms to an honest and ingenuous heart  viz thus all created finite intelligences being free and consequently fallible innumerable numbers of them through pride selfsufficiency and desire of independence trusting to and conducting themselves by their own natural lights as being made little deities and deriveing with their being from their author a ray efflux or infinitesimal emanation of his selfexistence infinite activity or power and infinite wisdom that is of his nature and essential attributes deriving i say dependent and derivative living freedom and intelligence but affecting independency and departing from pure love naked faith and universal resignation to infinite perfection they gradually sunk into selfishness propriety and inordinate love of the creatures and instead of being governed absolutely in all things by the providence influences impulses and suggestions of the eternal spirit they affected to be governed by their own natural spirits and selfish and narrow views and prejudices and became as it were independent unguarded and unrestrained thinkers and actors prying into and determining in all matters whatsoever and instead of being resigned to the universal reason and sovereign will and order of divine providence found fault with criticisd grumbled at and blasphemed the conduct and economy of infinite wisdom and gradually departed from pure love naked faith and trust and universal resignation the sole means to preserve them in the perfection of their dependent state and in similarity to his moral attributes and so fell from the perfect happiness of their rank and derivative being self spurious self became transubstantiated into their thus depraved natures      when human nature had thus lapsed by affecting independence and desireing to govern itself by its own natural spirit solely and wallowing in the objects of sense and swallowed in creaturepleasures it being an eternal law established in nature for many wise and great ends and by analogy as we find it extending from material to spiritual things viz that like draws and is equally drawn to like or that bodies and spirits attract and unite with similar bodies and spirits from the universal principle of attraction and union the human body did hence necessarily and mechanically as it were contract a rust grossness stupor and inactivity and became restive and disobedient to the commands of the natural spirit gradually degenerating into an earthly gross material prison or dungeon and the spirit was hereby more contracted restrained and limited in its original and immutable attributes of liveing activity and intelligence as to their extention purity the quickness and exertion of their acts for all spirits are limited and tied down to the nature order and purity of their vehicles while their union lasts though their natural powers in their fund and essence be immutable and constantly the same so that their natural spirits now being assisted by the supernatural grace and influence of the eternal spirit procured by the mediation of jesus must work out their recovery and restoration by gradually returning to their original order      perhaps as all animated beings sentient or intelligent must necessarily be clothed with some vehicle purer or grosser ethereal or planetary fitted to the mansion they are confined to and to their degree of purity in their moral powers and their extention or rank of natural powers so all created free intelligences of whatever order or degree must necessarily pass through some state of probation apprenticeship and trials of their love faith and patience before they can arrive at their final immutable and for ever permanent state and the mansion they are eternally to inhabit afterward that something like this was the general sense of mankind seems to be hinted in all pagan antiquity that we have any accounts of egyptian syrian grecian and roman by their initiations into the mysteries of their gods and this chiefly in order to produce an habitual firmness force and stability on finite free labile intelligences in the different institutions it would seem as none but god is a pure spirit in his nature and substance none but god can be infallible and impeccable and that all creatures being finite and free must necessarily by their nature be labile fallible and peccable and that even infinite wisdom and power could not make a creature for god cannot work contradictions that was of its own nature illabile infallible and impeccable but that before that secondary nature of eternal infallibility illability and impeccability could be brought about on the most perfect of created intelligences it must necessarily be by confirmed habits produced by repeated acts and perfected into pure love and naked faith or into an absolute surrendry of their natural and moral powers to infinite perfection which alone can produce derivative infallibility and illability on them and so eternize perfection and happiness and which only can be produced by various trials essays and temptations to the contrary he who never was tempted what knows he thus the son of god as man was made perfect by suffering as a potter gives firmness and impenetrability to his earthen ware by keeping it in the fire till it vitrifies had lucretia lived to all eternity her chastity would never have been doubted whereas cleopatra must not only first have made an amend honorable but have passed through several severe new trials before here is could have been believed we plainly find by revelation that many of all the several hierarchies fell on their trial for tried they must have been else they could not have fallen for reaction always supposes action as it is the nature of pride and malice to be spiteful infectious and tempting in hopes that numbers may make them overlooked or too powerful and so secure we find they or their leader suppose his name lucifer had a great hand in the human lapse as it is glanced at under the serpent that tempted eve and from this fall of the angels the natural and plain account of daemonology and the early impious heresy of the manichaeans  lucifer and his angels is to be derived what the trials of these fallen angels were and in what manner those of the angels in the several hierarchies who stood combated kept firm and unshaken and thereby were for ever confirmed established and eternized and perhaps increased and enlarged in purity luster and glory by their victory is not revealed nor to be discovered but by analogy or conjecture the history of the human lapse is so brief and obscure in moses perhaps partly allegorical partly literal with a plain design to damp idle or hurtful curiosity and so prevent our being hurt thereby by withdrawing us from the one thing necessary that it amounts almost to a total forbidding and a warning from prying with too much eagerness into this mysterious affair and to leave things secret the secreta imperii divini to god all that is certain is that we are lapsed at present or in a state of trial and probation we of the human race on this ruinous planet and cannot possibly now be as we came out of the hands of our infinitely wise good and powerful creator preexistence the manner of our lapse the duration of our banishment and the last term and limits of our restoration are with infinite wisdom and goodness in their detail concealed from us because they would infallibly hurt us if more precise they might obstruct the merit of faith or draw us out of the shortest way either of these two manners of explaining the lapse may suffice an honest modest philosopher who is sensible of his own limited faculties to make the affair neither improbable nor impossible especially when he finds himself both imperfect unhappy and unfit to be finally united with a being infinitely perfect and happy as he now is i choose the first as more conformable to revelation and the form of sound words and every modest christian philosopher will be cautious not to be wise above what is written      whether this globe of earth as we now inhabit it was the original and primitive seat of innocent and unlapsed human spirits and by the energy and force of the lapse was gradually and necessarily and according to the present laws of bodies turned into the ruinous dark dismal state it is now in and such elementary and clayey prisons made of it as our present vehicles and the human race with all the spirits concerned in the rebellion thrust down and confined upon it is not material to be known nor perhaps philosophically to be determined it seems most probable and conformable to the analogy of things and the common laws of nature that it gradually and naturally changed from its original beauty and superior place among the stars into its present ruinous and decayed state from the natural malignity and deleterious energy of the rebellion in its primitive inhabitants which perhaps was gradual what is certain is that such a place as paradise is described is now nowhere to be found on it and that balancing the inconveniences with the advantages of want of light and sun and of cold uncertain and various seasons of barrenness and mountains covered with ice and snow of the one part with the hurricanes tempests volcanos earthquakes thunder and lightning poisonous insects and ravenous and savage beasts scorching heats and pestilential winds blasts or damps of the other the whole globe is pretty near equal in conveniences and no particular place without its comforts and inconveniences so that either paradise was on some other planet or which is most natural to suppose crime rebellion and disorder have had a physical and necessary influence on the matter or vehicle belonging to each human spirit and thus the whole mass of rebellious intelligences with the globe they inhabited was naturally and physically changed and disordered i say it is most natural and philosophical and perhaps a necessary consequence of physical efficiency and energy to conclude that the spirit according to its degree of purity or depravity should purify and sublime or corrupt and disorder the elementary vehicle with which it is clothed as fire turns bodies into its own nature and cold deadens and incrassats them according to the degree of their intenseness we see luxury inordinat leachery riot and laziness first incrassat then inflame and at last mortify and putrify human and animal bodies and abstinence a low and cool regimen exercise and air lighten enliven and volatilize them and it is not impossible that a whole race and all the inhabitant mass of such corrupted and putrified bodies and depraved and degenerated spirits may have had such an insensible and gradual influence on a whole globe its atmosphere and different regions as quite to alter its original nature as we see heaps of putrefying fish insects and the carcasses of men by the fermentation and volatilization of the animal salts from intense heat produce an universal plague and pestilence as was that of athens and many others thus far the change of our planet might have been a natural and necessary consequence at least the elements or beginning of such a depravation of the bodies of its inhabitants and their habitation which no doubt infinite wisdom and power who directs the natural and necessary effects of his inanimat creation for the moral purposes of his intelligent creatures supernaturally and out of the general law established for material bodies and spiritual substances may have heightened exasperated or even quickened according to his pleasure for the wise ends and purposes of his providence and thus might have destroyed that paradise which by rebellion and disorder had been abused viz supernaturally and contrary to the general laws of the celestial motions might have changed the orbit the center of rotation the distance of the earth from the sun and the angle of the ecliptic with the equator to reverse the elements destroy its figure and structure and thus to weaken the fertility and produce the rest of the appearances we now observe on our planet and throughout the whole solar system which have many evident marks of ruin and desolation and this for a punishment and expiatory purification of the lapsed inhabitants and thus also the deluge might have been brought on after the destruction of a paradisaical globe by altering only its center of gravity and after the same manner other changes might have been produced      an animal body is nothing but a system or aggregat of mere mechanical powers viz of ropes pullies levers tubes glands strainers and the like viz one great pipe with infinite branches infinite in number fitness and delicacy secreting proper and specific liquors to keep them these solids in repair and preserve them in their due tone and a proper degree of elasticity thereby to serve the intentions and answer the ends of the intelligent spirit while confined to this planet and as i have often used the similitude i still find it the most proper viz that the body this earthly vehicle and machin is as it were a curious finely contrived organ or musical instrument whose keys stops and pipes were all originally elegantly adjusted and duly tuned for the use of the musician or indwelling spirit in this fitness and propriety to answer the purposes of the creator does the union consist if that is partly disordered this union is partially dissolved while the great and necessary parts are tolerably sound the union will still subsist though imperfectly but if these essential organs are quite spoiled the union will be totally dissolved and the inhabitants by the eternal laws of spirits must necessarily find out and pass into some other astral vehicle or musical organ proper for its then degree of purity or corruption as an insect is by the great law of instinct directed to deposit her eggs on those leaves or trees that are fittest to preserve and vivify them or a bird seeks by instinct the situation and materials for her nest that is most proper to shelter and accommodate her young and this perhaps in a continual progression from astral vehicle to vehicle perpetually refining as the rational free intelligence purifies in its moral capacity or attributes    0 matter or body is essentially incapable of any thing but division figure motion and situation it is naturally passive and to make it active or capable of selfmotion is an absolute contradiction and impossibility for two opposite and contrary principles can never subsist in the same subject and therefore it must be entirely inert and passive and for ever continue in the state it is put in unless it be changed by some external force and that can never be effected but by a spirit or spiritual substance which on the contrary is essentially selfactive and selfmotive and by its agency determines the motion and rest and different directions and actions of bodies it is true this agency is under certain restrictions being limited and subjected to the general laws of the nature of bodies but the beginning end and degree of the force and motion and all other changes produced in bodies are from the energy and action of spiritual substances either primary or secondary original or created so that where matter mechanism and its powers and laws end there spiritual agency and energy begin and therefore i fear that sir isaac newtons spiritus quidam subtilissimus descartess and leibnitzs vortices hugenss and fatios infinitely rare rapid subtle matter with the qualities they must endow them to solve appearances i mean only in animated bodies for in inanimat it may be required nay some such fluid seems necessary i think is i fear imaginary and without foundation from sufficient experiment or the anology of nature unless by their infinitely subtle matter they mean real spiritual substance or else the first elements of bodies for matter must be extended divisible inert and gravitat else it can be no longer matter and when such immaterial and as it were selfmoving matter is granted it will separate us but one step further from spiritual substance and agency or the perpetual influence of the first cause in whom all things live move and have their being and i fear the whole of the supposition how mechanical and adequat soever to answer appearances in all animated beings and in all accounts of it given by these great men has not that simplicity and beauty conspicuous in and essential and necessary to all the works of god i e to infinite wisdom and power of the same kind are animal spirits in the account of muscular motion and on the whole i can conceive matter no otherwise but as divided extended moved and figured and actuated and directed by spirit which only can act on it by its own selfmotive energy though that too is limited and circumscribed by matter in all created spirits if experiment or repeated observations should ascertain the existence of such an infinitely rare and elastic matter necessarily which i fear it will hardly do then we must submit to receive it but i think since resistance will always necessarily accompany matter in motion how small rare or elastic soever it will of consequence at last alter the figure and direction and abate the force and figure of the particles so as to render them unfit to produce the effect and answer present appearances and perhaps this system may be so ordained at first thus to end but still as we must stop somewhere at last and admit of spiritual agency to impress the first motion nothing but repeated and undeniable experiment and observation should induce us to multiply causes and allow any such fluid intervening between animated matter and the first or secondary movers this will be better understood by an example it is well known what pains have been taken and how many hypotheses have been framed not only by physicians but geometers of the first rank to explain muscular motion and all i think hitherto in vain this subtle matter under the name of animal spirits or at least in propagating them and even sir isaacs spiritus subtilissimus has been employed for this purpose though with little satisfaction to most attentive and qualified judges how much more natural philosophical and simple is it to suppose the nerves to be infinitely delicat and mechanically adjusted membranous tubes twists or ropes whose elasticity and mechanism is preserved by an internal milky soft pith which membranes receive their first impression and impulse from the selfmotive principle within us for the selfmoveing principle must communicate the first impulse either on this supposed intermediat fluid or on these membranes and either of them is equally unintelligible and explicable but the last is the shortest way and therefore likeliest to be the method of the author of nature who always works the shortest way and after the simplest manner as may be mathematically demonstrated in all his real and natural workings and communicate and propagat it by proper and harmonious oscillations to the muscles by whose mechanical structure those harmonious motions are excited into action by that admirable mechanism so fully and justly explained by the learned and ingenious dr alexander stewart how much more simple and natural is it to conceive that the surfaces of bodies their effluvia or repelling steams communicate certain justly proportioned and commensurable undulations vibrations and tremors to such membranous pipes which the natural sagacity of the intelligent principle knows by its own innate powers to indicat the presence of such and such bodies in the same manner as the governor of a besieged town or the several ships of a fleet understand what such a number of guns or such a flag import and signify thus things are easy intelligible and simple we daily see and hear what fine pieces of music a skilful musician can fling off a welltuned instrument from the various motions of his fingers or voice but this i propose as a mere illustration if experiment should show the necessity of the mentioned ethereal fluid even then i think it will take place only in unanimated nature and if there is any regard to be had to such an hypothesis before it be absolutely decided by experiment it must be because nature and its author never act by starts fits and intervals but by slow uniform and imperceptible degrees though the progression is often not to be determined by finite experiments or finite capacities but even though the organs of sense may and do want media the animal functions are too intimat and necessary to life to need such      life activity and intelligence are natural and necessary in some degree to all spiritual beings as all the consequences and combinations of them are as being miniatures sparkles or infinitesimals of the deity all of the same order rank or hierarchy have these nearly in the same degree and these hierarchies and ranks differ only in their degrees of these primary attributes what may make the most apparent difference in this state of things in the individuals of the same rank or species is perhaps the more coarse or elegant texture or the fitness or unfitness of their ethereal vehicles in their first formation as they primarily came out of the hands of their maker all the radical differences conspicuous in the human race now are owing to the different frame texture and culture of their bodily machin and its spiritual organs so that originally there must have been no difference of sexes because at last in their restored and recovered state there will be none they will in that respect be like the angels as revelation expressly asserts something analogous to creative fecundity possibly may be even in angels and primarily may have been too in the human race because of their similarity and resemblance to those angels and to their grand original the deity i say some miniature resemblance of his creative power might have been in them beneficent nature must be necessarily communicative and earnestly desirous there may be infinitely more beings to contemplat worship and adore the infinitely perfect being and admire the operations of his hands to imitat him and partake of his felicity but how this creative power or earnest desire of more intelligences operated then i will not take upon me to conjecture but certain it is that the division of the sexes was after the lapse was begun and perhaps when it was far advanced possibly to put a drag on it and prevent the final degeneracy into selflove or an idolatrous and unnatural commerce with the brute creation      it is both philosophical and highly probable to suppose that the bodies as well as the spirits of all the human race were created at one and the same time at least were sent into these adamical dungeons they now inhabit at one and the same time the spirit endowed with the three radical qualities of life activity and intelligence in the perfection that belonged to its order and species and the body in the perfection of their then estate at least in the original and first stock in whose loins were included in miniatures and infinitesimals in a perpetual progression descending all the race and mass that should ever exist of that species this will be no difficulty to those who know and understand the infinite divisibility of matter and the doctrine of first second third and consequent fluxions or differences as they are now demonstrated and explained these infinitesimal bodies have probably been animated and growing in their own manner and according to their laws from their first formation and from the time of the primary general creation till they arrived at their full maturity no doubt both these miniature and mature bodies were vastly different from what we find our lapsed earthly tabernacles now are as the spirit was perfect in its kind so was the body as the spirit was pliant supple and cheerfully obedient to the influences of the eternal spirit which was breathed into it by the spirit of god viz pure disinterested love so was the body pliant and obedient to the commands of the human spirit all was order peace love and harmony and probably the frame and figure of the body might be in many particulars different from what we now find it as we have observed of the difference of the sexes in the former section and these differences may be necessary in one state of the progression and may naturally drop off and decay in another when of no further use instances of which we may see in the different shapes of seminal animalculs eggs nymphae and young insects from what they have when arrived at maturity of a chick in the egg from what it is when perfectly grown in the several stages of the silkworm and most other animated beings vegetables as well as animals and this is a just and wise contrivance and evidently demonstrates design in the maker to fit the living creature for its several situations but what is most material is that even this now adamical and gross tabernacle of ours must necessarily contain under it the principles elements springs and linear root of that ethereal or paradisaical body it was created in and of that perhaps glorious body it will be restored to at last in the final recovery which perhaps are both the same but this can be no difficulty to those who know that the rays of the sun are but matter and body which may be contained in a dungeon of putrefaction and in a dunghill as well as in the azure sky and that the particles of matter attract and repel each other in different circumstances and purify and sublime as well as incraffat and condense by the mere force and energy of the present laws of nature and this law by which the whole stock of such an order and rank of intelligences advances in a certain progression toward happiness and perfection the confirmation and stability of which is only to be found in the last and most perfect state of purity and happiness as being free but finite and consequently fallible creatures must absolutely depend on and be brought about by experience confirmed habits many appropriated trials and much gradual labor for nothing is more certain than the axiom nemo repent fit turpissimus aut optimus this law i say of deriving the whole race from such a radical stock in an increasing progression was a noble design and of infinite love and wisdom for rendering the succeeding and posterior generations partakers of all the acquisitions of wisdom knowledge and other improvements of their predecessors but as corruption optimi est pessima by the lapse all the contrary has happened and  aet as parentum pejor avis tulit so that what infinite love and goodness could not effect that is render finite fallible intelligences fixed and eternally stable in order and purity punishment experience and trial may at last effect though in an unnatural and retrograde manner but for this misfortune infinite wisdom is no more to be blamed than a kind father that leaves a comfortable subsistence to a prodigal son is to be charged with the miseries and diseases he has contracted in squandering it      there may possibly be original difference in the complexion and frame of the spirits of the same rank and order of intelligences some have one or more of their natural and radical attributes in a greater degree of perfection than others which certainly are heightened by the different degrees of perfection and improvement of their moral qualities it being sufficient to constitute their degree or rank that the sum total of their qualities one to compensat the other be originally pretty near equal but i should think the greatest difference consists in the culture the righteous man is more excellent than his neighbor says the royal prophet which is only from his cultivating into higher habits his moral qualities and it is the same with both parts of the compound the qualities of which in all finite free intelligences must ever depend to a certain degree on culture and improvement in the docility or facility of the spirit and pliancy of the body he that by study entering into his own heart thinking reflecting remembering and acting cultivats his spirit will continually acquire a facility quickness and penetration in intellectual opperations and he that by air exercise a low diet and proper and welltimd remedies improves and heightens his health and perfects his animal functions will be fitter and more capable to improve his intellectual faculties the bodily machine disordered or spoiled will sink debase blunt and confound the operations of the spirit and the spirit violently agitated or too closely confined will disturb the economy of the bodily functions and the perfect state of health and the last perfection of all intelligent creatures consisting of an intelligent spirit and a material machine depends on the perfect sanity and harmony of both united in their respective order and rank a superior degree of perfection in either will consist with an inferior degree in the other but when either the spirit is quite uncultivated or in an infinitesimal degree only the radical qualities of living activity and intelligence may be dwindled into that one of mere living as in children and idiots perhaps brutes and when the body is much in disorder the spiritual faculties however cultivated either wander at random or act irregularly but the fund of the spirit or the radical qualities may be eternally the same invariable and unalterable in their order and rank whatever happens to the bodily machine only the sensible and elicited acts will vary and alter or which is the same thing the radical qualities of living activity and intelligence may be invariable in the rank and degree proper to such a species of spiritual nature whatever machine or bodily organ it be clothed with only it cannot exert its elicit or exterior acts without a proper machine as a musician is still in his nature and fund a good musician whether he has an organ or musical instrument to play on or not or whatever sort of musical instrument he has but he never can perform an harmonious pleasant piece of music without having a perfect and proper musical instrument an angel is still an angel in his nature whatever vehicle he appear in but cannot perform his office to the human species unless he appear in some shape or vehicle familiar and proper to his commission so that as to the human species the present body and vehicle was designed and is necessary only to commerciat and communicate with the system of bodies or beings clothed with material and sensible appearances and qualities as they now are in their ruinous state for as to invisible imperceptible and spiritual objects and beings the first elements of any knowledge about them must entirely and solely be derived from analogy to the ideas and resemblances of things conveyed to the sentient principle through the senses and when these elementary steps are gone through and become familiar and easy spiritual agency and operation if such be allowed may then begin its influence and effects for when the mind has been duly cultivated and habituated to a faculty of thinking to abstracted sentiments reflections and ideas then rational spiritual and closer thinking becomes familiar and easy but the rudiments and initial procedure must be derived through the senses in perceptions and ideas excited by matter and its qualities but improved by analogy and its appendages trope metaphor similitude and hieroglyphic      the natural progression and final cause or reason of this economy as far as philosophical reasoning may go in such matters may be this the original and radical qualities of all spiritual natures being as has been often said liveing activity and intelligence and these being unalterable and eternally the same in the specific order and rank a vast number perhaps of all the several orders of the hierarchies lapsed and fell and ran into rebellion and disorder being finite and free and so defaced and lost their moral qualities of justice goodness and truth infinite wisdom and love then always intending to recover and restore his lapsed creatures must by the eternal unalterable laws of his nature bring it about in a manner consistent with their original and radical qualities that is by preserving their life or liveing their activity or liberty and their intelligence or understanding in loseing their moral attributes they perhaps lost or spoiled their paradisaical or glorious body with which they were originally clothed and were newcloathd over it with a crass unactive tabernacle or prison such as we find our present adamical one now is by which means our radical qualities were greatly confined and more narrowly circumscribed and we were reduced to a state of annihilation and extinction as to them as it were for a long tract of time our radical qualities of liveing activity and intelligence being thus reduced to the single one of liveing as the whole human race actually once were in the loins of their first parent adam or whoever was the first of the human race from that time they have been developeing extending and unfettering their adamical tabernacles every one in his order thus spread over the internal ethereal vehicle till they came to a certain degree of maturity and had formed the several newcloathd organs pipes and springs of this second adamical machin fit to perform the probatory and expiatory harmony in this period of duration in order to acquire and regain their moral attributes of justice goodness and truth and to return into order and consequential happiness finite beings are absolutely incapable to regain these moral attributes consistent with their natural and necessary ones but by a gradual progress  viz by labor patience experience and trial by which they may be gradually confirmed into permanent habits and advanced to the degree of their order and rank or perhaps higher and thus their natural attributes being depressed and sunk into an equality with their moral ones by being thus clothed and circumscribed with gross vehicles their natural powers are preserved from violence and only sopited for a time till the moral qualities begin to rise and then both may go on in the same pace which it would seem could by no other possible or imaginable means be so consistently brought about for the natural attributes of liveing activity and intelligence preserved at their utmost original extent must necessarily have counteracted and clashed with the acquisition of the moral attributes to any degree of perfection for example innate precise knowledge and a penetrating understanding in any thing in this our lapsed estate would necessarily have counteracted dependence meekness poverty of spirit humility pure love and universal charity and unbounded liberty must have clashd with restraints submission and resignation now at least so absolutely necessary to the acquisition of the moral powers to any degree and so of the rest of the moral attributes but by thus depressing the natural attributes to the level of the moral ones both may without violence be in time restored to their appointed order and degree that is they gradually and step by step may be turned into permanent habits by the divine grace and the economy of jesus      hence the moral attributes being defaced by the lapse and the natural ones brought down to a level with them by confining them to gross vehicles or prisons the whole of the intellectual operations must in some measure depend on the bodily machin as well as the degree and perfection of the moral attributes in this present lapsed state at least in its first steps and initiation the intellectual operations can never be so regularly and perfectly exerted while the body is in disorder a sick and diseased person seldom perceives truly nor reasons justly and a vicious person never judges solidly that is by number weight and measure nor acts perfectly but that this may be more clearly understood it may want a little further detail i say nothing here of a possible passive state in advanced christianity that being above philosophy or conjecture and perhaps the last scene of the drama of restoration      what men call a genius or a man of fine natural parts a hero or a philosopher before the fund the whole created spiritual substance or the moral as well as the natural attributes be acquired and cultivated into a habit is much owing to the perfection of the machin or vehicle and its spiritual or ethereal now clothed over with clay organs the intellectual faculties require proper organs springs ropes and pipes to perform their operations by as well as the senses and these probably are the arteriolae fibrils and membranous tubuli prolonged of the cortical and glandular parts of the brain which are diversified and delicatly modified ad infinitum the detail and mechanism of which never was nor perhaps ever will be philosophically explained but that the perfection of the intellectual operations in our present state depends in some measure on the soundness and integrity of the body and these particular organs there are many undeniable evidences to prove as shall be afterward shown what i would here insinuat is that the delicacy fineness and perfection of one set of these intellectual organs beyond that of another set is that which makes the genius hero or philosopher thus the health of the body being good and sound if a man has warm but sharp blood with very elastic and strong pungent nerves but the particular organs of thinking attention and reflection indifferently agile only he may make a hero if his blood be cool soft mild and sweet and his intellectual organs very elastic or agile he may make a philosopher or lawgiver and so of the other differences of natural spirits among the human race in all of whom the fund or natural attributes may be pretty near equal but whatever equality there may be in the natural qualities of such spirits the difference in the moral ones makes the human species to differ at last widely even in the exercise of natural ones for the true criterion of a right and sound understanding and perfect judgment is to examine things by number weight and measure according to their nature and relations and then to estimat and prefer them according to their intrinsic worth and importance thus determined and in this sense it is true only that the righteous man is more excellent than his neighbor that is wiser as well as better and that the acquisition and culture of the moral qualities not only show the justness and strength of the natural ones but also enlarge augment and perfect them both as they necessarily mend and improve the bodily health by temperance and abstinence and consequently rectify and tune the organs of the intellectual faculties but likewise as they cultivat and extend all the powers of the spirit by study close thinking by actions and abstraction and other intellectual operations employed in the acquisition and exercise of these moral qualities      that the perfection and full free and just use of the intellectual faculties depends in a great measure on the soundness and health of the bodily machin more particularly of the organs of these intellectual faculties is evident from many considerations  st the body was designed to concentre and circumscribe the spiritual powers to confine and imprison them for a time and fit them only grossly to commerciat with other bodies on this present ruinous planet and must purify and refine according to the degree of the acquisition and perfection of the moral attributes as has been explained and every step in this acquisition necessarily tends to develop and enlarge the natural and radical attributes as has likewise been hinted from whence their mutual dependence on each other becomes evident in this our lapsed state our gross and earthly prisons were designed by infinite wisdom to curb concentre and restrain the exalted functions of the radical and intellectual faculties in proportion to the defacement and decay of the moral ones that being both on a level they might rise advance and perfect by equal degrees without clashing or contradiction without which our ruin must have been eternal our lapse perpetual and our recovery impossible the natural and radical qualities in their utmost extent being evidently contradictory to and destructive of the acquisition and improvement of the moral ones and the whole restoration must be brought about by the culture of the moral qualities which perfect and develop the natural ones and thereby purify and sublime the vehicle extend and form the intellectual organs so that in the first steps at least of this progressive purification the perfection of the acts of the intellectual faculties depend on and are in proportion to the perfection of their natural and bodily organs  dly we experimentally find the intellectual faculties and operations depend on the body in all acute and chronical especially those called nervous distempers the raveings incoherences and distractions in the first and the unaccountable terrors panics inconstancies dispondence and cowardice of the last are sufficient proofs of this and demonstrat the necessity of a proper crase in the juices and the soundness and proper elasticity of the solids and organs in all the intellectual functions and operations but eminently so in the first steps of our renovation  dly we actually find and are ocularly sensible in an embryo in infancy in seminal miniatures that the whole of the natural powers are concentred and imprisoned and that it is in their growth only and in the developing of their organs and in the enlargement of the doors windows and aperture of the senses that their intellectual faculties ever enlarge themselves to any degree  thly we find that luxury leachery intemperance laziness strong and violent passions inclement and pestilential air bruises and accidents that injure the arterial and nervous system always hurt and sometimes destroy the free exercise of these faculties and the acquisition of virtue at least of some virtues as well as science and that proper remedies and due management recover and restore them again  thly abstracting from the probability and analogical evidence that the bodies of the whole race were actually formed lived grew and extended in the loins of the first original pair we see plainly as i have hinted that every individual begins with as it were a mere vegetable life while in embryo in seminal miniature and in the mothers womb that when it is born it has scarce more than an animal life in which it continues much longer than any other animal we know and that it rises by slow and imperceptible degrees into a rational life from which it is evident that the powers of the soul are sunk concentred imprisoned and contracted by its unformed tabernacle or organical vehicle and cannot exert its intellectual functions but gradually and insensibly and as the bodily and intellectual organs are formed and that for this wise and gracious end that the moral powers and virtues of the soul may have time liberty and leisure by repeated acts to turn into habits and so all three may equally develop and extend together  viz the natural and radical powers which in their capacity and original energy are invariable and the moral attributes of the soul and their mechanical and material organs  thly but what is in this case a demonstration is that all the vital functions and sensations are all performed by the spirit by the intermediation only of motions vibrations and tremors properly modified and impressed by bodies or their effluvia on rightly disposed membranous tubuli elastic threads or filaments which motions or vibrations the soul naturally and by its own innate and radical powers and sagacity knows to denote the presence of such and such bodies and their actions thus seeing is performed by the impressions of the rays of light emitted or reflected by the surfaces of bodies which by the size of their component particles and other circumstances exciteing particular vibrations and undulations on the elastic optic nerves point out to the sagacious spirit innately and naturally endowed with such a capacity of perceiving and judging the presence of such and such bodies and in a manner analogous to this is hearing feeling and all the other senses performed and muscular motion may be performed much in the same way  thly to confirm all this and that observations and fact may justify and demonstrat speculation it is certain and almost infallible that ponderous medicines duly and properly prepared and adjusted and a low cool thin diet persisted in a due time and joined with air and exercise will generally restore the free and perfect use of the intellectual faculties not only to those who have destroyed or hurt them by luxury and laziness but even to such as have derived them with their birth or from accidents or parents if the organs themselves be not entirely confounded or spoiled at least in some degree sufficient to demonstrat the proposition and every one knows that this method and these medicines only mend the juices and open obstructions of this i could give some such instances having treated several such cases that i could venture my reputation on some degree of success of the method when applied early and in due time before the noble organs be quite spoiled and if philosophy have any thing certain or true it is this that quo posito ponitur and quo sublato tollitur in eo consistit ejus rei essentia a great deal more i could urge but this must suffice to the honest inquirer and fair philosopher else nothing will      from all which it is evident that it is to experience culture and probation removing obstacles and impediments that we must apply both for the extention and improvement of the natural and moral powers of the soul and for the perfection of the intellectual organs of the body all three since the lapse have been contracted imprisoned or concentred as it were to a punctum saliens as the naturalists speak of the beginning incubation of a chick from an egg to be extended and dilated to a given state of maturity and perfection altogether proper for its order and rank and alone and only to be brought about at first by the culture of others its parents nurses and masters while under age and afterward by its own industry attention and diligence in a proper method when come to maturity so that the whole perfection of body soul and spirit by soul and spirit i always mean the natural and moral powers depend on proper culture experience and trials and our whole lapsed state is probatory experimental and progressive and from our vegetable through our brutal and rational up to our restored first paradisaical and last divine fixed and immovable state the whole progress is in a great measure our own work though under general laws both for spirits and bodies but with supernatural or if you please miraculous aids and assistances from time to time to be the rewards and motives of our diligence and zeal though perhaps they are never to be felt or distinguished till the whole progression is at an end which progression might or may be much after this manner as far as can be conjectured from things as they now appear the human race was originally made in the scale of intelligences and in that cone of creation if i may be allowed the similitude without offending weak minds and low philosophers which seems to ascend from inert and passive matter through the human species to the angels and beyond the cherubims and seraphins up to the utmost extent that created finite free intelligence reaches all which in their natural powers are infinitesimals respectively and unalterably of their great original the deity but at an infinitely infinite distance from him as they ought and must be but in a verging progression of similarity to him in their natural as well as moral powers i say the human species being made a little lower only than the angels with bodies or earthly machins supple and pliant to their in dwelling spiritual intelligences and with spirits supple and pliant to the influences impulses and commands of the father of spirits in which their innocence and felicity consisted and being free and consequently capable of a progressive procedure from this original state of their creation either forward to perfection and happiness to a certain degree which probably might fix them in the extention of their original powers though not in the greatest perfection of their moral ones and consequently in their greatest happiness or a departure backward into disorder rebellion spurious selflove inordinat love of the creatures propriety and consequently misery their creator eternally designing to restore them to their first or perhaps a higher rank placed them first upon this ball of clay which had been either naturally and physically ruined and spoiled by their own immoral taint and corruption or was by his own omnipotent agency and confined them to prisons and dungeons made of this planet though with infinite wisdom and elegancy and with a sublime delicacy adjusted to the nature of their lapse or the ends of their probation and purification whereby their natural powers being cramped and concentred to the degree of the decay of their moral powers they may by their own labor and culture but supernaturally assisted advance proportionally in both to the stature and degree appointed them in their original formation and perhaps higher and in the mean time perhaps dropping through many different vehicles and material bodies grosser or more sublime either dungeons or partially glorious bodies as they have advanced or gone backward in the acquisition of the moral attributes justice goodness and truth or which is the same in the christian language of the cardinal virtues faith hope and charity which justly explained are of the same import      the human soul or intelligent principle has its radical qualities and faculties that it was endowed with in its first creation essentially inherent and innate in its nature and in their full extent and perfection even now in this lapsed state perhaps beyond the vigor they can ever arrive at in this mortal life only cramped and sopited by this gross and earthly prison like a felon in a dungeon or condemned hole and as it has the power or root of the senses of seeing hearing and feeling almost the same as when at entire liberty in its ethereal vehicle though now confined to darkness silence and unactivity and can only see and hear as through a grate or narrow chink yet it has its natural powers and their bodily organs as vigorous and lively as when it was at large though it be not in a capacity to exert them in the same degree by reason of its heavy clay coverlet and this gross earthly tabernacle actually contains under it the organical lines and stamina of that glorious paradisaical and first created body it was endowed with before the lapse or of the more glorious one it will be solely clothed with in its final perfection and restoration though both for they are one and the same now covered over and encrusted with gross mouldering clay and both soul and body as they are now in this lapsed state will gradually drop and put off this adamical tabernacle and slide into another and perhaps a third according to the general laws of purification and in proportion as the spiritual inhabitant advances in perfection till at last it arrive at that fixed and permanent state and the place and mansion it was designed for in the universal system of intelligences    0 from this account if agreeable with the universal analogy of things and the general laws of providence relating to the lapse and purification of intelligences it will follow that intellectual acts and exercises are but remembrance and removeing impediments or but the spirits returning to its original and primitive state that culture study and reflection and all the operations of the mind are really and not figuratively but lopping pruning dressing and removeing obstacles and encumbrances and forming the bodily organs to a proper suppleness and facility for the performance of spiritual exercises and to produce habits that the study of arts and sciences and all other knowledge is but remembrance and recollection opening passages and apertures to admit more light into the prison and dungeon which can only effectually be done by the acquisition of the moral powers of justice goodness and truth or of faith hope and charity and this not figuratively but in reality and by fixed habits in a word the soul has essentially and radically in its fund and nature innate and permanent all the natural powers in their full extent and degree that ever it can possibly arrive at here but they covered over sopited and concentred by the gross adamical prison and is only deprived of its moral powers in its present lapsed state which moral powers it is sent here to recover      the exercise of the natural powers of the soul  viz of liveing activity and intelligence is the general state and complexion of all spiritual natures liveing means supposes and implies the actuating informing directing and superintending the several motions and functions of a divinely organized material either ethereal or planetary grosser or more refined vehicle according to the economy of providence in its restoration and in giving motions and directions to bodies or matter to a certain degree memory is but an affection or modification of the understanding fixing it to a particular object as seeking any thing absent or lost is but a particular attention and observation or detention of the eye on the different objects presented and that the understanding has proper organs for the different uses and purposes of perceiving considering and fixing its attention as the eye has various muscles tendons humors and glands for directing fixing and perfecting its sight and memory is just such a modification of the understanding as searching or seeking is of the eye and all is performed through the mechanical powers and organs of the body by the innate sagacity of the mind and hence it comes to pass that when these mechanical powers and organs of the body are quick and agile to present variety of images pictures and ideas with readiness the person is ingegious fanciful poetical or of a quick and lively imagination if the organs of the imagination the nervous fibrillae the membranous tubuli be strong and firm the impressions or ideas being dureable the memory becomes strong the understanding is merely passive it is like the vis inertiae of matter or reflection and refraction in it of which it is the analogous quality in the soul and this vis inertiae is one of the last steps of the descending miniature of the divine original in his inanimat creation truth is to the understanding what light is in animal life to the eye it must be received absolutely and only according to the then state of the mind it is the will that is the ruling and directing faculty of spiritual nature and its analogous quality in inanimated matter is attraction and repulsion all depend on it it rules absolutely and without control even sometimes over the understanding and every faculty of the soul it is the selfactive and selfmotive principle acting above and beyond matter at a distance without the intervention of a material medium by its own energy and after its specific manner of operation as is evident from instinct impulse sympathy and antipathy conscience natural affection and the like immechanical affections of the soul matter only limits and modifies its operations and renders it capable to commerciat and communicate with bodies by acting upon them and being reacted upon by them the will may and can act without and contrary to the judgment conviction and approbation of the understanding selfactivity and selfmobility necessarily secluding all foreign aid and from it the first springs direction and perfection of the understanding often take their rise but generally they advance by the same steps in their purification only the probatory and purifying process in the lapsed state both in the acquisition of the moral attributes and in the culture and development of the bodily organs of the faculties gradually and by uniform acceleration like the velocity of descending bodies receives its constant impulse from the will      some have thought that the wills of all intelligences were so ordered by the divine decree and appointment that they should be so absolutely free as to become even independent of his influence and prescience and that their liberty should be in a natural equilibrium to do whatever their original powers could possibly effect and be determined by their own strength only and affirmed that so much a selfmotive power does necessarily imply and that accordingly god was not actually certified of the lapse till it happened in the angelical hierarchy that the divine nature may actually have arbitrary ideas they think necessarily follows from his natural infinite liberty which they suppose a consequence of the absolute infinitude of all his attributes and the base and root of his infinite intelligence or omniscience for no creature is free but must be at the same time intelligent and all intelligent creatures are naturally images of him and since intelligent creatures such as we are have arbitrary ideas as is evident from our being able to act contrary to our judgment and contrary to our present and future greater good were it but to show the nature of our liberty in any one instance for example to suffer present or future certain pain as in suicide therefore there must by analogy be concluded a correspondent power of infinitely more force and perfection in the divine nature it is true omniscience could certainly foreknow whatever omnipotence could effect but both omniscience and omnipotence being in the divine nature infinitely free they think it a higher instance of perfection and power for a free omniscience voluntarily to design not to know what his omnipotence might effect on his free intelligent creation and that it implies not want of perfection and power but on the contrary is a much higher instance of perfection and power for an infinitely perfect being to create intelligences that should be naturally in such a degree of freedom that even he himself should not foreknow what they were to do but should as it were voluntarily and arbitrarily suspend  jesus christ say the fathers suspended the influence of his divinity on his humanity he made himself of no report he took upon himself the form of a servant the greatest instance of his divinity possible the influence and penetration of his omniscience to magnify and manifest his omnipotence he might no doubt have foreknown every thing that should ever be effected or brought to pass by the selfmotive powers of his created miniature images but he might also designedly and arbitrarily not foresee or foreknow all this to enoble his intelligent creatures thereby that so they might be free even from his espial and observation for a trial of their faith and patience as a tender mother tries her fondlings strength and gait by letting go the leadingstring and thus leave them a possession and property that they might be fitter objects of his commerce and glory and that they might have something in dominion and heritage that in gratitude they might render back to him which even he now he had created them could not force from them perhaps such a creature might become a nobler instance of infinite wisdom and power than one all whose future thoughts and actions were certainly foreknown even by omniscience as a skilful watchmaker might make a watch or clock whose time of going or striking he might not foreknow or could not foretell that absolutely depending on the length of the chain tied to the spring or weight which he had in his power not to have measured this bold and profane supposition of gods designed and arbitrary nonforeknowledge of his finite free intelligences future actions would indeed entirely take off all the difficulties and objections against the lapse about liberty prescience and predestination and justify the darkness and distresses in providence revelation and the whole economy of the restoration but whether it is perfectly consistent with the harmony and simplicity and absolute infinitude and dignity of the divine nature and attributes i dare not take upon me to determine and since infinite sagacity and penetration like that of a wise and good minister of state will account for prescience without influencing or intrenching on liberty i am much rather inclined to subscribe to it infinite perfection can provide for the perfection and happiness of his creature without any prejudice to himself      all intelligent creatures being as i have often said effluxes emanations and analogous infinitesimals of the deity must necessarily be impressed with his image for though they be finite dependent and created yet being free so far they are little analogical divinities and though they flowed from him as their source yet by this their liberty they are able to hold as it were in property an infinitesimal portion of his spiritual nature and qualities and thereby have something of their own to give him back and thus to commerciat with him and at last to return to him as their last end just as the last and least particles of water being probably spherical or spheroidical may retain their own figure when received into the universal volume of all fluids of the ocean and are actuated by its motions or like the fish which though in the sea yet all of them preserve their own forms or rather like the iron in the oven which being turned into liquified fire yet retains its own shape just so all created intelligences may preserve their own principles of individuation when they are restored to the rock out of which they were hewn but these lame and unanimated allusions i adduce only as illustrations of this incomprehensible subject for creation though a necessary article to be believed in all the systems of natural religion is as incomprehensible and inexplicable as any mystery in revealed unless it be by analogy and it is no hard matter then to conceive any thing is that actually exists especially where infinite power is supposed the cause and when it does not involve an absolute contradiction as these analogical allusions show this does not however this explication be received i think it selfevident that in their creation or emanation from the first cause all intelligences have been impressed with gods image and are really thereby infinitesimal deities and that the natural powers attributes and faculties we feel in our own souls may fairly be carried up to absolute infinitude by analogy and in some imperfect and gross manner be so raised as to give a shadowy glance or faint idea of the supreme being the deity and that our liberty may not be violated and our restoration may be secured i fear this is as precise as we can reach in this our lapsed estate while we dwell in earthly prisons i mean by philosophy or mere reasoning only without revelation or divine faith and therefore whatever natural powers qualities or faculties we find in our own souls at least in the best and most perfect of our race we may safely conclude there are powers qualities and faculties eminently correspondent and analogous to them in the divine nature with the difference that absolute infinitude has to the lowest finite and on the other hand that there are miniature resemblances in all finite intelligences correspondent and analogous to the essential and fundamental attributes in the divine nature and consequently that we may fairly reason and philosophize with the modesty and humility that become the lowest of intelligences from our own spiritual nature up to the divine spiritual nature keeping within the bounds and proportion mentioned for example we find and certainly know that in our own spiritual nature there are liveing understanding and will and that all our intellectual operations are but modifications of these these then must be the natural image of the divine being originally impressed on our souls we learn from revelation that in the divine nature there is a trinity of persons in unity of substance we may then fairly conclude that in some manner or other the three radical powers of liveing understanding and will are the natural miniature image and representation of this trinity in unity in the divine nature the three analogous and correspondent attributes are selfexistence omniscience and omnipotence in other words necessity of being infinite wisdom and infinite activity in all created intelligences there are a derived being or liveing finite understanding and limited will or freedom this analogy or correspondence i say between the divine nature and the spiritual nature of all finite intelligences may give us at least some general notion of the trinity in unity for precision is incompatible with finitude and all i pretend to here is to remove contradiction and impossibility from an uncomprehensible and inexplicable mystery selfexistence or necessity of being is the proper characteristic of the father in revelation i am that i am or i am the sole being that is necessary existence the word the wisdom the understanding of the father the express image of his intelligent nature the sovereign reason is the characteristic of the son in scripture the holy ghost or the spirit of the father and the son  viz their infinite activity energy and power is represented there as a liveing enlightening actuating comforting and instructing intelligent substance and shadowed out to us by the most penetrating energic things known to wit wind light and fire and so may be explained by our selfmotive power our liberty the spring of pure love naked faith and universal resignation all these three and i think the natural attributes of the deity are but three natural powers and faculties are comprehended in one spiritual nature in all created intelligences in them they are modalities only powers or faculties but in the divine nature they are realities and active distinguished subsistences because of its infinite activity for nothing is more certain in philosophy than the metaphysical and scholastic axiom that every thing in god is god i might with a good deal of philosophical propriety run this analogy up to all the qualities and attributes ascribed in scripture to the persons of the holy trinity but i give it only as a philosophical emblem allusion or similitude to reconcile that inexplicable mystery to modest sober and guarded thinkers for it is still much better to adore and obey and wish or pray to believe as the holy spirit in revelation intended the best we can in the holy trinity than to philosophize about it the two capital errors in the doctrine of the trinity especially of the incarnation and divine nature of the persons which is the hinge of the doctrine of the trinity is the arian and sabellian heresies both which are of great detriment to christian perfection and the practice of its cardinal virtues faith hope and charity or the acquisition of the moral powers of the soul but with a very notable difference the arian being of infinitely more detriment to sublime practical christianity than the sabellian heresy the first dwindling and sinking the merit dignity and love his sufferings and satisfaction and consequently dishonouring and debasing the divine nature purity and the merit of the common savior of the lapsed mortals and thereby the motives and necessity of pure love naked faith and universal resignation the sole means of our recovery and immobility and perhaps among all the apostles martyrs and confessors and universally acknowledged saints there will not be found one who notably leaned to this heresy the sabellian on the contrary though certainly heretical too arrogantly departing from the form of sound words yet has preserved the dignity and purity of all these motives the greatness of the love of god the sanctity of his nature and heinousness of sin and is only too philosophically nice out of a dread of intrenching on the unity of the divine nature i was the more willing to retouch this speculation because what i have advanced about it in my philosophical principles of revealed religion has been misunderstood else i had not meddled with it here as being out of my present province for which i ought to beg the readers pardon this mystery was not revealed to puzzle our reason but for a trial of our faith and a motive to our resignation and because its truth was necessary to the conception of the general plan of the restoration and the understanding practiseing and perfecting the christian virtues and morality      the soul and body at first sopited in a state of mere vegetable life in the seminal animalcul and in embryo is there developing vegetats and lives perhaps for many ages according to their own general laws and the secret designs of providence in time the compound comes into the light and is born into the world and then from the velocity of its growth and the development of the organs of its faculties the nervous membranous tubuli and the glandular machinulae perhaps increasing first becomes sensitive and enjoys animal life the nature of gross matter the miseries of this ruinous globe and the present dark state of things inclement or deleterious air negligence and ignorance and many other accidents all under the direction of an infinitely wise being for kind and gracious purposes make the slender individual now become sensitive and feel pain misery and distress even before it is conscious or capable to know the cause instinct a plain but innate effect pains and sufferings make it mechanically as it were avoid the approach of the causes possible or probable by which these pains are produced hence natural aversion reluctance and some endeavors to retire from excess of colds and heats improper or too much nutriment and all noxious bodies and animals these sensations and feelings lodged in the memory with the innate instincts sympathies and antipathies grow stronger till they are gradually confirmed into habits and on these infant habits and ideas begin the dawnings of reason reflection memory and will and all the play of the intellectual faculties on their now developing organs if the body is strong its appetites and passions are proportionally so which inordinatly gratified naturally and necessarily beget strong and new pains and punishments these on reflection and remembrance awaken conscience arising from an innate instinct radically implanted in spiritual nature to excite and encourage a love of order and punish disorder and conscience actuated and enlivened by still further reflection on the necessary and natural connection between disorder crime and punishment on the first dawnings and awakening into rational and conscious life if children were duly and strenuously nurtured and cultivated by frequent acts as occasions offer and supported by due temperance air and exercise in the bodily and organical powers and by bringing the appetites and passions in subjection to the spirit and thereby laboring to acquire a facility and readiness in the exercise of the moral powers as the natural ones advance they would in due time raise the adamical compound to all the perfection and consequent happiness this present state would admit in the full and free exercise of the natural powers and the acquisition of the moral ones though not to the greatest yet to a competent degree and to the most perfect and orderly condition this present probatory and expiatory state will admit but the nature of things in and about us is such and the miseries and sufferings are so constant unavoidable and pungent as will naturally and necessarily excite in a mind cultivated after the manner has been described an anxious desire to inquire and examine if there be any possible means to be freed from them at last and if there can be any rational and probable way to secure at least after this state is past and this adamical clay tabernacle is laid down some state of being at least no worse and as much better as may be on our going into another mansion and this is the precise condition of mind infinite love and wisdom intends to bring his rational lapsed intelligences into by this wise economy for under such a disposition sooner or later they will be fitted to hearken to to examine and seriously to inquire into the truth of revelation and heartily to say lord what shall i do to be saved  end of the fourth discourse discourse v philosophical conjectures on natural analogy its laws and some of its consequences   cor xiii    for now we see through a glass darkley    cor iv    while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal discourse v philosophical conjectures on natural analogy its laws and some of their consequences things may differ in the degrees of the same qualities as well as in kind as in a cube of gold and one of lead in spiritual and material substances and the like  definition i difference in degrees only is where things having their essential qualities common admit in these qualities a more and a less or a difference in their degrees for example a miniature and a picture to the life a cube and a parallelopipedon of the same substance and on the same base a man and a child  definit ii difference in kind is only where some essential qualities in the things compared are common some are different as a vegetable and an animal matter and spirit a cube of gold and one of lead  definit iii by ratio is here meant the relation or reference of any two things compared to one another whose essential qualities admit of degrees or of a more and a less as between a brute and a man a man and an angel and between different bodies of the same substance  definit iv similarity is where there is an equality or sameness of ratios in the substance and essential qualities of things differing only by a more and a less for distinctions sake in abstracted or simple ideas or in qualities i should call this sameness or equality of ratios a similitude or likeness as in problems of arithmetic and geometry in heat and cold in light and darkness and the like in things substances or aggregats of qualities i should call it similarity as in all the individuals of the human species in animals and vegetables of the same tribe and their progress from the embrio or seed to maturity i should pronounce them i say in a similarity of ratios  definit v things substances and qualities are meant to be progressive or in a progression which are constantly increasing or decreasing similarly for example the concave surfaces that make a globe as the coats of an onion the membrans of the cornea of the eye the puncta salientia that become animals the mathematical point whose fluxion describes a line the mathematical line whose fluxion makes a surface and the mathematical surface whose fluxion makes a solid  scholium space and time motion and its velocity seem to be no realities at least no external realities but the mere modifications and different circumstances and situations of bodies or matter and so nothing but mere abstracted ideas or an easier and clearer manner for our finite conceptions which cannot comprehend any complicated thing at once a particular space or the locality of a body seems to be a mere mathematical abstracted solid so to speak or the last limit or term of a mathematical solid or of body evanishing such an one as a point is of a mathematical line a line of a mathematical surface and a surface of a mathematical solid only here the whole content of the mathematical solid or evanishing body is comprehended in the idea the same way of reasoning may be applied to time motion and velocity which are but the limits modifications and particular circumstances of body or matter and have no external realities but like the shadow that depends on the light shineing on the body they all admit of degrees or a more and a less as belonging to and connected with matter and bodies a particular space is to a particular body what o or the relative infinitesimal is to a particular given progression and an infinite body like infinite space is a mere imaginary idea the last term or limit of an ascending progression as o is of a descending one suppose for example a progression of the powers of natural numbers or their cossic characters descending etc  x   x   x   x    x  x   x   x  etc the middle term o or x will represent a mathematical point and  x will represent an infinite body and  x infinite space  x a particular body and  x a particular space and substituteing for  x x  x  x  x  x etc and for  x  x  x  x  x etc or what number of unknown quantities or howsoever compounded with their variable or constant powers and treating them according to the nature of their composition in a given expression by the common rules of cossic or arabic characters and rejecting all the finite terms or those of a lower order of such abstracted infinits and reserving only the highest terms of the expression and you will readily and intelligibly have all the mysteries and solve all the problems discovered by fluxions differentials and seriess in numbers space time motion velocity and bodies and see that all this mysterious and admired play of the understanding is wholly about abstracted ideas and the modifications of body and matter which our narrow limited and finite faculties not being able to apprehend and conceive distinctly in the complex are forced to parcel out and divide thus into single intelligible parts merely for their own convenience and so is a mere technical art of the understanding and imagination to assist the memory  definit vi relative infinite or infinitude in creatures whose nature consists in being more or less respectively than any assignable quantity whatever is such as increases or decreases perpetually yet by no finite power can be actually brought to nothing and no finite faculty can actually assign its limiting terms viz the greatest and the least in this sense it is that we suppose the least particles of bodies to be hard and indivisible that body or matter cannot be infinite that matter is divisible in infinitum that attraction at a certain finite distance becomes repulsion that positive quantities become negative in convergent progressions or from negative become positive in divergent progressions which progressions may be infinitely varied even to a created or relative infinitude as mathematicians know  definit vii absolute infinitude is the sole property or attribute of the deity who is infinitely infinite in all excellencies and realities which though infinitely various are at the same time infinitely simple and one this is evident from the simplicity and unity of his nature as a true philosopher must see  definit viii things are contradictory only which absolutley and totally destroy one another and mutually annihilat their substance subsistence and qualities thus it is in things created if absolute contradiction can subsist in them heat and cold in the same degree light and darkness in the same degree negative and positive terms of the same progression finite and infinite of the same kind but nothing seems to be so absolute a contradiction as necessary existence and nonentity absolute nothing and absolute infinitude  scholium it is doubtful whether or not there can be any real and complete contradiction between created substances things and qualities since they must all necessarily be pictures emblems or miniatures of the deity and the divine attributes substance or nature there seems to be necessary an energy action and reaction in the contradictory or totally annihilating substances things or qualities as that between the good and evil principle in the manichean system between absolute nothing and absolute infinitude in the true philosophical system between creation and annihilation for in all created things substances and qualities there is subsistence and reality  spiritual intellectual or material which cannot be annihilated or rendered totally contradictory but by the same absolute infinitude by which they were created or ordained and infinite perfection can at no future time be contrary to itself the works of god are without repentance and reaction always supposes action in created substances things and qualities there seems only to be a contrariety that is a contradiction or annihilation of some of the qualities and their respective degrees thus material and spiritual substances may be contrary to one another but not contradictory being actually united and somehow allied in all intelligent beings and having some qualities common as actual existence and a power of intending and remitting their energy or of expansion and contraction in their substances and powers analogous to elasticity in bodies they must indeed have limits and bounds of their activity and selfmobility beyond which they can do nothing which powers matter seems designed to terminat and counteract as shadows die away in thick darkness matter may suspend contract and destroy the action and exertion of these spiritual powers but cannot annihilat their substratum nor destroy their root or fund for after their concentration by matter or body they will still subsist in the substratum either in root or act in a finite magnitude or infinitesimal miniature  definit ix analogy is a similarity in substances and essential qualities differing only by a more or a less or in degrees  scholium analogy is of two kinds simple and complex that is perfect and complete or imperfect and incomplete  definit x simple analogy is where there is a perfect and total similarity of substances and essential qualities differing only in degrees as that between a lumbaginous animalcul a seminal embryo a child and a man that between a seed and a plant of this nature are all the particular answers to indetermind problems in algebra and all the particular curves that answer the same conditions in geometry of which there is an infinite variety  scholium there are i think substances things and qualities of a middle nature between the extremes or the greatest and least of their terms in every created reality as between any two finite given terms in quantities there is an infinity of mean proportionals actual and assignable as between x and y there is the mean  and between x and  there is  and in a circle of an infinite diameter between any finite part of the diameter and the other infinite segment there is the perpendicular a mean proportional which is neither infinitely small nor infinitely great i speak only of relative infinitude and which i should call indefinit so in substances or substrata of qualities whether material or spiritual the two terms or limits some may approach or verge toward gross indiscerptible or imporose matter or pure spirit in all the degrees of relative infinitude which never can by any power less than absolutely infinite arrive at either of the extremes this in algebra and geometry is demonstrated and the absolute infinitude purity and simplicity of the divine nature makes this distinction necessary here  corollary i hence it will be reasonable to suppose that as matter by its infinite possible division minuteness and rarity by its elasticity and velocity may be sublimed and refined into relative infinitude so as to become as it were sir isaac newtons spiritus quidam subtilissimus and meet only with an infinitely small resistance in passing through gross and porous bodies such as our planet is so spiritual substance may be analogically supposed to be capable of all the relative degrees of purity and sublimity or grossness and density till it terminat in the lowest or highest spiritual substance which yet will ever be contrary though not contradictory to material substance  corollary ii hence it will follow that this infinitely refined material fluid of indefinit rarity and elasticity will meet with no sensible resistance in passing through gross planetary bodies yet its parts being still material and subject to the laws of all material bodies must at least meet with some infinitesimal resistance and have some reaction as the rays of the sun being oceans of material particles constantly emitted from his body must necessarily lessen it though insensibly and infinitely little yet really so that neither of them can be designed to last to an actual eternity in their present state they may be so altered on proper occasions by the power and influence of him who first created them as to answer the ends of his wise providence but cannot continue as they now are during all his eternity  definit xi complex or imperfect analogy is where there is only a similarity between a certain number of essential qualities that differ in degrees and are diversified in other qualities less essential as that between a man and an angel that between a man and a brute or that between a plant and a brute and the several ranks and orders of being emerge as these qualities increase and multiply  proposition all creation the whole system of the universe with all the particular systems in nature all beings animated and inanimat all substances qualities and realities whatever and every individual circumstance in nature is nothing and necessarily can be nothing but the supreme being his nature and attributes transubstantiated into being and preceptibility portrayed and shadowed out and drawn forth ad extra mundus universus nihil est nisi deus explicitus but the workman will eternally be different in kind from his work the cause from the effect  demonstration before creation omnipotence itself could find no pattern or model for his operations ad extra but himself and his own attributes or the ideas of his own mind which being infinitely perfect must necessarily have been the best and most eligible to imitat and copy out in his productions and perfection being simple and one by the necessity of his own perfect nature he could act outwardly no other way than by this analysis and this is a demonstration a priori from the cause to the effect if any thing can possibly be such and in fact it holds equally strong a posteriori so far as the wisest and bestcultivated human spirits can reach or investigat taking in the necessary conditions and circumstances as far as experiment and observation can discover which i intend to show and illustrat in a few instances     the vegetable world in its variety elegance and final causes is a most astonishing proof of gods geometrical knowledge and skill so to speak and fully shows what matter the grossest and most unactive substance can do when contrived and directed by his wisdom and power in plants and vegetables there seems to be no spiritual or selfmotive power but only a material spirit or such an one perhaps as sir isaac newtons spiritus quidam subtilissimus here and in material agency that fluid seems necessary and the few observations he has offered to infer its necessity which the present experiments and discoveries about the cause and laws of electricity and magnetism wonderfully confirm are supported by its implication here in vegetable nature in order to explain the actuation growth and increase of plants and minerals all which vegetat and increase according to general laws which no less power than that of the author of nature could so wonderfully have contrived and perpetuated for though by heat moisture and attraction from a supramechanical original formation and arrangement of the indivisible particles of matter or original elements their future progression development and multiplication may be now in the gross understood and explained yet the cause of attraction and elasticity the first impulse and motive energy and the continuance of these powers and activity can so probably be accounted for from no other principle as this relatively infinitely rare and elastic fluid the size figure and laws of which could come only from this infinitely powerful and wise geometer     the totally inanimat creation consisting either in the fragments of the animated parts or in the now aggregated or compounded moleculae of the primary elements show and speak the wisdom and skill of their artificer but more especially the systems and collections of these elementary original particles viz air water light salts and mercury how proper their size figure and laws for the uses and ends proposed this speculation would rapturously employ the eternity of a sagacious natural philosopher sir isaac newton has with great penetration discovered many hitherto unknown mysteries and miracles of wisdom in the theory of light and colors i will only suggest on the head of this and the former proposition that had it not been for the first contrivance in the systems of minute particles now mentioned there could not possibly have been any proper materials for the food growth and increase of the vegetables minerals and metals and had it not been for the combination and arrangement of the elements into such middling integral particles as are these of the vegetables there could have been no proper and peculiar food for the animals the whole system being so disposed in a perpetual climax that all its parts mutually depend upon and are subservient to one another the tubes of vegetables being mechanically fitted and harmoniously adjusted to mould the form the size and combine these elements into the middling nourishing integral particles for the food of animals by the solar heat and the laws of attraction in minute bodies     in sentient and intelligent beings from the brute creation through men and angels up to the seraphims and cherubins as far as creation reaches the analogy is plain simple and necessary the three natural powers of liveing intelligence and liberty in their spiritual selfactive principles clothed and circumscribed by ethereal vehicles seem to be there in a perpetual climax and differ only in degrees the essential difference between this and the vegetable and mineral creation which are both of the same order and tribe and by the same vegetative laws diversified under different circumstances like the initial terms of an algebraic canon converging into the higher and more advanced terms equally grow and increase seems to consist in the selfmotive and selfactive powers of the former of which the latter is entirely destitute the vegetable creation seems only to be actuated by the powers of matter and is consequently inert and passive and continue for ever in their place and situation unless forced from it by some external impulse whereas the brute and animated creation have a selfmotive power so that vegetation entirely depends upon the powers of matter and animation in all its degrees requires a spiritual substance of some rank or other and here the essential difference between vegetable and animal nature lies viz in the locomotive power of the latter of which the former is destitute entirely and is merely passive but since the brute creation in some degree plainly manifests all the passions and affections of mind that we of the human race are capable of since they live or are actuated by a selfmotive selfactive principle since they feel pleasure and pain and may be at least most of them that fall under our observation made to learn and understand some things which is a proof that they are endowed even with intelligence in a lower degree and since all of them from the minutest microscopical animalcul up to the elephant and whale suffer and must necessarily suffer a million of different ways here at last most intensely by their death and dissolution it is highly probable that they are in a lapsed expiatory and progressive state of being and may advance to higher degrees of perfection and happiness like the initial terms of a diverging progression this the analogy perspicuous and necessary in all the works of infinite wisdom and the various and manifold operations of gods power makes highly probable rational and philosophical infinite benevolence admits of no stop or bounds in its communication of being happiness and perfection but what arises from the difference of the order of nature or of things     as to us of the human race our original powers the order rank and present state of our spiritual nature and selfmotive substance with its original ethereal vehicle at present covered over with a crust of the substance of the gross ruinous planet we inhabit so much has been already said in the former discourses that to avoid tautology which i have perhaps run too much into i shall not come over the same subject here     the angelic hierarchy must in its own nature and from our present lapsed state and condition be absolutely unknown to us but in so far as revelation or philosophical analogy give us some dark hints but such hints they do give us as imply no contradiction but on the contrary have a great degree of probability and verisimilitude and naturally flow from the infinitely various wisdom of the great author and cause of creation we may err in the detail but not in the general idea about them we see what a variety an infinite variety of vegetables and animals in their several tribes and species he has produced and if we could possibly observe and class them taking in those we cannot discover but by the help of microscopical art we should find this variety increase infinitely more in the animated than in the vegetable creation rising in a certain harmonious progression and variety and which no doubt is multiplied in the same proportion in the angelical world for as things combined multiply or increase in the number of their qualities or their degrees so do the combinations possible and actual as is well known to mathematicians the fixed stars with their analogous planetary ethereal pure and sublime systems and apparatus seem most probably to be the seats of the unlapsed angelical hierarchies and he that knows or has a dark notion only of the number of those already discovered the number of those hid in the milky way as it is called and the infinite extension and expansion of space which in order to preserve the situation distance and equilibrium of these orbs must be filled with analogous luminaries or systems may have some idea of the infinite number and variety of these hierarchies they must all have some generical nature as well as specific differences this generical nature may probably be no other than the fundamental and essential attributes of the deity viz liveing understanding and will or father son and holy spirit as has been analogically illustrated and which in gross solid matter are shadowed out in the trine dimensions of bodies their specific differences no finite capacity can possibly assign or comprehend but there are two very eminent essential and luminous ones suggested to us from revelation and confirmed by philosophical analogy viz those of the distinguishing characteristic of the son and holy spirit st john says god is light and in him is no darkness at all and in another place he says god is love and he that dwells in god dwells in love that is the divine nature and substance is light and love and accordingly the highest orders of the celestial hierarchies are eminently light and love or they are infinitely luminous or infinitely ardent which two qualities make the characteristic of the cherubims and seraphims as their names import and these two attributes of the divine nature seem to pass variously and in different degrees and gradations through all creation down to inanimat nature and in each individual they are both radically and actually existent but in different degrees according to their several orders existence or liveing is common to all created beings which is an analogous participation picture or image of the father and creator by whom are all things some bodies are nothing but light luminous and transparent as fire sulphurous bodies and all minute bodies violently agitated or put into brisk vibrating motions and every body shredded sufficiently thin becomes diaphanous and all bodies whatever reflect or refract light some bodies again are more or less attractive as salts oils and sulphurs and some at certain distances less than infinite are repulsive which is a flagrant picture of lapse corruption and rebellion in spiritual nature all these qualities have their analogous and correspondent powers in spiritual nature which to a philosopher of any penetration were superfluous to detail for in spiritual beings and intelligent natures these two qualities and their higher degrees in some more than in others are so conspicuous that they cannot be overlooked in all founders of republics and civil societies in all lawgivers and philosophers in all apostolical men in the inventers of arts and sciences even in the broachers of heresies this quality of light however coarse turbid and confined seems to have been their passion their fort their characteristic and overruling bias and in all the hermetical tribe the solitaries the true contemplative philosophers the founders of orders monasteries and collegiat life in true and zealous patriots and lovers of their country and species in short in all the contemplative and abstracted persons love seems to be the predominant affection and this division runs through all even corrupt and lapsed nature and makes the great distinction of mankind into the governed and governing those who defend truth and those who attack error those who thrust and hit the mark best ie the lawgivers or their makers and those who parry best ie politicians and honest statesmen those fitted by nature to command and those that are made only to be commanded and obedient that is all the active and social or the children of men and the sons of god or the thinking and contemplative but this difference is with infinite variety great imperfections foreign mixtures and diabolical influences in corrupt nature but never the one in any eminent degree without some degree of the other as they are both united to infinitude in their divine original and cause and these differences make up the specification and individuation of the several particulars of lapsed free and intelligent nature and the difference of the conduct of divine wisdom in their purification and restoration who with infinite wisdom and propriety conducts all and each without violence on their freedom and specific qualities or dissonance to the harmony of his own attributes to their great and final end of being which is the wonderful economy of the general and particular restoration and this difference and distinction of the original qualities and affections of the soul viz light and love and the different maneuver and conduct of providence in this state toward them is founded on the different parts they might have acted in the general lapse of mankind and the different offices seats and mansions they are to be prepared for in the universal monarchy of the restoration and may make the otherwise unaccountable difference of the bodies spirits tempers capacities and outward and inward success in this state of two children of the same birth as twins or two immediately succeeding one another of the same parents under the same education and beginnings in the world and on the same bottom which every one must have observed to be as various different and distant as the poles and in a manner diametrically opposite even otherwise unaccountable and odd     that the fixed stars and their analogous planetary satellitious sublimer ethereal systems may possibly be the seats and mansions of the unlapsed tried and purified angelical hierarchies and of restored purified and glorified sentient and intelligent mortal beings seems not only probable philosophical and according to the general analogy of things but is strongly and frequently hinted in revelation as every one who is familiarly acquainted with it must know gods throne his shechinah the heaven of heavens his dewlling place is always represented above elijah went upwards christ ascended and the seats of the blessed are always represented as among these celestial orbits and though analogy may not apodeictically demonstrate a fact or truth especially as to its precise and specific nature and secondary qualities in the detail about imperceptible and spiritual beings precise truth in these matters being not only incompatible with finitude but counteracting faith trust and resignation the sole means of our recovery and progressive purification being absolutely destructive of liberty and clashing with the divine attributes of infinite justice and purity and his absolut dominion over the creation yet when analogy and revelation concur in the same general conclusion it is so high a presumption and probability as comes nearest a demonstration at least to those who have any regard for revelation for to such it will be selfevident that infinite wisdom and absolut infallibility will never make the most distinct approach to any allusion or similitude that borders on things in no degree of alliance approximation or neighborhood or where the contact is not as near as circumstances will admit or that is not as the first terms of a convergeing progression or one that will lead his low wandering blundering creatures into gross mistakes that bodies or vehicles of spiritual substances must have an ubi a local permanent situation at last is certain that these numberless glorious luminaries were lighted up with such a profusion of luster only for us stupidly to gaze at is ridiculous that they must be infinite in their number i mean always creaturely relative infinitude follows from the infinite expansion of space and the equilibrium necessarily to be preserved in order to perpetuat the situation distance and relations of these glorious luminaries that they may be of an infinitely purer more refined and sublimed matter than even that of our sun who was designed grossly only to picture out the divine nature to us lapsed mortals and to enlighten and cherish us a little and our dark prison during our probation and recovery and not made for perpetuity and which is covered over and compressed with a gross dense atmosphere with maculae and spots that possibly may hinder its too quick and violent consumption is highly probable these fixed and permanent luminaries with their analogical planetary apparatus may be the seats of the blessed whose glorious vehicles may be of the same matter and substance with their respective mansions these ethereal planets and fixed stars may be so situated and so harmoniously placed in regard to one another that the rays and as it were spiritual or ethereal matter which they perpetually pour forth and emit through the whole expansion of space may by a perpetual flux and reflux and melodious vibrations be returned back again upon one another and so perpetuat and eternise their luster and glory the rays of our sun have fits of easy transmission refraction and reflection according to sir isaac newton its particles have a greater bias on the one side than on the other they attract one another in an infinitely greater proportion than their power of gravity in general bodies may be turned into light and light into bodies some diamonds and precious stones are luminous emit light and shine in the dark several phosphors liquid and solid emit light at all times both in air and water and the asbestos and purest gold bear all degrees of heat and fire without much alteration and the purest glass in the focus of the strongest specula only continues liquid without any other change these facts i suggest only to show that light as well as other bodies may be various of different purity and sublimity differing in degree though not in kind and much more might be suggested here to show the various nature and different qualities of light and luminous bodies one from another if necessary to illustrat this perhaps imaginary speculation at least save it free from contradiction or impossibility but i propose in this mere conjecture     that infinite wisdom power and love could produce no sentient or intelligent being ad extra without impressing in the fund and essence of its nature an infinite love to him an insatiable and unextinguishable desire thirst and ardour to be reunited at last with him as its supreme felicity is as absurd and i think blasphemous to doubt as to doubt of his being and existence to think otherwise is to question his infinite perfection for infinite perfection must be single and one and sentient and intelligent beings without this radical and innate ardor for happiness that is to be at last united and to commerciat with infinite perfection seeing by the sensibility and intelligence of their nature they are capable of it in their order would be an effect without a cause or an action without an end or purpose at least without intending the selfevident best end which is a contradiction the most absolut to infinite perfection no sentient and intelligent being ever was without an ardor or bent toward happiness it is a radical principle in their nature and never counteracted though its nature and true cause is often mistaken may be unknown or forgot yet it can finally consist only in this reunion but sensibility and intelligence being by their nature and essence free must be labile and by their lability may actually lapse degenerat and by habit acquire a second nature opposite and contrary to this implanted brass and tendency toward a reunion and permanent commerce with their original and first cause and by selfishness inordinat love and idolatry of their fellow creatures sopit and extinguish this central bias at least as to elicit acts though not in the root and fund and in this contrariety distraction and tearing asunder of these moral powers in spiritual nature the essence of misery and hell itself chiefly consists so long as this contrary habitual and foreign bias lasts so long must the unhappiness and tortures of such sentient and intelligent creatures continue like the chill and cold in the comets while in the parts of their orbit most distant from the sun or like the small particles of matter which out of the sphere of their attraction become repulsive and by the law of their passivity continuing ever in the state into which they are put must for ever proceed in this their repulsive course but this contrary bias to reunion with their infinitely perfect and happy original being adventitious only and by habit only confirmed into a second artificial nature the infinite love wisdom and economy of the son of god was contrived and designed to melt down annihilat and destroy that the original innate bias might operate and take place and without this infinitely wise economy to me it seems the permanent order peace and harmony and consequent felicity of universal sentient and intelligent nature could no other possible way have been or be established at last     it is not impossible but extremely probable and according to the universal analogy of nature that our planets and their satellites should be the more tolerable jails prisons and dungeons of the several orders and degrees of lapsed probationary sentient and intelligent beings that some of them are straiter less comfortable more dark dismal and unhappy than others there is no doubt can be made that they are not nor cannot be designed for an eternal duration in their present condition is highly probable we see on this our planet that the bodies tempers and habitudes of sentient and intelligent beings that continue long in such particular climats and under such influences of the celestial bodies alter and take a turn according to the general laws and temperature of that climat the planets and their satellites have an infinite propriety and fitness for being more tolerable bettering and correctionhouses and prisons for lapsed sentient and intelligent beings they are no ways nor cannot become in their present situation pleasurehouses paradises and happy mansions nor permanent dwellingplaces for perfect and glorified intelligences the natural language of the deity to us in our present condition can be no other but by types similitudes allusions parables allegories analogy and final causes without violence on our liberty our acquisition of faith hope and charity or debasing his own infinite purity and perfection at least about invisible and imperceptible beings and states under our present lapse and therefore i conjecture that our planets and their satellites are designed by infinite wisdom for the temporary jails and correctionhouses of lapsed probationary sentient and intelligent beings and that their superinduced vehicles or other penal and penitential habits are of the same substance and materials with the respective prisons they are confined to     that the comets cannot be the seats of blessed spirits i think is selfevident that they are not made only to supply our planet the earth or even all the other planets with moisture and humidity only is as evident the number of them perhaps half a dozen in a century that have been observed and seen and of which we have some records with their sensible effects appearances and periods are abundantly too many for that farfetched and precarious purpose only our water most certainly decreases and must necessarily be exhausted in time as do the heat and rays of the sun but not so sensibly as to lay a foundation for experience and observation by our senses or art but rather to increase our sensible punishment and natural purification at the last stage and it is highly reasonable and philosophical to suppose that our whole system was designed by our creator to last in its present situation only so long as was required for the probation purification and expiation of lapsed sentient and intelligent beings which both revelation and philosophy show cannot be an infinite duration but that the whole planetary system within the orbit of saturn is progressively and by general laws verging toward some grand catastrophe and jaildeliverance the elect seems to imply the officers and governors of this new jerusalem this political future state this universal restoration monarchy of the father of all and the period of the duration of this present probatory state of the system of saturn seems confined and limited in revelation to the number of the elects being accomplished that is to the time when all the necessary officers governors or magistrates of this new universal government is formed finished and accompleated and then will be the end crisis and period of this probatory state i say then the comets cannot be the seats of the blessed if alterations of heat and cold summer and winter in some more temperat and moderat degree be necessary for tolerable liveing in bodies crusted over with the substance of which the habitation is made as it is philosophical to think of the inhabitants of the comets seeing their orbits are so excentric to the sun the foci of their ellipses so vastly distant that they must pass for ages through both extremes of heat and cold and be perpetually involved either in fire or darkness and so in extreme misery as to their incrusted machins and consequently they probably are the prisons condemndholes and dungeons of gods kingdom and universal monarchy    0 it is both rational and philosophical and according to the natural analogy of things to suppose that the next world or its several steps of progression and its initial steps or first terms and the invisible impreceptible state of things in the other life has a great and near similitude and resemblance to this present state and that they differ chiefly in degrees the other world being of an infinitely greater purity sublimity and perfection only without the errors darkness or miseries of this life god is the same yesterday today and for ever immutable and invariable in his nature and attributes and as has been often hinted all his works ad extra and the operations of his wisdom and power have a perpetual ascending analogy and progression toward him his nature and felicity it is true revelation informs that eye has not seen ear has not heard nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive the glory and happiness that god has reserved in another life for them that love him but as that refers chiefly to the inward joy and happiness ecstasies and transports that the consummatly blessed feel in their commerce and final union with him their infinitely perfect source and original so it does not affect their outward state their polity external order and mansions of which only i am here speaking and of which the description and account by revelation intimats plainly a great affinity with the most perfect and happy condition of our now world and it is highly probable they differ more in degrees of perfection than in kind the new jerusalem is likend to a city a state and republic it has its people subjects and officers it has temples paradisaical gardens rivers of pleasure a perpetual spring and all our best and most beatifying delights and material comforts here i know all this language and description is but allusion figure and allegory and must be understood chiefly of our creation or glorified bodies but as every created being sentient and intelligent has a body or vehicle as well as spirit an ethereal planetary or a glorified vehicle the last inseparable and immortal as well as a spiritual selfmotive substance the body or glorified vehicle may have analogical food some fruit of the tree of life which in paradise itself perpetuated the immortality of and would have eternisd the creation vehicle it must have an ubi a mansion and dewlling place it must have analogous pleasures of an innocent spiritual and sublimer nature proper to its order and rank and proportioned to the purity of its then body and soul there must be different orders ranks and distinctions superior officers and subalterns a government and polity in the new as well as in the old jerusalem in short they will probably differ not in kind or absolute and total contradiction from the best and most perfect state of things here that can be imagined or described at least in the first steps or terms in the progressive perfection and happiness but in degrees and in negation of all that is imperfect dissonant and disorderly in this present state but this in an infinite that is a relative or creaturely infinite superior degree and into the final consummat and perfectest state we must mount only by degrees and steps through many mansions and progressive order and by acquireing an habitual stability by repeated acts and trials be confirmed in eternal purity and felicity at last and one stage of being will be perhaps but an apprenticeship and probatory initiation for a higher and better and this without bounds and without limits i mean only as to the bodily restoration vehicle its mansion food created pleasures and enjoyments which can only flow from the fund the spiritual inhabitants being restored and perfectly united with and transformed into the divine nature and qualities this system modestly explained and cautiously guarded in the proportion of perfect to imperfect infinite to finite innocent to lapsed would i think take off many difficulties in revelation in the economy of jesus and the restoration the different methods of providence and its present appearances and our mistakes of the sentiments and writings of inspired authors for it is impossible the spirit of god should insinuat any resemblance alliance or analogical similitude between things that differ generically were disparata and incompatible but between such as were verging by progression and in an approximation to the real perfection of their natures lapsed beings are infinitely distant at present from such a final union and relative identity with their source and his throne and shechinah but must be like the assymptots of hyperbolas and their curves eternally approaching to but never able totally to coincide      analogy it is true can never demonstrat the actual existence and real being of any thing to us sensation only and experience can do that it is only capable of explaining and illustrating the nature substance and qualities of things already made and created it is as quintilian very elegantly describes analogy ejus haec vis est ut id quod dubium est ad aliquod simile de quo non quaeritur referat ut incerta certis probet but then it takes off any contradiction and impossibility from its existence makes it possible probable and rational and renders it a fit subject for the supreme reason and power to work upon if he pleases and similar to his other operations it clears all possible objections and difficulties and makes it natural and intelligible and that is precisely what our present condition and situation requires or will admit for the acquisition of the moral powers faith hope and charity to secure our liberty from violence and the divine attributes from dissonance and if the fundamental proposition be admitted viz that all the works of infinite wisdom and power ad extra are and can be nothing but pictures resemblances and signatures of gods nature substance and attributes in miniature impressed or prominent in a word if it be true as has been said that mundus universus nihil est nisi deus explicitus and i think nothing can be more selfevident then most of the consequences i have drawn from this great truth are necessary natural and obvious especially when revelation suggests the same truths and conclusions at least in general we may very readily err in the detail and in the eliciting and application of a particular case but not so readily in the general law as is common with algebraists they often blunder in the application who were in the right in the canon      we may blunder and be mistaken in our particular conclusions and deductions from this universal analogy i say as well as in geometry and algebra being weak fallible and imperfect creatures but our errors and blunders in the first will sometimes proceed from a different cause from our mistakes in the latter a wrong head want of culture and precipitation are generally the cause of our mistakes in geometry and algebra but in analogy especially that analogy which concerns the moral attributes of the divine nature the human soul the holy scriptures and invisible states it is owing often to a wrong heart pride and selfsufficiency we are afraid such pure and sublime theorems should be true they hint the necessity of a greater purity in us than we are willing to cultivat at present if we ascribed all perfection every good gift and perfect donation to the supreme cause and were at the same time humbled and contented even with our own ignorance errors and blunders of love and resignation only if our sentiments and ratiocination were intended for his glory and magnificence solely and our own humiliation satisfied with this single truth alone that god is god that is infinitely perfect they could neither hurt us nor others but if our heads must needs be at work as mine has here if like children we must play with ideas and philosophise about the kingdom of invisibles and imperceptibles and the arcana imperii divini if we cannot at first at least and in our years of probation or elementary state arrive per saltum at pure love naked faith and universal resignation the only solid means of infallibility and stability then the best and surest method is to deal in analogy as the mathematicians do in algebra and geometry to acquire a facility in solving difficult problems with readiness and accuracy viz by laying up in our memory or having ready at hand a penus analogica as they have a penus analytica in beginning with the most simple and least complicated analogies in attentively observing the ratios relations and references of things substances their qualities and probable final causes and finding out their degrees and progression the astronomers had with exactness and accuracy discovered and settled the orbit period distance and laws of the sun and earth before they attempted with any success that of the moon and sir isaac newton had settled and adjusted the laws motions and appearances of the solar system before he attempted the moon and planets and had for seven years studied experimental chemistry before he set about to investigat the nature and laws of minute bodies and their systems he had cultivated and made many and various experiments by separating combining and analyzing the rays of light through many diaphanous mediums before he attempted to discover the nature figure and laws of their component particles analogy and its appendages type allusion similitude parable hieroglyphic and allegory all more remote or nearer approaches to analogy is the only natural language the deity can speak to us at present under our degeneracy and lapse consistent with his dignity and purity and the preservation of our liberty he may speak to us mediatly by his angels he may speak to the wills by his holy spirit and to our understandings by his word his only begotten son and in the holy scriptures by his prophets apostles and saints but his sole natural articulat indelible and universal language can possibly be no other but his works of wonder ad extra the heavens declare the glory of god by the characters and hieroglyphics intimatly impressed on them and they can only be read or understood by analogy to him to us and to one another if then we began with this inanimat world in which only true natural philosophy from final causes can instruct us thence proceeded to the vegetable world then advanced to the brute creation where natural history and chemistry will be of great service and at last ascended to intelligent beings through the angelic hierarchy till by analogy we arrived at the supreme cause this method would be the most natural and secure in a natural progression by analogy and if with humility modesty and begging the direction of the uncreated wisdom we perseverd with patience this divine philosophy might in time cultivated by different hands be of service to the contemplative christian philosopher himself as well as to others but my meaning will be better understood by a short recapitalation of what has been said and an illustration by an example    when god intended to bring creatures into being he could not choose but make them after the most perfect pattern he therefore stamped his own image upon all his works hence the creatures being all miniatures of the deity must bear a mutual resemblance to him and to one another this resemblance is what we call analogy and runs through the whole scale of beings every being besides its peculiar and distinguishing quality whereby it is determined to this or that particular order and has the preeminence of all below it being also possessed of all those qualities that are to be found in any of the inferior orders as a curve of any of the orders has all the properties of the inferior orders of curves besides those that belong to its own class or species    these different orders or ranks of beings being distinguished by their respective qualities the first term of this infinite scale will be simple existence the addition of one quality will constitute the second term or order of two the third and so of the rest whence the number of qualities with which any being is endowed will determine its place in this scale and show its distance from the first term besides this difference in the several orders of beings there is also a diversity among those of the same order which proceeds from their possessing some of the common qualities in a more or less eminent degree    as god can have but one model in all his productions every system of beings will resemble all the other systems and each will be a copy of the whole creation the material world will be a transcript of the spiritual and the laws and economy of the one will be analogous to and correspond with those of the other besides this general analogy there will be a more immediate and flagrant relation between each material system and the intelligences to which it belongs the structure of the bodies and other material organs of these intelligences together with the whole frame and contexture of the material system being such as will best suit the nature rank and order of these intelligences and this relation probably will subsist and attend them in all the changes and periods through which they pass so that should the intelligent system lapse from its purity and perfection the material system would fall into disorder likewise and undergo some similar and analogous change    of this general analogy between the spiritual and material systems there are many traces plainly to be discerned by an acute and contemplative philosopher to instance only in the similitude which our solar system as now disordered bears to the lapsed intelligences that inhabit it in the center of this system is placed the sun a bright and lively image of the deity his material inanimat miniature the planets and other celestial orbs revolving about him at their respective distances and performing their revolutions in different periods of time will represent the several orders of lapsed intelligences the different degrees of their lapse and the duration and continuance of their probatory state this glorious body the sun infinitely surpasses all the other orbs in magnitude and luster they are no more compared to him than points in the circumference of a circle they have no brightness of their own it is all derived by reflection and is more or less according to their distance from him    the chief properties of the sun are attraction light and heat the suns attraction extends to the remotest parts of the system acting at all distances with a force increasing in a certain proportion as these distances decrease it is by this attraction that the planets are retained in their orbits and kept from flying off in the tangent to which their projectile force gives them a constant tendency should the suns attraction cease but a moment the whole system would fall into the utmost disorder and be irrecoverably ruined how like is this attraction to the love of god continually operating upon all created intelligences and powerfully soliciting them to a nearer approach and resemblance to himself its influence is constant and invariable were it possible it should have the least intermission the whole creation would fall into utter ruin and destruction    the light of the sun is diffused throughout the whole system no celestial body is endowed with this quality but himself this is an image of that light which enlightens every man that comes into the world an emblem of him who came forth from the father of lights the light and sun of the new jerusalem and of spiritual nature    the suns light is always accompanied with heat the principle of life and vegetation in the other celestial bodies there is some small degree of this quality but it is originally derived from or produced in them by the solar heat without which they would be barren and inhospitable deserts this represents the influences of the holy spirit which are inseparable from the light of the gospel and are the principle of our spiritual life animating and cherishing every intelligent being and making it productive of all the fruits of righteousness    let us next consider the properties of the planets and other bodies that revolve about the sun their various magnitudes and distances from the sun with the periodical times of their revolution will express the several orders of lapsed intelligences the different degrees of their lapse and the particular periods of time allotted for their trial and probation some of these bodies as the comets move in orbits that are very ellyptical going off to immense distances from the sun where the influence of his heat and light is almost insensible but by the force of his attraction they are again drawn back and brought even to a nearer approach than other bodies that move in narrower orbits    the planets are constantly acted upon by two different forces viz gravity or attraction and the projectile force these are contrary to one another and always act in opposite directions the projectile force giveing the planet a constant tendency to recede from the sun and to fly off in the tangent while the force of attraction by drawing it the contrary way prevents that effect so that by the joint action of both the planet is kept in its orbit the attractive force though continually influencing the planet is not a quality of it but proceeds from the sun the only quality belonging to the planet is that of the projectile force this will shadow out the lapse the action of selfishness and the inordinate love of the creature with their opposition to the divine love  philosophers tell us that the present state of our system cannot be of long continuance but that the solar attraction must necessarily prevail over the projectile force of the celestial bodies and all the comets and planets with their satellites be at last absorbed and swallowed up in the sun  finis an abstract or a brief but distinct representation of the doctrines and sentiments contained in the preceding discourses an abstract of discourse i philosophical conjectures about the nature and qualities of the original animal body and of its progressive state in its several stages of existence that there may be animals and consequently animal organs performing analogically at least the animal functions less than our senses can discover assisted by our best art possibly less than our imagination can frame an idea of page   several demonstrations showing the utter impossibility that an animal body could be first formed or can be now continued by mere mechanism or the laws of nature now obtaining but must be the immediate work continued and supported by the constant influence of an omnipotent and omniscient first cause   that the least and last particles of matter can be divided by no finite power whatever   that their figures were probably at first only spheres cubes and equilateral triangular prisms ibid that our now porous and confused elements salts water light air and earth still have inherent qualities which distinguish them from each other which they never totally lose though these may be swallowed up when combined unharmoniously as they now are   that the original creation and the resurrection body might have been and may be of this first kind of simple elements harmoniously combined but are now crusted over and discordantly blended with the gross secondary elements of this ruinous planet we inhabit   that the fineness of the original ethereal animal body may have been in proportion to its order and the perfection of the natural and moral powers of the soul conjunctly   that this analogically spiritual so to speak animal body might have been rolled up and concentred into a miniature of a miniature in infinitum in the loins of the first adamical parent till by its being sufficiently plastered over with the matter of this ruinous planet it became able to bear its now inclemency and be born into this world   that this primitive ethereal divinely organized body by an individual fitness and congruity to the informing spiritual substance might have been thereby so intimatly and commensuratly united with it that they could never after be separated by any finite power no more than the original particles of matter could be divided by such a power ibid that the confineing this original spiritual body and soul so long a time to so dark a prison as the seeds and eggs of animals are now might have been for progressive purification correction and punishment   that it is fact that the wisest and best men have been at first mere vegetables afterward mere brutes and but at last rational intelligent beings  0 that sentient and intelligent beings are by their derivative nature immortal and unannihilable and because god can never be contrary to himself but are in a progressive state toward perfection and happiness in their order like the several orders of hyperboloids    that the natural powers being uniformly constant and invariable and the moral powers being cancelled by the lapse had not the natural powers in their full vigor been suspended and fettered they must have counteracted the acquisition of the moral powers    that precise knowledge and mathematical certainty in the real nature and of the intimat substance of any complex thing is incompatible with finitude and that the degree of certainty in things is only in proportion to the amplitude of the faculty    that subjecting all creation to general laws was one infinitely wise and effectual mean to secure liberty inviolate and to harmonize the divine attributes in the great work of restoration    that the only thing worthy of a philosopher is by experiment attention and induction to collect as many of these general laws as he possibly can    that god being simple one and always the same must necessarily act by general laws in all creation but that good and wise men have been deterred from studying them in spiritual nature out of dread of the odious appellation of enthusiasts    that the study of these general laws of infinite wisdom and sagacity may be a part of the employment of happy contemplative spirits hereafter  0 that an infinitely rational and perfect being could possibly have no other pattern or model for his works of creation at first but himself his own substance nature and attributes    that therefore there must be one perpetual analogy and progressive perfection running through all the works of an infinitely rational being and that as proportion is the key of the material analogy is the logic of the spiritual world    that suffering is a mechanical and necessary consequence of our present situation on this ruinous globe and that none ever could avoid it absolutely but in degree and that through the merits and economy of jesus only sufferings become blessings because means of restoration    that this suffering is a natural and mechanical purification and perfection of the subject    that consciousness of the end or occasion of this suffering is no way necessary toward the beneficial effects of it that consciousness would be prejudicial in the first steps of this purification and only when its end is obtained can it be beneficial to clench its effects    that the great problem and difficulty with the best of beings so to speak and in the economy of his providence and the reason of the present darkness in it is to restore lapsed creatures in consistence with their liberties and the harmony of his divine attributes    that the general methods of providence in restoreing lapsed intelligences are plainly   the continuing general laws   the suspending the elicit acts of the natural powers for a time by ligatures of this ruinous planet and   by the admireable and adoreable economy of jesus  0 that it is a contradiction to suppose a beneficent being would create sentient or intelligent beings for suffering merely for sufferings sake ibid that the sufferings of the sentient and intelligent creatures in this present state necessarily supposes a state of preexistence and a future lapse or a course of trial and probation    that there may be other states and mansions in infinitum of progressive purification and perfection and that suffering which in the divine purity and the nature of disorder must have been eternal is made temporary only by the merit and suffering of jesus    that spiritual substance may be conceived analogous to and not contradictory to matter sublimed and refined by the power of omnipotence but even this idea is imperfect and not satisfactory their substances being naturally destructive of each other and their qualities in all their modifications equidistant    that the spiritual body and immaterial spirit crusted over with clay may for its purification progressively be an infinite time in developeing these natural powers and in acquireing the moral powers defaced by the lapse but that now under the economy of jesus this will be perfected in a finit time and even the whole system of saturn is by general laws vergeing to some great catastrophe or change    that the spirit as being a ray of the divine substance or a power emitted from his necessarily existent nature is immortal in its own nature but that the spiritual or ethereal vehicle is only immortal by the divine order and comparatively as the first particles of matter are indivisible    that the thinner and lighter the crust on this ethereal vehicle is the natural powers will be elicited more readily and freely and the moral powers acquired more easily and fully and the necessary sufferings thereby lessened    that since the natural powers of the spirit are constant and always the same in their root and fund it will follow   that our acquired knowledge is but remembrance   that there is in our spiritual nature inherent and innate a moral sense and a natural sagacity as well as natural sensations   that there are innate ideas of god and virtue and of moral good and evil in the soul though sopited and unelicited as well as a natural power to perform the animal functions   that spiritual sensation and senses justly explained are realities and not figures   that the soul in her operations now can only use and employ the material organs of the ethereal vehicle crusted over as they are with planetary clay which she must endeavor to extend develope and mundify   that culture study and labor in extending and perfecting the natural powers is but removeing superfluities cutting off excrescences and rendering the ethereal vehicles and their organs pliant and supple and for the which we are now condemned to labor for our punishment and purification   that the shortest way to perfect the natural powers is to labor at the recovering the moral powers    that the activity sensibility and penetration the animal functions the passions sentiments memory imagination and the other more material and less abstracted operations of the soul and even the involuntary functions the voluntary motions of the body are more immediately performed by the selfmoveing immaterial naturally sagacious spirit on the primitive ethereal vehicle divinely organized but now crusted over with clay as springs and weights move clockworks the first though having an innate principle of selfaction the other only an extraneous and adventitious one    that in this progressive endless purification and perfection of an animal in body and spirit there may be many steps stations and mansions and one finished another may begin till the final completion  0 that in this endless progressive purification toward consummat perfection and happiness there may be a particular law of attraction fitness and similarity proportioned to the acquisition of the moral powers and extension of the natural powers that may draw and determine them to their several stations and mansions as the eggs of insects and seeds of plants are by electricity drawn to their proper niduss and leaves till like the asymptots of hyperbolas they come at last to meet in their curve ibid that this sketch of a system is innocent though it should be deemed a romance which is all i am answerable for    an abstract of discourse ii philosophical conjectures about the preference of vegetable to animal food and of the end and design of providence in appointing the first and on trial permitting the latter that by our present frame we are fitted as for vegetable so for animal food at least in the days of our vigor but that animal food on trial and consequent miscarriage under the first intended and appointed vegetable food was permitted by the author of nature as a pis all   to let us feel the natural and necessary effects of our own lusts and concupiscence   to produce naturally and mechanically those pains miseries and distempers that might create a horror of inordinat lusts and appetites and afford time and opportunities to ponder and think and thereby to return to order love of virtue and its source   to shorten the duration of our natural lives that sin and misery might not increase or last eternally   to concentre our natural powers to a level with our defaced moral powers that without clashing they might rise and be restored in the same progression and   perhaps to connive at what without committing violence on liberty could not at that time be prevented    that our present earthly bodies being composed of the now secondary sulphur salt air water and fine earth only and it being certain from chemical experiments that sulphur and salt are the two most active and destructive elements and that the three last air water and fine earth are more innocent the less active and deleterious and animal food abounding most in the two first and vegetable in the three last consequently animal food must be more destructive to animal bodies than vegetable in the same proportion   because by experiment the juice and nourishing extract of animal food is more tenacious and glewy than that of vegetable food   because animal food abounding more with salts and sulphurs and they by their nature being always in perpetual motion and action must mechanically tear animal substances faster than vegetables which abound most with the more passive and innocent elements especially   when fermented liquors are joined to them as dilution which harden the solid meat and obstruct its solution and digestibility and lastly since   the particles of animal food being strained through the finer tubes and stronger organs of animal digestion must be more minutely divided than the particles of vegetables can by their fewer and grosser tubes of preparation and being destitute of animal heat and force and having only the solar heat and universal law of attraction common and equal in both on these accounts the particles of animal must be much finer than the particles of vegetable food and consequently have a proportional much greater degree of attraction must therefore be united with greater force and form stronger obstructions and being more delicious betray the feeder more readily into excesses on all which accounts i say animal food must mechanically and necessarily create diseases and shorten life more readily than vegetable    that since what is and necessarily is must be a part of the intention of the creator and since animal food necessarily begets diseases and pains more readily than vegetable food can there is no accounting for the permission of animal food but by supposing pain and suffering here a necessary mean of expiation and purification which god on trial finding nothing else could reclaim his rebellious creatures unwillingly as it were permitted it as a father sends his son to the correctionhouse and that as when by pride tyranny malice murder and brutal commerce by the more luxuriant and delicious vegetable food the deluge came to its pitch he was forced to destroy both the people and their food by this deluge    that to those to whom revelation is familiar the like means of correction will be evident from the permission of plurality of wives to the jews and that under his immediate and miraculous government he on their murmurs indulged them in a monarchical government as a kind father admonishes his froward giddy child to beware of too familiar approaches to fire by burning his fingers    that there is no accounting for the permission of animal food on the foot of natural religion the wanton murder of animals for food when more salutary vegetable food can be readily had showing a cruelty and ferocity inconsistent with beneficent natures but that the universal proprietor of life and happiness might with great wisdom justice and kindness knowing when the term of expiation of a lower class of probationary progressive or lapsed animals is accomplished give leave in the course of his providence to put an end to their present manner of living and advance them thereby sooner to a higher state of being and felicity and at the same time secretly and in consistence with their liberty to admonish a higher rank of intelligences what they merited for these to be sure for wise and beneficent ends perhaps unknowable by us god might have permitted the killing animals for our food as he certainly did for sacrifice for this we have a patent in revelation but none for fermented liquors but as physic cordials and stomachicks or bitters on extremities sickness inclement seasons fatigue or in festivals    that fermented liquors of any kind can never in their nature be proper or the best for animal health and life for they are the spurious invention of art and the further deviation from the simplicity of nature which has given us no intimation of any such kind of beverage in the preparations of pure nature and which the animals who follow the laws of nature will not touch they are properly physic bitter draughts and unnatural cordials on extremities in sickness and inclement seasons and only designed for a temporary relief and occasionally fermentation concentres condenses and contracts as it were to a point at least to a much smaller volum like a burningglass which condenses the solar rays to make them more fierce all the deleterious particles of the vegetables that is their salts and oils and is the true and sole cause of all our great and atrocious distempers especially of all the train of the frightful nervous diseases which now rage universally in england like a plague and have been increaseing since the conquest and since wine has been familiar to all ranks and waterdrinking only timeously begun in life is the only sufficient antidote for these most wretched lunatic distempers    that there are many evidences of the hurt fermented but especially spirituous liquors do an animal body as   that they harden and destroy the digestibility of animal food and indeed of all kinds of food in the stomach   because they corrugat and contract the fibers and pin together the particles of the food so that they cannot be so readily separated and divided into their integral nourishing parts   because by their heat and activity they bring the fibers and membrans of the digestive organs and all the other solids into too violent and frequent vibrations and succussions and thereby break the tone and destroy the elasticity of these organs dissolve their continuity and so wear them out much sooner and   because they stunt the ductility and growth of the animal organs themselves and thereby hinder their developement extension elasticity and natural strength by continuing their linear or superficial amplitude folded or rolled up    that all sentient and intelligent creatures are in an expiatory perfectioning and progressive state is evident because here they must necessarily suffer and infinite beneficence could not possibly create any sentient or intelligent being merely to suffer but chiefly perhaps only for expiation and consequent progressive perfection and happiness that probably the early and universal precept of sacrifice might first introduce animal food which sacrificeing might have been intended   silently and kindly to admonish the sinner to consider what he deserves in this silent manner possibly for the preserving liberty inviolate all the animals might partly be designed to read us lectures of instruction in morality or of the conveniences of life in the same manner   by a prolepsis to perpetuat the expectation and hope of some more noble sacrifice with such a view as the eucharist was instituted after that sacrifice had been accomplished but yet this permission seems to have been against the grain as may be gathered from the caution not to eat the animals blood in which its life and deleterious qualities alone consisted    this aversion in infinite wisdom and goodness to permit the use of animal food which he condescended to merely for the hardness of the hearts of his lapsed creatures kindly to give them a forced permission to do what he found they would presumptuously do is further shown by the distinction between clean and unclean animals which were not to be eaten which in their nature are more apt to madden the passions enrage distempers and produce an aversion to virtue and though st peter had a miraculous vision to tell him nothing was unclean under the gospel yet that was not till the doctrine of selfdenial and mortification was established as the fundamental of christianity    that some vegetables as eastern gums spices aromaticks pungent foetids and onion tribes are more destructive to animals than young white animal food    to the difficulties that our blessed savior eat and drank with publicans and sinners that he wrought his first miracle to produce wine that he fed a multitude by miraculous animal food that st peter had a vision to instruct him that all food was equal it is answered   that the question only is which of the two foods animal or vegetable was probably first intended by the author of the universe before the lapse and the ruin of the planet we now inhabit   that different repairs are necessary to different degrees of ruin even in material habitations   that there is neither virtue nor vice in either kinds of food but in their quantity or as they are commanded by lawful superiors but that a low or vegetable diet is naturally and mechanically more productive of health and long life and consequently of knowledge and virtue than a high animal diet   that our savior came to seek to save those who were lost and so was under a necessity of converseing with the voluptuous and sinners but that the preference he gave to a low diet was implicitly included in his grand doctrine of selfdenial and taking up the cross   i grant that in our present situation on this ruinous globe it is impracticable and impossible for persons of all ranks conditions and occupations to live entirely on vegetables their use now is only to cure alleviat and lessen the distempers generated necessarily by animal food and fermented liquors and   even these and spirituous liquors are sometimes necessary on extremities in some diseases as filips and cordials for temporary reliefs and infinite wisdom foresaw this mischief of these high meats and drinks and provided an antidote for them at least for a time   by making the great bowel the liver to draw off their poison and turn it into a salutary medicin   by forming mineral waters of all kinds with such profusion and variety everywhere on the surface of the globe and   by creating the minerals themselves mercury especially mechanically adjusted for that purpose among many other uses and utilities of ponderous and mineral medicines which probably were not in the same form or so readily at hand before the flood    that to the appearances in the present state of nature that seem to clash with this doctrine which consists only in these three propositions   that animal food in its own nature is more ready to produce distempers than vegetable food   that therefore infinite wisdom must have had wise and beneficent ends in instituteing the first and but probably permitting only the latter and   that therefore the latter must be the proper antidote for disorders produced by the former it is to be observed further that at present our whole system is in disorder in a purifying and as it were in a febrile state laboring in a perfectionating progression by general laws under natural liberty and the harmony of the divine attributes which must at last terminate in relative order perfection and universal happiness that now there is no such thing as avoiding the destroying of animal life absolutely but that it should not be done out of mere luxury wantonness and ferocity which even the rapacious animals do not but from want of any proper food    that on the whole it is plain from revelation that   animal food was permitted and fermented liquors not absolutely but their excesses forbidden   that in many circumstances and situations a reasonable quantity of animal food and fermented liquors is absolutely necessary for a time   that it is plain from philosophy and experience that excesses in high animal food and strong fermented liquors are the true and adequat cause of the great and atrocious distempers   that animal food and fermented liquors will necessarily shorten life perhaps one half more readily than vegetable food and unfermented liquors and in the same proportion cause distempers   that though a moderat quantity of animal food and fermented liquors will naturally warm and strengthen the blood and tighten the solids for a time and consequently is necessary in all eruptive distempers yet they will shorten life and produce distempers much more readily than vegetable food and unfermented liquors   that for bodily and mechanical strength dureing a time and for a transient occasion though animal food and fermented liquors be the most effectual yet for intellectual purposes vegetable food and unfermented liquors are certainly fittest but to secure the golden mediocrity between bodily strength and clear penetrating heads about a half pound of animal food and a half pint of fermented liquors in the entirely healthy and young or rather less seems to bid fairest in quantity for that purpose the valentudinary must gradually sink below this healthy standard till by experience they find their own proper dose    an abstract of discourse iii a philosophical theory founded on experiments of the nature and laws of minute inanimat bodies and their systems in general proposition i the least particles of matter are of various sizes densities and figures the very least are almost infinitely small hard and elastic making the first order the second order are composed of those and these combined make the third order    scholium the quantity of solid matter in the material system of the universe may be very small and yet if duly divided and arranged might answer all the appearances of material worlds    prop ii the least particles of bodies are indivisible by any finite or created powers    analogous to gravity in the great bodies of the universe there is in the least particles of matter a principle of attraction and repulsion ibid schol i what the general law of attraction and repulsion in the least particles of matter precisely is has not yet been determined only in receding from the contact it is demonstrable that it is greater than the reciprocal duplicat    schol ii if particles attracted each other in the reciprocal triplicat in their point of contact the force of their attraction would be infinitely greater than at any assignable distance yet it would not be infinitely greater than the force of gravity since any body may be separated by an assignable force    schol iii repulsion begins and goes on where attraction ends and they probably go on according to the same law and progression but with contrary directions ibid prop iv the force of cohesion in the small particles of matter is in a compound proportion of the quantity of their cohering surfaces and the quantity of their attractive powers ibid corol therefore the less the cohering surfaces are the less will be the degree of cohesion and the least of all will be in spheres or spheriods    prop v the force of attraction in small particles increases as the size of the particles is diminished ibid prop vi the gravities of particles decrease as the cubes of their diameters ibid corol hence from the smallness and divisibility of its parts mercury is so easily raised and bodies may be suspended in fluids specifically lighter than themselves ibid prop vii if a fluid attracts the parts of an immersed body more strongly than they do one another they will be equally diffused through it    prop viii elastic particles suspended in a fluid after their collision will resile and by their actions and reactions cause fermentation and effervescence ibid prop ix unelastic particles suspended in a fluid attracting each other will sink and be precipitated the same will be produced by diminishing the gravity of the menstruum    prop x the figures of the particles of all unelastic fluids must necessarily be spherical and the elements of all solids must be of some of the regular solids as cubes triangles prisms etc    schol the figure of the particles of elastic fluids is of no consideration since their elasticity depends only on their repulsive force ibid prop xi the elasticity of solid bodies is the effect of the attracting force of their particles ibid prop xii that bodies under a rotation fly off in the tangent is the effect of the general law by which they continue in their state whatever that be  00 prop xiii the figures of the particles and their actions on one another arising from the principles of attraction and repulsion together with the motions impressed on them by living and intelligent agents will probably account for the appearances of the material world if adjusted according to their laws ibid prop xiv air is a system of particles endowed with a repulsive force which being fixed in all animal vegetable and mineral substances are by fire fermentation putrefaction dissolution or any other intestine action and reaction set at liberty and compose our atmosphere and hence its compression weight elasticity and density ibid schol the density of the air is proportionat to its compression and therefore its expansive force must be in the direct subtriplicat ratio thereof  0  prop xv earth is a loose collection of the different elementary particles of matter of all the three orders thrown together without any regular combination ibid prop xvi water is a collection of the solution of tasteless salts originally crystallizd but kept in fusion by heat and different salts are different combinations of these with the other elements  0  prop xvii acids seem to be very attractive particles of plain surfaces and angular points ibid schol possibly the figures of acids may be triangular prisms for all matter must be figured ibid prop xviii heat is the brisk vibrating action and reaction of the repelling nitre of the air and the ethereal fluid with an attractive acid sulphur which sulphur yields an inflammable oil an acid salt a fixed earth and a little metal     corol hence the affinity between light and sulphurous bodies and the true nature of inflammable spirits ibid schol since a thermometer in an exhausted receiver will rise and fall in the same manner as in the open air and since polished bodies in the same cling together as strongly as in the air it seems to follow that there is some subtle elastic fluid pervadeing all bodies to produce these appearances  0  prop xix light seems to be the vibrating particles of hot bodies driven out by the repelling force with an immense velocity which is increased by the ethereal fluid and the attraction of bodies ibid schol i since light is convertible into bodies and bodies into light it would seem that light is only the particles of a hot body thrown off with an immense velocity ibid schol ii the rays of light seem to consist of particles of different sizes and different degrees of refrangibility ibid schol iii the sun and fixed stars are immense globes of matter saturated with the particles of the second order or of light ibid schol iv it is not impossible this earth with all the planets and comets should be intended as temporary prisons and places of correction for the trial expiation or progressive purification of the several orders of lapsed sentient and intelligent beings  0  prop xx flame is the sulphurous smoke of a hot body  0  prop xxi bodies are transparent whose pores are sufficiently small and rectilinear ibid experiments prop i mercury consists of smaller particles than any known fluid   the particles of mercury the smaller they are the more perfect spheres they are   mercury is the heaviest of all natural fluids   mercurial particles attract some bodies most and fly from others the most  0  philosophical corollaries   therefore the particles of mercury are most easily raised by heat   therefore they have the greatest momentum   therefore they will readily pass through all animal substances which are lax and porous  0  medical corollaries   therefore the particles of mercury are fittest to break viscosity   therefore they are the fittest medicin to open the obstructions of the small vessels   therefore they are fittest to cure palsies   therefore they are fittest to antidot the scurvy   therefore they are the best antidot for the gout   therefore they are the best remedy for chronical distempers caused by excesses   therefore the particles of mercury duly prepared are the most probable mean to make the circulation quite round and entire through the whole system of the animal tubes that is to thin the juices   0 medical cautions mercury however prepared will infallibly burst those vessels whose obstructions cannot be dissolved and break those whose sides are very slender or which are putrified and therefore mercury is a divine antidot or real poison according as it is managed neither it nor any mineral medicin being ever designed by the creator to enter an animal body no more than animal food in his first intention at least before the lapse and perhaps not before the deluge the minerals being probably then intended for other uses and not being perhaps in the form they are now nor on the mountainous surfaces of the earth nor dissolved in water as we now find them     the choice of mineral medicines the best preparation of mercury is that wherein its particles are most minutely divided and separated and thereby fitted to pervade the smallest tubes ibid that preparation of mercury is best where its particles being minutely divided the mixture is made with that body of the most acknowledged specific virtue against the disease     therefore the aqua mercurialis is the best and most universal of all deobstruents in very weak persons the mercurius alcalisatus next then the cinnabar aethiops quicksilver purified with specific extracts etc ibid all mineral medicines ought to be infinitely divided before they are sent into an animal body ibid mercury and the active salts are the very worst and most prejudicial preparations to animal bodies and are not to be used but in small doses and in cases that require expedition     general medical corollaries as water bloodwarm is the best diluent so purified quicksilver is the best deobstruent but as water alone may be too sluggish so mercury alone may be too active and ponderous in delicat constitutions therefore the very best preparation is where mercury infinitely divided is mixed with the specific vegetable or mineral against a given distemper ibid therefore a thin cool low diet of vegetable or very tender and loose animal substances is the very best food for delicat and wasted constitutions     a general medical scholium from this system or philosophical explication of the nature and laws of the minute particles of matter it will follow   that soft mild thin and cool foods are fittest to carry on and continue animal life and functions   that spirits salts chemical oils and medicines that have passed through the tortures of the fire are most pernicious to animal bodies   that food of animals which live on animals are the worst kind of animal food for human bodies   that mercury duly prepared and combined with a specific alterative is the best deobstruent and dissolvent   that milk and vegetables are the proper food for young and diseased animals and tender constitutions   that water beverage is best for preserving the faculties clear the spirits free and prolonging life   that on the whole mercury somehow prepared and water naturally or artificially impregnated are the two antidots provided by nature for animal distempers in chronical cases     an abstract of discourse iv philosophical conjectures on spiritual nature the human spirit in particular that the natural powers of all spirits are these two understanding and willing which suppose a third viz living as their base     that all created spirits naturally and philosophically can be conceived only as infinitesimal miniatures sparkles emanations or if i durst use the words diminutive analogous particles of that infinitely perfect spiritual being who is so entirely one that he cannot have parts yet have these miniatures of him an infinitesimal portion of his spiritual substance endowed with a proportional share of his natural attributes of living understanding and willing and so are therefore necessarily immortal and cannot be annihilated   0 that these faculties or powers are felt sensibly and perceptibly by duly cultivated spirits of all orders and follow by analogy as to the substance of the soul and these faculties from the necessary nature and attributes of the deity     that this meaning is evident in revelation which says men are gods images and they are there called gods that is they were at first made infinitesimal divinities endowed with his natural and moral attributes in their order     that all pagan and christian antiquity believed that all created spirits were clothed with some material vehicle and that god alone was pure immaterial infinite spirit and revelation speaks of a spiritual that is of an infinitely refined and sublimed body     that neither material nor spiritual substances are knowable by us at present but by their sensible effects and acting but that matter and spirit are contrary though not contradictory in their most essential and distinguishing qualities matter being divisible in infinitum and spirit indivisible but what infinite divisibility rarity elasticity and velocity in the particles of matter might at last effect on its substance and qualities to give matter a nature different from gross porous inert bodies none but the author of matter and spirit can tell or comprehend but they will eternally be even thus like the hyperbolic curve and its asymptot probably like parallel right lines     living is probably actuating governing and moveing a divinely organized vehicle primitive ethereal or planetary and wherever there is any degree of life vegetative or divinely organized matter only sensative or rational there of neceslity must be a spiritual so to speak body or an immaterial immortal and progressive spiritual substance actuating governing and moveing a divinely organized body of some order or nature or another or both united     that there may possibly be orders ranks and species of animated beings with divinely organized vehicles of all degrees gradually rising from the coralline to the highest seraphim and an angel is only a spiritual substance actuating a divinely organized body of an order and purity a little higher than that of an unlapsed perfect human being     that we plainly perceive how imperfect and unhappy beings we are at present we of the human race yet cannot possibly think that we came thus out of the hands of our creator but must conclude we have lost our primitive creation state by some wilful mismanagement of our own     that our primitive state must necessarily have been   that our organisd vehicle was entirely supple and pliable to our spirit and   that our spirit was entirely pliable to the divine spirit     that all created spirits being naturally free must be necessarily fallible that on this globe there was never a thinking being come to any degree of maturity who found not himself at one time or another miserable and wished not to be otherwise this state is called the lapse   0 how this lapse was brought about is not explicitly revealed and is not knowable by mere reason or philosophy we feel that it is and that is all we at first know certainly gods design being to restore us with the consent of our own liberty and the harmony of his attributes discourages vain curiosity in particulars all that is revealed to us is general and indefinit we feel that we are imperfect and unhappy and that is sufficient to begin the first steps of our recovery into order in body and soul we are always certain in the knowledge of our recovery of the second step when we have made the first of the third when we have made the second and soon in infinitum more previous knowledge would but perplex and confound us and draw us out of the shortest road of restoration     that it is not improbable that the lapse was brought about by steps and degrees that way of lapseing being most natural to finite creatures and many of the several orders of beings might have been concerned in it     that our senses were given us to commerciat with material objects these of our present system especially or others we may pass into in which the key and logic of our knowledge is proportion all we can possibly know of spiritual natures must be from analogy without violence on our liberty which make us mere vegetables and from comparing them with the faculties and operations of our own spirits and analogy duly cultivated and cautiously guarded in spiritual nature is answerable to algebra or analyticks in mathematics     that since god is spiritual nature and material nature is and exists all gods words and works must therefore necessarily have a literal or material spiritual and divine meaning and sense the literal for beginners the spiritual for the advanced and the divine for the perfect perhaps it may be thus in the account of the lapse and all the group of this affair certainly were literal paradise a place of material delight the tree of life a food to perpetuat the then material vehicle in health and liveliness the tree of the knowledge of good and evil quite the contrary the serpent the highest fallen angel the spiritual meaning may refer to the moral powers of the soul as the literal did to the bodily the tree of life may refer to the source of the divinity the father the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to the godman jesus christ the serpent the grand deceiver paradise the natural powers of the soul which were contracted and sopited by gross matter upon the lapse after the moral powers were defaced by rebellion disorder selfishness and inordinat love of the creature     that by this lapse from the principle of attraction established universally in the spiritual as well as material world the primitive ethereal vehicle was gradually turned to a planetary one such as we now live in and thereby the activity energy and extension of the natural powers of the soul were greatly confined and stunted as to their elicited acts though they could not be so as to their fund and potential nature and now they must rise to perfection in proportion only to the acquired moral powers and by labor and culture under the economy of jesus and by the aid of supranatural grace be developd extended and purified     that perhaps all sentient and intelligent beings of all ranks must necessarily pass through a state of trial probation and apprenticeship before they can be even by omnipotence confirmed and eternized in illability and impeccability as a potter vitrifies his ware by fire or a smith steels his iron all that is necessary or proper for us to know or be certain of in our present state is that we are lapsed probationers and progressive toward perfection and happiness more precise knowledge of our preexistent or future state might only retard our progress     whether the ruinous planet we now inhabit was the primitive seat of unlapsed human spirits and by their gradual lapse was insensibly turned into its present condition is impossible for us now to determine paradise as described by moses is now nowhere to be found and most climats on a balance of incommodities with conveniences are pretty much upon an equality to the natives we find luxury destroys our planetary vehicles and pestilences infect the atmosphere and the earth as well as its inbitants but it is probable the divine power might suspend or accelerat the general laws of nature to turn this globe from its paradisiacal to its present state     an animal body being a system only of mechanical powers composed of fine elastic infinitesimal lines or threads formed into various webs or membranes and they into tubes or solid bundles are by proper liquors kept for a time in due elasticity having under them the primitive ethereal vehicle which is the proper covering of the soul and its immediate instrument between it and the planetary plaistering which when broken drops and perhaps they soul and ethereal vehicle pass into others till its progressive purification be finished into illability and impeccability     matter is capable only of division figure motion and situation and is passive and inert spirit is selfmotive and selfactive and must be the principle of motion in bodies without which they would continue for ever inert but so far as their principle of attraction or repulsion produced probably by some subtle universal fluid sets them into action but this fluid seems confined chiefly to inanimat matter and does nothing in particular or eminently in proper animal functions but as the general laws of nature operate and concur with all material operations and the whole of animated functions seem to be directly and eminently transacted by the actuating immaterial principle on the divinely organized ethereal vehicle which communicats its energy to the planetary plaistering so that the material spirit of sir isaac hugens and leibnitzs rapid fluid and even our common animal spirits seem to be without any use but in inanimat motions and appearances and perhaps animal motions and functions may be better understood and explained by supposing what is fact that our solids the nerves especially which are the more immediate instruments of animal motions and their functions are membraneous cellular tubuli preserved in their proper elasticity and tone by a milky oil contained in them and are mechanically adjusted at first by the immediate hand of the almighty and fitted to convey from the immaterial spirit a beginning of proper harmonious vibrations and oscillations which may perhaps be promoted and forwarded by the correspondent undulations of an infinitely rare elastic fluid disseminated through universal space which being sent in a proper direction by the appropriated nerves to the peculiar muscles and divinely organized instruments conveys proper action energy and motion to them and bodies and their effluvia so and so vibrating may to the same membranous tubuli communicate peculiar vibrations fitted to impress a sensation of their presence and of bodies and their qualities to the intelligent naturally sagacious spirit so that the whole work may be directly transacted between the spirit and outward bodies by the divine mechanism of proper bodily organs and the ethereal fluid may be to animated bodies in their motions and functions not essential but accidental or commodious for a more convenient propagation as air is to animals or water to the fish     that living activity or liberty and intelligence in some degree and all their modes are necessary to all animated beings of all orders and the difference in the individuals of the same order depends on the frame and texture of their vehicles in a great measure so that probably at first there might have been no difference of sexes that depending on a designed different configuration of this planetary crusting that some power analogous to the original creative attributes in the deity arising from his infinite selfactivity might be communicated to all sentient and intelligent beings is not improbable but how this infinitesimal creative power operated before the lapse is not known perhaps by an intense willing under the influence of the divine spirit     it is highly probable from the necessity of suffering in the present state that all the sentient and intelligent beings that shall ever live or appear on this globe were all created at the same instant miscarried in their probation and were all at the same time confined into infinitesimal prisons of this ruinous planet in the miniature seeds ova and animalculs of the primitive pairs or stock to be progressively propelld into sensible living on this planet all by general analogous laws in their order and this progressive propagation was kindly designed as a mean of recovering their moral powers by the benefits arising from the acquisition of virtue and wisdom in the parents though the contrary has fallen out     there may be original differences in the spirits of the individuals of the same order of intelligences some having one of the essential and natural attributes of the spirit in a higher extent than the other it may be sufficient to constitute the same order that their aggregats be equal but the perfection of the ethereal vehicle culture and the acquisition of the moral attributes makes the most signal difference in this state as air exercise and diet improve the health so does culture in the acquisition of the moral powers of the mind the natural powers are constant and invariable as to their fund and capacity but are impeded from elicit acts by the clumsiness and want of due culture of the animal and intellectual material organs     the mainoeuvre of providence in the restoration seems to be thus the radical natural powers being constant and invariable in their fund and capacity but the moral powers being defaced by the lapse infinite goodness ever acting by his own beneficent nature designing to recover these moral powers tied down the energy and elicitation of the natural powers by ligatures of this ruinous planet at first into that of mere living and included the whole mass of lapsed human intelligences in the loins of one or a pair who were to be the universal parents designing the selfactive and selfmotive principle in each should under certain general laws break and work off these ligatures in their several orders while they by other general laws relating to spiritual nature  prophecy to wit miracles apostolic lawgivers supernatural influences and graces and at last by the overwhelming light and love of the messiah his only begotten son should recover in them the defaced moral virtues     hence it is evident the first and initial steps of this restoration must in a great measure depend on the sanity of the adamical machin because when our earthly tabernacle is greatly disordered these elementary steps in the developement of the natural and the acquisition of the moral powers cannot be so readily brought about which depends greatly on the parentage for the whole aggregat of all that is connected with the parents their bodies humors and material or spiritual qualities are transfused and transubstantiated through the whole and descend to posterity just as they possess them and so the children must fare accordingly     it may happen by accident by disease by universal causes that one set of nervous glands in the brain one set of membranous tubuli the material organs of cogitation may be more spoiled broken and worn out in some than the others both in parents and children which will make a great difference in the elicit acts of the natural powers and which will make the difference between a lawgiver a philosopher a hero and an artisan but this whole affair is more immediately under gods special and particular moral government of his world though perhaps by general laws only occasionally and on great and worthy motives suspended     that at present the perfection of intellectual faculties depends in a great measure on the sanity of the bodily machin seems evident because   the adamical machin was intended only to suspend the elicit acts of the natural powers in their most eminent degree to give us fredom by developeing and throwing off their incrustation to acquire the moral powers   by experience we find that in disorders and distempers of the body the intellectual operations are either inconstantly weakly or unsteadily performed   it is fact that in seminal miniatures in embryo and childhood and for a long time the soul does nothing but perform the living and animal functions   we find that luxury leachery laziness strong passions inclement air bruises and accidents that injure the body hurt and destroy the free and easy exercise of these faculties in the acquisition of science and virtue   we actually see that as the body inlarges and the organs of the senses strengthen the intellectual faculties and their elicit acts grow stronger   all intellectual as well as vital operations are performed by the intermediation of modulated and harmonious vibrations on membranous tubuli the nerves and they absolutely depend on the state of the body   as luxury leachery and laziness will spoil these intellectual operations so on the other hand a low cool diet air and exercise proper evacuation and the mild ponderous medicines will cure and mend them and bring them often to the same sometimes to a better state than they were before     from hence it is evident that the whole work of our restoration in some measure depends on ourselves in cooperation with the divine assistance under his providence and the economy of jesus the whole creation from inert matter up to the highest cherubim being as it were an inverted cone rising from a point and made of infinitesimal surfaces as it were contitinually enlarging which makes their order being all pictures less or greater of the radical or natural attributes of their creator but men having defaced their moral attributes are imprisoned in gaols of this ruinous planet that by a progressive expiation purification and labor they may recover these and so become again similar to their original in their moral as well as natural powers and so become again infinitesimal divinities in their order and perpetually happy     the human soul has innate constantly and invariably in it all the natural powers it was first created with even now in its lapsed state at least in its fund capacity and essence only they are suspended chained down and concentred as to its elicit acts by the adamical tabernacle like a felon in a dungeon and will drop at last and so perhaps passing through various planetary gaols will progressively recover the use of their natural powers as they acquire the moral ones     from whence it will follow that the culture of the natural powers the acquisition of sciences and all intellectual exercises are but remembrance cutting off obstacles and removeing impediments opening passages and widening apertures through this adamical prison which is the most readily and effectually brought about by endeavoring to acquire the moral powers     that memory is but an affection of the understanding and will fixing the attention and reflection like seeing in the eye by the effort of the will the understanding is passive and inert as every material organ is it is the will that is the ruling and commanding faculty and sovereign in the soul the will is infinite and unlimited and may act in contradiction and contrariety to the understanding is so absolutely unlimited infinite and unconfined that it extends to all distances without the intermediation of body being a selfmotive and selfactive principle it is no less real in its operations though it do not always effect its volitions in it lies the true and essential natural miniature image of the deity     some have thought the will of all free agents so infinitely free in its own nature as it was derived from the creative source of liberty and power the deity that he left it free hid and imperceptible directly from his own penetration espial and influence for so much they think a selfmotive power necessarily implies though but an infinitesimal one and that even omniscience knew not that the angels had lapsed till the rebellion actually happened but had from all eternity provided for the possibility of such an event that to ennoble his creatures and make them fit to commerciat with himself he might suspend his omniscience to magnify his omnipotence and might designedly and arbitrarily not foresee though he certainly always might the contingent and natural actions of his intelligent creatures to make them more worthy of him but this bold and unwarranted supposition though it might solve some difficulties about the lapse about prescience and predestination and in the economy of revelation and the restoration is perhaps inconsistent with the perfection of the divine nature and since infinite penetration and sagacity will equally answer the same difficulties and is less derogatory from infinite perfection the former supposition is untenable i think     as the trine dimensions of matter and space and their necessarily being neither fewer nor more give us in unanimated nature a lively picture of the trinity in unity in the divine nature so the three fundamental natural and essential powers of all intelligent creatures carry up the analogical picture higher which perhaps passes through all the celestial hierarchy and all intelligent nature up to their source the creator who is the last and highest term of this climax as he is so we are in our spiritual nature with the uncomprehensible difference there is between the lowest finite and absolute infinitude as in our nature there is living understanding and willing so in his there is selfexistence omniscience and omnipotence or analogous to in the revelation language father son and holy spirit but as living understanding and willing in us and all creatures are but as it were modalities qualities faculties and powers in the divine nature on the contrary they must be realities subsistences and beings because every essential and radical attribute in god must be actually god because of his infinite simplicity and perfection but this representation of the divine nature is here only alleged as an allusion and analogous picture to take off the difficulties in this inexplicable mystery and in some degree to reconcile it to modest guarded philosophers of honest hearts who are conscious of their own low rank in the scale of intelligence the arian and sabellian heresies being the two extremes are yet widely different in their influence on christian perfection the first dwindling the merit dignity example and satisfaction of the savior of men into a mean low human transaction the second being only too philosophically nice and punctilous about the unity of the divine nature which though i think this emblematical miniature representation of it actually existent in all intellectual nature fairly reconciles and makes as clear as our present state will admit     the immaterial soul and ethereal vehicle sopited in a state of mere vegetable life for perhaps many ages in the seminal animalcul by this planetary incrustation in time appears on this globe becomes sensitive feels pain and misery then begins instinct and remembrance from precedent suffering and stores the mind with ideas or pictures of absent actions and things and on these the understanding operats to produce a facility and habit of reasoning as the material organs and instruments of these operations develope and strengthen reflection and remembrance of present or past suffering awakens conscience an innate faculty of the soul this faculty as the ideas multiply sensations become more intense reflection more strong and frequent and the intellectual organs are disposed becomes more anxious and vehement and providential disposing accidents or natural occurrences incline us to provide for a durable future happiness at least when this adamical tabernacle shall crumble into dust and then perhaps we come to a state to say in earnest lord what shall i do to be saved which seems to be the precise condition infinite love and goodness intends by this wonderful economy to bring us into   0 an abstract of discourse v on natural analogy its laws and some of its consequences things may differ in degree as well as in kind     def   difference in degrees is where things having their essential qualities the same admit in these qualities a more and a less ibid def   difference in kind is where some of the essential qualities of things compared are common some are different ibid def   by ratio or relation is meant the reference or connection any two things compared have with one another whose essential qualities common admit of a more or less ibid def   similarity is where there is an equality or sameness of relations in the substance and essential qualities of things compared differing only by a more or a less in abstracted and simple ideas this sameness is commonly called similitude of ratios in things substances or aggregats of qualities it may be called similarity of relations     def   things substances and qualities are meant to be progressive which are constantly increasing or decreasing similarly     schol space time motion and velocity seem to be no realities or external things but mere modifications different situations and circumstances of bodies or matter and are only our manner of conceiveing or considering these a particular space or the locality of a particular body seems to be the mathematical term or the limits of the three dimensions of a body as a point is of a line or a body in the instant of its evanishing or generating and universal space is just such an idea as infinite number or an infinitely great body or a mere ens rationis and to show that they are all but abstracted ideas and our partial manner of conceiveing things from our limited capacity if we perform actually the arithmetical operations as the expression points them out on proper infinite seriess and throw away all the lesser quantities we shall come to all the mysteries in fluxions and differentials ratios and series commonly known which are acknowledged to be only abstracted ideas and technical arts to supply the defects of our faculties which are not intuitive but progressive they admit of degrees or a more and less only as belonging to and being connected with body viz space time motion and velocity are relations or modifications only of body or matter     def   relative infinite is such as is supposed to increase or decrease perpetually yet by no finite power can be brought to and no finite capacity can assign or conceive its limiting terms viz the greatest or the least     def   absolute infinitude is the sole attribute of the deity who is infinitely infinite in all perfections and realities ibid def   things only are contradictory which totally destroy one another destroy their subsistence substance and qualities ibid schol it is very doubtful nay i think impossible there can subsist a full contradiction among created things substances or qualities since they must all be effluxes of the deity in whom there can subsist no contradiction for in created things to become totally contradictory there must be an equal action and reaction to have produced it but in all creatures there seems to be a subsistence and reality which cannot be totally destroyed by one another but by a power and energy equal to that by which they were created and infinite perfection cannot be contrary to itself there may therefore be a contrariety among created substances and qualities but not a full contradiction or total annihilation of their subsistence substance and all their qualities for even between material and spiritual substances there will remain still substance subsistence a relation an alliance a power of expansion and remission both of their substance and qualities which will make them alliable and as the chemists speak will make them capable of an amalgama like quicksilver with lead though they will eternally act by contrariety on one anothers substances and qualities and ever counteract one another  00 def   analogy is a similarity in substances and essential qualities differing only by a more or a less ibid schol analogy is of two kinds perfect and complete and imperfect and incomplete ibid def  0 perfect analogy is where there is a total similarity of substances and essential qualities differing only in degrees ibid schol there are i think substances as well as things and qualities of a middle nature between the extremes in every created reality and this seems to be necessary from the infinitude of the divine nature as well as from the nature of finitude and creature which must be various and gradual and as between any two given terms there are an infinity of mean proportionals assignable and between an infinitely small and an infinitely great part of the diameter of an infinite circle there is the perpendicular neither infinitely small nor great so there must be material and spiritual substances of all degrees of sublimity purity and perfection which though similar may differ in degrees  0  corol hence it may be possible there may exist material substances continually approaching to the nature and qualities of spiritual substances which yet they can never arrive at like the asymptots of an hyperbola  0  corol   hence there may possibly be material fluids so infinitely rare spiritual and elastic that they may permit gross porous planetary bodies with only an infinitely little resistance though that resistance may be still somewhat and but as the sun diminishes only infinitely little continually in the emission of her light neither the spiritual fluid nor the sun can be designed to last in their present condition a duration equal to gods eternity  0  def   complex analogy is where there is only a similarity between a certain number of essential qualities common to the things compared which differ in degrees but are diversified in other qualities less essential ibid proposition all creation the whole system of the universe with all the particular systems in nature are or can be nothing but the supreme being and his attributes transubstantiated into being and perceptibility but the cause will be always different from the effect the artificer from the work this may be demonstrated a priori from the nature and attributes of the first cause but to illustrate it a posteriori some instances may be proper  0    in the vegetable world to explain their growth and multiplication the infinitely rare elastic material fluid mentioned judiciously applied will be sufficient as also in the vegetation and growth of minerals  0    the totally inanimat creation especially our now secondary elements of air water light salts and mercury in the peculiar fitness of the size figure law of attraction and gravity show the infinite wisdom of their contriver for had they not been figured so as they are now in nature to fit the tubes of vegetables and to combine them into their now integral parts they could not have been proper materials for the accretion of these vegetables and if they had not been so combined and molded in the vegetables there had been no proper food for animals  0  the difference between vegetables and animals lies in this that for the actuation growth and multiplication of the first there neither is nor is wanted any other power or energy than what an infinitely rare and elastic material fluid produces on a divinely organisd material machin but in the latter there is a selfmotive and selfactive spiritual substance actuating and governing all their functions of some order or degree even in the lowest brute and insect  0    the human powers their degree order and the nature of their primitive ethereal vehicle with its now plaistering have been sufficiently explained  0    the angelic hierarchies must be infinite in their number rising in a harmonious progression and variety whose seats may possibly be the fixed stars and their analogous planetary ethereal systems and apparatus and these must be infinite in number likewise to preserve the equilibrium in universal space and their original distances from each other they must have one generical nature which must be that of the radical attributes of the deity living understanding and willing their specific differences may consist in light and love that some are more eminently luminous others more ardently loving and this difference seems to take place even on this ruinous planet in the different complexions and talents of mind in the different orders of men which can only account for the odd diversity in the children of the same parents under the same education and example     the fixed stars which must be infinite in number seem to be the material mansions of unlapsed tried and purified angelical hierarchies and of restored sentient and intelligent lapsed creatures gods throne his shechina is represented as above elijah went upwards and christ ascended bodies of all orders or different purity must have an ubi a local situation and a parmanent mansion at last these fixed stars and their planetary apparatus may be the seats of the unlapsed and restored and their ethereal vehicles may be of the same matter with their mansions and the matter of these luminous and glorious seats and the vehicles made of them may be eternisd by harmonious vibrations and a perpetual flux and reflux of their rays     god being the creator of all sentient and intelligent beings the efficient cause and object of perfect felicity it is a manifest contradiction he should creat any such without impressing in the very essence of their nature an ardent and insatiable tendency and ardor after reunion with him and accordingly the desire of happiness in all sentient and intelligent beings is invariable and unextinguishable as we see however they may mistake the end or means by being labile and placeing it in spurious selfishness and inordinat love of the creatures and in the distinction and contrariety between this innate bias and that adventitious one does the essence of misery and hell in all future states consist but this last bias being acquired only and not innate and essential the love merits and satisfaction of the son of god were contrived from all eternity to melt down and efface     is it not highly probable that the system of saturn the planets and their satellits may be the local prisons and dungeons or correctionhouses of the several orders of lapsed probationary and progressive sentient and intelligent beings they differ vastly in their accommodations they seem to be under some penitential discipline from many obvious imperfections and oddities not easily otherwise accountable or reconcilable to the simplicity beauty harmony and regular order of all the works of an infinitely perfect and powerful being but with infinite propriety and wisdom seem fitted for the design of penitence correction and initial purity and perfection   0 the comets cannot possibly be the seats of the blessed they are too many to supply only our decrease of water their alternations of extreme heat and cold light and darkness are too violent for any animated vehicle in a state of happiness they seem more probably to be the habitations of animated beings under the expectation of the last sentence or to be the condemned holds of gods kingdom     the next immediate mansions to this or the several stations and mansions designed for the respective purification of soul and body of lapsed sentient and intelligent beings and all the several steps stations or mansions in all probability have a gradual resemblance or analogy to one another and to this state here and this planet we now inhabit as the first or initial term upwards or downwards respectively in those upwards all the beauties comforts and pure delights here increasing similarly in degree without their deformity miseries or pains in those downwards all the contrary this climax seems naturally to flow from the simplicity and immutability of the divine nature by analogy and is conform to revelation all bodies or vehicles planetary and ethereal must have an ubi and a fixed mansion at least for a time and all sentient and intelligent beings must have a polity order and laws be under a government and subordination else it would not be a happy state but consummat misery god is a god of order and all his works are performed with order number weight and measure and must have all a mutual analogy or as near a resemblance to one another as the nature of things will admit     analogy does not at least always directly and infallibly demonstrat the real existence and necessary production of things ad extra but it strongly illustrats explains and makes them consistent with and consonant to the things that we know already see and feel to exist it makes them different links only of the same chain of effects and similar terms of the same progression removes difficulties and makes things rational and fit objects for a rational supreme cause to work by and this is the solid foundation of all true philosophy which can only gather causes and general laws by induction from repeated single experiments and is as high an evidence as the nature of finitude and our rank of intelligence will admit in imperceptible things and when confirmed by revelation rises to the evidence of a demonstration in the strictest sense     we may err and blunder in it as we may in algebra and geometry but often our errors in the last come but from want of culture precipitation or a wrong head only but in the analogy that leads us to the knowledge of the divine purity and nature and the necessity of our own purification and perfection for invisible states and the nature of spirits our blunders are often owing to a wrong heart licentiousness selfishness and independency if we went on in natural analogy as we do in natural philosophy and geometry by the simplest plainest and most obvious cases first collected by induction laid them up as a store to proceed on to the higher terms of the analogical progression and with attention and humility went on from inanimated matter and its law to vegetation animation spiritual being up to the supreme cause perhaps great proficience might be made in time by such a method analogy is the only mean of knowledge that can secure liberty in lapsed intelligences i will illustrate my meaning by an example in the system of saturn       god bringing creatures into existence must have made them after the most perfect pattern and therefore stamped them with his own image and so they must bear a resemblance to him and to one another which is analogy   the number of qualities added to existence together with the degrees of these qualities determine their order   the material world is a transcript of the spiritual and there is a more immediate relation between each material system and the intelligences to which it belongs and should they lapse and fall into disorder their mansion would make a similar change   there are many evidences of this analogy between the material and spiritual systems the sun is placed in the center of our system the material image of the deity the planets revolve about him in different times and periods to represent the several orders of lapsed intelligences these planets have no light in themselves it is all derived by reflection from him   heat light and their consequence attraction are his chief properties and by this attraction the planets are kept in their orbits which strongly pictures out the love of god continually soliciting all intelligences to a nearer approach to him   the light of the sun is diffused through the whole system representing that light which enlightens every man that comes into the world an emblem of him who came forth from the father of lights godman   the suns light is always accompanied with heat which represents the holy spirit the principle of spiritual life   the various magnitudes their distances from the sun with the periodical times of the revolutions of the planets will express the different degrees of the lapse and the times allotted for their first trials and probation the comets by their long elliptical orbits are thrown off to the greatest distance and again drawn back to the nearest approach to the sun to represent the extremes of love and punishment to the same intelligences in order to purify them   the planets are acted upon by two different forces attraction and the projectile force which are contrary to one another the projectile force makes the planet recede perpetually from the sun while the force of attraction prevents this effect the projectile force belongs to the planet the attractive to the sun how wonderfully does all this economy proclaim and speak in a language truly natural and proper to the majesty and wisdom of the deity the nature of the lapse the action of selfishness and inordinat love of creatures and the force of the divine love in the economy of jesus for it is supposed by the best philosophers that the solar attraction will at last prevail over the projectile force and thereby both planets and comets will be swallowed up and transformed into the substance of the sun finis miscellaneous observations on and explications of the preceding discourses    there seems to be something solid in one observation leibnitz makes viz the mark or criterion between the works and operations of nature or the god of nature and the works of art or of finite power and wisdom viz that god or nature works always by organs infinite in number or in a perpetual convergent progression of organs or means toward some one or many wise ends or art by organs finite in number or numerable by organs creature man is always meant a separable distinct part of a machin for example we may be able to reckon the wheels springs pullies chains etc of any watch or clock or any machin how complicated soever made by art but who can reckon the fibers tubes membranes valves inosculations ligatures degrees of curvature in the tubes etc of a pile of grass or of a feather of a bird the further we go by our senses assisted even by the most perfect art their number multiplies on us but then if we could descend into the figure number and law of cohesion of their component particles we should be entirely lost and all our art or management would leave us in thick darkness and utter confusion in the works of the god of nature there is no maximum or minimum assignable or conceiveable by us sir isaac newton has demonstrated the infinite tenuity of the particles of light and the progressive analogy of nature shows it is possible that there may be fluids as much more rare and of as much lesser particles as those of sand are bigger than those of light leuvenhoecks discoveries of the minuteness of some animalculs and of some tubes of animals are scarce credible by any one who has not seen some of them as i have the ingenious dr porterfeild has demonstrated the extreme tenuity of even an organized and compounded nervous fiber and there is no reason from the nature of matter from the laws of mechanism or from the divine attributes to stop there we may descend still lower or higher in infinitum and be warranted by reason and geometry one great fault in natural philosophers has been that they have rejected every account as incredible imaginary and fictitious which supposed fluids extremely or infinitely rare rapid and elastic as is that of huygenss leibnitz and sir isaac newtons and yet some such there must infallibly exist in nature as the phenomenon show for if the natural motions on our earth in bodies are performed by air water and heat since we know sensibly these are fluids of a finite and pretty near determinable size figure and degree of gravity in their particles the analogy of nature will make it as evident that the other less known secret subtle and unaccountable appearances may be performed by some other properly conditioned fluid i mean only in the appearances of the material world i say as certainly as if the first terms of a series x  x   x   x  etc were given i should certainly conclude the  0th   th and   th terms of such a series were x 0  x    x       the threads the last and the least fibers or linear filaments of all vegetable and animal substances are certainly infinitely small elastic and ductile in separateing and anatomiseing them we can never come to an end and fine microscopes will show that even the very least our senses can perceive or our art divide are still twists or tubuli and compounded of an infinite number of lesser and lesser threads they are infinitely elastic for we find no limits in their elasticity the smaller and finer they are we find them growing still more elastic in the same proportion and here also the progression is without stop or limit elasticity depending on the degree of attraction in the component particles the elasticity can never be stopped till we arrive at particles infinitely hard indivisible and imporose which no finite power can produce and no finite intelligence conceive and even in such there would be an infinitely small renisus or reaction of their particles when compressed so that all fluids of whatever nature and of whatever degree of rarity must have some degree of elasticity or reaction of such threads the membranes and of these membranes the tubes and vessels of all vegetable and animal substances seem composed i say not mechanically and according to the laws of nature that we see now they are governed by and accounted from but supramechanically composed and by the immediate hand and power or influence of an infinitely wise and powerful first cause of these again i say are the tubuli the coats of the pipes and all the other vascular apparatus in fewer or more pipes according to their use and necessity composed the fluids are only designed to keep them in a proper degree of moisture and glibness to continue their necessary tone and due degree of elasticity all the pleasant easy and healthful sensations of life depend chiefly on these fluids little can be effected by art or medicin on the solids and their linear fibers a temporary constriction only a transient winding up a fit of tolerable health and flow of spirits may be gained by astringent cordial medicines but it is regimen alone by rendering the fluids sweet soft cool and balsamic that enable the solids to play according to their innate powers that can give dureable and uniform good health and keep these solids as they were at first formed in a proper tone glibness and elasticity     we are not to conceive as if the author of nature created things in the order and in the manner we can only now apprehend or explain them they were in him but one single act of his omnipotence and omniscience for us to understand them in any tolerable manner if at all we can we must divide them into different parts and parcels and form an idea of them by different acts of our imagination for example suppose matter divided into solid imporose infinitely little cubes triangular equilateral prisms and spheres harmoniously ranged and united at first by some law of attraction and framed by a divine mechanism into organical bodies somehow analogous and similar to those which sentient and intelligent beings are now clothed with with this only difference that besides their being now cased over with the gross porous matter of this ruinous planet several additional temporary organs to fit them for their changeing situations may be added which in other situations may drop off and dry away as we see in the placenta and umbilical vessels of the foetus and the different temporary apparatus of the silkworm and other insects into which the first cause inspired an infinitesimal sparkle and miniature of his own substance and natural and moral attributes to actuate and govern this microcosm in the same analogous but in an infinitely lower manner as he presides over and actuates the universe this ethereal body being then supple and pliable to the actuating spiritual substance as it was to the divine influence but being free and fallible innumerable multitudes of them by spurious selflove and inordinat love of the creatures and created pleasures actually lapsed fell into rebellion and disorder and so brought on the necessity of this present state and the gross penitential appearances of this ruinous planet we now inhabit    body and spirit or material and spiritual substances will eternally be disparata if not contradictory yet entirely dissimilar and contrary and at an infinite distance in their natures and substances body will be eternally passive and inert spirit eternally selfactive and selfmoveing or endowed with an internal principle of acting on or moveing matter all their relation or reference one toward another can only be known by analogy and yet not being contradictory they might possibly be conceived of the nature of hyperbolas with their assymptots for though the passivity of body be in proportion to its density yet since body cannot be actually infinite in its quantity or extent its passivity or inertia cannot be infinite but lessens as its density does but still if its density was supposed even infinitely small that will not make it selfactive it must actually become spirit and pass through that term notmatter in its progression before it can arrive at selfactivity and then acquire the contrary qualities as the series              0             does and nothing less than infinite power can reduce it to that state that is it must be actually brought to be notmatter or an immaterial substance before it can become active or spiritual substance and so is as it were in the state of parallel lines and not of an hyperbola with its assymptot but still there is an analogy between their substances such an one thos as is between finite and relative infinite or between the least and greatest term of an infinite convergent series    the persians of all the ancients seem to have had the least intolerable notion idea or analogical picture on their imaginations of spiritual nature in conceiving it like light or fire if we suppose an indivisible infinitely rare substance and endow it with infinite elasticity and energy with an internal principle of selfactivity or of selfmobility we have the essential attribute of spiritual substance all its other qualities will be as modifications flowing from that root for then understanding or conception will become only analogous to an intimat union contact and presence to every individual atom or component particle as it were of the object conceived or understood reasoning will be a progressive performance of this intellectual operation and compareing the analogous parts or component particles to one another love or desire will be a continued union or contact with the object and so of the other modifications of this internal principle of selfaction in an infinitely rare and indivisible sentient or intelligent substance fire or light will then be the most luminous resemblance or analogical picture of spiritual substance and qualities especially if we take it as it is in its uncreated source the divine nature for an infinitely pure perfect simple and active living and intelligent substance then it will become the best analogical resemblance of the divine substance however faulty and deficient we can frame now as at present we are and small lamps globes or sparkles of light or fire kindled up voluntarily emitted or flowing from this infinite globe of light and love will best represent particular spiritual natures whose rays though emitted with a relatively infinite velocity will weaken and terminat in thicker and thicker darkness shade or want of fire and light which will best represent to us and furnish out the idea of body but still an imperfect one darkness being only a negation of light but as the rays of millions of different flambeaux may pass really though material through the eye of a needle without resistance or interfereing so spiritual substances by a proper penetration may conceive and comprehend according to their capacity and power their proper objects and in this analogical sense it may be understood that universal nature or the created universe may represent gods body or his sensorium and he may be called the soul of the universe as the planets in our system may be termed the body the tabernacle and organical machin of the sun in all which though there will be eternal impropriety and disparity for the one is the cause the other the effect only the one is the artificer the other the work the one is a living spiritual substance the other dead matter the one is selforiginated and necessarily existent the other is created derived and dependent the one is the first and least term the other as it were the greatest and last term of an infinite divergeing series but at an infinitely infinite distance this is as far it would seem as our active powers can go in their present state by themselves unless it be communicated and impressed by the source from above by direct sensation and feeling on the spirit    as the selfmotive selfactive power in spiritual substance is the source of intelligence by its intimat penetration union and presence with the whole internal substance of its comprehended object so it is the sole principle of liberty and the true miniature image of the deity in short it is the very essence of spiritual nature and the root of all its qualities and operations it may be limited in its extent in its elicit acts and circumscribed in its energy but in its root faculty and essential nature in its selfactive base it is infinite and unbounded a farthing candle is as truly light and heat as the body of the sun and we may have vehement willings longings volitions and velleities and have an innate inherent power to intend or remit our wills in infinitum which no other power can deprive us of but that which can annihilat us or turn us into another nature it would seem to me that created spiritual substance of all orders and degrees were analogous to the infinitely pure and perfect divine spiritual substance infinitely diluted or rarefied as it were like the light and heat of the sun reflected from the moon and this in an infinite similar progression becomeing rarer and more diluted till it terminated in darkness or shade thicker and grosser till it becomes like matter which is analogous to shade or darkness and which too goes on in infinitum thickning and incrassating to become quite inert and passive so that laying aside created substance both material and spiritual as quite unknown and unknowable and of which we can have no idea a priori nor be certain of its existence but a posteriori and from its effects or the divine veracity if we conceive spiritual substance analogous to fire or light infinitely pure rare selfactive and selfmotive and material substance analogous to shade or darkness infinitely dense compact and concentred we shall have all that i think can be made of either in this our present state and as darkness contracts and limits light extinguishes or imbibes its elicit rays so body or matter limits and stops the selfactivity of spiritual nature and they are an eternal bar and obstacle on one another as matter of a proper figure and contexture of parts condenses and heightens the action of fire and light so divinely organisd and harmoniously figured vehicles may promote the elicit acts of spiritual natures and the analogy to fire light and darkness will hold good then through all the degrees of compareing it may be said that all this is but figure but i think all true figure is but remote analogy and all true analogy is a distant progressive approximation to reality and both are as real the one as the other and differ only as the first and last terms of a series    the purification of the soul is perfectly analogous to the cure of the cacochymical and cadaverous state of the body and the method of cure of spiritual nature taking in the different subjects matter and spirit is perfectly similar to the methodus metasyncriticus of the ancients in the cure of a cachexy in the body the analogy is here perfect and complete they differ only as the first and subsequent terms of a geometrical divergent progression sin disorder and rebellion is to the spiritual nature of an intelligent being precisely and really as much as they are both realities what a cancerous and malignant ulcer is to an animal body the cure of the last is by a low sweetning and thinning diet at first to enable the patient to bear the last operation which must be by excision and extirpation and raiseing new sound flesh in its place penitence selfdenial calm passions a meek spirit and a constant patient attendance to and dependence on the directions of the physician of souls will answer the first part and i am of opinion he the divine physician of souls by his omnipotent power and his being god he i say must perform supernaturally and instanteously as it were for a sweetning cure of such inveterat humors alone would require infinite time some grand operation in which the creature is entirely passive analogous to excision and extirpation to divide between the joints and marrow to cut out the adamical core in lapsed spiritual nature and to raise up ingraft and implant his own nature and substance in its stead to perpetuat and eternise its soundness and integrity not in a figure or metaphor as is commonly though i think barbarously philosophised but at last and in the dernier resort and before the hyperboloid curve to speak so can meet with its assymptot as really and truly as matter and spirit are realities though of different natures in the day thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die in the sense that death came by adam death spiritual was completed by one action of the of the parentage of mankind so by some one miraculous operation eternal life comes by jesus christ i can never apprehend that the economy the operation the efficiency of jesus terminats either in example repair of the indignity confirming the standing hierarchies cooperating with us in destroying bad humors and habits gradually or making a sufficient free and full atonement only but that he must supernaturally and really cut out burn away and fill up and supply as it were with his own spiritual substance the adamical cadaverous core out of lapsed spiritual nature to sanctify and eternise its purity perfection and happiness and this as really though not materially but spiritually i say as really as spirit is real contradistinguishd from matter i choose to speak in the mathematical and medical language because the analogy the similarity and the precision is here so just so close and so luminous that i think it must penetrat those who can perfectly understand it and may by a dictionary be made plain to others if they think it worth the while to deal in such abstracted conjectures    the human spirit is literally and not in a mere figure a tabula rasa a sheet of white paper as it comes into the world at present under its planetary plaistering and it would seem for this very end the plaistering itself was designed and the gross porous secondary elements of this ruinous planet were by infinite wisdom contrived not but that spiritual nature in its order and in its natural and essential powers of living understanding and willing and all their modifications of sagacity penetration and conduct and a capacity of perceiveing outward things and of gathering the materials on which they work of external objects ideas and knowledge of things are not in their fund in the faculty and power unalterably the same and as it were engraved in their substance according to their order for spiritual nature cannot increase or diminish in its essential powers and capacity but their elicit acts their appearances ad extra may be intercepted and restrained from issuing forth by the gross planetary plaistering like characters and inscriptions engraved in the substance of brass or marble and filled up with wax clay or dirt or like the imperceptible ink which leaves no trace on the white paper but shows itself when rubbed over with juice of lemon thus the immaterial thinking substance is laid asleep becomes thoughtless and as it were stupefied a bare polisht plain and a sheet of clean paper its three natural powers of living understanding and willing are sunk in one of living only a mere recipient or continent and as it were without ridicule a dark lanthorn in the loins of the parent and as it comes first into the world but still the selfactive and selfmotive flame is alive within in its seed and its punctum saliens external objects pain natural instincts and necessities rub off some of the improper plaistering and break some of the ligatures these repeated and increased unloose more and thus the organs of sensation the apertures of the senses and the sentient and instructive powers are gradually set free and the dirt picked out of the spiritual substance then memory and attention awakens and ideas are formed and retained by time and degrees by the animal functions which flow from living more and more of the membranous tubuli and medullar and cortical glands of the brain are developd and the selfmotive powers by repeated efforts strains and pushes like a spring in the box of a watch set free more and more of ethereal organs of thinking according to the degree of culture exercise and useage they pass under and this by a quicker or slower progression and velocity as they are cultivated used and exercised till they come to the highest state they generally arrive at and thus by labor and exercise of the organs of the intellectual faculties they work off the dirt that filled up the ingravd characters on their spiritual substances and make the imperceptible writeing appearing legible merely by fileing off and scrapeing away the plaistering on the primitive ethereal vehicle whereby the spiritual substance is set free directly to enjoy and use all its inbred powers and has capacity to perceive all things ad extra know understand and possess them not as a blind man restored to his sight or a deaf man to his hearing or a dumb man to his speech who were born so but as a man for a short time shut up in a dungeon and separated from all things without and again set at liberty knows and enjoys all again as before and the final cause of this reduceing the spiritual substance to a tabula rasa by a gross plaistering and a temporary imprisonment in the dark dismal cadaverous dungeon of this body seems to be not only for expiation and punishment but that the moral powers of the soul justice goodness and truth or faith hope and charity might feel no interruption from the activity extent and contrariety of these natural powers but that they might amicably gradually and by mutual assistance and support rise and grow together in similar steps and a regulated progression till they were confirmed into a habit like sweetning the whole mass of the fluids by a milk or vegetable diet to fit the subject for the last passive grand operation in the economy of jesus which may be to cut out as it were of our spiritual substances that core schirrous or cancerous gland generated by the lapse and from the adamical principle and to heal and fill it up with his own immaculat substance perhaps really and truly as the liturgy of the church of england expresses it communicated to us in the worthy receiveing of the sacrament of the body and blood of jesus or somehow we cannot explain  this effect will neither appear absurd nor unphilosophical to those who believe jesus to be the son of god of the same substance and equal powers with the father the manner how is the proper subject of faith unconceiveable to us at least as we are at present but the fact in general or something of that kind highly probable from analogy and evident from revelation for i think no truly humble christian let him be in what state of perfection he may can think himself fit to be united and commerciat eternally with infinite purity and perfection till some great work be done in his soul more than he feels in himself then     most christians at least are agreed that the economy of the restoration as contrived and executed by jesus christ  godman the eternal son of god as far as it was possible on his part and as far as it was consistent with liberty and the harmony of the divine attributes i say all christians are agreed that this was a work of surprizeing wisdom beauty goodness and worthy of a god having in it to the greatest perfection every thing that could most effectually answer the end proposed but i know not if many have endeavored to show it to be the  and the only one that could possibly answer that end taking in the whole conditions and yet i cannot help thinking that this may be strictly demonstrated a sovereign may pardon on his repentance and amendment a rebellious subject and receive him into grace and favor but it will be eternally true he has been a rebel and that there remains the cicatrice of that sore in his heart and soul which first produced his rebellion now it is as certain as that god is that nothing impure and imperfect in its order can finally invariably and eternally be united and commerciat with him that is be permanently and eternally happy because of his infinite purity dignity and sovereignty and the receiveing an imperfect intelligent being into his favor service and designed post again permanently or one less similar to him in its order would not only sully his purity but make him cheaper and less intensely the sovereign felicity of the standing hierarchies and make his wrath less dreaded and so not a sufficient bar on their lapse now every truth and every fact is in its own nature as eternal as it is real it will be eternally true i have been a rebel if i have been one and god alone who has the power of creation has the power of annihilation and this fact as far as a fact can be at least as to its root must be annihilated and done away somehow before it can be creaturely and relatively true that i was not a rebel or at least that my rebellion is really now both as to him and me as it never had been which can only be done as far as i conceive by annihilating burning out consumeing the rebellious core of my spiritual substance and filling it up with something analogous to his pure immaculat divine nature and substance or new createing and nothing less than a god can do this so that on repentance and amendment men might be in the condition only of rebels whose lives conquering monarchs have saved yet instead of continuing them citizens had translated them into some remote corner of an uncultivated country as a conquered province and made them a lower order of creatures but as infinite perfection is without any possible change in its first most perfect intention as to its nature but not as to its degree and can only bring it about less immediately and after a longer time by reason of the freewills of his intelligent creatures on which he neither can nor will commit violence yet still will effect it with a perfection at last beyond even as it were the first intention accordingly jesus christ came to bring life and to bring it more abundantly and by his infinite power and love being god to annihilat melt down and burn away the adamical lapse core and cicatrice of sin and rebellion in spiritual nature and new create and replace his own divine substance and nature in its stead so that it may then be said with philosophic propriety that a truly regenerat and sanctified person has the divine nature and substance of jesus godman actuating and moving him that is living in him as really and substantially as ever before his adamical lapsed spirit lived in him this may sound odd and particular to little philosophers nay even to many perhaps virtuous and good persons but as i think it is the language of st paul and of jesus christ himself i think also that if there is not some reality and philosophic propriety in it as real as is the distinction between material and spiritual substance and that it is not entirely all figure there is no forming any idea either of the  or  of it and even figure in philosophic propriety is but the first term of an infinite series nor why it should have been revealed or mentioned nor will there be much difficulty insuperable in it or unexplicable in philosophy to those who admit jesus to be god and his words to be spirit and truth and god to be infinite in power and goodness the end and means of all whose actings must be equally perfect in their order and who suppose that matter and spirit must be equal realities this last state i resemble to the hyperbolic curves meeting with its asymptot i hope i shall be forgiven the particularity of the expression because of its justness and propriety and it may be the finishing operation to eternize the infallibility and impeccability of all lapsed sentient and intelligent beings to which few arrive in this life and all must perhaps pass through many mansions and various planetary vehicles before they can attain to it in its last perfection and to which some pass with a quicker velocity and a faster convergeing progression like the several orders of the hyperloids some of which meet the asymptot infinitely sooner and faster than others vide philosophical principles of revealed religion  but through which all must pass sooner or later for gods ways must be equal uniform and general to all his creatures of the same order with only the difference their general or particular wants or distempers require and as he treated the manhood of jesus christ who was made perfect by sufferings and as he has treated all his disciples so all lapsed intelligent beings must pass through jesus christ receive his revelation and go through his states sooner or later or in some mansion or another before they arrive at perfect infallibility and illability that is they must first or last all be jesus christlike before they can become permanently godlike or similar to him in perfection and happiness this progression and final perfection the freewills of intelligent beings may retard a finite time and they might have retarded it from eternity to eternity that is for ever both in the eternal nature of sin and the infinite purity of the divine nature without this sole and individual mean viz the merits power and efficacy of the economy of jesus the godman who uniteing human nature to himself has actually really but spiritually cut out the core and cicatrice of the lapse and filled up the discontinuous void with his own spiritual substance and nature in all those who shall be finally restored for he is the way the truth and the life    0 reason and faith in their true philosophic natures in their source and foundation are so far from being contrary much less contradictory that they are entirely similar and analogous and differ only as the higher and lowest terms of a divergeing series reason in its principle and faculty in the lowest intelligence is like a progression the first term of which is the root or miniature base of all the higher subsequent terms which are all similar and analogous to one another how compounded and elevated soever they may be and where the superior terms virtually include the inferior and bring them down to the simplicity and plainness of the lowest term but not without labor attention and reduction of the conditions to their proper limits god is the sovereign and supreme reason involved in clouds and darkness by reason of his infinite splendour and the infinite disproportion of our faculties and perhaps out of designs of love and goodness as we are at present in so unfit a state our reason and conception though infinitely disproportioned to such an object yet is of a similar nature with his light and natural attributes our reason and intelligent powers are analogous to the lowest and first term of such a progression his light and splendour to the highest and last great term which term in a series though comparatively infinite yet is but a finite compared with his absolute infinitude the other terms of such a series may be analogous to the natural powers of the several different orders of intelligences that may exist in external nature and all the several orders of intelligences with their respective powers from the lowest to the relative highest may be continually approaching one another yet never can reach the other terms much less the last term relative infinite and least of all to absolute infinitude for in absolute infinitude there is such variety of objects mansions pleasures and happiness as are boundless and without number or limits god is the sovereign and supreme reason i say always consistent uniform and invariable he is pure unsullied and unchangeable creatures even the most sublime and perfect can only know him by a progressive nearer approach to him in similarity which will be gradual but endless the faculties powers and qualities both natural and moral of creatures are as it were but analogous to speak still more plainly to a series such as               etc we of the human race at least our fellow animals of the only sentient race may be as   or   the higher orders may be as  0  00  000 etc to us at what term we began or any order begins we cannot know nor did we know could we alter it that depends entirely on the good pleasure and wisdom of him that made us in this point we cannot add a cubit to our stature but we may all press forward to higher terms and degrees and be continually progressive though perhaps mostly in our moral powers and consequently in perfection and happiness which can be done by faith only that is by trusting to believing in and acting according to the direction given by one whose natural and moral powers are of a much higher order or in proportion to a much higher term than ours are as if one whose natural and moral powers are as  000 should reveal to one whose natural and moral powers are as   only that in order to raise his natural and moral powers to   he must trust or believe that is take his word for it so and so and do so and so in consequence and that this will lead him on gradually to the term   and so in all the other terms of the progression this really seems to be somewhat like the case of all sentient and intelligent beings in order to advance in this eternal progression of perfection the only method possible for them is to trust and act in consequence of this trust and depend on the veracity and ability of the informer for this trusting is in order to the acting in building or working or sailing a ship to a certain port the seaman must trust and work according to his directions in raising an arch or measuring a distance very few operators understand the abstract geometry on which the directions are founded in short in this our present expiatory and probatory state in all we do to advance toward higher terms of our progressive perfection and happiness we must absolutely trust and work else we shall never advance in divine faith and in the progressive perfection of our natural and moral powers and here we have not only infinite power and wisdom for our director but infinite goodness for our assistant who yet from the purity and perfection of his own nature cannot direct or assist us but in consistence with the harmony of his own attributes and our own freewills i e imperceptibly our intellectual powers are analogous to our material organs our senses one with a telescope or with very strong eyes might see a city or a dwelling which another without it or with weaker eyes could not perceive if the weaksighted person must needs go to this city or dwelling he could only take the directions of the strongersighted on what point of the compass to direct his course what hills dales and rivers to cross to walk on trust and hope our trusting is in order to our traveling faith or trust that does not terminat in action or traveling is mere painting and dead work revelation discovers the being purity and perfection of the first cause his internal nature and the splendour he dwells in what is his society and what their occupation that to be happy completely and permanently we must get thither we while our powers natural and moral are but as   or   cannot see or perceive the beauty perfection of his nature and the place he inhabits nor the propriety of the directions and advices he gives us in order to get thither the nature of things will not admit of any other evidence but faith and trust and consequent working till our natural and moral powers are thereby raised higher and then we shall perfectly comprehend the beauty propriety and utility of these directions and advance gradually by following the same method to higher terms of powers and faculties and higher degrees of glory and felicity in this infinite endless progression from all which it is evident that reason and faith are so far from being contrary much less contradictory that reason is the first term given in this progression of created light or powers faith or trust is as it were the ratio of the several terms which goes through them all that is the ground or bottom of the subsequent operation and working by the directions given and working we infallibly pass to the second third and higher terms or to express it yet more strongly and clearly if possible faith or trust is proceeding as we do in algebra supposing the second or higher term though unknown yet as known and then working according to the conditions of the question the term unknown becomes thereby infallibly known i cannot enlighten these figures and this language here they are so pertinent and cogent to those who understand them     pure and disinterested love is love of infinite perfection for itself only and for its own amiableness without any other consideration but this as every thing else admits of infinite degrees the great mistake here lies in persons pretending to get to the top of the ladder without ascending by all the steps and that some define the last step as it were the first all things belonging to creatures must be progressive and confirmed habits must be acquired by repeated persevereing acts naked free and generous faith is trusting confideing and believeing in infallibility and infinite veracity upon its own word its nature only and on the most slender intimation of its orders the generous believer is determined to venture his whole on that bottom and from these two flow absolute resignation and this also admits of degrees both these are subject to error mistake and delusion in feeble lapsed mortals such as we are and this cannot be prevented from the very nature of things as they are now in our probatory and penitential state constituted but surely there is less danger in the excess than the defect no good master ever rejected or punished his poor goodnatured weak servant for loveing and trusting him too much or obeying him too precisely or literally i readily grant prudence order measure decency and regularity are the first of all the moral and christian virtues and frightful consequences have ensued upon the neglect of them and both enthusiasm and infidelity i think equally imply a wrong head some nervous disorder and want of common sense but both excesses and defects strongly evidence that there is a just medium wherein true virtue and sole right consist and still of the two evils infidelity and tepidity is infinitely the worst not only in regard of the infidels and tepid themselves as it defeats the sole means providence has or i think can contrive for their recovery and restoration but as it destroys numbers of weak souls by its influence and example and as infidelity saps the foundations of all morality and consequently of all civil society whereas enthusiasm can but hurt chiefly the bodies or outward fortunes of their fellow creatures by diabolic and tyrannical persecution unless hypocrisy can be joined to enthusiasm and then it becomes consummat infidelity to me it would seem the whole conduct and design of providence in this present probationary state is to produce in the hearts of his lapsed creatures pure love and naked faith only and that this is the sole key of all the enclosures of his providence and that this state of mind must be that which alone is of any value in the sight of god as being the only means possible of begetting perfect felicity and eternizeing it even so much as that he in his providence seems to neglect or overlook and undervalue as it were any thing less than these at least any thing that might retard or interfere with these an instance or two will make this plain we see that we of the lowest rank of intelligences are endowed with a capacity and power of communicating our thoughts conceptions dispositions and sentiments to one another directly plainly and intelligibly by language or writeing and by many other signs symbols and figures infinite wisdom and power without all doubt had he so pleased might have contrived us so at present that he might have been able somehow to communicate himself directly plainly instantaneously and intelligibly to all his intelligent creatures his children the work of his own hands whom he cannot help loveing as a tender father does his children but since this method not only would have done us no good but on the contrary a great deal of hurt by hindering and interfereing with our implicit trust our reliance our resignation our faith and absolute dependence on him so necessary to the production and eternizeing of perfect happiness we see he hides himself in clouds and darkness and is literally a deus absconditus as to us and does only approach to or commerciat with us in pure love naked faith and total abnegation and resignation so hard to be acquired again how necessary how indispensable would seem the precise the limited the unmistakeable nature of natural and moral good and evil to us in our present probatory state and yet we are left for the knowledge of them to feeling to observation to experience to culture to pain and suffering the wisest of mere men said that no man knows good or evil by all that is before him we naturally reckon health wealth honor and success the real the only goods of this life and yet if christianity is not all a farce their contraries are often nay almost always the most real and the most perfect goods since they are the shortest road to absolute resignation the greatest of all goods and the sole mean of perfect happiness once more infinite wisdom and power has as it were done nothing to gratify our curiosity to polish our natures to advance the comforts and gratifications the conveniences and the honest improvements of living how many nations and millions of our own species of the same order and rank of intelligences are left all their lives in the utmost brutality ignorance and savageness not only as to the endowments of their minds but almost as to the absolute at least decent necessaries of life in which cimmerian darkness and execrable bodily impurity or filth they wallow live and die even vastly below many of the brute species the most useful pleasant and instructive discoveries in life have even among the most polisht nations been discovered late by chance and with great imperfections at first i mean writeing printing the compass and glasses and even philosophical physic itself all this cannot happen by chance fatality from impotence or without some infinitely wise and gracious design under the economy and providence of an infinitely good wise and powerful governor who alone knows best how long and what kind of trial and probation is fittest for his lapsed intelligent creatures of such tribes nations and climats to what degree they have lapsed what is their most proper trial how far simplicity and even actual humiliation of this intelligent creature made a little lower than the angels in his natural unalterable powers and as it were to drench him in dirt and nastiness even below the lowest brute as compost fructifies vegetables is the via brevissima and suffering even unconscious suffering is sufficient and knows best what mansion they are designed to inhabit hereafter and has fitted outward circumstances accordingly and as to what is commonly reckoned polishing and having the decent necessaries and conveniences of life he leaves men to their natural liberty and industry to employ their natural activity innocently and laudably thereby which otherwise might run riot in turpitude and vice and to general laws which followed with simplicity attention and sincerity would naturally bring them perhaps the shortest way to disinterested love implicit trust and resignation and this he does even with a seeming neglect of those other things as accounting them of no value when compared with this pure love and implicit trust that disposition of mind which alone can beget and eternize happiness further of what great consequence to the quickness of our purification and consequently of our eternal happiness it would appear to us would be the certain knowledge of the precise time of our dissolution and death then like true penitent and serious felons we should employ all our last moments entirely in cleansing our vessels and trimming our lamps and yet all that is known in this weighty affair is general and that we once must all die the time the manner and other circumstances are all absolutely unknown to us and why this but only because infinite purity and perfection values nothing about us but absolute trust dependence and resignation even to venturing our very lives and as our savior expresses it if we do not hate that is undervalue our own life in respect of him or love it but in subordination to our love of him we cannot be his disciples again the providence of god seems to act here solely by second causes and by general laws only and in such a manner that we but seldom perceptibly discern the hand that disposes of events though doubtless as god is an infinitely free agent he governs by a particular as well as a general providence on proper and particular occasions he dispenses with his own general laws for a time by a particular interposition both in material and spiritual appearances but in these particular interpositions we can have no physical but only a moral certainty in order to raise and confirm our trust and resignation for faith trust and resignation always suppose uncertainty and doubt and some time or other we shall admire and adore that wisdom and goodness who could in so delicat and kindly a manner conceal from us and hide that hand which directs every atom of the universe and disposes of every hair of our heads in order to render our trust faith and resignation stronger and more firm as the darkness and cool of the autumn nights are what harden and consolidat the now refined and purified juices which the stronger sun and longer daylight had raised and sublimed into the seeds and fruits for the same reason the operations and influences of the divine spirit or grace and spiritual aid and assistance are secret and imperceptible and are always to be suspected when they are impetuous sensible and acting only by fits and starts as the gross machin is in or out of tune and as the animal functions play easily or labor especially in young unexperienced persons who have not been tried and purified in the school of the cross for these uncommon and extraordinary or even perceptible operations of the divine spirit seldom happen pure sincere and unmixt but to the long and severely tried and purified and when the passions appetites and spiritual humors are moderated calmed and subdued on the decline of a life spent in due retirement and proper silence not in the storm or tempest but in the still calm voice does the divine spirit speak and a truly humble and enlightened person ought to suspect himself get above and pass over every impulse sweetning or glance of light that comes not thus accompanied children beginners and noviciats in the spiritual life are often gratified with such sugarings for their encouragement but bread is for grown persons which is got by the sweat of the brow and bearing the cross and a prudent staid person will have too great a regard for the purity and dignity of the divine spirit to bring him down to account for all the mechanical and animal operations of his volatile and various imagination nec deus intersit nisi sit deo dignus vindice nodus and aquila non captat muscas but i beg pardon for this digression out of my sphere capacity and experience to treat justly but all the difficulties and darkness in providence and in natural and revealed religion seem to be intended by infinite wisdom with surprizeing justness propriety and delicacy only as the most effectual means to bring us to pure love and naked faith trust and resignation and are so far from being objections against the christian religion or to weaken its credibility dignity and authority that were there no such difficulties doubts uncertainties and mysteries in revelation it would be a strong presumption and an undeniable argument that it came not from god who being infinitely infinite in all perfection wisdom knowledge and goodness must be incomprehensible to us in our present state and so they could not be worthy adequat and proper for such a being who is equally above perception feeling and sentiment as above comprehension these may be good useful and real and his mediat but seldom his immediate operation this pure love and naked faith seems to be the only point in view of the great and wise governor of the universe even to such a contempt of what we commonly think fine endowments and polishing that in a great many instances in nations tribes and for ages he would seem in the conduct of his providence to prefer their contraries as the shortest way to this end though still there is a choice perfection and meliority in the honestum utile and the decorum but he only can know when where and in what outward circumstances lies the  quoad hos aut hunc     i take it in the first original creation there was but one universal salt or one kind of saline particles and that they were hard imporose triangular equilateral prisms when nature came to be confounded jumbled and unharmoniously combined the other elements of air water sulphur and earth in forming secondary elements were incommensuratly and discordantly mixed with these but still each preserved some degree of its primitive nature as the compounded elements retained more or less of their primitive particles in the composition hence our purest elements that art can elicit are still compounded and inseparable from the rest the purest most simple and most necessary of them all seems to be our pure nitre or the universal salt of the air the mother of all salts so necessary to animal life sanguification the stimulation of the animal fibers the propagation and action of heat and fire the production of cold and freezeing to animal foecundity and vegetation and many other of the appearances of nature to which it seems absolutely necessary and enters into their substance and composition the other salts acids and alcalis the essential or lixivial salts of vegetables plants and minerals are only this primitive nitrous salt combined with these other elements and as they predomine and exist in these particular subjects these mentioned salts in animals are nitre mixed with animal oils air water and earth such as their substances are compounded of and it is in the same manner in the plants and minerals the greatest specific difference among the salts seems to arise from the distinction of acids and alcalis the first both from philosophy and experiment seem to be of acuteangled greatly attractive particles and the degree of their acidity seems to depend on the proportional degree of the sharpness of their points which now may be various and their degree of attraction also alcalis seem to be porous calcarious fine earths the testaceous powders are among the most simple and perfect of them and the model of all the rest and plainly show the nature of the whole tribe they are as is evident from the microscope nothing but earths of an exceeding fine grain and of very small particles full of large pores and cells wherein an acid water or spirit has been contained probably that of nitre heat solar or culinary and calcination throws off some part of this acid water and leaves the cells partially empty these empty cells upon being immerged in any acid spirit or water suck it in again with violence and velocity the remaining part of the acid in the cells attracting the new acid with additional force and hence fermentation and effervescence all the alcalis partake of this one general nature and differ only as they are more or less combined with the other elements volatility arises from a light oil united with either kinds of salts and this seems to be the true philosophic nature of all salts salts and air seem absolutely necessary to carry on animal life and functions air to rarefy the juices separat the globules which might otherwise be too closely united and compressed for the introduction of which into the blood and fluids the lungs of animals seem chiefly designed salts stimulat the solids into actions vibrations and excite their clumsy elastic force in order to carry on the animal functions so absolutely necessary to living the just and proper regulation of these two air and salts the so necessary instruments of pleasant and easy living is as fit a subject to be adjusted by a wise and philosophic physician others are but empyrics at the best as diet and exercise the air we choose to live in ought to be rather dry and thin in the medium but even this must be proportioned to the nature of the distemper and the state of the juices if possible and they who have acquired their disorders by high meats and drinks which abound in volatile salts must by insipid foods and aqueous liquors lessen the abundance of such salts which is the case of all the rich and wealthy they on the contrary who have acquired their distempers by too poor and low a manner of living on vegetable insipid and instimulating food only which is the case of most of the poor or indigent must be cured by more generous living and more stimulating and sapid meats and drinks which excite their solids into action and on which account all low livers who are driven into this way of living by the nature of their distempers require double the exercise of those who can bear generous and active foods and without it nature will stagnat and sink which is the case of many of the female sex and of persons in gaols and monasteries in a word wherever a low or vegetable diet is necessary there air and exercise are in a much higher degree necessary than they are in a more generous diet to make a low diet effectual but then the high feeders pay in the shortness of their lives and the sharpness of their diseases for their present pleasure and idle indolent healthy life  finis errata page    line    dele with p    l   for gene read general p    for
