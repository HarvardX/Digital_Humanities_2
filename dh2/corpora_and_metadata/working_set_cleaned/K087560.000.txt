rennardo and satan sit to receive their friends  the first that arrives is  volunterus mitredos  his reception and pretensions told  then a man of war  the next a politician  an editor  an apostate  the man of words or great allsides  and pleaderus  the heralds advice concludes this canto  in its due time  the morning came uprose the guest  the host  and dame worthys of equal rank and fame  a messenger proclaimed the approach of horse and foot and cart and coach  announce their names old satan cried and be their merits singly tried to save us trouble  and that all may know why we have made this call  make them before they enter read  this scrowl which we pronounce our creed the creed  kings lords and commons we abhor and against all moral ties  wage war   religion useless is  equality  of vice well seek  and thus  be free the messenger was scarce withdrawn when lo  a reverend rogue in lawn burst in and thus attention won  an eh priest in days of yore translated to a neighboring

clothes  dashed down my crozier seized the spear and with my railings filled the air i have perseverd from earliest age against order in its every stage  thus qualified  i have hasted here  your prless mitd volunteer he ceased  the two rose up to embrace and near rennardo  gave him place  a man of war  the herald said strait in he rushed  with broken head got  as he from the bailiffs fled what  ho my hearties shall we do it what shall we make the noodles rue it shall  go out and  and  come in a placeman i with cash to sin damme i am yours  by this long nose this fierce cocked hat  and tight drawn hose  old beelzebub  i am ever thine give me but women dice and wine a nod of approbation did and he behind mitredos slid a politicians next dread sir and seems to make a woundy stir  the herald said   let him approach so said  so done  and take up time so precious now but barely make my duteous vow   time  its impossible to rate such various subjects on debate and i conspicuous in each storm  on prisons  taxes  poor  reform trust me will stir the blessed pother and act as brother should by brother sessions my first  yet as we have cast i will strive my best to make it the last but i must hence wild bills to draw which reason cannot pass as law they will be objected to no doubt at which i will make accustomed rout rave for my country seem its friend to serve our equalizing end farewell  depend  though young  i am  in wisdoms selfproviding way he passed  the herald  named aloud an editor  who entering  bowed  then thus  sworn foe to morals spurning laws i have fallen your sacrifice but trust you will raise your votrist from the dust oh  if you mean to dip in ink   wealths  worths  and virtues cause to sink   let me be uttrer of the filth i will force from purest soil such tilth as shall surprise your wondering eyes  another argus  shall arise to blast the innocent  the great confound and every generous feeling wound  such services deserve no less whenever we print well use thy press  a wretch without a coat is here the herald uttered with a sneer with forced assurance in his gait and seeming halfshamd fallen state the traitor stepped  then lowvoicd said   i am noble born  and soldier bred  but from my standard basely fled for which i hope reward from you i own twas simple  having grace not only to have kept my place but should have risen to command then treachry would have wrapped the land but now it is past  enrol me here none else will trust  you have naught to fear dear to our loves  the old angel said look up  nor longer be dismayed worthy to be chief engineer  for soldiers seldom reach our ear no  there is not one now pent in hell who for our cause so greatly fell what  give up honor  rank  and birth the all  which man esteems on earth to class with us  oh nobly done and nobly i will reward my son promote thee  as such merit should   command our corpse  ingratitude he blushed  retired  the crier now the man of words  proclaimed in view   my lud  and gemmen of this jury i come for freemen  freedoms fury i am yours confessed  bold slands son  all trades have tried  at last have won the  did not suit my mind to sword and musket disinclind the n was a poor regard  there merit only  meets reward lastly the  i tried  and now  as nastiest food  makes fat the sow  my gab my go my silver tongue has traitors saved  and guiltless hung   black i have made white  white turned to black in truth my conscience is a hack  no vice but i can virtue prove say if i am worthy of your love if god should offer me a brief and if a larger fee  a thief  even god might plead or lose his cause with me  the fee supports the laws  raised thus by chance i aimed to show what i in higher life could do but there  our friends rennardos tool alas  i proved myself a fool that there i failed was not my fault i hoped the cs would be caught like those  where i was wont to bawl to you  i need not name the  if more there needs to show my zeal as favrer of a common   my last essay  must all convince though  to the  next to our loved rennardo stand satan exclaimed  and seized his hand another man of words drew near who whispering in the old fiends ear was lowly heard  to articulate   i have  nuities  and stocks  and plate  to part with them  should sadly hate   rennardos else in every joint in all except this money point   now do but show  how i can serve and yet my precious land preserve which by half guineas i have gained and interest a little strained  let but my wealth continue mine with you  i ever will opine  it shall our worthy good compeer  rennardo cried  you know it is clear from others sacks  we mean to steal a place we have will suit your zeal be treasrer of our common weal and now  the herald  notice gave  their lordships ought some respite have to eat a bit  and dress  and shave for such a cavalcade drew nigh as would their passions gratify ladies  and lords  and squires  and dukes  at least they seemed so by their looks excepting  one sad ragged wretch  whod neither hat  nor coat  nor breech  such numbers  that the whole day d not do though each spoke but a word or two  therefore they would best take his advice and have refreshment in a trice then go  to business again  such good advice  was not in vain  they rose  withdrew  to breakfast went precedence sans  sans compliment end of the second canto the levellers canto iii the argument noon  council continued  arrival of volunterus maximus  his merits and reception  of catolicus  of the shade of vigginus primus  of dramaticus  of the nobilissimi ruinati  of nequissimus whose explanation produces a storm raised by heaven in defense of injured b  satan sinks to hell again leaving his proselytes in the lurch  they separately disperse  and order proclaim the death of rebellion  and now refreshed and nicely quippd again into the hall they trippd  the devil had on the very suit in which rennardo looked so cute  the day he made his famous m to acknowledge authors of commotion and nicely hid his cloven foot just as rennardo used to do it seated once more  largess was cnyd  in stalked with stiff mockmartial pride a selfconceited veteran  who scould around  then thus began   my state  not lessening  i report the happy meeting of this court i have long desired  done all i could done every thing  but what was good  to effect reform  alas in vain  we could not virtually complain loudly i railed against absentees and pensioners of all degrees   then arms i seized  a sole pretense and tailors taught to fire and fence made haberdashers muskets use and furnished colnels from the stews  made myself general  then swaggerd  a foaming pseudopatriot braggard it would not do  i must be candid the useless lumber was dis but hope assures this brilliant day may somehow work a lasting fray if so  behold  to help the fuss  great volunterus maximus  if  said the dl   we could aspire  such talents  and such worth to hire though foolish vrys did oerlook which you expecting could not brook yet we  if not below your care would name you  secretar at war  a courtly bow the acceptance showed he joined the gathering chosen crowd  largess  again was echoed round  largess   largess  the walls resound  the annunciation caused belief the coming personage some chief and so it proved by lines foretold of him  whose lines are sterling gold a ke ennobled  st  and cd base representation of  sir though not first  thus spoke the  i trust you will mitigate rebuke i have ever tried to win your favor witness my uniform behavior for you i fled my fathers c and left connections in the lurch mixed with the dregs and scum of earth to show the vanity of birth that title  pedigree  and crest and trophied halls  are but a jest  a farce  not worth the wise mans care who knows the goods of life to share with was  buffoons  and parasites devote to priapaean rites  in short i strive to make it clear that nature forming me a  became confusions and debauchries friend and thus acknowledged orders end yours thus  unalterably yours  a smile  my future aid secures example from so great a name   rennardo said will raise our fame will show the yet outstanding few how little to descent is due in token how we steem your  deign to accept this proffered place the rights of man  approves your call  equalitys high marichal pleased with the gift a glove he tore knighthoods proud vaunt in days of yore  his longborne banner then defaced and anarchys black standard raised  a noble shade  now passed in view which halted  sighed  and quick withdrew just as its form was lost in air these murmurs seemed to breathe despair  why why rennardo  would you force my generous spirit from its course  i worship god and love my king i will not be that rascal thing thy politics compel  forbear or by heavens sacred truth i swear i will be what nature meant i should  protector only of the good  it is past  we can no more agree  who parts from virtue  parts from me  the assembly on each other gaze rennardo stood in fixed amaze downcast his eye  now first it is said a blush his sable cheek overspread confused  he could not raise his head the archfiend observed  twas consciencestruck which to divert  he gently took his hand  then slyly smoothly spoke  why should that silly shadow make this change my friend  wherefore this gloom  such checks  we must expect to come   and  ere complete our grand attempt unnumberd phantoms of contempt virtues cold votrists will arise obtrusive on our ears our eyes   thou  heed them not  though they appear they are but unembodied air know  substance could not enter here  inimical to our career  the noxious vapors round us spread  would strike corporeal virtue dead rennardo  willingly beguiled shook friendship off  and blacker smiled  substance  again arrived  a form that seemed the leavings of a storm with deepsunk eye and rubied face a badge to temperance disgrace drew near and to the sable chief thus gave his phrenzied mind relief  before this court  i humbly bend   disorders staunchest loudest friend   rennardo thou thou know full well my wily match is not in hell ignobly born  i have dared to soar where knaves like me never sailed before  no height  i have not aspired to climb by aid of prose or aid of rhyme my eloquential powers framed against whatsoever is virtue named  myself confusions eldest born true to my sire have ever worn these maxims graven on my mind  with naught thine own be aye inclined to raise rebellions blustering wind and think anothers loss may give thy shattered frame wherewith to live beyond the reach of justice power who blasts as yet  thine every hour be grave  be gay  all sins partake  be  stsmnplr rake that hitherto i so have strivn behold who comes  the fallen from heaven behold  and own  conjunct with thine  my acts  illustrious cataline the portals opening wide displayed  two noble forms  in black arrayed  conviction sat in either eye and either bosom heaved a sigh each would have spoke when satan thus  ladies  precedence claim with us a word sufficed she curtsied low his  retiring made his bow   high born  and bred with all the care that fondness could invent  to rear a mind might suit this once fair frame no art was left untried  the flame of conquest struggling i represt but all in vain it fired my breast this my wise sire perceived  and dread lest shame should wrap his ancient head  he chose a mate and bade me wed   rank  splendour  wealth  i now enjoyed of splendour  rank  and wealth was cloyed insensible of honor grew and dissipation only knew which to support i played was crossed and pinmoney  and jewels lost  nor them alone  rennardo saw my spirit spurned at wedded law he introduced a blooming  and modesty has fled me since  their cause was mine  as such receive  and view in me another eve she ceased  her mate approached  and said  confusions cause  has turned my head of  thousand pounds a year i have not now a guinea clear my wife the fairest of the fair is lost to every social care trammelld by you has past the goal  you have had her body  take her soul  too spiritless  and mean to sin hence  satan said rejoin your kin who in days past my power defied and jmes expelled  and me belied backward he trod his dreary way to widowrd  ruined  chearless day now  cursings  ravings noise and gabble  exceeding all we have heard of babel reached the high bench  now louder grew in rushed the crowd  and first to view head of the democratic mob and panting for a sanguine job the wretch nequissimus was seen a bookuplifting   rights of men primaeval rights  i claim  he cried each passion shall be gratified   what claim has any to withold  from me  his lands or hoarded gold  what claim has any to refuse  that i his wife or daughter use  what claim has any to a home where i and mine may not freely come  what claim has any king or judge to hang a murderer  thief make budge  none i proclaim  this pamphlet read  you there will find it is decreed the world from fettring law is free and man controuls his destiny  earth thus disburthend of its load well storm the skies and unthrone g instant  a total darkness grew hail thunders lightning  scared the crew satan before had felt it is force arrest his cursed blasphemous course so sunk to hell from king and church and left his proslytes in the lurch fallen on their faces fearing day  they knew not wrath was passed away until they heard  a loyal choir with voice  and harp and stringed lyre the praise of albion celebrate whose three like heavens compose the state by that they found her genius rose triumphant over malignant foes ashamed  afraid  they separate fled  and order sang   rebellion dead finis
