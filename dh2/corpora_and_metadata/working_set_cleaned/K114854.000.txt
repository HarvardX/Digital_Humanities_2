contains the remainder of those miscellaneous pieces which were in some sort promised in the preface to the former volumes or which have been written since the verses are paged separately that they may be added to that volume which wholly consists of verse and the treatise of the bathos placed in their stead in this the reader may be assured no other edition is either genuine or complete and that they are all the things of this kind which will ever be printed by the same hands  there are in this volume as in the former one or two small pieces by other hands  the narrative of dr robert norris concerning the strange and deplorable frenzy of mr jn dis an officer of the customhouse it is an acknowledged truth that nothing is so dear to an honest man as his good name nor ought he to neglect the just vindication of his character when it is injuriously attacked by any man the person i have at present cause to complain of is indeed in very melancholy circumstances it having pleased god to deprive him of his senses which may extenuate the crime in him but i should be wanting in my duty not only to my self but also to my fellow creatures to whom my talents may prove of benefit should i suffer my profession or honesty to be undeservedly aspersed i have therefore resolved to give the public an account of all that has past between that unhappy gentleman and my self  on the  0 th instant while i was in my closet pondering the case of one of my patients i heard a knocking at my door upon opening of which entered an old woman with tears in her eyes and told me that without my assistance her master would be utterly ruined i was forced to interrupt her sorrow by enquiring her masters name and place of abode she told me he was one mr dis an officer of the customhouse who was taken ill of a violent frenzy last april and had continued in those melancholy circumstances with few or no intervals upon this i asked her some questions relating to his humor and extravagancies that i might the better know under what regimen to put him when the cause of his distemper was found out alas sir says she this day fortnight in the morning a poor simple child came to him from the printers the boy had no sooner entered the room but he cried out the devil was come he often stares ghastfully raves aloud and mutters between his teeth the word cator or cato or some such thing now doctor this cator is certainly a witch and my poor master is under an evil tongue for i have heard him say cator has bewitched the whole nation it pitied my very heart to think that a man of my masters understanding and great scholarship who as the child told me had a book of his own in print should talk so outragiously upon this i went and laid out a groat for a horshoe which is at this time nailed on the threshold of his door but i dont find my master is at all the better for it he prepetually starts and runs to the window when any one knocks crying out s death a messenger from the french king i shall die in the bastile  having said this the old woman presented me with a viol of his urine upon examination of which i preceivd the whole temperament of his body to be exceeding hot i therefore instantly took my cane and my beaver and repaired to the place where he dwelt  when i came to his lodgings near charing cross up three pair of stairs which i should not have published in this manner but that this lunatic conceals the place of his residence on purpose to prevent the good offices of those charitable friends and physicians who might attempt his cure when i came into the room i found this unfortunate gentleman seated on his bed with mr bernard lintott bookseller on the one side of him and a grave elderly gentleman on the other who as i have since learnt calls himself a grammarian the latitude of whose countenance was not a little eclipsed by the fullness of his peruke as i am a black lean man of a pale visage and hang my clothes on somewhat slovenly i no sooner went in but he frowned upon me and cried out with violence  gods death a frenchman i am betrayed to the tyrant who could have thought the queen would have delivered me up to france in this treaty and least of all that you my friends would have been in a conspiracy against me  sir said i here is neither plot nor conspiracy but for your advantage the recovery of your senses requires my attendance and your friends sent for me on no other account i then took a particular survey of his person and the furniture and disposition of his apartment his aspect was furious his eyes were rather fiery than lively which he rolled about in an uncommon manner he often opened his mouth as if he would have uttered some matter of importance but the sound seemed lost inwardly his beard was grown which they told me he would not suffer to be shaved believing the modern dramatick poets had corrupted all the barbers in the town to take the first opportunity of cutting his throat his eyebrows were gray long and grown together which he knit with indignation when any thing was spoken insomuch that he seemed not to have smoothed his forehead for many years his flannel night cap which was exceedingly begrimd with sweat and dirt hung upon his left ear the flap of his breeches dangled between his legs and the rolls of his stockings fell down to his ankles  i observed his room was hung with old tapestry which had several holes in it caused as the old woman informed me by his having cut out of it the heads of diverse tyrants the fierceness of whose visages had much provoked him on all sides of his room were pinned a great many sheets of a tragedy called cato with notes on the margin with his own hand the words absurd monstrous execrable were every where written in such large characters that i could read them without my spectacles by the freside lay threefarthingsworth of smallcoal in a spectator and behind the door huge heaps of papers of the same title which his nurse informed me she had conveyed thither out of his sight believing they were books of the black art for her master never read in them but he was either quite mopd or in raving fits there was nothing neat in the whole room except some books on his shelves very well bound and gilded whose names i had never before heard of nor i believe are any where else to be found such as gibraltar a comedy remarks on prince arthur the grounds of criticism in poetry an essay on public spirit the only one i had any knowledge of was a paradise lost interleavd the whole floor was covered with manuscripts as thick as a pastry cooks shop on a christmas eve on his table were some ends of verse and of candles a gallipot of ink with a yellow pen in it and a pot of halfdead ale covered with a longinus  as i was casting my eyes round on all this odd furniture with some earnestness and astonishment and in a profound silence i was on a sudden surpised to hear the man speak in the following manner  beware doctor that it fare not with you as with your predecessor the famous hippocrates whom the mistaken citizens of abdera sent for in this very manner to cure the philosopher democritus he returned full of admiration at the wisdom of that person whom he had supposed a lunatic behold doctor it was thus aristotle himself and all the great ancients spent their days and nights wrapped up in criticism and beset all around with their own writings as for me whom you see in the same manner be assured i have none other disease than a swelling in my legs whereof i say no more since your art may further certify you  i began now to be in hopes that his case had been misrepresented and that he was not so far gone but some timely medicines might recover him i therefore proceeded to the proper queries which with the answers made to me i shall set down in form of dialogue in the very words they were spoken because i would not omit the least circumstance in this narrative and i call my conscience to witness as if upon oath that i shall tell the truth without addition or diminution  doct pray sir how did you contract this swelling   denn by a criticism   doct a criticism that is a distemper i never read of   denn gods death sir a distemper it is no distemper but a noble art i have sat fourteen hours a day at it and are you a doctor and dont know there is a communication between the legs and the brain   doct what made you sit so many hours sir   denn cato sir   doct sir i speak of your distemper what gave you this tumor   denn cato cato cato remarks on cato published by mr d in the year         old wom for gods sake doctor name not this evil spirit it is the whole cause of his madness alas poor masters just falling into his fits   mr lintott fits z what fits a man may well have swellings in his legs that sits writing fourteen hours in a day he got this by the remarks   doct the remarks what are those   denn gods death have you never read my remarks i will be damned if this dog lintott ever published my advertisements   mr lint z i published advertisement upon advertisement and if the book be not read it is none of my fault but his that made it by g as much has been done for the book as could be done for any book in christendom   doct we do not talk of books sir i fear those are the fuel that feed his delirium mention them no more you do very ill to promote this discourse  i desire a word in private with this other gentleman who seems a grave and sensible man i suppose sir you are his apothecary   gent sir i am his friend   dr i doubt it not what regimen have you observed since he has been under your care you remember i suppose the passage of celsus which says if the patient on the third day have an interval suspend the medicaments at night let fumigations be used to corroborate the brain i hope you have upon no account promoted sternutation by hellebore   gent sir no such matter you utterly mistake   dr mistake am i not a physician and shall an apothecary dispute my nostrums  you may perhaps have filled up a prescription or two of ratcliffs which chanced to succeed and with that very prescription injudiciously prescribed to different constitutions have destroyed a multitude pharmacopola componat medicus solus prescribat fumigate him i say this very evening while he is relieved by an interval   denn gods death sir my friend an apothecary a base mechanic he who like my self professes the noblest sciences in the universe criticism and poetry can you think i would submit my writings to the judgment of an apothecary by the immortals he himself inserted three whole paragraphs in my remarks had a hand in my public spirit nay assisted me in my description of the furies and infernal regions in my appius   mr lintott he is an author you mistake the gentleman doctor he has been an author these twenty years to his booksellers knowledge and no mans else   denn is all the town in a combination shall poetry fall to the ground must our reputation be lost to all foreign countries o destruction perdition he wrote a treatise proving the decay of public spirit to proceed from italian operas opera opera as poetry once raised cities so when poetry fails cities are overturned and the world is no more   dr he raves he raves mr lintott i pray you pinion down his arms that he may do no mischief   denn o i am sick sick to death   dr that is a good symptom a very good symptom to be sick to death say the modern physicians is an excellent symptom when a patient is sensible of his pain it is half a cure pray sir of what are you sick   denn of every thing of every thing i am sick of the sentiments of the diction of the protasis of the epitasis and the catastrophe  alas what is become of the drama the drama   old wom the dram sir mr lintott drank up all the gin just now but i will go fetch more presently   denn o shameful want scandalous omission by all the immortals here is no peripaetia no change of fortune in the tragedy z no change at all   old wom pray good sir be not angry i will fetch change   dr hold your peace woman his fit increases good mr lintott hold him   mr lintott plague on it i am damnably afraid they are in the right of it and he is mad in earnest if he should be really mad who the devil will buy the remarks   here mr lintott scratched his head doct sir i shall order you the cold bath to morrow  mr lintott you are a sensible man pray send for mr verdiers servant and as you are a friend to the patient be so kind as to stay this evening whilst he is cuppd on the head the symptoms of his madness seem to be desperate for avicen says that if learning be mixed with a brain that is not of a contexture fit to receive it the brain ferments till it be totally exhausted we must eradicate these undigested ideas out of the perecranium and reduce the patient to a competent knowledge of himself   denn caitiffs stand off unhand me misoreants is the man whose whole endeavors are to bring the town to reason mad is the man who settles poetry on the basis of antiquity mad dares any one assert there is a peripaetia in that vile piece that is foisted upon the town for a dramatick poem that man is mad the town is mad the world is mad see longinus in my right hand and aristotle in my left i am the only man among the moderns that support them am i to be assassinated and shall a bookseller who has lived upon my labors take away that life to which he owes his support   gent by your leave gentlemen i apprehend you not i must not see my friend ill treated he is no more affected with lunacy than my self i am also of the same opinion as to the peripaetia  sir by the gravity of your countenance and habit i would conceive you to be a graduate physician but by your indecent and boisterous treatment of this man of learning i perceive you are a violent sort of person i am loath to say quack who rather than his drugs should lie upon his own hands would get rid of them by cramming them into the mouths of others the gentleman is of good condition sound intellectuals and unerring judgment i beg you will not oblige me to resent these proceedings   these were all the words that passed among us at this time nor was there need for more it being necessary we should make use of force in the cure of my patient  i privately whispered the old woman to go to mr verdiers in longacre with orders to come immediately with cupping glasses in the mean time by the assistance of mr lintott we locked his friend into a closet who it is plain from his last speech was likewise touched in his intellects after which we bound our lunatic hand and foot down to the bedsted where he continued in violent ravings notwithstanding the most tender expressions we could use to persuade him to submit to the operation till the servant of verdier arrived he had no sooner clapped half a dozen cupping glasses on his head and behind his ears but the gentleman abovementioned bursting open the closet ran furiously upon us cut mr diss bandages and let drive at us with a vast folio which sorely bruised the shin of mr lintott mr john dis also starting up with the cupping glasses on his head seized another folio and with the same dangerously wounded me in the skull just above my right temple the truth of this fact mr verdiers servant is ready to attest upon oath who taking an exact survey of the volumes found that which wounded my head to be gruteruss lampas critica and that which broke mr lintotts shin was scaligers poetices after this mr john dis strengthened at once by rage and madness snatched up a perukeblock that stood by the bedside and weilded it round in so furious a manner that he broke three of the cupping glasses from the crown of his head so that much blood trickled down his visage  he looked so ghastly and his passion was grown to such a prodigious height that my self mr lintott and verdiers servant were obliged to leave the room in all the expedition imaginable  i took mr lintott home with me in order to have our wounds dressed and laid hold of that opportunity of entering into discourse with him about the madness of this person of whom he gave me the following remarkable relation  that on the   th of may      between the hours of  0 and    in the morning mr john dis entered into his shop and opening one of the volumes of the spectator in the large paper did suddenly without the least provocation tear out that of no  where the author treats of poetical justice and cast it into the street that the said mr john dis on the    th of march      finding on the said mr lintotts counter a book called an essay on criticism just then published he read a page or two with much frowning till coming to these two lines some have at first for wits then poets past turned ctiticks next and proved plain fools at last he flung down the book in a terrible fury and cried out by gd he means me  that being in his company on a certain time when shakespeare was mentioned as of a contrary opinion to mr dennis he swore the said shakespeare was a rascal with other defamatory expressions which gave mr lintott a very ill opinion of the said shakespeare  that about two months since he came again into the shop and cast several suspicious looks on a gentleman that stood by him after which he desired some information concerning that person he was no sooner acquainted that the gentleman was a new author and that his first piece was to be published in a few days but he drew his sword upon him and had not my servant luckily caught him by the sleeve i might have lost one author upon the spot and another the next sessions  upon recollecting all these circumstances mr lintott was entirely of opinion that he had been mad for some time and i doubt not but this whole narrative must sufficiently convince the world of the excess of his frenzy it now remains that i give the reasons which obliged me in my own vindication to publish this whole unfortunate transaction  in the first place mr john dis had industriously caused to be reported that i entered into his room vi and armis either out of a design to deprive him of his life or of a new play called cariolanus which he has had ready for the stage these four years  secondly he has given out about fleetstreet and the temple that i was an accomplice with his bookseller who visited him with intent to take away diverse valuable manuscripts without paying him copymoney  thirdly he has told others that i am no graduate physician and that he had seen me upon a mountebank stage in moorfields when he had lodgings in the college there  fourthly knowing that i had much practice in the city he reported at the royal exchange customhouse and other places adjacent that i was a foreign spy employed by the french king to convey him into france that i bound him hand and foot and that if his friend had not burst from his confinement to his relief he had been at this hour in the bastile  all which several assertions of his are so very extravagant as well as inconsistent that i appeal to all mankind whether this person be not out of his senses i shall not decline giving and producing further proofs of this truth in open court if he drives the matter so far in the mean time i heartily forgive him and pray that the lord may restore him to the full enjoyment of his understanding so wishes as becomes a christian  robert norris m d from my house on snowhill july the  0th      god save the queen a full and true account of a horrid and barbarous revenge by poison on the body of mr edmund curll bookseller with a faithful copy of his last will and testament history furnishes us with examples of many satirical authors who have fallen sacrifices to revenge but not of any booksellers that i know of except the unfortunate subject of the following paper i mean mr edmund curll at the bible and dial in fleetstreet who was yesterday poisoned by mr pope after having lived many years an instance of the mild temper of the british nation  every body knows that the said mr edmund curll on monday the   th instant published a satirical piece entitled court poems in the preface whereof they were attributed to a lady of quality mr pope or mr gay by which indiscreet method though he had escaped one revenge there were still two behind in reserve  now on the wednesday ensuing between the hours of ten and eleven mr lintott a neighboring bookseller desired a conference with mr curll about settling a title page inviting him at the same time to take a whet together mr pope who is not the only instance how persons of bright parts may be carried away by the instigation of the devil found means to convey himself into the same room under pretense of business with mr lintott who it seems is the printer of his homer this gentleman with a seeming coolness reprimanded mr curll for wrongfully ascribing to him the aforesaid poems he excused himself by declaring that one of his authors mr oldmixon by name gave the copies to the press and wrote the preface upon this mr pope being to all appearance reconciled very civily drank a glass of sack to mr curll which he as civilly pledged and though the liquor in color and taste differed not from common sack yet was it plain by the pangs this unhappy stationer felt soon after that some poisonous drug had been secretly infused therein  about eleven a clock he went home where his wife observing his color changed said are you not sick my dear he replied bloody sick and incontinently fell a vomiting and straining in an uncommon and unnatural manner the contents of his vomiting being as green as grass his wife had been just reading a book of her husbands printing concerning jane wenham the famous witch of hertford and her mind misgave her that he was bewitched but he soon let her know that he suspected poison and recounted to her between the intervals of his yawnings and reachings every circumstance of his interview with mr pope  mr lintott in the mean time coming in was extremely affrighted at the sudden alteration he observed in him brother curll says he i fear you have got the vomiting distemper which i have heard kills in half an hour this comes from your not following my advice to drink old hock in a morning as i do and abstain from sack mr curll replied in a moving tone your authors sack i fear has done my business zds says mr lintott my author  why did not you drink old hock notwithstanding which rough remonstrance he did in the most friendly manner press him to take warm water but mr curll did with great obstinacy refuse it which made mr lintott infer that he chose to die as thinking to recover greater damages  all this time the symptoms increased violently with accute pains in the lower belly brother lintott says he i perceive my last hour approaching do me the friendly office to call my partner mr pemberton that we may settle our worldly affairs mr lintott like a kind neighbor was hastening out of the room while mr curll raved aloud in this manner if i survive this i will be revenged on tonson it was he first detected me as the printer of these poems and i will reprint these very poems in his name his wife admonished him not to think of revenge but to take care of his stock and his soul and in the same instant mr lintott whose goodness can never be enough applauded returned with mr pemberton after some tears jointly shed by these humane booksellers mr curll being as he said in his perfect senses though in great bodily pain immediately proceeded to make a verbal will mrs curll having first put on his nightcap in the following ma nner  gentlemen in the first place i do sincerely pray forgiveness for those indirect methods i have pursued in inventing new titles to old books putting authors names to things they never saw publishing private quarrels for public entertainment all which i hope will be pardoned as being done to get an honest livelihood  i do also heartily beg pardon of all persons of honor lords spiritual and temporal gentry burgesses and commonalty to whose abuse i have any or every way contributed by my publications particularly i hope it will be considered that if i have vilifyd his grace the duke of marlborough i have likewise aspersed the late duke of ormond if i have abused the honorable mr walpole i have also libelled the lord bolingbroke so that i have preserved that equality and impartiality which becomes an honest man in times of faction and division  i call my conscience to witness that many of these things which may seem malicious were done out of charity i having made it wholly my business to print for poor disconsolate authors whom all other booksellers refuse only god bless sir richard blackmore you know he takes no copymoney  the second collection of poems which i groundlesly called mr priors will sell for nothing and has not yet paid the charge of the advertisements which i was obliged to publish against him therefore you may as well suppress the edition and beg that gentlemans pardon in the name of a dying christian  the french cato with the criticism showing how superior it is to mr addisons which i wickedly ascribed to madam dacier may be suppressed at a reasonable rate being damnably translated  i protest i have no animosity to mr row having printed part of callipaedia and an incorrect edition of his poems without his leave in quarto mr gildons rehearsal or bays the younger did more harm to me than to mr row though upon the faith of an honest man i paid him double for abusing both him and mr pope  heaven pardon me for publishing the trials of sodomy in an elzevir letter but i humbly hope my printing sir richard blackmores essays will atone for them i beg that you will take what remains of these last which is near the whole impression presents excepted and let my poor widow have in exchange the sole propriety of the copy of madam mascranny   here mr pemberton interrupted and would by no means consent to this article about which some dispute might have arisen unbecoming a dying person if mr lintott had not interposed and mr curll vomited  what this poor unfortunate man spoke afterward was so indistinct and in such broken accents being perpetually interrupted by vomitings that the reader is entreated to excuse the confusion and imperfection of this account  dear mr pemberton i beg you to beware of the indictment at hickss hall for publishing rochesters bawdy poems that copy will otherwise be my best legacy to my dear wife and helpless child  the case of impotence was my best support all the last long vacation   in this last paragraph mr curll s voice grew more free for his vomitings abated upon his dejections and he spoke what follows from his closestool  for the copies of noblemens and bishops last wills and testaments i solemnly declare i printed them not with any purpose of defamation but merely as i thought those copies lawfully purchased from doctors commons at one shilling a piece our trade in wills turning to small account we may divide them blindfold  for mr manwarings life i ask mrs oldfields pardon neither his nor my lord halifaxs lives though they were of service to their country were of any to me but i was resolved since i could not print their works while they lived to print their lives after they were dead  while he was speaking these words mr oldmixon entered ah mr oldmixon said poor mr curll to what a condition have your works reduced me i die a martyr to that unlucky preface however in these my last moments i will be just to all men you shall have your third share of the court poems as was stipulated when i am dead where will you find another bookseller your protestant packet might have supported you had you writ a little less scurrilously there is a mean in all things  here mr lintott interrupted why not find another bookseller brother curll and then took mr oldmixon aside and whispered him sir as soon as curll is dead i shall be glad to talk with you over a pint at the devil  mr curll now turning to mr pemberton told him he had several taking titlepages that only wanted treatises to be wrote to them and earnestly desired that when they were writ his heirs might have some share of the profit of them  after he had said this he fell into horrible gripings upon which mr lintott advised him to repeat the lords prayer he desired his wife to step into the shop for a common prayer book and read it by the help of a candle without hesitation he closed the book fetched a groan and recommended to mrs curll to give forty shillings to the poor of the parish of st dunstans and a weeks wages advance to each of his gentlemenauthors with some small gratuity in particular to mrs centlivre  the poor man continued for some hours with all his disconsolate family about him in tears expecting his final dissolution when of a sudden he was surprizingly relieved by a plentiful foetid stool which obliged them all to retire out of the room notwithstanding it is judged by sir richard blackmore that the poison is still latent in his body and will infallibly destroy him by slow degrees in less than a month it is to be hoped the other enemies of this wretched stationer will not further pursue their revenge or shorten this small period of his miserable life  a further account of the most deplorable condition of mr edmund curll bookseller the public is already acquainted with the manner of mr curlls impoisonment by a faithful though unpolite historian of grubstreet i am but the continuer of his history yet i hope a due distinction will be made between an undignifyd scribler of a sheet and half and the author of a threepenny stitched book like my self  blackmores essays vol   wit says sir richard blackmore proceeds from a concurrence of regular and exalted ferments and an affluence of animal spirits rectified and refined to a degree of purity on the contrary when the igneous particles rise with the vital liquor they produce an abstraction of the rational part of the soul which we commonly call madness the verity of this hypothesis is justified by the symptoms with which the unfortunate mr edmund curll bookseller has been afficted ever since his swallowing the poison at the swan tavern in fleetstreet for though the neck of his retort which carries up the animal spirits to the head is of an extraordinary length yet the said animal spirits rise muddy being contaminated with the inflammable particles of this uncommon poison  the symptoms of his departure from his usual temper of mind were at first only speaking civilly to his customers singeing a pig with a new purchased libel and refusing twoandninepence for sir richard blackmore s essays  as the poor mans frenzy increased he began to void his excrements in his bed read rochester s bawdy poems to his wife gave oldmixon a slap on the chops and would have kissed mr pembertons a by violence  but at last he came to such a pass that he would dine upon nothing but copper plates took a clyster for a whipped syllabub and made mr lintott eat a suppository for a raddish with bread and butter  we leave it to every tender wife to imagine how sorely all this afflicted poor mrs curll at first she privately put a bill into several churches desiring prayers of the congregation for a wretched stationer distempered in mind but when she was sadly convinced that his misfortune was public to all the world she writ the following letter to her good neighbor mr lintott a true copy of mrs curlls letter to mr lintott worthy mr lintott you and all the neighbors know too well the frenzy with which my poor man is visited i never perceived he was out of himself till that melancholy day that he thought he was poisoned in a glass of sack upon this he ran a vomiting all over the house nay in the newwashd dining room alas this is the greatest adversity that ever befell my poor man since he lost one testicle at school by the bite of a black boar good lord if he should die where should i dispose of the stock unless mr pemberton or you would help a distressed widow for god knows he never publshed any books that lasted above a week so that if we wanted daily books we wanted daily bread i can write no more for i hear the rap of mr curlls ivoryheaded cane upon the counter  pray recommend me to your pastrycook who furnishes you yearly with tarts in exchange for your papers for mr curll has disobliged ours since his fits came upon him  before that we generally lived upon baked meats  he is coming in and i have but just time to put his son out of the way for fear of mischief so wishing you a merry easter i remain your  most humble servant c curll p s as to the report of my poor husbands stealing a calf it is really groundless for he always binds in sheep       but return we to mr curll who all wednesday continued outragiously mad on thursday he had a lucid interval that enabled him to send a general summons to all his authors there was but one porter who could perform this office to whom he gave the following bill of directions where to find em this bill together with mrs curlls original letter lie at mr lintotts shop to be perused by the curious  instructions to a porter how to find mr curlls authors at a tallowchandlers in petty france half way under the blind arch ask for the historian  at the bedsted and bolster a musickhouse in moresields two translators in a bed together  at the hercules and still in vinegaryard a schoolmaster with carbuncles on his nose  at a blacksmiths shop in the friars a pindarick writer in red

young man who is writing my new pastorals  at the laundresses at the hole in the wall in cursitors alley up three pair of stairs the author of my church history  if his flux be over  you may also speak to the gentleman who lies by him in the flock bed my indexmaker  the cooks wife in buckingham court bid her bring along with her the similies that were lent her for her next new play  call at budge row for the gentleman you use to go to in the cockloft i have taken away the ladder but his landlady has it in keeping  i dont much care if you ask at the mint for the old beetlebrowd critic and the purblind poet at the alley over against st andrews holbourn but this as you have time   all these gentlemen appeared at the hour appointed in mr curlls dining room two excepted one of whom was the gentleman in the cockloft his landlady being out of the way and the gradus ad parnassum taken down the other happened to be too closely watched by the bailiffs  they no sooner entered the room but all of them showed in their behavior some suspicion of each other some turning away their heads with an air of contempt others squinting with a leer that showed at once fear and indignation each with a haggard abstracted mien the lively picture of scorn solitude and short commons so when a keeper feeds his hungry charge of vultures panthers and of lybian leopards each eyes his fellow with a siery glare high hung the bloody liver tempts their maw or as a housewife stands before her pales surrounded by her geese they fight they hiss they gaggle beat their wings and down is scattered as the winters snow for poor grain of oat or tare or barley such looks shot through the room transverse oblique direct such was the stir and din till curll thus spoke but without rising from his closestool   whores and authors must be paid beforehand to put them in good humor therefore here is half a crown a piece for you to drink your own healths and confusion to mr addison and all other successful writers  ah gentlemen what have i not done what have i not suffered rather than the world should be deprived of your lucubrations i have taken involuntary purges i have been vomited three times have i been cand once was i hunted twice was my head broke by a grenadier twice was i tossed in a blanket i have had boxes on the ear slaps on the chops i have been frighted pumped kicked slandered and beshitten  i hope gentlemen you are all convinced that this author of mr lintotts could mean nothing else but starving you by poisoning me it remains for us to consult the best and speediest methods of revenge    he had scarce done speaking but the historian proposed a history of his life the exeterexchangegentleman was for penning articles of his faith some pretty smart pindarick says the redstocking poet would effectually do his business but the indexmaker said there was nothing like an index to his homer  after several debates they came to the following resolutions resolved that every member of this society according to his several abilities shall contribute some way or other to the defamation of mr pope resolved that toward the libelling of the said pope there be a sum employed not exceeding six pounds sixteen shillings and nine pence not including advertisements resolved that he has on purpose in several passages perverted the true ancient heathen sense of homer for the more effectual propagation of the popish religion resolved that the printing of homers battles at this juncture has been the occasion of all the disturbances of this kingdom ordered that mr barnivelt be invited to be a member of this society in order to make further discoveries resolved that a number of effective erratas be raised out of popes homer not exceeding      and that every gentleman who shall send in one error for his encouragement shall have the whole works of this society gratis resolved that a sum not exceeding ten shillings and six pence be distributed among the members of this society for coffee and tobacco in order to enable them the more effectually to defame him in coffeehouses resolved that toward the further lessening the character of the said pope some persons be deputed to abuse him at ladies teatables and that in consideration our authors are not well dressed enough mr cy and mr kel be deputed for that service resolved that a ballad be made against mr pope and that mr oldmixon mr gildon and mrs centlivre do prepare and bring in the same resolved that above all some effectual ways and means be found to increase the joint stock of the reputation of this society which at present is exceeding low and to give their works the greater currency whether by raising the denomination of the said works by counterfeit title pages or mixing a greater quantity of the fine metal of other authors with the alloy of this society resolved that no member of this society for the future mix stout in his ale in a morning and that mr b remove from the hercules and still resolved that all our members except the cooks wife be provided with a sufficient quantity of the vivifying drops or byfields sal volatile resolved that sir r b be appointed to endue this society with a large quantity of regular and exalted ferments in order to enliven their cold sentiments being his true receipt to make wits   these resolutions being taken the assembly was ready to break up but they took so near apart in mr curlls afflictions that none of them could leave him without giving him some advice to reinstate him in his health  mr gildon was of opinion that in order to drive a pope out of his belly he should get the mummy of some deceased moderator of the general assembly in scotland to be taken inwardly as an effectual antidote against antichrist but mr oldmixon did conceive that the liver of the person who administered the poison boiled in broth would be a more certain cure  while the company were expecting the thanks of mr curll for these demonstrations of their zeal a whole pile of sir richards essays on a sudden fell on his head the shock of which in an instant brought back his delirium he immediately rose up overturnd the closestool and besht the essays which may probably occasion a second edition then without putting up his breeches in a most furious tone he thus broke out to his books which his distempered imagination represented to him as alive coming down from their shelves flutterring their leaves and flapping their covers at him  now gd damn all folios quartos octavos and duodecimos ungrateful varlets that you are who have so long taken up my house without paying for your lodging  are you not the beggarly brood of fumbling journeymen born in garrets among lice and cobwebs nursed up on gray peace bullocks liver and porters ale  was not the first light you saw the farthing candle i paid for did you not come before your time into dirty sheets of brown paper  and have not i clothed you in double royal lodged you handsomely on decent shelves laced your backs with gold equipt you with splendid titles and sent you into the world with the names of persons of quality must i be always plagued with you why flutter ye your leaves and flap your covers at me damn ye all ye wolves in sheeps clothing rags ye were and to rags ye shall return why hold you forth your texts to me ye paltry sermons why cry ye  at every word to me ye bawdy poems  to my shop at tunbridge ye shall go by g and thence be drawn like the rest of your predecessors bit by bit to the passagehouse for in this present emotion of my bowels how do i compassionate those who have great need and nothing to wipe their breech with  having said this and at the same time recollecting that his own was yet unwiped he abated of his fury and with great gravity applied to that function the unfinished sheets of the conduct of the earl of nm  a strange but true relation how edmund curll of fleetstreet stationer out of an extraordinary desire of lucre went into changealley and was converted from the christian religion by certain eminent jews and how he was circumcised and initiated into their mysteries avarice as sir richard in the third page of his essays has elegantly observed is an inordinate impulse of the soul toward the amassing or heaping together a superfluity of wealth without the least regard of applying it to its proper uses  and how the mind of man is possessed with this vice may be seen every day both in the city and suburbs thereof it has been always esteemed by plato puffendorf and socrates as the darling vice of old age but now our young men are turned usurers and stockjobbers and instead of lusting after the real wives and daughters of our rich citizens they covet nothing but their money and estates strange change of vice when the concupiscence of youth is converted into the covetousness of age and those appetites are now become venal which should be venereal  in the first place let us show you how many of the ancient worthies and heroes of antiquity have been undone and ruined by this deadly sin of avarice  i shall take the liberty to begin with brutus that noble roman does not aetian inform us that he received fifty broad pieces for the assassination of that renowned emperor julius caesar who fell a sacrifice to the jews as sir edmund bury godfrey did to the papists  did not themistocles let in the goths and vandals into carthage for a sum of money where they barbarously put out the other eye of the famous hannibal as herodotus has it in his ninth book upon the roman medals  even the great cato as the late mr addison has very well observed though otherwise a gentleman of good sense was not unsullied by this pecuniary contagion for he sold athens to artaxerxes longimanus for a hundred rixdollars which in our money will amount to two talents and thirty sestertii according to mr demoivers calculation see hesiod in his   th chapter of feasts and festivals  actuated by the same diabolical spirit of gain scylla the roman consul shot alcibiades the senator with a pistol and robbed him of several bank bills and chequer notes to an immense value for which he came to an untimely end and was denied christian burial hence comes the proverb incidat in scyllam  to come near to our own times and give you one modern instance though well known and often quoted by historians viz echard dionysius halicarnassaeus virgil horace and others it is that i mean of the famous godfrey of bulloigne one of the great heroes of the holy war who robbed cleopatra queen of egypt of a diamond necklace earrings and a tompions gold watch which was given her by mark antony all these things were found in godfreys breeches pocket when he was killed at the seige of damascus  who then can wonder after so many great and illustrious examples that mr edmund curll the stationer should renounce the christian religion for the mammon of unrighteousness and barter his precious faith for the filthy prospect of lucre in the present fluctuation of stocks  it having been observed to mr curll by some of his ingenious authors who i fear are not overchargd with any religion what immense sums the jews had got by bubbles etc he immediately turned his mind from the business in which he was educated but thrived little and resolved to quit his shop for change alley whereupon falling into company with the jews at their club at the sign of the cross in cornhill they began to tamper with him upon the most important points of the christian faith which he for some time zealously and like a good christian obstinately defended they promised him paradise and many other advantages hereafter but he artfully insinuated that he was more inclinable to listen to present gain they took the hint and promised him that immediately upon his conversion to their persuasion he should become as rich as a jew  they made use likewise of several other arguments to wit  that the wisest man that ever was and inasmuch the richest beyond all peradventure was a jew videlicet solomon  that david the man after gods own heart was a jew also and most of the children of israel are suspected for holding the same doctrine  this mr curll at first strenuously denied for indeed he thought them roman catholics and so far was he from giving way to their temptations that to convince them of his christianity he called for a pork grisking  they now promised if he would poison his wife and give up his grisking that he should marry the rich ben meymons only daughter this made some impression on him  they then talked to him in the hebrew tongue which he not understanding it was observed had very great weight with him  they now perceiving that his godliness was only gain desisted from all other arguments and attacked him on his weak side namely that of avarice  upon which john mendez offered him an eighth of an advantageous bargain for the apostles creed which he readily and wickedly renounced  he then sold the nine and thirty articles for a bull but insisted hard upon blackpuddings being a great lover thereof  joshua parrara engaged to let him share with him in his bottomrye upon this he was persuaded out of his christian name but he still adhered to blackpuddings  sir gideon lopez tempted him with forty pound subscription in rams bubble for which he was content to give up the four evangelists and he was now completed a perfect jew all but blackpudding and circumcision for both of which he would have been glad to have had a dispensation  but on the   th of march mr curll unknown to his wife came to the tavern asoresaid at his entrance into the room he perceived a meagre man with a sallow countenance a black forky beard and long vestment in his right hand he held a large pair of sheers and in his left a red hot searingiron at sight of this mr curlls heart trembled within him and feign would he retire but he was prevented by six jews who laid hands upon him and unbuttoning his breeches threw him upon the table a pale pitiful spectacle  he now entreated them in the most moving tone of voice to dispense with that unmanly ceremonial which if they would consent to he faithfully promised that he would eat a quarter of paschal lamb with them the next sunday following  all these protestations availed him nothing for they threatened him that all contracts and bargains should be void unless he would submit to bear all the outward and visible signs of judaism  our apostate hearing this stretched himself upon his back spread his legs and waited for the operation but when he saw the high priest take up the cleft stick he roared most unmercifully and swore several christian oaths for which the jews rebuked him  the savor of the effluvia that issued from him convinced the old levite and all his assistants that he needed no present purgation wherefore without farther anointing him he proceeded in his office when by an unfortunate jerk upward of the impatient victim he lost five times as much as ever jew did before  they finding that he was too much circumcised which by the levitical law is worse than not being circumcised at all refused to stand to any of their contracts wherefore they cast him forth from their synagogue and he now remains a most piteous woeful and miserable sight at the sign of the old testament and dial in fleet street his wife poor woman is at this hour lamenting over him wringing her hands and tearing her hair for the barbarous jews still keep and expose at jonathans and garraways the memorial of her loss and her husbands indignity  prayer to save the stamp keep us we beseech thee from the hands of such barbarous and cruel jews who albeit they abhor the blood of blackpuddings yet thirst they vehemently after the blood of white ones and that we may avoid such like calamities may all good and welldisposed christians be warned by this unhappy wretchs woeful example to abominate the heinous sin of avarice which sooner or later will draw them into the cruel clutches of satan papists jews and stockjobbers amen  gods revenge against punning showing the miserable fates of persons addicted to this crying sin in court and town manifold have been the judgments which heaven from time to time for the chastisement of a sinful people has inflicted on whole nations for when the degeneracy becomes common it is but just the punishment should be general of this kind in our own unfortunate country was that destructive pestilence whose mortality was so fatal as to sweep away if sir william petty may be believed five millions of christian souls besides women and jews  such also was that dreadful conflagration ensuing in this famous metropolis of london which consumed according to the computation of sir samuel morland  00000 houses not to mention churches and stables  scarce had this unhappy nation recovered these funest disasters when the abomination of play houses rose up in this land from hence has an inundation of obscenity flowed from the court and overspread the kingdom even infants disfigured the walls of holy temples with exorbitant representations of the members of generation nay no sooner had they learnt to spell but they had wickedness enough to write the names thereof in large capitals an enormity observed by travelers to be found in no country but england  but when whoring and popery were driven hence by the happy revolution still the nation so greatly offended that socinianism arianism and whistonism triumphed in our streets and were in a manner become universal  and yet still after all these visitations it has pleased heaven to visit us with a contagion more epidemical and of consequence more fatal this was foretold to us first by that unparalled eclipse in      secondly by the dreadful coruscation in the air this present year and thirdly by the nine comets seen at once over sohosquare by mrs katherine wadlington and others a contagion that first crept in amongst the first quality descended to their footman and infused it self into their ladies i mean the woeful practice of punning this does occasion the corruption of our language and therein of the word of god translated into our language which certainly every sober christian must tremble at  now such is the enormity of this abomination that our very nobles not only commit punning over tea and in taverns but even on the lords day and in the kings chapel therefore to deter men from this evil practice i shall give some true and dreadful examples of gods revenge against punsters  the right honorable  but it is not safe to insert the name of an eminent nobleman in this paper yet i will venture to say that such a one has been seen which is all we can say considering the largeness of his sleeves this young nobleman was not only a flagitious punster himself but was accessory to the punning of others by consent by provocation by connivance and by defense of the evil committed for which the lord mercifully spared his neck but as a mark of reprobation wryed his nose  another nobleman of great hopes no less guilty of the same crime was made the punisher of himself with his own hand in the loss of  00 pounds at box and dice whereby this unfortunate young gentleman incurred the heavy displeasure of his aged grandmother  a third of no less illustrious extraction for the same vice was permitted to fall into the arms of a dalilah who may one day cut off his curious hair and deliver him up to the philistines  colonel f an ancient gentleman of grave deportment gave into this sin so early in his youth that whenever his tongue endeavors to speak common sense he hesitates so as not to be understood  thomas pickle gentleman for the same crime banished to minorca  muley hamet from a healthy and hopeful officer in the army turned a miserable invalid at tilburyfort   eustace esquire for the murder of much of the kings english in ireland is quite deprived of his reason and now remains a lively instance of emptiness and vivacity  poor daniel button for the same offense deprived of his wits  one samuel an irishman for his forward attempt to pun was stunted in his stature and has been visited all his life after with bulls and blunders  george simmons shoemaker at turnstile in holborn was so given to this custom and did it with so much success that his neighbors gave out he was a wit which report coming among his creditors no body would trust him so that he is now a bankrupt and his family in a miserable condition  diverse eminent clergymen of the university of cambridge for having propagated this vice became great drunkards and tories  from which calamities the lord in his mercy defend us all etc etc  the wonderful wonder of wonders there is a certain person lately arrived at this city whom it is very proper the world should be informed of his character may perhaps be thought very inconsistent improbable and unnatural however i intend to draw it with the utmost regard to truth this i am the better qualified to do because he is a sort of dependant upon our family and almost of the same age though i cannot directly say i have ever secn him he is a native of this country and has lived long among us but what appears wonderful and hardly credible was never seen before by any mortal  it is true indeed he always chooses the lowest place in company and contrives it so to keep out of sight it is reported however that in his younger days he was frequently exposed to view but always against his will and was sure to smart for it  as to his family he came into the world a younger brother being of six children the fourth in order of    birth of which the eldest is now head of the house the second and third carry arms but the two youngest are only footmen some indeed add that he has likewise a twinbrother who lives over against him and keeps a    victuallinghouse he has the reputation to be a close griping squeezing fellow and that when his bags are full he is often needy yet when the fit takes him as fast as he gets he lets it fly  when in office no one discharges himself or does his business better he has sometimes strained hard for an honest livelihood and never got a bit till every body else had done  one practice appears very blameable in him that every morning he privately frequents unclean houses where any modest person would blush to be seen and although this be generally known yet the world as censorious as it is is so kind to overlook this infirmity in him to deal impartially it must be granted that he is too great a lover of himself and very often consults his own ease at the expense of his best friends but this is one of his blindsides and the best of men i fear are not without them  he has been constituted by the higher powers in the station of receivergeneral in which employment some have censured him for playing fast and loose he is likewise overseer of the golden mines which he daily inspects when his health will permit him  he was long bred under a    master of arts who instilled good principles in him but these were soon corrupted i know not whether this deserves mention that he is so very capricious as to take it for an equal affront to talk either of kissing or kicking him which has occasioned a thousand quarrels however no body was ever so great a sufferer for faults which he neither was nor possibly could be guilty of  in his religion he has thus much of the quaker that he stands always covered even in the presence of the king in most other points a perfect    idolater although he endeavors to conceal it for he is known to offer daily sacrifices to certain subterraneous nymphs whom he worships in an humble posture prone on his face and stripped stark naked and so leaves his offerings behind him which the    priests of those goddesses are careful enough to remove upon certain seasons with the utmost privacy at midnight and from thence maintained themselves and families in all urgent necessities and pressures he applies himself to these deities and sometimes even in the streets and highways from an opinion that those powers have an influence in all places although their peculiar residence is in caverns under ground upon these occasions the fairest ladies will not refuse to lend their hands to assist him for although they are ashamed to have him seen in their company or even so much as to hear him named yet it is well known that he is one of their constant followers  in politics he always submits to what is uppermost but he peruses pamphlets on both sides with great impartiality though seldom till every body else have done with them  his learning is of a mixed kind and he may properly be called a helluo librorum or another jacobus de voragine though his studies are chiefly confined to schoolmen commentators and german divines together with modern poetry and critics and he is an atomick philosopher strongly maintaining a void in nature which he seems to have fairly proved by many experiments  i shall now proceed to describe some peculiar qualities which in several instances seem to distinguish this person from the common race of other mortals  his grandfather was a member of the rump parliament as the grandson is of the present where he often rises sometimes grumbles but never speaks however he lets nothing pass willingly but what is well digested his courage is indisputable for he will take the boldest man alive by the nose  he is generally the first a bed in the family and the last up which is to be lamented because when he happens to rise before the rest it has been thought to forebode some good fortune to his superiors  as wisdom is acquired by age so by every new    wrinkle in his face he is reported to gain some new knowledge  in him we may observe the true effects and consequences of tyranny in a state for as he is a great oppressor of all below him so there is no body more oppressed by those above him yet in this time he has been so highly in favor that many illustrious persons have been entirely indebted to him for their preferments  he has discovered from his own experience the true point wherein all human actions projects and designs do chiefly terminate and how mean and sordid they are at the bottom  it behooves the public to keep him quiet for his frequent murmurs are a certain sign of intestine tumults  no philosopher ever lamented more the luxury for which these nations are so justly taxed it has been known to cost him    tears of blood for in his own nature he is far from being profuse though indeed he never stays a night at a gentlemans house without leaving something behind him  he receives with g eat submission whatever his patrons think fit to give him and when they lay heavy burdens upon him which is frequently enough he gets rid of them as soon as he can but not without some labor and much grumbling  he is a perpetual hangeron yet no body knows how to be without him he patiently fuffers himself to be kept under but loves to be well used and in that case will sacrifice his vitals to give you ease and he has hardly one aquaintance for whom he has not been bound yet as far as we can find was never known to lose any thing by it  he is observed to be very    unquiet in the company of a frenchman in new clothes or a young coquett  he is in short the subject of much mirth and raillery which he seems to take well enough though it has not been observed that ever any good thing came from himself  there is so general an opinion of his justice that sometimes very hard cases are left to his decision and while he sits upon them he carries himself exactly even between both sides except where some knotty point arises and then he is observed to lean a little to the right or left as the matter inclines him but his reasons for it are so manifest and convincing that every man approves them  postscript gentle reader though i am not insensible how many thousand persons have been and still are with great dexterity handling this subject and no less aware of what infinite rheams of paper have been laid out upon it however in my opinion no man living has touched it with greater nicety and more delicate turns than our author but because there is some intended obscurity in this relation and curiosity inquisitive of secrets may possibly not enter into the bottom and depth of the subject twas thought not improper to take off the veil and gain the readers favor by enlarging his insight ars enim non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem it is well known that it has been the policy of all times to deliver down important subjects by emblem and riddle and not to suffer the knowledge of truth to be derived to us in plain and simple terms which are generally as soon forgot as conceived for this reason the heathen religion is mostly couched under mythology for the like reason this being a fundamental in its kind the author has thought fit to wrap up his treasure in clean linen which it is our business to lay open and set in a due light for i have observed upon any accidental discovery the least glimpse has given great diversion to the eager spectator as many ladies could testify were it proper or the case would admit  the politest companies have vouchsafed to smile at the bare name and some people of fashon have been so little scrupulous of bringing it in play that it was the usual saying of a knight and a man of good breeding that whenever he rose his ase rose with him    he alludes to the manner of our birth the head and arms appearing before the posteriors and the two feet which he calls the footmen    victuallinghouse the belly which receives and digests our nourishment    master of arts persius magister artis ingenique largitor venture    idolater alludes to the sacrifices offered by the romans to the goddess cloacina    priests goldfinders who perform their office in the nightime but our author further seems to have an eye to the custom of the heathen priests stealing the offerings in the night of which see more in the story of bell and the dragon    wrinkle this refers to a proverb  you have one wrinkle in your ase more than you had before    tears of blood haemorrhoids according to the physicians are a frequeut consequence of intemperance    unquiet their tails being generally observed to be most restless  the wonder of all the wonders that ever the world wondered at for all persons of quality and others newly arrived at this city the famous artist john emanuel schoitz who to the great surprise and satisfaction of all spectators is ready to do the following wonderful performances the like before never seen in this kingdom  he will heat a bar of iron red hot and thrust it into a barrel of gunpowder before all the company and yet it shall not take fire  he lets any gentleman charge a blunderbuss with the same gunpowder and twelve leaden bullets which blunderbuss the said artist discharges full in the face of the said company without the least hurt the bullets sticking in the wall behind them  he takes any gentlemans own sword and runs it through the said gentlemans body so that the point appears bloody at the back to all the spectators then he takes out the sword wipes it clean and returns it to the owner who receives no manner of hurt  he takes a pot of scalding oil and throws it by great ladles full directly at the ladies without spoiling their clothes or burning their skins  he takes any person of qualitys child from two years old to six and lets the childs own father or mother take a pike in their hands then the artist takes the child in his arms and tosses it upon the point of the pike where it sticks to the great satisfaction of all spectators and is then taken off without so much as a hole in his coat  he mounts upon a scaffold just over the spectators and from thence throws down a great quantity of large tiles and stones which fall like so many pillows without so much as discomposing either perukes or headdresses  he takes any person of quality up to the said scaffold which person pulls off his shoes and leaps nine foot directly down on a board prepared on purpose full of sharp spikes six inches long without hurting his feet or damaging his stockings  he places the said board on a chair upon which a lady sits down with another lady in her lap while the spikes instead of entering into the under ladys flesh will feel like a velvet cushion  he takes any person of qualitys footman ties a rope about his bare neck and draws him up by pullies to the cieling and these keeps him hanging as long as his master or the company pleases the said footman to the wonder and delight of all beholders with a pot of ale in one hand and a pipe in the other and when he is let down there will not appear the least mark of the cord about his neck  he bids a ladys maid put her finger into a cup of clear liquor like water upon which her face and both her hands are immediately withered like an old woman of fourscore her belly swells as if she were in a week of her time and her legs are as thick as millposts but upon putting her finger into another cup she becomes as young and handsome as she was before  he gives any gentleman leave to drive forty twelvepenny nails up to the head in a porters backside and then places the said porter on a loadstone chair which draws out every nail and the porter feels no pain  he likewise draws the teeth of half a dozen gentlemen mixes and jumbles them in a hat gives any person leave to blindfold him and raturns each their own and fixes them as well as ever  with his forefinger and thumb he thrusts several gentlemens and ladys eyes out of their heads without the least pain at which time they see an unspeakable number of beautiful colors and after they are entertained to the full he places them again in their proper sockets without any damage to the sight  he lets any gentleman drink a quart of hot melted lead and by a draught of prepared liquor of which he takes part himself he makes the said lead pass through the said gentleman before all the spectators without any damage after which it is produced in a cake to the company  with many other wonderful performances of art too tedious here to mention  the said artist has performed before most kings and princes in europe with great applause  he performs every day except sundays from ten of the clock to one in the forenoon and from four till seven in the evening at the new inn in smithfield  the first seat a british crown the second a british halfcrown and the lowest a british shilling  n b the best hands in town are to play at the said show  to the right honorable the mayor and aldermen of the city of london the humble petition of the colliers cooks cookmaids blacksmiths jackmakers brasiers and others shows that whereas certain virtuosi disaffected to the government and to the trade and prosperity of this kingdom taking upon them the name and title of the catoptrical victuallers have presumed by gathering breaking folding and bundlingup the sunbeams by the help of certain glasses to make produce and kindle up several new focuss or fires within these his majestys dominions and thereby to boil bake stew fry and dress all sorts of victuals and provisions to brew distill spirits smelt oar and in general to perform all the offices of culinary fires and are endeavoring to procure to themselves the monopoly of this their said invention we beg leave humbly to represent to your honors  that such grant or patent will utterly ruin and reduce to beggary your petitioners their wives children servants and trades on them depending there being nothing left to them after the said invention but warming of cellars and dressing of suppers in the wintertime that the abolishing so considerable a branch of the coasting trade as that of the colliers will destroy the navigation of this kingdom that whereas the said catoptrical victuallers talk of making use of the moon by night as of the sun by day they will utterly ruin the numerous body of tallowchandlers and impair a very considerable branch of the revenue which arises from the tax upon tallow and candles  that the said catoptrical victuallers do profane the emanations of that glorious luminary the sun which is appointed to rule the day and not to roast mutton and we humbly conceive it will be found contrary to the known laws of this kingdom to confine forestall and monopolize the beams of the sun and whereas the said catoptrical victuallers have undertaken by burningglasses made of ice to roast an ox upon the thames next winter we conceive all such practices to be an encroachment upon the rights and privileges of the company of watermen  that the diversity of exposition of the several kitchens in this great city whereby some receive the rays of the sun sooner and others later will occasion great irregularity as to the time of dining of the several inhabitants and consequently great uncertainty and confusion in the dispatch of business and to those who by reason of their northern exposition will be still forced to be at the expenses of culinary fires it will reduce the price of their manufacture to such inequality as is inconsistent with common justice and the same inconveniency will affect landlords in the value of their rents  that the use of the said glasses will oblige cooks and cookmaids to study optics and astronomy in order to know the due distances of the said focuss or fires and to adjust the position of their glasses to the several altitudes of the sun varying according to the hours of the day and the seasons of the year which studies at these years will be highly troublesome to the said cooks and cookmaids not to say any thing of the utter incapacity of some of them to go through with such difficult arts or which is still a greater inconvenience it will throw the whole art of cookery into the hands of astronomers and glassgrinders persons utterly unskilled in other parts of that profession to the great detriment of the health of his majestys good subjects  that it is known by experience that meat roasted with sunbeams is extremely unwholesome witness several that have died suddenly after eating the provisions of the said catoptrical victuallers forasmuch as the sunbeams taken inwardly render the humors too hot and adust occasion great sweatings and dry up the rectual moisture  that sunbeams taken inwardly shed a malignant influence upon the brain by their natural tendency toward the moon and produce madness and distraction at the time of the full moon that the constant use of so great quantities of this inward light will occasion the growth of quakerism to the danger of the church and poetry to the danger of the state  that the influences of the constellations through which the sun passes will with his beams be conveyed into the blood and when the sun is amongst the horned signs may produce such a spirit of unchastity as is dangerous to the honor of your worships families  that mankind living much upon the seeds and other parts of plants these being impregnated with the sunbeams may vegetate and grow in the bowels a thing of more dangerous consequence to human bodies than breeding of worms and this will fall heaviest upon the poor who live upon roots and the weak and sickly who live upon barley and ricegruel etc for which we are ready to produce to your honors the opinions of eminent physicians that the taste and property of the victuals is much altered to the worse by the said solar cookery the fricasses being deprived of the haut gout they acquire by being dressed over charcoal  lastly should it happen by an eclipse of an extraordinary length that this city should be deprived of the sunbeams for several months how will his majestys subjects subsist in the interim when common cookery with the arts depending upon it is totally lost  in consideration of these and many other inconveniences your petitioners humbly pray that your honors would either totally prohibit the confining and manufacturing the sunbeams for any of the useful purposes of life or in the ensuing parliament procure a tax to be laid upon them which may answer both the duty and price of coals and which we humbly conceive cannot be less than thirty shillings per yard square reserving the sole right and privilege of the catoptrical cookery to the royal society and to the commanders and crew of the bombvessels under the direction of mr whiston for finding out the longitude who by reason of the remoteness of their nations may be reduced to streights for want of firing  and we likewise beg that your honors as to the forementioned points would hear the reverend mr flamstead who is the legal officer appointed by the government to look after the heavenly luminaries whom we have constituted our trusty and learned solicitor  reasons humbly offered by the company exercising the trade and mystery of upholders against part of the bill for the better viewing searching and examining drugs medicines etc      being called upon by several retailers and dispensers of drugs and medicines about town to use our endeavors against the bill now depending for viewing etc in regard of our common interest and in gratitude to the said retailers and dispensers of medicines which we have always found to be very effectual we presume to lay the following reasons before the public against the said bill  that the company of upholders are far from being averse to the giving of drugs and medicines in general provided they may be of such qualities as we require and administered by such persons in whom our company justly repose the greatest confidence and provided they tend to the encouragement of trade and the consumption of the woollen manufacture of this kingdom  we beg leave to observe that there has been no complaint from any of the nobility gentry and citizens whom we have attended our practice which consists chiefly in outward applications having been always so effectual that none of our patients have been obliged to undergo a second operation excepting one gentlewoman who after her first burial having burdened her husband with a new brood of posthumous children her second funeral was by us performed without any farther charges to the said husband of the deceased and we humbly hope that one single instance of this kind a misfortune owing merely to the avarice of a sexton in cutting off a ring will not be imputed to any want of skill or care in our company  we humbly conceive that the power by this bill lodged in the censors of the college of physicians to restrain any of his majestys subjects from dispensing and welldisposed persons from taking what medicines they please is a manifest encroachment on the liberty and property of the subjects  as the company exercising the trade and mystery of upholders have an undisputed right in and upon the bodies of all and every the subjects of the kingdom we conceive the passing of this bill though not absolutely depriving them of their said right might keep them out of possession by unreasonable delays to the great detriment of our company and their numerous families  we hope it will be considered that there are multitudes of necessitous heirs and penurious parents persons in pinching circumstances with numerous families of children wives that have lived long many robust aged women with great jointures elder brothers with bad understandings single heirs of great estates whereby the collateral line are for ever excluded reversionary patents and reversionary promises of preferments leases upon single lives and playdebts upon joint lives and that the persons so aggrieved have no hope of being speedily relieved any other way than by the dispensing of drugs and medicines in the manner they now are burying alive being judged repugnant to the known laws of this kingdom  that there are many of the deceased who by certain mechanical motions and powers are carried about town who would have been put into our hands long before this time by any other wellordered government by want of a due police in this particular our company have been great sufferers  that frequent funerals contribute to preserve the genealogies of families and the honors conferred by the crown which are no where so well illustrated as on this solemn occasion to maintain necessitous clergy to enable the clerks to appear in decent habits to officiate on sundays to feed the great retinue of sober and melancholy men who appear at the said funerals and who must starve without constant and regular employment moreover we desire it may be remembered that by the passing of this bill the nobility and gentry will have their old coaches lie upon their hands which are now employed by our company  and we further hope that frequent funerals will not be discouraged as is by this bill proposed it being the only method left of carrying some people to church  we are afraid that by the hardships of this bill our company will be reduced to leave their business here and practice at york and bristol where the free use of bad medicines will be still allowed  it is therefore hoped that no specious pretense whatsoever will be thought sufficient to introduce an arbitrary and unlimited power for peope to live in defiance of art as long as they can by the course of nature to the prejudice of our company and the decay of trade  that as our company are like to suffer in some measure by the power given to physicians to dissect the bodies of malefactors we humbly hope that the manufacture of cases for skeletons will be reserved solely to the coffinmakers  we likewise humbly presume that the interests of the several trades and prosessions which depend upon ours may be regarded such as that of hearses coaches coffins epitaphs and bellropes stonecutters feathermen and bellringers and especially the manusacturers of crapes and the makers of snuff who use great quantities of old coffins and who considered in the consumption of their drugs employ by far the greatest number of hands of any manufacture of the kingdom  annus mirabilis or the wonderful effects of the approaching conjunction of the planets jupiter mars and saturn by mart scriblerus philomath a wellwisher to the mathematics in nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora   i suppose every body is sufficiently apprizd of and duly prepared for the famous conjunction to be celebrated the   th of this instant december      foretold by all the sages of antiquity under the name of the annus mirabilis or the metamorphostical conjunction a word which denotes the mutual transformation of sexes the effect of that configuration of the celestial bodies the human males being to be turned into females and the human females into males  the egyptians have represented this great transformation by several significant hieroglyphics particularly one very remarkable there are carved upon an obelisk a barber and a midwife the barber delivers his razor to the midwife and she her swaddling clothes to the barber accordingly thales milesius who like the rest of his countrymen borrowed his learning from the egyptians after having computed the time of this famous conjunction then says he shall men and women mutually exchange the pangs of shaving and childbearing  anaximander modestly describes this metamorphosis in mathematical terms then says he shall the negative quantity of the women be turned into positive their  into i e their minus into plus  plato not only speaks of this great change but describes all the preparations toward it long before the bodily transformation says he nature shall begin the most difficult part of her work by changing the ideas and inclinations of the two sexes men shall turn effeminate and women manly wives shall domineer and husbands obey ladies shall ride a horseback dressed like cavaliers princes and nobles appear in nightrails and petticoats men shall squeak upon theaters with female voices and women corrupt virgins men shall knot and cut paper and even the northern people  a phrase which for modestys sake i forbear to translate which denotes a vice too frequent amongst us so far plato  that the ministry foresaw this great change is plain from the callicoact whereby it is now become the occupation of the women all over england to convert their useless female habits into beds windowcurtains chairs and jointstools undressing themselves as it were before their transformation  the philosophy of this transformation will not seem surprising to people who search into the bottom of things madam bourignon a devout french lady has shown us how man was at first created male and female in one individual having the faculty of propagation within himself a circumstance necessary to the state of innocence wherein a mans happiness was not to depend upon the caprice of another it was not till after he had made a saux pas that he had his female mate many such transformations of individuals have been well attested particularly one by montaigne and another by the late bishop of salisbury from all which it appears that this system of male and female has already undergone and may hereafter suffer several alterations every smatterer in anatomy knows that a woman is but an introverted man a new fusion and flatus will turn the hollow bottom of a bottle into a convexity but i forbear for the sake of my modest men readers who are in a few days to be virgins  in some subjects the smallest alterations will do some men are sufficiently spread about the hips and contrived with that female softness that they want only the negative quantity to make them buxom wenches and there are women who are as it were already the ebauche of a good sturdy man if nature could be puzzled it will be how to bestow the redundant matter of the exuberant bubbies that now appear about town or how to roll out the short dapper fellows into wellsizd women  this great conjunction will begin to operate on saturday the   th instant accordingly about eight at night as senezino shall begin at the opera si videte did you but see he shall be observed to make an unusual motion upon which the audience will be affected with a red suffusion over their countenance and because a strong succession of the muscles of the belly is necessary toward performing this great operation both sexes will be thrown into a profuse involuntary laughter then to use the modest terms of anaximander shall negative quantity be turned into positive etc time never beheld nor will it ever assemble such a number of untouched virgins within those walls but alas such will be the impatience and curiosity of people to act in their new capacity that many of them will go to pot that very night to prevent the disorders that may happen upon this occasion is the chief design of this paper  gentlemen have begun already to make use of this conjunction to compass their filthy purposes they tell the ladies forsooth that it is only parting with a perishable commodity hardly of so much value as a callico underpetticoat since like its mistress it will be useless in the form it is now in if the ladies have no regard to the dishonor and immorality of the action i desire they will consider that nature who never destroys her own productions will exempt bigbellyd women till the time of their lyingin so that not to be transformed will be the same as to be pregnant if they dont think it worth while to defend a fortress that is to be demolished in a few days let them reflect that it will be a melancholy thing nine months hence to be brought to bed of a bastard a posthumous bastard as it were to which the quondam father can be no more than a dry nurse  this wonderful transformation is the instrument of nature to balance matters between the sexes the cruelty of scornful mistresses shall be returned the slighted maid shall grow into an imperious gallant and reward her undoer with a big belly and a bastard etc  it is hardly possible to imagine the revolutions that this wonderful phenomenon will occasion over the face of the earth i long impatiently to see the proceedings of the parliament of paris as to the title of succession to their crown this being a case not provided for by the salique law there will be no preventing disorders amongst friars and monks for certainly vows of chastity dont bind but under the sex in which they were made the same will hold good with marriages though i think it will be a scandal amongst protestants for husbands and wives to part since there remains still a possibility to perform the debitum conjugale by the husbands being femme couverte i submit it to the judgment of the gentlemen of the long robe whether this transformation does not discharge all suits of rapes  the pope must undergo a new groping but the false prophet mahomet has contrived matters well for his successors for as the grand signior has now a great many fine women he will then have as many fine young gentlemen at his devotion  these are surprising scenes but i beg leave to affirm that the solemn operations of nature are subjects of contemplation not of ridicule therefore i make it my earnest request to the merry fellows and giggling girls about town that they would not put themselves in a high twitter when they go to visit a general lying in of his first child his officers serving as midwifes nurses and rockers dispensing caudle or if they behold the reverend prelates dressing the heads and airing the linen at court i beg they will remember that these offices must be filled with people of the greatest regularity and best characters for the same reason i am sorry that a certain prelate who notwithstanding his confinement still preserves his healthy cheerful countenance cannot come in time to be a nurse at court  i likewise earnestly entreat the maids of honor then ensigns and captains of the guards that at their first setting out they have some regard to their former station and do not run wild through all the infamous houses about town that the present grooms of the bedchamber then maids of honor would not eat chalk and lime in their green sickness and in general that the men would remember that they are become retremingent and not by inadvertency lift up against walls and post  petticoats will not be burdensome to the clergy but balls and assemblies will be indecent for some time  as for you coquettes bawds and chambermaids the future ministers plenipotentaries and cabinetcounsellors to the princes of the earth manage the great intrigues that will be committed to your charge with your usual secrecy and conduct and the affairs of your master will go better than ever  o ye exchange women our right worshipful representatives that are to be be not so griping in the sale of your ware as your predecessors but consider that the nation like a spendthrift heir has run out be likewise a little more continent in your tongues than you are at present else the length of debates will spoil your dinners  you housewifely good women who now preside over the confectionary henceforth commissioners of the treasury be so  as to dispense the sugarplumbs of the government with a more impartial and frugal hand  ye prudes and censorious old maids the hopes of the bench exert but your usual talent of finding faults and the laws will be strictly executed only i would not have you proceed upon such slender evidences as you have done hitherto  it is from you eloquent oystermerchants of billingsgate just ready to be called to the bar and quoifd like your sisterserjeants that we expect the shortening the time and lessening the expenses of lawsuits for i think you are obliged to bring your debates to a short issue and even custom will restrain you from taking the oyster and leaving only the shell to your clients  o ye physicians who in the figure of old women are to clean the tripe in the markets scour it as effectually as you have done that of your patients and the town will fare most deliciously on saturdays  i cannot but congratulate human nature upon this happy transformation the only expedient left to restore the liberties and tranquillity of mankind which is so evident that it is almost an affront to common sense to insist upon the proof of it if there can be any such stupid creature who doubts it i desire he will make but the following obvious reflection there are in europe alone at present about a million of sturdy fellows under the denomination of standing forces with arms in their hands that those are masters of the lives liberties and fortunes of all the rest i believe no body will deny it is no less true in fact that reams of paper and above a square mile of skins of vellum have been employed to no purpose to settle peace amongst those sons of violence pray who is he that will say unto them go and disband your selves but lo by this transformation it is done at once and the halcyon days of public tranquillity return for neither the military temper nor dicipline can taint the soft sex for a whole age to come bellaque matribus invisa wars odious now to mothers will not grow immediately palatable in their paternal state  nor will the influence of this transformation be less in familytranquility than it is in national great faults will be amended and frailties forgiven on both sides a wife who has been disturbed with late hours and choked with the haugout of a sot will remember her sufferings and avoid the temptation and will for the same reason indulge her mate in his female capacity in some passions which she is sensible from experience are natural to the sex such as vanity of fine cloths being admired etc and now tenderly must she use her mate under the breeding qualms and labourpains which she has felt her self in short all unreasonable demands upon husbands must cease because they are already satisfied from natural experience that they are impossible that the ladies may govern the affairs of the world and the gentlemen those of their household better than either of them have hitherto done is the hearty desire of  their most sincere wellwisher m s  advertisements planetary powders as necessary for the new births of sexes as sperma ceti for puerperous women prepared and sold by john moore apothecary at the pestle and mortar in abchurch lane all male and female implements exchanged at reasonable rates at mr deards toyshop against st dunstans church all sorts of manly exercise riding vaulting etc taught to the ladies at a guinea a lesson at mrs lges in redlionstreet an essay of the learned martinus scriblerus concerning the origin of sciences written to the most learned dr  f r s from the deserts of nubiad among all the enquiries which have been pursued by the curious and inquisitive there is none more worthy the search of a learned head than the source from whence we derive those arts and sciences which raise us so far above the vulgar the countries in which they rose and the channels by which they have been conveyed as they who first brought them amongst us traveled into the remotest parts of the earth to attain them i may boast of some advantages by the same means since i write this from the deserts of ethiopia from those plains of sand which have buried the pride of invading armies with my foot perhaps at this instant ten fathom over the grave of cambyses a solitude to which neither pythagoras nor apollonius ever penetrated  it is universally agreed that arts and sciences took their rise among the egyptians and indians but from whom they first received them is yet a secret the highest period of time to which the learned attempt to trace them is from the beginning of the assyrian monarchy when their inventors were worshipped as gods it is therefore necessary to go backward into times even more remote and to gain some knowledge of their history from whatever dark and broken hints may any way be found in ancient authors concerning them  nor troy nor thebes were the first of empires we have mention though not histories of an earlier warlike people called the pygmaeans i cannot but persuade my self from those accounts of il   hom homer aristotle and others that their history wars and revolutions were then a part of the study of the learned from the very air in which those authors speak of them as of things universally known and though all we directly hear is of their military achievements in the brave defense of their country from the annual invasions of a powerful enemy yet i cannot doubt but that they excelled as much in the arts of peaceful government though there remain no traces of their civil institutions empires as great have been swallowed up in the wreck of time and such certain periods have been put to them as occasion a total ignorance of their story and if i should conjecture that the like happened to this nation from a general extirpation of the people by those flocks of monstrous birds wherewith antiquity agrees they were continually infested it ought not to seem more incredible than that one of the baleares was wasted by rabbits eustathius in hom ii   smynthe by mice and of late speed in bermudas bermudas almost depopulated by rats nothing is more natural to imagine than that the few survivers of that empire retired into the depths of their deserts where they lived undisturbed till they were found out by osyris in his travels to instruct mankind  he met says l   chapter    diod diodorus in aethiopia a sort of little satyrs who were hairy one half of their body and whose leader pan accompanied him in his expedition for the civilizing of mankind now of this great personage pan we have a very particular description in the ancient writers who unanimously agree to represent him shaggy bearded hairy all over half a man and half a beast and walking erect with a staff the posture in which his race are to this day shown among us and since the chief thing to which he applied himself was the civilizing of mankind it should seem that the first principles of science must be received from this people to whom the gods were by il   st homer said to resort twelve days every year for the conversation of its wise and just inhabitants  if from egypt we proceed to take a view of india we shall find that their knowledge also derived itself from the same source to that country did these noble creatures accompany bacchus in his expedition under the conduct of silenus who is also described to us with the very same marks and qualifications mankind is ignorant says l   chapter    diod diodorus whence silenus derived his birth through his great antiquity but he had a tail on his loins as likewise had all his progeny in sign of their descent here then they settled a colony which to this day subsists with the same tails from this time they seem to have communicated themselves only to those men who retired from the converse of their own species to a more uninterrupted life of contemplation i am much inclined to believe that in the midst of those solitudes they instituted the so much celebrated order of gymnosophists for whoever observes the scene and manner of their life will easily find them to have imitated with all exactness imaginable the manners and customs of their masters and instructors they are said to dwell in the thickest woods to go naked to suffer their bodies to be overrun with hair and their nails to grow to a prodigious length plutarch in his first orat on alexanders fortune plutarch says they eat what they could get in the fields their drink was water and their bed made of leaves or moss and herod l   herodotus tells us that they esteemed it a great exploit to kill very many ants or creeping things  hence we see that the two nations which contend for the origin of learning are the same that have ever most abounded with this ingenious race though they have contested which was first blessed with the rise of science yet have they conspired in being grateful to their common masters egypt is well known to have worshipped them of old in their own images and india may be credibly supposed to have done the same from that adoration which they paid in latter times to the tooth of one of these hairy philosophers as it should seem in just gratitude to the mouth from which they received their knowledge  pass we now over into greece where we find orpheus returning out of egypt with the same intent as osyris and bacchus made their expeditions from this period it was that greece first heard the name of satyrs or owned them for semidei and hence it is surely reasonable to conclude that he brought some of this wonderful species along with him who also had a leader of the line of pan of the same name and expressly called king by  theo id   st theocritus if thus much be allowed we easily account for two of the strangest reports in all antiquity one that the tradition of beasts following the music of orpheus which has been interpreted of his taming savage tempers will thus have a literal application the other which we most insist upon is that the love which these sages bear to the females of our kind affords a solution of all those fables of the gods compressing women in woods under bestial appearances i am sensible it may be objected that they are said to have been compressed in the shape of different animals but to this we answer that women under such apprehensions hardly know what shape they have to deal with  from what has been last said it is highly credible that to this ancient and generous race the world is indebted if not for the heroes at least for the acutest wits of antiquity one of the most remarkable instances is that great mimick genius vit aesop initio aesop for whose extraction from these sylvestres homines we may gather an argument from planudes who says that aesop signifies the same thing as aethiop the original nation of our people for a second argument we may offer the description of his person which was short deformed and almost savage insomuch that he might have lived in the woods had not the benevolence of his temper made him rather adapt himself to our manners and come to court in wearing apparel the third proof is his acute and satirical wit and lastly his great knowledge in the nature of beasts together with the natural pleasure he took to speak of them upon all occasions  the next instance i shall produce is vid plato and xenophon socrates first it was a tradition that he was of an uncommon birth from the rest of men secondly he had a countenance confessing the line he sprung from being bald flatnosd with prominent eyes and a downward look thirdly he turned certain fables of aesop into verse probably out of his respect to beasts in general and love to his family in particular  in process of time the women with whom these sylvans would have lovingly cohabited were either taught by mankind or induced by an abhorrence of their shapes to shun their embraces so that our sages were necessitated to mix with beasts this by degrees occasioned the hair of their posterity to grow higher than their middles it arose in one generation to their arms in the second it invaded their necks in the third it gained the ascendant of their heads till the degenerate appearance in which the species is now immersed became completed though we must here observe that there were a few who fell not under the common calamity there being some unprejudiced women in every age by virtue of whom a total extinction of the original race was prevented and it is remarkable also that even where they were mixed the defection from their nature was not entire there still appeared mavelous qualities among them as was manisest in those who followed alexander in india how did they attend his army and survey his order how did they cast themselves into the same forms for march or for combat w an imitation was there of all his discipline the ancient true remains of a warlike disposition and of that constitution which they enjoyed while they were a monarchy  to proceed to italy at the first appearance of these wild philosophers there were some of the least mixed who vouchsafed to converse with mankind which is evident from the name of livy fauns a fando or speaking such was he who coming out of the woods in hatred to tyranny encouraged the roman army to proceed against the hetruscans who would have restored tarquin but here as in all the western parts of the world there was a great and memorable era in which they began to be silent this we may place something near the time of aristotle when the number vanity and folly of human philosophers increased by which mens heads became too much puzzled to receive the wisdom of these ancient sylvans the questions of that academy were too numerous to be consistent with their ease to answer and too intricate extravagant idle or pernicious to be any other than a derision and scorn unto them from this period if ever we hear of their giving answers it is only when caught bound and constrained in like manner as was that ancient grecian prophet proteus  accordingly we read in plutarch in vit sylla syllas time of such a philosopher taken near dyrrachium who would not be persuaded to give them a lecture by all they could say to him and only showed his power in sounds by neighing like a horse  but a more successful attempt was made in augustuss reign by the inquisitive genius of the great virgil whom together with varus the commentators suppose to have been the true persons who are related in the  th bucolick to have caught a philosopher and doubtless a genuine one of the race of the old silenus to prevail upon him to be communicative of the importance of which virgil was well aware they not only tied him fast but allured him likewise by making him a present of a comely maiden called aegle which made him sing both merrily and instructively in this song we have their doctrine of the creation the same in all probability as was taught so many ages before in the great pygmaean empire and several hieroglyphical fables under which they couched or embellished their morals for which reason i look upon this bucolick as an inestimable treasure of the most ancient science  in the reign of constantine we hear of another taken in a net and brought to alexandria round whom the people flocked to hear his wisdom but as ammianus marcellinus reports he proved a dumb philosopher and only instructed by action  the last we shall speak of who seems to be of the true race is said by st jerome to have met st vit st ant anthony in a desert who enquiring the way of him he showed his understanding and courtesy by pointing but would not answer for he was a dumb philosopher also  these are all the notices which i am at present able to gather of the appearance of so great and learned a people in your side of the world but if we return to their ancient native seats africa and india we shall there find even in modern times the traces of their original conduct and valor  in africa as we read among the indefatigable mr purchass collections a body of them whose leader was inflamed with love for a woman by martial powers and stratagem won a fort from the portuguese  but i must leave all others at present to celebrate the praise of two of their unparalled monarchs in india the one was perimal the magnificent a prince most learned and communicative to whom in malabar their excess of zeal dedicated a temple raised on seven hundred pillars not inferior in maff l   maffaeuss opinion to those of agrippa in the pantheon the other hanimant the mavelous his relation and successor whose knowledge was so great as made his followers doubt if even that wise species could arrive at such perfection and therefore they rather imagined him and his race a sort of gods formed into apes his was the tooth which the portuguese took in bisnagar      for which the indians offered according to linschot chapter    linschotten the immense sum of seven hundred thousand ducats nor let me quit this head without mentioning with all due respect oran outang the great the last of this line whose unhappy chance it was to fall into the hands of europeans oran outang whose value was not known to us for he was a mute philosopher oran outang by whose dissection the learned dr tyson has added a confirmation to this system from the resemblance between the homo sylvestris and our humane body in those organs by which the rational soul is exerted  we must now descend to consider this people as sunk into the bruta natura by their continual commerce with beasts yet even at this time what experiments do they not afford us of relieving some from the spleen and others from imposthumes by occasioning laughter at proper seasons with what readiness do they enter into the imitation of whatever is remarkable in human life and what surprising relations have le comte and others given of their appetites actions conceptions affections varieties of imaginations and abilities capable of pursuing them if under their present low circumstances of birth and breeding and in so short a term of life as is now allotted them they so far exceed all beasts and equal many men what prodigies may we not conceive of those who were nati melioribus annis those primitive longaeval and antideluvian mantegers who first taught sciences to the world  this account which is entirely my own i am proud to imagine has traced knowledge from a fountain correspondent to several opinions of the ancients though hitherto undiscovered both by them and the moderns and now what shall i say to mankind in the thought of this great discovery what but that they should abate of their pride and consider that the authors of our knowledge are among beasts that these who were our elder brothers by a day in the creation whose kingdom was like the scheme of plato governed by philosophers who flourished with learning in aethiopia and india are now undistinguished from and known only by the same appellation as the manteger and the monkey  as to speech i make no question that there are remains of the first and less corrupted race in their native deserts who yet have the power of it but the vulgar reason given by the spaniards that they will not speak for fear of being set to work is alone a sufficient one considering how exceedingly all other learned persons affect their ease a second is that these observant creatures having been eyewitnesses of the cruelty with which that nation treated their brother indians find it necessary not to show themselves to be men that they may be protected not only from work but from cruelty also thirdly they could at best take no delight to converse with the spaniards whose grave and sullen temper is so averse to that natural and open cheerfulness which is generally observed to accompany all true knowledge  but now were it possible that any way could be found out to draw forth their latent qualities i cannot but think it would be highly serviceable to the learned world both in respect of recovering past knowledge and promoting the future might there not be found certain gentle artful methods whereby to endear us to them is there no nation in the world whose natural turn is adapted to engage their society and win them by a sweet similitude of manners is there no nation where the men might allure them by a distingushing civility and in a manner fascinate them by assimilated motions no nation where the women with easy freedoms and the gentlest treatment might oblige the loving creatures to sensible returns of humanity the love i bear my native country prompts me to wish this nation might be great britain but alas in our present wretched divided condition how can we hope that foreigners of so great prudence will freely declare their sentiments in the midst of violent parties and at so vast a distance from their friends relations and country the affection i bear our neighbourstate would incline me to wish it were holland  sed laeva in part mamillae nil salit arcadico it is from france then we must expect this restoration of learning whose late monarch took the sciences under his protection and raised them to so great a height may we not hope their emissaries will some time or other have instructions not only to invite learned men into their country but learned beasts the true ancient mantegers i mean of aethopia and india might not the talents of each kind of these be adapted to the improvement of the several sciences the mantegers to instruct heroes statesmen and scholars baboons to teach the courtiers ceremony and address monkeys the art of pleasing in conversation and agreeable affectations to ladies and their lovers the apes of less learning comedians and dancing masters the marmosets court pages and young english travelers but the distinguishing each kind and allotting them to their proper business i leave to the inquisitive and penetrating genius of the jesuits in their

house of mr ratcliff in bishopsgatestreet as also of the faustina the celebrated italian singing woman and of the copperfarthing dean from ireland and lastly of the wonderful wild man that was nursed in the woods of germany by a wild beast hunted and taken in toyls how he behaveth himself like a dumb creature and is a christian like one of us being called peter and how he was brought to court all in green to the great astonishment of the quality and gentry      we shall begin with a description of peter the savage deferring our other curiosities to some following papers  romulus and remus the two famous wild men of antiquity and orsin that of the moderns have been justly the admiration of all mankind nor can we presage less of this wild youth as may be gathered from that famous and well known prophecy of lillys which being now accomplished is most easily interpreted when rome shall wend to benevento and espagne breaking the assiento when eagle split shall fly to china and christian folks adore faustina then shall an oak be brought to bed of creature neither taught nor fed great feats shall he atchieve    the pope is now going to benevento the spaniards having broke their treaty the emperor trades to china and lilly were he alive must be convinced that it was not the empress faustina that was meant in the prophecy  it is evident by several tokens about this wild gentleman that he had a father and mother like one of us but there being no register of his christening his age is only to be guessed at by his stature and countenance and appears to be about twelve or thirteen his being so young was the occasion of the great disappointment of the ladies who came to the drawing room in full expectation of some attempt upon their chastity so far is true that he endeavored to kiss the young lady wle who for that reason is become the envy of the circle this being a declaration of nature in favor of her superior beauty  aristotle says that man is the most mimick of all animals which opinion of that great philosopher is strongly confirmed by the behavior of this wild gentleman who is endowed with that quality to an extreme degree he received his first impressions at court his manners are first to lick peoples hands and then turn his breech upon them to thurst his hand into every bodys pocket to climb over peoples heads and even to make use of the royal hand to take what he has a mind to at his first appearance he seized on the lord chamberlains staff and put on his hat before the king from whence some have conjectured that he is either descended from a grandee of spain or the earls of kingsale in ireland however these are manifest tokens of his innate ambition he is extremely tenacious of his own property and ready to invade that of other people by this mimick quality he discovered what wild beast had nursed him observing children to ask blessing of their mothers one day he fell down upon his knees to a sow and muttered some sounds in that humble posture  it has been commonly thought that he is ulricks natural brother because of some resemblance of manners and the officious care of ulrick about him but the superiority of the parts and genius in peter demonstrates this to be impossible  though he is ignorant both of ancient and modern languages that care being left to the ingenious physician who is entrusted with his education yet he distinguishes objects by certain sounds framed to himself which mr rotenberg who brought him over understands perfectly beholding one day the shambles with great fear and astonishment ever since he calls man by the same sound which expresses wolf a young lady is a peacock old women magpyes and owls a beau with a toupee a monkey glass ice blue red and green ribbons he calls rainbows an heap of gold a turd the first ship he saw he took to be a great beast swimming on her back and her feet tied above her the men that came out of the hold he took to be her cubs and wondered they were so unlike their dam he understands perfectly the language of all beasts and birds and is not like them confined to that of one species he can bring any beast what he calls for and no doubt is much missed now in his native woods where he used to do good offices among his fellow citizens and served as a mediator to reconcile their differences one day he warned a flock of sheep that were driving to the shambles of their danger and upon uttering some sounds they all fled he takes vast pleasure in conversation with horses and going to the meuse to converse with two of his intimate acquaintances in the kings stable as he passed by he neighed to the horse at charing cross being as it were surpised to see him so high he seemed to take it ill that the horse did not answer him but i think no body can undervalue his understanding for not being skilled in statuary  he expresses his joy most commonly by neighing and whatever the philosophers may talk of their risibility neighing is a more noble expression of that passion than laughing which seems to me to have something silly in it and besides is often attended with tears other animals are sensible they debase themselves by mimicking laughter and i take it to be a general observation that the top felicity of mankind is to imitate monkeys and birds witness hartequins scaramouches and masquerades on the other hand monkeys when they would look extremely silly endeavor to bring themselves down to mankind love he expresses by the cooing of a dove and anger by the croaking of a raven and it is not doubted but that he will serve in time as an interpreter between us and other animals  great instruction is to be had from this wild youth in the knowledge of simples and i am of opinion that he ought always to attend the censors of the college in their visitation of apothecaries shops  i am told that the new sect of herbeaters intend to follow him into the fields or to beg him for a clerk of their kitchen and that there are many of them now thinking of turning their children into woods to graze with the cattle in hopes to raise a healthy and moral race refined from the corruptions of this luxurious world  he sings naturally several pretty tunes of his own composing and with equal facility in the chromatick inharmonick and diatonick style and consequently must be of infinite use to the academy in judging of the merits of their composers and is the only person that ought to decide betwixt cuzzoni and faustina  i cannot omit his first notion of clothes which he took to be the natural skins of the creatures that wore them and seemed to be in great pain for the pulling off a stocking thinking the poor man was a fleaing  i am not ignorant that there are disaffected people who say he is a pretender and no genuine wild man this calumny proceeds from the false notions they have of wild men which they frame from such as they see about the town whose actions are rather absurd than wild therefore it will be incumbent on all young gentlemen who are ambitious to excel in this character to copy this true original of nature  the senses of this wild man are vastly more acute than those of a tame one he can follow the track of a man or any other beast of prey a dog is an ass to him for finding troufles his hearing is more perfect because his ears not having been confined by bandages he can move them like a drill and turn them toward the sonorous object  let us pray the creator of all beings wild and tame that as this wild youth by being brought to court has been made a christian so such as are at court and are no christians may lay aside their savage and rapacious nature and return to the meekness of the gospel  an infalible scheme to pay the public debt of ireland in six months the great distress of this unhappy country is too visible to all except those who have power to redress it  we may observe through the whole nation one universal complaint of the decay of trade the oppression of landlords and the deficiency of money and yet i cannot find among all the schemes proposed to lessen these evils any one in particular which seems likely to succeed  but what is still an addition to this melancholy prospect of affairs is the unbounded luxury and extravagance both in apparel and entertaiments which persons of all ranks and degrees run into at present though in general we labor under such hardships and poverty  we are affected in a quite different manner from all the nations upon earth for with others wealth is the mother of luxury but with us poverty has the very same effect with others scarcity is the parent of industry but with us it is the nurse of idleness and vice  we labor to imitate our neighboring kingdoms in nothing but their extravagance without having the same plentiful aids of commerce or applying ourselves to the study of fairdealing to maintain it so that in short by our own ill management we are brought to so low an ebb of wealth and credit that our condition seems incapable of any relief  but as i have the interest of this misguided people very much at heart i do not intend this essay as a detection of their present grievances but as a remedy against them and for that purpose i have labored to find out such a scheme as will discharge our public debt with all possible ease and pleasure to the subject and in so short a time that we may neither complain of being oppressed with long continued taxes as some unreasonable people often presume to do nor quite despair of being once more in a thriving condition  let us consider what those vices are which at present prevail most among us and i believe upon enquiry they will be found perjury fornication drunkenness swearing slander infidelity fraud blasphemy and many others would it not then be worthy of our consideration whether a moderate tax upon every particular vice instead of laying an additional duty upon wine hops and other commodities would not supply us with a sufficient sum in a very short time such a tax must of necessity yield a vast revenue and prove the most infallible and indeed the only scheme for our prosperity if it shall be thought proper to be continued  but before i proceed to particulars it may not be amiss to premise that this tax is not designed for any one county or province in this kingdom but to extend itself universally over the whole nation because different vices may flourish in different counties as different plants in their different soils as perjury in one theft in another dissimulation and flattery in another rapine in another and so of the rest however i take theft to be our peculiar staple vice  and least any disputes may hereafter arise about the nature of perjury the intention of the act in this particular or what persons are to be subject to this tax i must here also premise that every lie confirmed by an oath is undoubtedly perjury whether before a magistrate or behind a counter and therefore we do not doubt but the trading part of our people will be great benefactors to the public in this particular article as well as many others  these two things being premised let us suppose that in this large country  000 persons are guilty of this infirmity each daywhich computation must be allowed very moderate if we recollect that this number is not above a fourhundredth part of the inhabitants of this kingdom who are generally computed to amount to two millions and if we further consider what strong inducements our natives have to practice it from its being often so exceeding beneficial if we consider the great use made of it in all sorts of traffic the great demands for it in lawsuits the great advantage of it in elections and the undeniable profit of it in all prosecutions we shall think the number of  000 still more reasonable  let us then suppose every one of this number to be perjured only once every day which is a very favorable supposition and subject only to a tax of sixpence for each offense for which sum perhaps he may procure either the death of an enemy an estate for his friend or a fortune for himself all which are esteemed very desirable the tax will be too inconsiderable to make any one murmur and yet will yield the sum of     l per day toward discharging our national debt  besides this tax though very low may in reality be very profitable for mankind for attorneys sollicitors usurers butchers and other honest traders will scarce think it answerable to the expense of time to forswear themselves for any profit from one penny to six pence inclusive as now customary but will at least for every transgression expect to gain sufficient to defray the tax  however i would have all sworn constables and all collectors of this and many other taxes entirely exempted from any penalty as priviledgd persons because by that means they will be enabled to be very serviceable in their several stations  fornication as the world is at present would furnish the public with a large sum even at a very moderate tax for it is now made an essential part of the polite gentlemans character and he that has prevailed on the greatest number proportionably rises in reputation  let us then compute that in the several parts of this nation  000 per day were liable to be taxed for this general vice only at two shillings the sum arising from this to the public good will amount to  00 l per day and in six months to almost one third of our national debt  i know it may be here objected that i have computed upon too small a number and that i might justly account rather upon twenty or thirty thousand per day in the several counties of this kingdom but though i own this objection to be very strong if we were to consider the opportunities of wakes patrondays haymaking seasons maydays religious pilgrimages to holy wells balls public and private and many other commodious scenes for that kind of entertainment yet i would rather choose to err on the right side in too small than too great a computation  i know the popish clergy will make strong remonstrances against this tax and plead that it is designed to oppress them that all nations of the earth allow them a toleration in this particular point as they are frail mortals and sworn to celibacy and what is still worse that such a tax would be the most effectual means to drain them of their whole revenues but as i would not have such pious persons justly complain of the least rigor i shall readily agree to their being exempted  drunkenness i would only tax at six pence because it might be prejudicial to his majestys revenue to discourage it and consequently subject the proposer to penalties  let us then compute that only twenty thousand persons which is but one hundredth part of the people in this kingdom were daily liable to be taxed the amount would be  00 l per day and how extremely moderate this computation is may appear to any one who considers that besides the usual opportunities of taverns and private houses there are elections fairs mayors feasts university treats corporation dinners christmas regales weddings and christnings both in town and country and many other irresistible inducements to this manly vice which would perhaps if nicely calculated daily furnish us with two thirds more than our computed number and by that means greatly conduce to the public good  but however i would by all means exempt all country justices of the peace whether squires or parsons because it would be unseemly to see such honorable and reverend personages insulted by meaner officers as often as they might be discovered in such a condition  swearing would be a most universal benefit in this case because at present it serves to season the discourse of all ranks and degrees of men it is the principal ingredient and decoration of all modern jokes gibes quarrels lovespeeches disputes threats and promises and consequently capable of affording an incredible revenue  however let us suppose  0000 persons per day liable to the tax of six pence only for each offense of this kind which considering the great number of markets coffeehouses shambles barracks and gaminghouses in this kingdom is a very inconsiderable number yet even this article will furnish us with  000 l per day which would amount to near two thirds of the public debt  our laws have amerced each offense in this way at one shilling ordering one half to the informer and the other to the poor which in my humble opinion was very ill concerted for if the legislature did really intend that this law should be punctually enforced they ought to have divided the whole mulct between the informer and the justice without any regard to the poor and then they might be assured it would be vigorously executed  i am already apprehensive that all military persons will expect an exemption from taxes on this account because they may plead precedents for many generations may allege the power of custom the decency and comeliness of it when properly mingled with other discourse or that the censorious world would perhaps suspect they knew nothing of god at all if they did not sometimes mention his name and many other reasons of equal weight but though these remonstrances are very just yet as this is the only means by which some think a standing army can conduce to the national good it will be hard to exempt them  however as the military power would infallibly be liable to this tax in all its branches by which means they might be utterly impoverished i believe it may not be improper to allow all footsoldiers and fieldofficers all young ensigns spruce cornets naval captains cabinboys and quarter masters forty or fifty oaths a day entirely free from any tax or penalty  as for slander supposing only twenty thousand per day taxed at six pence for every offense this article would daily afford the public at the lowest reasonable computation five hundred pounds  and as this is a favorite talent we might have ventured to tax it much higher but i would not seem to discourage so charitable a disposition especially where it may promote the interest of my country  as to the ladies i have been always too great an admirer of theirs to desire any restriction should be laid on their pleasure either private or public and therefore i would have them taxed only half as much as the men for every little error of this kind because slander in men is a talent unnatural and acquired and generally practiced to ingratiate themselves with the opposite sex whereas this genteel failing in females is innate and impossible to be restrained which is a case that demands our utmost compassion  i think all drawingrooms assemblies and all places of public resort for ladies ought to be exempt from any penalty because it is so material a part of the discourse and amusement of those places that to tax them for each offense would be in effect to enjoin them perpetual silence which if it were possible would be too great a misfortune both to themselves and the world to be exacted from them  infidelity and blasphemy would furnish us with a considerable sum and as they are not originally of our own growth but annually imported from neighboring kingdoms they ought to be subject to some duty which in few years would probably be a vast addition to the public revenue yet as this traffic is principally carried on by young lawyers and traveling squires any attempt to tax it would certainly meet with too vigorous an opposition but on condition it might pass into a law i would gladly exempt both lawyers of all ages subaltern and fieldofficers young heirs dancingmasters pickpockets and players  let us now only consider the several sums arising from the tax on our vices as we have before computed them and the justness and infallibility of this scheme must appear demonstrably l the public debt of this nation is about  00000 and the tax l per day for perjury     fornication  00 drunkenness  00 swearing  000 slander  00 total per day      which in     days or half a year will amount to      0 l which is considerably more than our national debt  but left by the universal poverty of our people which is much to be feared or by their growing more virtuous which never can be reasonably apprehended this daily income should fall short of what we have computed i must humbly beg leave to offer some other improvements of this scheme which will undoubtedly answer all deficiencies  and for this purpose what if a severe tax was laid on all manner of persons who presumed to marry till they were full forty years old if any should prove foolhardy enough to transgress a law so calculated for the happiness of men each offense would be of signal benefit to the public and if providentially it should prove an effectual restraint there must of necessity be fewer children in each family and of consequence the number of beggars and wretches in this kingdom must proportionably decrease and what would still be more material perhaps in one age if this beneficial act should be continued the greatest part of this country would require to be new peopled from ed a circumstance greatly to be wished because such an accident would probably cure that nation of its inveterate antipathy to the inhabitants of this at least for some generations  as for the scheme to tax batchelors which has lately been proposed to the house by one of its honorable members i must beg leave to think it highly improper because batchelors of all ranks and degrees are real benefactors to the public by not furnishing it either with beggars or oppressors of beggars one of which must infallibly be the consequence of marriage in this country  i would also earnestly request that all young clergymen who with more passion than prudence shall dare to marry before they are beneficed may be liable to a most severe tax equal to a prohibition because such offenders must inevitably multiply beggars live in contempt and die in poverty  these and many other expedients might easily be found upon any emergency to furnish considerable sums for the national debt  but as there will remain about      0 l over and above our public debt i will allow one hundred thousand pounds of it for sallaries to such persons as shall be appointed collectors and i hope this will be a reasonable provision though generally above one half of every tax is expended in paying proper officers to collect it the overplus may be deposited in the treasury for any other pious use  and if this scheme should be so fortunate as to succeed as i have no reason to doubt from the present disposition of the h of cs all those noblemen who shall be appointed commissioners will have excellent opportunities of promoting their nephews cousins footmen fosterers valets and other valuable dependants to good incomes and places of trust and credit but i would by all means have none but englishmen nominated to be tax gatherers because we may rationally suppose that they will be entirely free from prejudice in favor of the natives of this kingdom  thus would a moderate tax upon our vices apparently contribute to save this nation from utter ruin many persons who have not the least excuse for their irregularities at present except the commendable publickspirited contempt for religion might then plead in their own defense that their immoralities had preserved their country and by this means we might be furnished with a multitude of patriots who probably would never prove so in any other respect  but i must humbly beg leave to dissent from that religious gentleman the excellent author of the fable of the bees though perhaps such a particularity of opinion may injure my character with several of my laybrethren of most professions and i must publicly declare that there can be no other method half so good as mine to make private vices public benefits  a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people in ireland from being a burden to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the public it is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town or travel in the country when they see the streets the roads and cabbindoors crowded with beggars of the female sex followed by three four or six children all in rags and importuning every passenger for an alms these mothers instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who as they grow up either turn thieves for want of work or leave their dear native country to fight for the pretender in spain or sell themselves to the barbados  i think it is agreed by all parties that this prodigious number of children in the arms or on the backs or at the heels of their mothers and frequently of their fathers is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom a very great additional grievance and therefore whoever could find out a fair cheap and easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the commonwealth would deserve so well of the public as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation  but my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars it is of a much greater extent and shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them as those who demand our charity in the streets  as to my own part having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important subject and maturely weighed the several schemes for no projectors i have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation it is true a child just dropped from its dam may be supported by her milk for a solar year with little other nourishment at most not above the value of two shillings which the mother may certainly get or the value in scraps by her lawful occupation of begging and it is exactly at one year old that i propose to provide for them in such a manner as instead of being a charge upon their parents or the parish or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives they shall on the contrary contribute to the feeding and partly to the clothing of many thousands  there is likewise another great advantage in my scheme that it will prevent those voluntary abortions and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children alas too frequent among us sacrificing the poor innocent babes i doubt more to avoid the expense than the shame which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast  the number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half of these i calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple whose wives are breeders from which number i substract thirty thousand couples who are able to maintain their own children although i apprehend there cannot be so many under the present distresses of the kingdom but this being granted there will remain an hundred and seventy thousand breeders i again substract fifty thousand for those women who miscarry or whose children die by accident or disease within the year there only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born the question therefore is how this number shall be reared and provided for which as i have already said under the present situation of affairs is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed for we can neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture we neither build houses i mean in the country nor cultivate land they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old except where they are of towardly parts although i confess they learn the rudiments much earlier during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers as i have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of cavan who protested to me that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of six even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art  i am assured by our merchants that a boy or a girl before twelve years old is no saleable commodity and even when they come to this age they will not yield above three pounds or three pounds and half a crown at most on the exchange which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom the charge of nutriment and rags having been at least four times that value  i shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts which i hope will not be liable to the least objection  i have been assured by a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasie or a ragoust  i do therefore humbly offer it to public consideration that of the hundred and twenty thousand children already computed twenty thousand may be reserved for breed whereof only one fourth part to be males which is more than we allow to sheep black cattle or swine and my reason is that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage a circumstance not much regarded by our savages therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females that the remaining hundred thousand may at a year old be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month so as to render them plump and fat for a good table a child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends and when the family dines alone the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish and seasoned with a little pepper or salt will be very good boiled on the fourth day especially in winter  i have reckoned upon a medium that a child just born will weigh    pounds and in a solar year if tolerably nursed increases to    pounds  i grant this food will be somewhat dear and therefore very proper for landlords who as they have already devoured most of the parents seem to have the best title to the children  infants flesh will be in season throughout the year but more plentiful in march and a little before and after for we are told by a grave author an eminent french physician that fish being a prolifick diet there are more children born in roman catholic countries about nine months after lent than at any other season therefore reckoning a year after lent the markets will be more glutted than usual because the number of popish infants is at least three to one in this kingdom and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage by lessening the number of papists among us  i have already computed the charge of nursing a beggars child in which list i reckon all cottagers laborers and fourfifths of the farmers to be about two shillings per annum rags included and i believe no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child which as i have said will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat when he has only some particular friend or his own family to dine with him thus the squire will learn to be a good landlord and grow popular among his tenants the mother will have eight shillings neat profit and be fit for work till she produces another child  those who are more thrifty as i must confess the times require may flea the carcass the skin of which artificially dressed will make admirable gloves for ladies and summer boots for fine gentlemen  as to our city of dublin shambles may be appointed for this purpose in the most convenient parts of it and butchers we may be assured will not be wanting although i rather recommend buying the children alive and dressing them hot from the knife as we do roasting pigs  a very worthy person a true lover of his country and whose virtues i highly esteem was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter to offer a refinement upon my scheme he said that many gentlemen of this kingdom having of late destroyed their deer he conceived that the want of venison might be well supplied by the bodies of young lads and maidens not exceeding fourteen years of age nor under twelve so great a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for want of work and service and these to be disposed of by their parents if alive or otherwise by their nearest relations but with due deference to so excellent a friend and so deserving a patriot i cannot be altogether in his sentiments for as to the males my american acquaintance assured me from frequent experience that their flesh was generally tough and lean like that of our schoolboys by continual exercise and their taste disagreeable and to fatten them would not answer the charge then as to the females it would i think with humble submission be a loss to the public because they soon would become breeders themselves and besides it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice although indeed very unjustly as a little bordering upon cruelty which i confess has always been with me the strongest objection against any project how well soever intended  but in order to justify my friend he confessed that this expedient was put into his head by the famous sallmanaazor a native of the island formosa who came from thence to london above twenty years ago and in conversation told my friend that in his country when any young person happened to be put to death the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality as a prime dainty and that in his time the body of a plump girl of fifteen who was crucified for an attempt to poison the emperor was sold to his imperial majestys prime minister of state and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet at four hundred crowns neither indeed can i deny that if the same use were made of several plump young girls in this town who without one single groat to their fortunes cannot stir abroad without a chair and appear at a playhouse and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for the kingdom would not be the worse  some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast number of poor people who are aged diseased or maimed and i have been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of so grievous an encumbrance but i am not in the least pain upon that matter because it is very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by cold and famine and filth and vermin as fast as can be reasonably expected and as to the young laborers they are now in almost as hopeful a condition they cannot get work and consequently pine away for want of nourishment to a degree that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labor they have not strength to perform it and thus the country and themselves are happily delivered from the evils to come  i have too long digressed and therefore shall return to my subject i think the advantages by the proposal which i have made are obvious and many as well as of the highest importance  for first as i have already observed it would greatly lessen the number of papists with whom we are yearly overrun being the principal breeders of the nation as well as our most dangerous enemies and who stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the pretender hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good protestants who have chosen rather to leave their country than stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate  scecondly the poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own which by law may be made liable to distress and help to pay their landlords rent their corn and cattle being already seized and money a thing unknown  thirdly whereas the maintenance of an hundred thousand children from two years old and upwards cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum the nations stock will be thereby increased fifty thousand pounds per annum besides the profit of a new dish introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom who have any refinement in taste and the money will circulate among our selves the goods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture  fourthly the constant breeders besides the gain of eight shillings sterling per annum by the sale of their children will be rid of the charge of maintaining them after the first year  fifthly this food would likewise bring great custom to taverns where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for dressing it to perfection and consequently have their houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in good eating and a skilful cook who understands how to oblige his guests will contrive to make it as expensive as they please  sixthly this would be a great inducement to marriage which all wise nations have either encouraged by rewards or enforced by laws and penalties it would increase the care and tenderness of mothers toward their children when they were sure of a settlement for life to the poor babes provided in some sort by the public to their annual profit instead of expense we should soon see an honest emulation among the married women which of them could bring the fattest child to the market men would become as fond of their wives during the time of their pregnancy as they are now of their mares in foal their cows in calf or sows when they are ready to farrow nor offer to beat or kick them as is too frequent a practice for fear of a miscarriage  many other advantages might be enumerated for instance the addition of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barreld beef the propagation of swines flesh and improvement in the art of making good bacon so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs too frequent at our tables which are no way comparable in taste or magnificence to a well grown fat yearly child which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a lord mayors feast or any other public entertainment but this and many others i omit being studious of brevity  supposing that one thousand families in this city would be constant customers for infants flesh besides others who might have it at merry meetings particularly at weddings and christenings i compute that dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses and the rest of the kingdom where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper the remaining eighty thousand  i can think of no one objection that will possibly be raised against this proposal unless it should be urged that the number of people will be thereby much lessened in the kingdom this i freely own and twas indeed one principal design in offering it to the world i desire the reader will observe that i calculate my remedy for this one individual kingdom of ireland and for no other that ever was is or i think ever can be upon earth therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound of using neither clothes nor household furniture except what is of our own growth and manufacture of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury of curing the expensiveness of pride vanity idleness and gameing in our women of introducing a vein of parcimony prudence and temperance of learning to love our country wherein we differ even from laplanders and the inhabitants of topinamboo of quitting our animosities and factions nor act any longer like the jews who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy toward their tenants lastly of putting a spirit of honesty industry and skill into our shopkeepers who if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price the measure and the goodness nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing though often and earnestly invited to it  therefore i repeat let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients till he has at least some glimpse of hope that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them in practice  but as to my self having been wearied out for many years with offering vain idle visionary thoughts and at length utterly desparing of success i fortunately fell upon this proposal which as it is wholly new so it has something solid and real of no expense and little trouble full in our own power and whereby we can incur no danger in disobliging england for this kind of commodity will not bear exportation the flesh being of too tender a consistence to admit a long continuance in salt although perhaps i could name a country which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it  after all i am not so violently bent upon my own opinion as to reject any offer proposed by wise men which shall be found equally innocent cheap easy and effectual but before something of that kind shall be advanced in contradiction to my scheme and offering a better i desire the author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points first as things now stand how they will be able to find food and raiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs and secondly there being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout this kingdom whose whole subsistence put into a common stock would leave them in debt two millions of pounds sterling adding those who are beggars by profession to the bulk of farmers cottagers and laborers with their wives and children who are beggars in effect i desire those politicians who dislike my overture and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an answer that they will first ask the parents of these mortals whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness to have been sold for food at a year old in the manner i prescribe and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes as they have since gone through by the oppression of landlords the impossibility of paying rent without money or trade the want of common sustenance with neither house nor clothes to cover them from the inclemencies of the weather and the most inevitable prospect of intailing the like or greater miseries upon their breed for ever  i prosess in the sincerity of my heart that i have not the least personal interest in endeavoring to promote this necessary work having no other motive than the public good of my country by advancing our trade providing for infants relieving the poor and giving some pleasure to the rich i have no children by which i can propose to get a single penny the youngest being nine years old and my wife past childboaring  a vindication of the lord lieutenant of ireland the lord carteret from the charge of favoring tories highchurchmen and jacobites in order to treat this important subject with the greatest fairness and impartiality perhaps it may be convenient to give some account of his excellency in whose life and character there are certain particulars which might suggest a very just suspicion of some truth in the accusation he lies under  he is descended from two noble ancient and most loyal families the carterets and the granvilles too much distinguished i confess for what they acted and what they suffered in defending the former constitution in church and state under king charles the martyr i mean that very prince on account of whose martyrdom a form of prayer with fasting was enjoined by act of parliament to be used on the thirtieth day of january every year to implore the mercies of god that the guilt of that sacred and innocent blood etc might not be visited on us or our posterity as we may read at large in our commonprayerbooks which day has been solemnly kept even within the memory of many men now alive  his excellency the present lord was educated in the university of oxford from thence with a singularity scarce to be justified he carried away more greek latin and philosophy than properly became a person of his rank indeed much more of each than most of those who are forced to live by their learning will be at the unnecessary pains to load their heads with  this was the rock he split on upon his first appearance in the world just got clear of his guardians for as soon as he came to town some bishops and clergymen and other persons most eminent for learning and parts got him among them from whom though he were fortunately dragged by a lady and the court yet he could never wipe off the stain nor wash out the tincture of his university acquirements and disposition  to this another missortune was added that it pleased god to endow him with great natural talents memory judgment comprehension eloquence and wit and to finish the work all these were fortified even in his youth with the advantages received by such employments as are best fitted both to exercise and polish the gifts of nature and education having been ambassador in several courts when his age would hardly allow him to take a degree and made principal secretary of state at a period when according to custom he ought to have been busied in losing his money at a chocolatehouse or in other amusements equally laudable and epidemick among persons of honor  i cannot omit another weak side in his excellency for it is known and can be proved upon him that greek and latin books might be found every day in his dressing room if it were carefully searched and there is reason to suspect that some of the said books have been privately conveyed to him by tory hands i am likewise assured that he has been taken in the very fact of reading the said books even in the midst of a session to the great neglect of public affairs  i own there may be some grounds for this charge because i have it from good hands that when his excellency is at dinner with one or two scholars at his elbows he grows a most insupportable and unintelligible companion to all the sine gentlemen round the table  i cannot deny that his excellency lies under another great disadvantage for besides all the accomplishments abovementioned having that of a most comely and graceful person he has during the prime of youth spirits and vigor in a most exemplary manner led a regular domestic life discovered a great esteem friendship and love for his lady as well as a true affection for his children and when he is disposed to admit an entertaining evening companion he does not always enough reflect whether the person may possibly in former days have lain under the imputation of a tory nor at such times do the natural or affected fears of popery and the pretender make any part of the conversation i presume because neither homer plato aristotle nor cicero have made any mention of them  these i freely acknowledge to be his excellencys failings yet i think it is agreed by philosophers and divines that some allowance ought to be given to human infirmity and the prejudices of a wrong education  i am well aware how much my sentiments differ from the orthodox opinion of one or two principal patriots for these have decided the matter directly against me by declaring that no person who was ever known to lie under the suspicion of one single tory principle or who had been once seen at a great mans levee in the worst of times should be allowed to come within the verge of the castle much less to bow in the antichamber appear at the assemblies or dance at a birthnight however i dare assert that this maxim has been often controlled and that on the contrary a considerable number of early penitents have been received into grace who are now an ornament happiness and support to the nation  neither do i find any murmuring on some other points of greater importance where this favorite maxim is not so strictly observed  to instance only in one i have not heard that any care has hitherto been taken to discover whether a famous ropedancer madam violante be a whig or tory in her principles or even that she has ever been offered the oaths to the governmem t on the contrary i am told that she openly professes herself to be a highflyer and it is not improbable but by her outlandish name she may also be a papist in her heart yet we see this illu strious and dangerous female openly caressed by principal persons of both parties who contribute to support her in a splendid manner without the least apprehensions from a grand jury and as hobbs wisely observes so much money being equivalent to so much power it may deserve considering with what safety such an instrument of power ought to be trusted in the hands of an alien who has not given any legal security for her good affection to the government  i confess there is one evil which i could wish our friends would think proper to redress there are many whigs in this kingdom of the oldfashiond stamp of whom we might make very good use they bear the same loyalty with us to the hanoverian family in the person of king george the second the same abhorrence of the pretender with the consequents of popery and slavery and the same indulgence to tender consciences but having nothing to ask for themselves and consequently the more leisure to think for the public they are often apt to entertain fears and melancholy prospects concerning the state of their country the decay of trade the want of money the miserable condition of the people with other topics of like nature all which do equally concern both whig and tory who if they have any thing to lose must be equally sufferers perhaps one or two of these melanchly gentlemen will sometimes venture to publish their thoughts in print now i can by no means approve our usual custom of cursing and railing at this species of thinkers under the names of tories jacobites papists libellers rebels and the like  this was the utter ruin of that poor angry bustling wellmeaning mortal pistorides who lies equally under the contempt of both parties with no other difference than a mixture of pity on one side and of aversion on the other  how has he been pelted pestered and pounded by one single wag who promises never to forsake him living or dead  i was much pleased with the humor of a surgeon in this town who having in his own apprehensions received some great injustice from the earl of galloway and desparing of revenge as well as relief declared to all his friends that he had set apart a hundred guineas to purchase the earls carcass from the sexton whenever i t should die to make a skeleton of the bones stuff the hide and show them for three pence and thus get vengeance for the injuries he had suffered by the owner  of the like spirit too often is that implacable race of wits against whom there is no defense but innocence and philosophy neither of which is likely to be at hand and therefore the wounded have no where to fly for a cure but to downright stupidity a crazed head or a profligate contempt of guilt and shame  i am therefore sorry for that other miserable creature ld vt an who spoke against the libel in the privy council and likewise in the house of lords traulus who although of somewhat a different species yet seems very far to outdo even the genius of pistorides in that miscarrying talent of railing without consistency or discretion against the most innocent persons according to the present situation of his gall and spleen i do not blame an honest gentleman for the bitterest invectives against one to whom he professes the greatest friendship provided he acts in the dark so as not to be discovered but in the midst of caresses visits and invitations to run into the streets or to as public a place and without the least pretended incitement sputter out the basest and falsest accusations then to wipe his mouth come up smiling to his friend shake him by the hand and tell him in a whisper it was all for his service this proceeding i am bold to think a great failure in prudence and i am afraid lest such a practitioner with a body so open so foul and so full of sores may fall under the resentmen of an incensed political surgeon who is not in much renown for his mercy upon great provocation who without waiting for his death will flay and dissect him alive and to the view of mankind lay open all the disordered cells of his brain the vonom of his tongue the corruption of his heart and spots and flatuses of his spleen  and all this for three pence  in such a case what a scene would be laid open and to drop my metaphor what a character of our mistaken friend might an angry enemy draw and expose particularizing that unnatural conjunction of vices and follies so inconsistent with each other in the same breast furious and fawning scurrilous and flattering cowardly and provoking insolent and abject most profligately salse with the strongest professions of sincerity positive and variable tyrannical and slavish  in vain would his excusers endeavor to palliate his enormities by imputing them to madness beause it is well knowm that madness only operates by inflaming and enlarging the good or evil dispositions of the mind for the curators of bedlam assure us that some lunaticks are persons of honor truth benevolence and many other virtues which appear in their highest ravings although after a wild incoherent manner while others on the contrary discover in every word and action the utmost baseness and depravity of human minds which infallibly they possessed in the same degree although perhaps under a better regulation before their entrance into that academy  but it may be objected that there is an argument of much more force to excuse the overflowings of that zeal which our friend shows or means for our cause and it must be confessed that the easy and smooth fluency of his elocution bestowed on him by nature and cultivated by continual practice added to the comelyness of his person the harmony of his voice the gracefulness of his manner and the decency of his dress are temptations too strong for such a genius to resist upon any public occasion of making them appear with universal applause and if good men are sometimes accused of loving their jest better than their friend surely to gain the reputation of the first orator in the kingdom no man of spirit would scruple to lose all the friends he had in the world  it is usual for masters to make their boys declaim on both sides of an argument and as some kinds of assemblies are called the schools of principles i confess nothing can better improve political schoolboys than the art of making plausible or implausible harangues against the very opinion for which they resolve to determine  so cardinal perron after having spoke for an hour to the admiration of all his hearers to prove the existence of god told some of his intimates that he could have spoken another hour and much better to prove the contrary  to return from this long digression if persons in high sations have been allowed to choose mistresses without regard even to difference in religion yet never incurred the least reflection on their loyalty or their protestantism shall the chief govenour of a great kingdom be censured for choosing a companion who may formerly have been suspected for differing from the orthodox in some speculative opinions of persons and things which cannot affect the fundamental principles of a sound whig  but let me suppose a very possible case here is a person sent to govern ireland whose unfortunate weak side it happens to be for several reasons abovementioned that he has encouraged the attendance of one or two gentlemen distinguished for their taste their wit and their learning who have taken the oaths to his majesty and pray heartily for him yet because they may perhaps be stigmatized as quondam tories by pistorides and his gang his excellency must be forced to banish them under the pain and peril of displeasing the zealots of his own party and thereby be put into a worse condition than every common goodfellow who may be a sincere protestant and a loyal subject and yet rather choose to drink fine ale at the popes head than muddy at the kings  let me then return to my supposition it is certain the highflown loyalists in the present sense of the word have their thoughts and studies and tongues so entirely diverted by political schemes that the zeal of their principles has eaten up their understandings neither have they time from their employments their hopes and their hourly labors for acquiring new additions of merit to amuse themselves with philological converse or speculations which are utterly ruinous to all schemes of rising in the world what must then a great man do whose ill stars have fatally perverted him to a love and taste and possession of literature politeness and good sense our thoroughsped republic of whigs which contains the bulk of all hopers pretenders expectors and possessors are beyond all doubt most highly useful to princes to governors to great ministers and to their country but at the same time and by necessary consequence the most disagreable companions to all who have that unfortunate turn of mind peculiar to his excellency and perhaps to five or six more in a nation  i do not deny it possible that an original or proselyte favourer of the times might have been born to these useless talents which in former ages qualified a man to be a poet or a philosopher all i contend for is that where the true genius of party once enters it sweeps the house clean and leaves room for many other spirits to take joint possession till the last state of that man is exceedingly better than the first  i allow it a great error in his excellency that he adheres so obstinately to his old unfashionable academick education yet so perverse is human nature that the usual remedies for this evil in others have produced a contrary effect in him to a degree that i am credibly informed he will as i have already hinted in the middle of a session quote passages out of plato and pindar at his own table to some booklearnd companion without blushing even when persons of great stations are by  i will venture one step farther which is freely to confess that this mistaken method of educating youth in the knowledge of ancient learning and language is too apt to spoil their politics and principles because the doctrine and examples of the books they read teach them lessons directly contrary in every point to the present practice of the world and accordingly hobbes most judiciously observes that the writings of the greeks and romans made young men imbibe opinions against absolute power in a prince or even in a first minister and to embrace notions of liberty and property  it has been therefore a great felicity to these kingdoms that the heirs to titles and large estates have a weakness in their eyes and a tenderness in their constitutions are not able to bear the pain and indignity of whipping and as the mother rightly expresses it could never take to their books yet are well enough qualified to sign a receipt for half a years rent to put their name rightly spelt to a warrant and to read pamphlets against religion and highflying whereby they fill their niches and carry themselves through the world with that dignity which best becomes a senator and a squire  i could heartily wish his excellency would be more condescending to the genius of the kingdom he governs to the condition of the times and to the nature of the station he sills yet if it be true what i have read in old english storybooks that one agesilaus no matter to the bulk of my readers whether i spell the name right or wrong was caught by the parson of the parish riding on a hobbyhorse with his children that socrates a heathen philosopher was found dancing by himself at fourscore that a king called caesar augustus or some such name used to play with boys whereof some might possibly be sons of tories and two great men called scipio and laelius i forget their christian names and whether they were poets or generals often played at duck and drake with smooth stones on a river now i say if these facts be true and the book where i found them is in print i cannot imagine why our most zealous patriots may not a little indulge his excellency in an infirmity which is not mortally evil provided he gives no public scandal which is by all means to be avoided i say why he may not be indulged twice a week to converse with one or two particular persons and let him and them conn over their old exploded readings together after mornings spent in hearing and prescribing ways and means from and to his most obedient politicians for the welfare of the kingdom although the said particular person or persons may not have made so public a declaration of their political faith in all its parts as the business of the nation requires still submitting my opinion to that happy majority which i am confident is always in the right by whom the liberty of the subject has been so frequently so strenuously and so successfully asserted who by their wise councils have made commerce to flourish money to abound inhabitants to increase the value of lands and rents to rise and the whole island put on a new face of plenty and prosperity  but in order to clear his excellency more fully from this accusation of showing his favors to highflyers tories and jacobites it will be necessary to come to particulars  the first person of a tory denomination to whom his excellency gave any marks of his favor was doctor thomas sheridan it is to be observed that this happened so early in his exellencys government as it may be justly supposed he had not been informed of that gentlemans character upon so dangerous an article the doctor being well known and distinguished for his skill and success in the education of youth beyond most of his profession for many years past was recommended to his excellency on the score of his learning and particularly for his knowledge in the greek tongue whereof it seems his excellency is a great admirer although for what reasons i could never imagine however it is agreed on all hands that his lordship was too easily prevailed on by the doctors request or indeed rather from the biass of his own nature to hear a tragedy acted in that unknown language by the doctors lads which was written by some heathen author but whether it contained any tory or highchurch principles must be left to the consciences of the boys the doctor and his excellency the only witnesses in this case whose testimonies can be depended upon  it seems his excellency a thing never to be sufficiently wondered at was so pleased with his entertainment that some time after he gave the doctor a church living to the value almost of one hundred pounds a year and made him one of his chaplains from an antiquated notion that good schoolmasters ought to be encouraged in every nation professing civility and religion yet his excellency did not venture to make this bold step without strong recommendations from persons of undoubted principles fitted to the times who thought themselves bound in justice honor and gratitude to do the doctor a good office in return for the care he had taken of their children or those of their friends yet the catastrophe was terrible for the doctor in the height of his felicity and gratitude going down to take possession of his parish and furnished with a few led sermons whereof as it is to be supposed the number was very small having never served a cure in the church he stopped at cork to attend on his bishop and going to church on the sunday following was according to the usual civility of country clergymen invited by the minister of the parish to supply the pulpit it happened to be the first of august and the first of august happened that year to light upon a sunday and it happened that the doctors text was in these words sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof and lastly it happened that some one person of the congregation whose loyalty made him watchful upon every appearance of danger to his majestys person and government when service was over gave the alarm notice was immediately sent up to town and by the zeal of one man of no large dimensions of body or mind such a clamor was raised that we in dublin could apprehend no less than an invasion by the pretender who must be landed in the south the result was that the doctor must be struck out of the chaplains list and appear no more at the castle yet whether he were then or be at this day a whig or a tory i think is a secret only it is manifest that he is a zealous hanoverian at least in poetry and a great adorer of the present royal family through all its branches his friends likewise assert that he had preached this same sermon often under the same text that not having observed the words till he was in the pulpit and had opened his notes as he is a person a little abstracted he wanted presence of mind to change them and that in the whole sermon there was not a syllable relating to government or party or to the subject of the day  in this incident there seems to have been an union of events that will probably never happen again to the end of the world or at least like the grand conjunction in the heavens which i think they say can arrive but once in twenty thousand years  the second gentleman if i am right in my chronology who under the suspicion of a tory received some favor from his excellency is mr james stopford very strongly recommended by the most eminent whig in england on the account of his learning and virtue and other accomplishments he had passed the greatest part of his youth in close study or in traveling and was either not at home or not at leisure to trouble his thoughts about party which i allow to be a great omission though i cannot honestly place him in the list of tories and therefore think his excellency may be fairly acquitted for making him vicar of finglass worth about one hundred and fifty pounds a year  the third is doctor patrick delany this divine lies under some disadvantage having in his youth received many civilities from a certain person sir constantine phipps lord chancellor of ireland when queen anne died then in a very high station here for which reason i doubt the doctor never drunk his confusion since and what makes the matter desperate it is now too late unless our inquisitors will be content with drinking confusion to his memory the aforesaid eminent person who was a judge of all merit but party distinguished the doctor among other juniors in our university for his learning virtue discretion and good sense but the doctor was then in too good a situation at his college to hope or endeavor at a better establishment from one who had no power to give it him  upon the present lord lieutenants coming over the doctor was named to his exdellency by a friend among other clergymen of distinction as persons whose characters it was proper his excellency should know and by the truth of which the giver would be content to stand or fall in his excellencys opinion since not one of those persons were in particular friendship with the gentlemen who gave in their names by this and some other incidents particularly the recommendation of the late archbishop of dublin the doctor became known to his excellency whose fatal turn of mind toward heathenish and outlandish books and languages finding as i conceive a like disposition in the doctor was the cause of his becoming so domestic as we are told he is at the castle of dublin  three or four years ago the doctor grown weary of an academick life for some reasons best known to the managers of the discipline in that learned society which it may not be for their honor to mention resolved to leave it although by the benefit of his pupils and his seniorfellowship with all its perquisites he received every year between nine hundred and a thousand pounds and a small northern living in the universitys donation of somewhat better than a hundred pounds a year falling at the same time with the chancellorship of christchurch to about equal value in the gist of his excellency the doctor ventured into the world in a very scanty condition having squandered away all his annual income in a manner which although perhaps proper enough for a clergyman without a family will not be for the advantage of his character to discover either on the exchange or at a bankers shop  about two months ago his excellency gave the doctor a prebend in st patricks cathedral which being of near the same value with either of the two former will add a third part to his revenues after he shall have paid the great encumbrances upon it so that he may now be said to possess of church preserments in scattered tithes three hundred pounds a year instead of the like sum of infallible rents from a senior fellowship with the offices annexed besides the advantage of a free lodging and some other easements but since the doctor has not in any of his writings his sermons his actions his discourse or his company discovered one single principle of either whig or tory and that the lord lieutenant still continues to admit him i shall boldly pronounce him one of us but like a new freemason who has not yet learned all the dialect of the mystery neither can he justly be accused of any tory doctrines except perhaps some among those few with which that wicked party was charged during the height of their power but have been since transferred for the most solid reasons to the whole body of our firmest friends i have now done with the clergy and upon the strictest examination have not been able to find above one of that order against whom any party suspicion can lie which is the unfortunate gentleman dr sheridan who by mere chancemedly shot his own fortune dead with a single text  as to the laity i can hear of but one person of the tory stamp who since the beginning of his excellencys government did ever receive any solid mark of his favor i mean sir arthur acheson reported to be an acknowledged tory and what is almost as bad a scholar into the bargain it is whispered about as a certain truth that this gentleman is to have a grant of a certain barrack upon his estate within two miles of his own house for which the crown is to be his tenant at the rent of sixty pounds per annum he being only at the expense of about five hundred pounds to put the house in repair build stables and other necessaries i will place this invidious mark of beneficence conferred on a tory in a fair light by computing the costs and necessary defalcations after which it may be seen how much sir arthur will be annually a clear gainer by the public notwithstanding his unfortunate principles and his knowledge in greek and latin  l s d for repairs etc  00 l the interest whereof per ann  0 0 0 for all manner of poultry to furnish the troopers but which the said troopers must be at the labor of catching valued per ann   0 0 for straggling sheep   0 0 for game destroyed five miles round   0 0    0 0 rent paid to sir arthur  0 0 0 deduct    0 0 remains clear    0 0  thus if sir arthur acheson shall have the good fortune to obtain a grant of this barrack he will receive neat profit annually from the crown eleven pounds sterling to help him in entertaining the officers and making provision for his younger children  it is true there is another advantage to be expected which may fully compensate the loss of cattle and poultry by multiplying the breed of mankind and particularly of good protestants in a part of the kingdom half depopulated by the wild humor among the farmers thereof leaving their country but i am not so skilful in arithmetic as to compute the value  i have reckoned one per cent below the legal interest for the money that sir arthur must expend and valued the damage in the other articles very moderately however i am confident he may with good management be a saver at least which is a prodigious instance of moderation in our friends toward a professed tory whatever merit he may pretend by the unwillingness he has shown to make his excellency uneasy in his administration  thus i have with the utmost impartiality collected every single favor further than personal civilities conferred by his excellency on tories and reputed tories since his first arrival hither to this present   th day of april in the year of our lord    0 giving all allowance possible to the arguments on the other side of the question  and the account will stand thus disposed of preferments and employments to tories or reputed tories by his excellency the lord lieutenant in about the space of six years to doctor thomas sheridan in a rectory near kinsale per ann  00 0 0 to sir arthur acheson baronet a barrack per ann    0 0     0 0  give me leave now to compute in gross the value of the favors done by his excellency to the true friends of their king and country and of the protestant religion  it is to be remembered that although his excellency cannot be properly said to bestow bishoprics commands in the army the place of a judge or commissioner in the revenue and some others yet they are for the most part disposed upon his recommendation except where the persons are immediately sent from england by their interest at court for which i have allowed large defalcations in the following accounts and it is remarkable that the only considerable station conferred on a reputed tory since his present excellencys government was of this latter kind  and indeed it is but too remarkable that in a neighboring nation where that dangerous denomination of men is incomparably more numerous more powerful and of consequence more formidable real tories can often with much less difficulty obtain very

iconoclasts antigloriousmemorists whiterosalists tenthajunians and the like when by a fair state of the account the balance i conceive plainly lies on the other side  an essay on the fates of clergymen there is no talent so useful toward rising in the world or which puts men more out of the reach of fortune than that quality generally possessed by the dullest sort of people and is in common speech called discretion a species of lower prudence by the assistance of which people of the meanest intellectuals without any other qualification pass through the world in great tranquillity and with universal good treatment neither giving nor taking offense courts are seldom unprovided of persons under this character on whom if they happen to be of great quality most employments even the greatest naturally fall when competitors will not agree and in such promotions no body rejoices or grieves the truth of this i could prove by several instances within my own memory for i say nothing of the present times  and indeed as regularity and forms are of great use in carrying on the business of the world so it is very convenient that persons endued with this kind of discretion should have that share which is proper to their talents in the conduct of affairs but by no means to meddle in matters which require genius learning strong comprehension quickness of conception magnanimity generosity sagacity or any other superior gift of human minds because this sort of discretion is usually attended with a strong desire of money and few scruples about the way of obtaining it with servile flattery and submission with a want of all public spirit or principle with a perpetual wrong judgment when the owners come into power and high place how to dispose of favor and preferment having no measure for merit and virtue in others but those very steps by which themselves ascended nor the least intention of doing good or hurt to the public farther than either one or the other is likely to be subservient to their own security or interest thus being void of all friendship and enmity they never complain nor find fault with the times and indeed never have reason to do so  men of eminent parts and abilities as well as virtues do sometimes rise in the courts sometimes in the law and sometimes even in the church such were the lord bacon the earl of strafford archbishop laud in the reign of king charles i and others in our own times whom i shall not name but these and many more under different princes and in different kingdoms were disgraced or banished or suffered death merely in envy to their virtues and superior genius which emboldened them in great exigencies and distresses of state wanting a reasonable infusion of this aldermanly discretion to attempt the service of their prince and country out of the common forms  this evil fortune which generally attends extraordinary men in the management of great affairs has been imputed to diverse causes that need not be here set down when so obvious an one occurs if what a certain writer observes be true that when a great genius appears in the world the dunces are all in confederacy against him and thus although he employs his talents wholly in his closet without interfering with any mans ambition or avarice what must he expect when he ventures out to seek for preferment in a court but universal opposition when he is mounting the ladder and every hand ready to turn him off when he is at the top and in this point fortune generally acts directly contrary to nature for in nature we find that bodies full of life and spirits mount easily and are hard to fall whereas heavy bodies are hard to rise and come down with greater velocity in proportion to their weight but we find fortune every day acting just the reverse of this  this talent of discretion as i have described it in its several adjuncts and circumstances is no where so serviceable as to the clergy to whose preserment nothing is so fatal as the character of wit politeness in reading or manners or that kind of behavior which we contract by having too much conversed with persons of high stations and eminency these qualifications being reckoned by the vulgar of all ranks to be marks of levity which is the last crime the world will pardon in a clergyman to this i may add a free manner of speaking in mixed company and too frequent an appearance in places of much resort which are equally noxious to spiritual promotions  i have known indeed a few exceptions to some parts of these regulations i have seen some of the dullest men alive aiming at wit and others with as little pretensions affecting politeness in manners and discourse but never being able to persuade the world of their guilt they grew into considerable stations upon the firm assurance which all people had of their discretion because they were a size too low to deceive the world to their own disadvantage but this i confess is a trial too dangerous often to engage in  there is a known story of a clergyman who was recommended for a preferment by some great men at court to an archbishop his grace said he had heard that the clergyman used to play at whisk and swobbers that as to playing now and then a sober game at whisk for pastime it might be pardoned but he could not digest those wicked swobbers and it was with some pains that my lord srs could undeceive him i ask by what talents we may suppose that great prelate ascend so high or what sort of qualifications he would expect in those whom he took into his patronage or would probably recommend to court for the government of distant churches  two clergymen in my memory stood candidates for a small free school in shire where a gentleman of quality and interest in the country who happened to have a better understanding than his neighbors procured the place for him who was the better scholar and more gentlemanly person of the two very much to the regret of all the parish the other being disappointed came up to london where he became the greatest pattern of this lower discretion that i have known and possessed with as heavy intellectuals which together with the coldness of his temper and gravity of his deportment carried him safe through many difficulties and he lived and died in a great station while his competitor is too obscure for fame to tell us what become of him  this species of discretion which i so much celebrate and do most heartily recommend has one advantage not yet mentioned that it will carry a man safe through all the malice and variety of parties so far that whatever faction happens to be uppermost his claim is usually allowed for a share of what is going and the thing seems to me highly reasonable for in all great changes the prevailing side is usually so tempestuous that it wants the ballast of those whom the world calls moderate men and i call men of discretion whom people in power may with little ceremony load as heavy as they please drive them through the hardest and deepest roads without danger of foundring or breaking their backs and will be sure to find them neither rusty nor vicious  i will here give the reader a short history of two clergymen in england the characters of each and the progress of their fortunes in the world by which the force of worldly discretion and the bad consequences from the want of that virtue will strongly appear  corusodes an oxford student and a farmers son was never absent from prayers or lecture nor once out of his college after tom had tolled he spent every day ten hours in his closet in reading his courses dozing clipping papers or darning his stockings which last he performed to admiration he could be soberly drunk at the expense of others with college ale and at those seasons was always most devout he wore the same gown five years without dragling or tearing he never once looked into a playbook or a poem he read virgil and ramus in the same cadence but with a very different taste he never understood a jest or had the least conception of wit  for one saying he stands in renown to this day being with some other students over a pot of ale one of the company said so many pleasant things that the rest were much diverted only corusodes was silent and unmoved when they parted he called this merry companion aside and said sir i preceive by your often speaking and our friends laughing that you spoke many jests and you could not but observe my silence but sir this is my humor i never make a jest myself nor ever laugh at another mans  corusodes thus endowed got into holy orders having by the most extreme parsimony saved thirty four pounds out of a very beggarly fellowship went up to london where his sister was waiting woman to a lady and so good a solicitor that by her means he was admitted to read prayers in the family twice a day at fourteen shillings a month he had now acquired a low obsequious awkward bow and a talent of gross flattery both in and out of season he would shake the butler by the hand he taught the page his catechism and was sometimes admitted to dine at the stewards table in short he got the good word of the whole family and was recommended by my lady for chaplain to some other noble house by which his revenue beside vales amounted to about thirty pounds a year his sister procured him a scarf from my lord who had a small design of gallantry upon her and by his lordships solicitation he got a lectureship in town of sixty pounds a year where he preached constantly in person in a grave manner with an audible voice a style ecclesiastic and the matter such as it was well suited to the intellectuals of his hearers some time after a country living fell in my lords disposal and his lordship who had now some encouragement given him of success in his amor bestowed the living on corusodes who still kept his lectureship and residence in town where he was a constant attendant at all meetings relating to charity without ever contributing further than his frequent pious exhortations if any women of better fashion in the parish happened to be absent from church they were sure of a visit from him in a day or two to chide and to dine with them  he had a select number of poor constantly attending at the street door of his lodgings for whom he was a common solicitor to his former patroness dropping in his own halfcrown among the collections and taking it out when he disposed of the money at a person of qualitys house he would never sit down till he was thrice bid and then upon the corner of the most distant chair his whole demeanor was formal and starched which adhered so close that he could never shake it off in his highest promotion  his lord was now in high employment at court and attended by him with the most abject assiduity and his sister being gone off with child to a private lodging my lord continued his graces to corusodes got him to be a chaplain in ordinary and in due time a parish in town and a dignity in the church  he paid his curates punctually at the lowest sallary and partly out of the communionmoney but gave them good advice in abundance he married a citizens widow who taught him to put out small sums at ten per cent and brought him acquainted with jobbers in changealley by her dexterity he sold the clarkship of his parish when it became vacant  he kept a miserable house but the blame was laid wholly upon madam for the good doctor was always at his books or visiting the sick or doing other offices of charity and piety in his parish  he treated all his inferiors of the clergy with a most sanctified pride was rigorously and universally censorious upon all his brethren of the gown on their first appearance in the world or while they continued meanly preferred but gave large allowance to the laiety of high rank or great riches using neither eyes nor ears for their faults he was never sensible of the least corruption in courts parliaments or ministries but made the most favorable constructions of all public proceedings and power in whatever hands or whatever party was always secure of his most charitable opinion he had many wholesome maxims ready to excuse all miscarriages of state men are but men erunt vitia donee homines and quod supra nos nil ad nos with several others of equal weight  it would lengthen my paper beyond measure to trace out the whole system of his conduct his dreadful apprehensions of popery his great moderation toward dissenters of all denominations with hearty wishes that by yielding somewhat on both sides there might be a general union among protestants his short inoffensive sermons in his turns at court and the matter exactly suited to the present juncture of prevailing opinions the arts he used to obtain a mitre by writing against episcopacy and the proofs he gave of his loyalty by palliating or defending the murder of a martyred prince  endowed with all these accomplishments we leave him in the full career of success mounting fast toward the top of the ladder ecclesiastical which he has a fair probability to reach without the merit of one single virtue moderately stocked with the least valuable parts of erudition utterly devoid of all taste judgment or genius and in his grandeur naturally choosing to hawl up others after him whose accomplishments most resemble his own except his beloved sons nephews or other kindred be not in competition or lastly except his inclinations be diverted by those who have power to mortify or further advance him  eugenio set out from the same university and about the same time with corusodes he had the reputation of an arch lad at school and was unfortunately possessed with a talent for poetry on which account he received many chiding letters from his father and grave advice from his tutor he did not neglect his college learning but his chief study was the authors of antiquity with a perfect knowledge in the greek and roman tongues he could never procure himself to be chosen fellow for it was objected against him that he had written verses and particularly some wherein he glanced at a certain reverend doctor famous for dullness that he had been seen bowing to ladies as he met them in the streets and it was proved that once he had been found dancing in a private family with half a dozen of both sexes  he was the younger son to a gentleman of a good birth but small fortune and his father dying he was driven to london to seek his fortune he got into orders and became reader in a parish church at twenty pounds a year was carried by an oxford friend to wills coffeehouse frequented in those days by men of wit where in some time he had the bad luck to be distinguished his scanty sallery compelled him to run deep in debt for a new gown and cassock and now and then forced him to write some paper of wit or humor or preach a sermon for ten shillings to supply his necessities he was a thousand times recommended by his poetical friends to great persons as a young man of excellent parts who deserved encouragement and received a thousand promises but his modesty and a generous spirit which disdained the slavery of continual application and attendance always disappointed him making room for vigilant dunces who were sure to be never out of sight  he had an excellent faculty in preaching if he were not sometimes a little too refined and apt to trust too much to his own way of thinking and reasoning  when upon the vacancy of preferment he was hardly drawn to attend upon some promising lord he received the usual answer that he came too late for it had been given to another the very day before and he had only this comfort left that every body said it was a thousand pities something could not be done for poor mr eugenio  the remainder of his story will be dispatched in a few words wearied with weak hopes and weaker pursuits he accepted a curacy in derbyshire of thirty pounds a year and when he was five and forty had the great felicity to be prefered by a friend of his fathers to a vicaridge worth annually sixty pound in the most desert parts of lincolnshire where his spirit quite sunk with those reflections that solitude and disappointments bring he married a farmers widow and is still alive utterly undistinguished and forgotten only some of the neighbors have accidentally heard that he had been a notable man in his youth  an essay on modern education from frequently reflecting upon the course and method of educating youth in this and a neighboring kingdom with the general success and consequence thereof i am come to this determination that education is always the worse in proportion to the wealth and grandeur of the parents nor do i doubt in the least that if the whole world were now under the dominion of one monarch provided i might be allowed to choose where he should fix the seat of his empire the only son and heir of that monarch would be the worst educated mortal that ever was born since the creation and i doubt the same proportion will hold through all degrees and titles from an emperor downwards to the common gentry  i do not say that this has been always the case for in better times it was directly otherwise and a scholar may fill half his greek and roman shelves with authors of the noblest birth as well as highest virtue nor do i tax all nations at present with this defect for i know there are some to be excepted and particularly scotland under all the disadvantages of its climate and soil if that happiness be not rather owing even to those very disadvantages what is then to be done if this reflection must fix on two countries which will be most ready to take offense and which of all others it will be least prudent or safe to offend  but there is one circumstance yet more dangerous and lamentable for if according to the postulatum already laid down the highest quality any youth is of he is in greater likelihood to be worse educated it behooves me to dread and keep far from the verge of scandalum magnatum  retracting therefore that hazardous postulatum i shall venture no further at present than to say that perhaps some additional care in educating the sons of nobility and principal gentry might not be ill employed if this be not delivered with softness enough i must for the future be silent  in the mean time let me ask only two questions which relate to england i ask first how it comes about that for above sixty years past the chief conduct of affairs has been generally placed in the hands of newmen with very few exceptions the noblest blood of england having been shed in the grand rebellion many great families became extinct or supported only by minors when the king was restored very few of those lords remained who began or at least had improved their education under the happy reign of king james or king charles i of which lords the two principal were the marquis of ormond and the earl of southampton the minors have or had during the rebellion and usurpation either received too much tincture of bad principles from those fanatic times or coming to age at the restoration fell into the vices of that dissolute reign  i date from this era the corrupt method of education among us and the consequence thereof in the necessity the crown lay under of introducing newmen into the chief conduct of public affairs or to the office of what we now call prime ministers men of art knowledge application and insinuation merely for want of a supply among the nobility they were generally though not always of good birth sometimes younger brothers at other times such who although inheriting good estates yet happened to be well educated and provided with learning such under that king were hyde bridgeman clifford osborn godolphin ashleycooper few or none under the short reign of king james ii under king william summers mountague churchil vernon boil and many others under the queen harley st john harcourt trevor who indeed were persons of the best private families but unadorned with titles so in the following reign mr robert walpole was for many years prime minister in which post he still happily continues his brother horace is ambassador extraordinary to france mr addison and mr craggs without the least allowance to support them have been secretaries of state  if the facts have been thus for above sixty years past whereof i could with a little further recollection produce many more instances i would ask again how it has happened that in a nation plentifully abounding with nobility so great share in the most competent parts of public management has been for so long a period chiefly entrusted to commoners unless some omissions or defects of the highest import may be charged upon those to whom the care of educating our noble youth had been committed for if there be any difference between human creatures in the point of natural parts as we usually call them it should seem that the advantage lies on the side of children born from noble and wealthy parents the same traditional sloth and luxury which render their body weak and effeminate perhaps refining and giving a freer motion to the spirits beyond what can be expected from the gross robust issue of meaner mortals add to this the peculiar advantages which all young noblemen possess by the privileges of their birth such as a free access to courts and a universal deference paid to their persons  but as my lord bacon charge it for a fault on princes that they are impatient to compass ends without giving themselves the trouble of consulting or executing the means so perhaps it may be the disposition of young nobles either from the indulgence of parents tutors and governors or their own inactivity that they expect the accomplishments of a good education without the least expense of time or study to acquire them  what i said last i am ready to retract for the case is infinitely worse and the very maxims set up to direct modern education are enough to destroy all the seeds of knowledge honor wisdom and virtue among us the current opinion prevails that the study of greek and latin is loss of time that public schools by mingling the sons of noblemen with those of the vulgar engage the former in bad company that whipping breaks the spirits of lads well born that universities make young men pedants that to dance fence speak french and know how to behave yourself among great persons of both sexes comprehends the whole duty of a gentleman  i cannot but think this wise system of education has been much cultivated among us by those worthies of the army who during the last war returning from flanders at the close of each campaign became the dictators of behavior dress and politeness to all those youngsters who frequent chocolatecoffeegaminghouses drawingrooms operas levees and assemblies where a colonel by his pay perquisites and plunder was qualified to outshine many peers of the realm and by the influence of an exotic habit and demeanor added to other foreign accomplishments gave the law to the whole town and was copyed as the standardpattern of whatever was refined in dress equipage conversation or diversions  i remember in those times an admired original of that vocation sitting in a coffeehouse near two gentlemen whereof one was of the clergy who were engaged in some discourse that savoured of learning this officer thought fit to interpose and professing to deliver the sentiments of his fraternity as well as his own and probably did so of too many among them turning to the clergyman spoke in the following manner dn me doctor say what you will the army is the only school for gentlemen do you think my lord marlborough beat the french with greek and latin dn me a scholar when he comes into good company what is he but an ass dn me i would be glad by gd to see any of your scholars with his nouns and his verbs and his philosophy and trigonometry what a figure he would make at a siege or blockade or rencountring  dn me etc after which he proceeded with a volley of military terms less significant sounding worse and harder to be understood than any that were ever coined by the commentators upon aristotle i would not here be thought to charge the soldiery with ignorance and contempt of learning without allowing exceptions of which i have known many but however the worse example especially in a great majority will certainly prevail  i have heard that the late earl of oxford in the time of his ministry never passed by whites chocolatehouse the common rendezvous of infamous sharpers and noble cullies without bestowing a curse upon that famous academy as the bane of half the english nobility i have likewise been told another passage concerning that great minister which because it gives a humorous idea of one principal ingredient in modern education take as follows le sack the famous french dancingmaster in great admiration asked a friend whether it were true that mr harley was made an earl and lord treasurer and finding it confirmed said well i wonder what the devil the queen could see in him for i attended him two years and he was the greatest dunce that ever i taught  another hindrance to good education and i think the greatest of any is that pernicious custom in rich and noble families of entertaining french tutors in their houses these wretched pedagogues are enjoined by the father to take special care that the boy shall be perfect in his french by the mother that master must not walk till he is hot nor be suffered to play with other boys nor be wet in his feet nor daub his clothes and to see the dancingmaster attends constantly and does his duty she further insists that the child be not kept too long poring on his book because he is subject to sore eyes and of a weakly constitution  by these methods the young gentleman is in every article as fully accomplished at eight years old as at eight and twenty age adding only to the growth of his person and his vice so that if you should look at him in his boyhood through the magnifying end of a perspective and in his manhood through the other it would be impossible to spy any difference the same airs the same strutt the same cock of his hat and posture of his sword as far as the change of fashions will allow the same understanding the same compass of knowledge with the very same absurdity impudence and impertinence of tongue  he is taught from the nursery that he must inherit a great estate and has no need to mind his book which is a lesson he never forgets to the end of his life his chief solace is to steal down and play at spanfarthing with the page or young blackamoor or little favorite footboy one of which is his principal confident and bosomfriend  there is one young lord in this town who by an unexampled piece of good fortune was miraculously snatched out of the gulf of ignorance confined to a public school for a due term of years well whipped when he deserved it clad no better than his comrades and always their playfellow on the same foot had no precedence in the school but what was given him by his merit and lost it whenever he was negligent it is well known how many mutinies were bred at this unprecedented treatment what complaints among his relations and other great ones of both sexes that his stockings with silver clocks were ravished from him that he wore his own hair that his dress was undistinguished that he was not fit to appear at a ball or assembly nor suffered to go to either and it was with the utmost difficulty that he became qualified for his present removal where he may probably be farther persecuted and possibly with success if the firmness of a very worthy governor and his own good dispositions will not preserve him i confess i cannot but wish he may go on in the way he began because i have a curiosity to know by so singular an experiment whether truth honor justice temperance courage and good sense acquired by a school and college education may not produce a very tolerable lad although he should happen to fail in one or two of those accomplishments which in the general vogue are held so important to the finishing of a gentleman  it is true i have known an academical education to have been exploded in public assemblies and have heard more than one or two persons of high rank declare they could learn nothing more at oxford and cambridge than to drink ale and smoke tobacco wherein i firmly believed them and could have added some hundred examples from my own observation in one of those universities but they all were of young heirs sent thither only for form either from schools where they were not suffered by their careful parents to stay above three months in the year or from under the management of french familytutors who yet often attended them to their college to prevent all possibility of their improvement but i never yet knew any one person of quality who followed his studies at the university and carried away his just proportion of learning that was not ready upon all occasions to celebrate and defend that course of education and to prove a patron of learned men  there is one circumstance in a learned education which ought to have much weight even with those who have no learning at all the books read at school and colleges are full of incitements to virtue and discouragements from vice drawn from the wisest reasons the strongest motives and the most influencing examples thus young minds are filled early with an inclination to good and an abhorrence of evil both which increase in them according to the advances they make in literature and although they may be and too often are drawn by the temptations of youth and the opportunities of a large fortune into some irregularities when they come forward into the great world it is ever with reluctance and compunction of mind because their bias to virtue still continues they may stray sometimes out of infirmity or compliance but they will soon return to the right road and keep it always in view i speak only of those excesses which are too much the attendants of youth and warmer blood for as to the points of honor truth justice and other noble gifts of the mind wherein the temperature of the body has no concern they are seldom or ever known to be mild  i have engaged my self very unwarily in too copious a subject for so short a paper the present scope i would aim at is to prove that some proportion of human knowledge appears requisite to those who by their birth or fortune are called to the making of laws and in a subordinate way to the execution of them and that such knowledge is not to be obtained without a miracle under the frequent corrupt and sottish methods of educating those who are born to wealth or titles for i would have it remembered that i do by no means confine these remarks to young persons of noble birth the same errors running through all families where there is wealth enough to afford that their sons at least the eldest may be good for nothing why should my son be a scholar when it is not intended that he should live by his learning by this rule if what is commonly said be true that money answers all things why should my son be honest temperate just or charitable since he has no intention to depend upon any of these qualities for a maintenance  when all is done perhaps upon the whole the matter is not so bad as i would make it and god who works good out of evil acting only by the ordinary cause and rule of nature permits this continual circulation of human things for his own unsearchable ends the father grows rich by avarice injustice oppression he is a tyrant in the neighborhood over slaves and beggars whom he calls his tenants why should he desire to have qualities infused into his son which himself never possessed or knew or found the want of in the acquisition of his wealth the son bred in sloth and idleness becomes a spendthrift a cully a profligate and goes out of the world a beggar as his father came in thus the former is punished for his own sins as well as for those of the latter the dunghill having raised a huge mushroom of short duration is now spread to enrich other mens lands it is indeed of worse consequence where noble families are gone to decay because their titles and privileges outlive their estates and politicians tell us that nothing is more dangerous to the public than a numerous nobility without merit or fortune but even here god has likewise prescribed some remedy in the order of nature so many great families coming to an end by the sloth luxury and abandoned lusts which enervated their breed through every succession producing gradually a more effeminate race wholly unfit for propagation  a letter to the intelligencer sir it may appear to you perhaps a thing very unnatural to receive a complaint from a son against his father but the treatment which i meet with from mine is of such a nature that it is impossible for me not to complain  you must know there are three brethren of us george patrick and andrew i am the second but the last in affection with my father for which i call heaven and earth to witness i never committed any fault to incur his displeasure or to deserve his neglect but so it is that the best of men have often times been misled in the choice of their minions and very undiscerning in conferring their favors where they ought  if parents could but once bring themselves to be impartial it would beyond all doubt produce a delighful union in their children and be the most binding cement that could be thought of to preserve their affections because an equal dispensation of favors would entirely remove all cause of murmuring repining or envy and what is of the greatest consequence would secure the love and esteem of their children whereas a partial behavior in parents must necessarily produce the contrary  but to state my case in the best manner i can and with an unbiassed regard to truth i think it first necessary to give you our characters with an account of my fathers behavior that you may be the better able to give me your advice  first then to begin with my brother george he was ever a great lover of his belly and formerly used to cram himself with beef pudding and whitepot but for some time past he has taken more delight in new fangled tossups and french keckshaws this high feeding does naturally dispose him to be haughty stubborn choleric and rebellious insomuch that besides his insults toward others he is ready upon all occasions to fly in his owm fathers face and apt to despise every body but himself  he is so various in his opinions that he is of as many religions as there are and have been sects since the beginning of christianity but the true and reformed church as by law established is what he chiefly frequents he was once a great admirer of ancient learning but he has long since quitted this for the reading of newspapers pamphlets and modern languages in his younger years he was fond of manly exercises such as fencing leaping boxing pitching the bar wrestling hurling football hunting etc but of late he has fallen into a strange and unaccountable effeminacy and seems to take delight in nothing but masquerades plays and italian operas he is very fond of italian magnificent buildings although entirely inconsistent with our climate extravagant in the highest degree in purchasing fine paintings and statues and no less expensive in vast extensive parks and gardens by which means he has almost run out all his fortune  my younger brother andrew who has cunning enough to outwit the devil joined with brother george some years ago and they manage so dexterously together that whatever they say is a law with my father however they are not without their quarrels now and then but brother andrew still comes by the worst although he is cautious enough to go always armed for brother george wears a longer sword brother andrew is not very nice in his food but loves fine clothes this i suppose he has learned abroad for he is a great traveller his chief studies are mathematics and the civillaw in both which he has made a considerable progress as for his religion although he openly professes himself a most rigid fanatic of the kirk yet he is shrewdly suspected to have a hankering after popery he has one eminent bad quality which is that he cannot easily forgive and forget i remember i was once so unfortunate as to tell a fair lady a mistress of mine before his face that i would stand by her against him and all her other adversaries which he took heinously ill and has not forgiven me to this hour but lies upon the watch to do me all the ill offices he can  i come now to my own character in which i shall not conceal nor gloss over my vices errors or failings but at the same time i shall not think it inconsistent with modesty to tell you my virtues  i have but a small fortune can hardly keep soul and body together yet out of a regard to my family which is very ancient i love to make what they call a figure upon extraordinary occasions and now and then i furnish my table with victuals and liquors of the best kinds which makes my father and brother george think i have got the world in a string i am kind and hospitable to strangers although they frequently rob my house and turn my children to lie in the barn  i am so fond of learning that i put them to the best school in the kingdom and i plainly see they will be only the wiser but never the richer for it because my father uses all his interest for brother georges sons and the greatest dunce among them shall be better provided for than the most ingenious of mine and i must say i have some who are equal in learning to the best of his i had a design once to follow merchandise that i might the better be able to provide for my poor children but brother george having a mind to make a monopoly prevailed upon my father to join against me and so at last they contrived it that i should sell nothing but a few of my cattle and some linen cloth which is all the support i have whereas brother george can sell every thing he has all the world over and so cruel is he to me that he will not let me have even a bit of his dirt if he thinks it will be of any advantage to me my religion is of three sorts the established popish and presbyterian but i have a greater share of the first in me i think it is best because it encourages obedience to my father more than either of the other two it is not long since brother george and andrew were in a confederacy against my father with an intent to turn him out of his house and give another the possession at which critical juncture i mustered up a great number of my sons and servants to his assistance and for ought i know saved both his life and fortune  soon after this i had like to have been ruined by a project for one of my brother georges family endeavored to persuade my father that gold and silver were of no use to me and desired leave to furnish me with a few counters in lieu thereof and i fear i should have been so weak as to accept of them had it not been for the seasonable remonstrances made by some of my own house  these are a few of the many hardships i have suffered notwithstanding all which i am willing to continue in passive obedience to my dear father for i have reason to believe that his unkindness to me is owing to ill advisers who have prejudiced him against me and my children but i hope before long he will be able to distinguish his most faithful son in the mean time i do humbly entreat the favor of you to write a letter to my father which he may see in print for i fear all my letters to him hitherto have been intercepted  patrick   sir you have not told me your fathers name nor his quality and therefore i am at a loss in what manner i should address him but in common humanity because i think your case deplorable i will give you what comfort i am able together with my best advice  you are not the only instance of suffering innocence and therefore it ought not surprze you that providence for reasons unaccountable to us has laid two great trials in your way oppression from your brethren and unkindness from your father this too without any fault on your side if you did not meet with these afflictions you would want an opportunity of showing your humility and resignation as i understand you do not by your letter  let me advise you to consider that your condition is not quite so lamentable as that of joseph who triumphed in gods own time over all his misfortunes and sufferings and at last had the pleasure of doing good even to his persecutors but indeed there is this difference that his grievance was chiefly from his brethren for had his father joined in the cruelty the wounds would have pierced nearer to his heart  i do not in the least doubt but there are some about your father who do you ill offices i hope some time or other they will be detected you may find a convenient opportunity of getting fairly at him state your case and expostulate with him concerning your own and your childrens sufferings when he hears your story and beholds your sincerity you may be sure of his compassion and a redress for there is no heart so hard as not to sympathize with real woe no advocate so powerful as innocence in the mean time let me conjure you not to turn aside to the right or to the left from that indispensable duty which the express laws of god enjoin you for let me assure you that ingratitude to a parent is no less than rebellion like the sin of witchcraft  i commit you to his care and direction who is best able to govern the unruly affections of men to turn the hearts of the malicious and to relieve and support those who suffer for the sake of righteousness  i am your faithful friend the intelligencer   a second letter to the intelligencer quantum stagna tagi rudibus stillantia venis effluxere decus quanto pretiosa metallo hermi ripa micat quantas per lidia culta despumat rutilas dives pactolus arenas claudian mr intelligencer having lately with great candor and impartiality perused some of your papers upon the distress and poverty of this island which you take care to describe in the most pathetick manner you must forgive me if i differ from you and think it one of the most flourishing and wealthy kingdoms in the whole world and to support my opinion i will venture to affirm that there never was such affluence in ready cash as at this present juncture for have we not more bankers than ever were known among us and whether the money circulates in specie or paper it is the same thing to us since those who would rather have cash than paper can as is well known have their choice whenever they please it is to be presumed that no banker gives a note before the money is first laid down on his counter then of consequence there is as much money as there is paper and that we have a great deal of paper is most certain therefore a great deal of money but i will proceed farther and prove that we have much more money than paper because there are multitudes who keep their own money this appears from the great number of iron chests imported from holland within these last seven years for what use can they be of but to lodge money they are at least two hundred we will suppose that these one with another may contain two thousand pounds a piece then the sum total amounts to four hundred thousand pounds which is so much superfluous and unnecessary cash  if this island were not very wealthy it is strongly to be presumed that so many wise and able heads men of great learning and superior talents whose reputations reached us from distant regions long before they came among us so well distinguished in their own countries for their great knowledge in their several professions and here more especially remarkable for their speaking in public and their profound skill in religion politics and law i say that men of such accomplishments would never quit their own native soil where so many estates are daily made if they were not sure that this island must on account of its greater wealth afford them opportunities of making larger acquisitions than they could at home  have not almost all the gentlemen through this kingdom for some years past declined all profitable employments and left them to be filled by others can there be a stronger argument of their wealth than their choosing to live at their ease out of office rather than be at the small trouble which attends the discharge of a beneficial employment  could so many estated gentlemen through the north of ireland afford to keep so much of their lands waste and untenanted if they had not money enough by them to live without tenants and would not the tenants likewise be glad to take this waste land to plow and sow but that they have ready money enough to buy bread corn and other necessaries from all the world beside  as another signal mark of our riches there is scarce a gentleman who does not educate his sons at our university  which as the world sees wants not its due encouragement where they live at vast expenses take degrees return to their fathers who without ever troubling law or gospel maintain them afterward at home like gentlemen  do not many of our nobility through wantonness and superfluity reside constantly in another kingdom where it is well known they make a better figure as to houses coaches and equipages than their neighbors and do not our young peers and gentry who go thither to see the world game race drink etc beyond any in great britain of the same age and quality which they could not possibly do if their agents here had not an undrainable fund to supply them for as the philosopher says nemo dat quod non habet or as the juglar very elegantly expresses it where nothing is there nothing can come out  if it be true i know it is confidently reported that a great number of english robbers are come over that likewise is a very strong argument of our wealth for they would never quit the english streets and roads for ours unless they were sure to find an advantage by the change it is most certain we never had such a number of robbers as at this very juncture from whence we may conclude that they could not possibly multiply thus if they did not find houses and people enough to rob for all professions and trades increase according to the encouragement they meet with  are not whole streets adding every day to our metropolis when one would think it large enough already some entire streets and many houses i must confess are waste and uninhabited but does not this show the wealth and wantonness of the inhabitants who not content with their present dwellings change them for others more costly and expensive  do not great numbers of our inhabitants daily go off to america will any man say this can be done with empty pockets can any man think otherwise but that it must be the effect of vast superfluity when people wantonly take such long voyages and journeys to go where they have no business  the last argument i shall offer for the wealth of this kingdom is the great number of beggars in which it abounds for it is a common observation that riches are the parent of idleness sloth and luxury and are not these naturally productive of want and beggary  i could offer many more arguments but that i hope you and your countrymen are sufficiently convinced by what i have said that ireland is a place of great wealth affluence and plenty therefore let me advise you the next time you put pen to paper not to dress up hibernia in rags and dirt but cloth her in scarlet and fine linen for she can very well afford them draw the god of riches hovering over your island shaking ten thousand of golden feathers from his wings much more than the inhabitants can gather and thus will your countrymen who have retrenched upon your last groundless alarm return to their former hospitality and we shall see halcyon that is irish days once more  a true and faithful narrative of what passed in london during the general consternation of all ranks and degrees of mankind on tuesday wednesday thursday and friday last on tuesday the   th of october mr whiston held his lecture near the royal exchange to an audience of fourteen worthy citizens his subscribers and constant hearers besides these there were five chance auditors for that night only who had paid their shillings apeice i think my self obliged to be very particular in this relation lest my veracity should be suspected which makes me appeal to the men who were present of which number i my self was one their names are henry watson haberdasher george hancock druggist john lewis drysalter william jones cornchandler henry theobald watchmaker james peters draper thomas floyer silversmith john wells brewer samuel greg soapboyler william cooley fishmonger james harper hosier robert tucker stationer george ford ironmonger daniel lynch apothecary apprentices william bennet david summers charles lock leonard daval henry croft    mr whiston began by acquainting us that contrary to his advertisement he thought himfelf in duty and conscience obliged to change the subject matter of his intended discourse  here he paused and seemed for a short space as it were lost in devotion and mental prayer after which with great earnestness and vehemence he spoke as follows  friends and fellow citizens all speculative science is at an end the period of all things is at hand on friday next this world shall be no more put not your confidence in me brethren for to morrow morning five minutes after five the truth will be evident in that instant the comet shall appear of which i have heretofore warned you as ye have heard believe go hence and prepare your wives your families and friends for the universal change  at this solemn and dreadful prediction the whole society appeared in the utmost astonishment but it would be unjust not to remember that mr whiston himself was in so calm a temper as to return a shilling a piece to the youths who had been disappointed of their lecture which i thought from a man of his integrity a convincing proof of his own faith in the prediction  as we thought it a duty in charity to warn all men in two or three hours the news had spread through the city at first indeed our report met with but little credit it being by our greatest dealers in stocks thought only a courtartifice to sink them that some choice favorites might purchase at a lower rate for the south sea that very evening fell five per cent the india eleven and all the other funds in proportion but at the courtend of the town our attestations were entirely disbelievd or turned into ridicule yet nevertheless the news spread every where and was the subject matter of all conversation  that very night as i was credibly informed mr whiston was sent for to a great lady who is very curious in the learned sciences and addicted to all the speculative doubts of the most able philosophers but he was not now to be found and since at other times he has been known not to decline that honor i make no doubt he concealed himself to attend the great business of his soul but whether it was the ladys faith or inquisitiveness that ocasiond her to send is a point i shall not presume to determine as for his being sent for to the secretarys office by a messenger it is now known to be a matter notoriously false and indeed at first it had little credit with me that so zealous and honest a man should be ordered into custody as a seditious preacher who is known to be so well affected to the present happy establishment  twas now i reflected with exceeding trouble and sorrow that i had disused family prayers for above five years and though it has been a custom of late entirely neglected by men of any business or station i determined within myself no longer to omit so reasonable and religious a duty i acquainted my wife with my intentions but two or three neighbors having been engaged to sup with us that night and many hours being unwarily spent at cards i was prevailed upon by her to put it off till the next day she reasoning that it would be time enough to take off the servants from their business which this practice must infallibly occasion for an hour or two every day after the comet had made its appearance  zachary bowen a quaker and my next neighbor had no sooner heard of the prophecy but he made me a visit i informed him of every thing i had heard but found him quite obstinate in his unbelieve for said he be comforted friend thy tidings are impossibilities for were these things to happen they must have been foreseen by some of our brethren this indeed as in all other spiritual cases with this set of people was his only reason against believing me and as he was fully persuaded that the prediction was erroneous he in a very neighbourly manner admonished me against selling my stock at the present low price which he said beyond dispute must have a rise before monday when this unreasonable consternation should be over  but on wednesday morning i believe to the exact calculation of mr whiston the comet appeared for at three minutes aster five by my own watch i saw it he indeed foretold that it would be seen at five minutes after five but as the best watches may be a minute or two too slow i am apt to think his calculation just to a minute  in less than a quarter of an hour all cheapside was crowded with a vast concourse of people and notwithstanding it was so early it is thought that through all that part of the town there was not man woman or child except the sick or infirm left in their beds from my own balcony i am consident i saw several thousands in the street and counted at least seventeen who were upon their knees and seemed in actual devotion eleven of them indeed appeared to be old women of about fourscore the six others were men in an advanced life but as i could guess two of them might be under seventy  it is highly probable that an event of this nature may be passed over by the greater historians of our times as conducing very little or nothing to the unravelling and laying open the deep schemes of politicians and mysteries of state for which reason i thought it might not be unacceptable to record the facts which in the space of three days came to my knowledge either as an eyewitness or from unquestionable authorities nor can i think this narrative will be entirely without its use as it may enable us to form a more just idea of our countrymen in general particularly in regard to their faith religion morals and politics  before wednesday noon the belief was universal that the day of judgment was at hand insomuch that a waterman of my accquaintance told me he counted no less than one hundred and twenty three clergymen who had been ferryd over to lambeth before twelve aclock these it is said went thither to petition that a short prayer might be penned and ordered there being none in the service upon that occasion but as in things of this nature it is necessary that the council be consulted their request was not immediately complied with and this i affirm to be the true and only reason that the churches were not that morning so well attended and is in no ways to be imputed to the fears and consternation of the clergy with which the freethinkers have since very unjustly reproached them  my wife and i went to church where we had not been for many years on a weekday and with a very large congregation were disappointed of the service but what will be scarce credible by the carelessness of a prentice in our absence we had a piece of fine cambric carried off by a shoplifter so little impression was yet made on the minds of those wicked women  i cannot omit the care of a particular director of the bank i hope the worthy and wealthy knight will forgive me that i endeavor to do him justice for it was unquestionably owing to sir g hs sagacity that all the fireoffices were required to have a particular eye upon the bank of england let it be recorded to his praise that in the general hurry this struck him as his nearest and tenderest concern but the next day in the evening after having taken due care of all his books bills and bonds i was informed his mind was wholly turned upon spiritual matters yet ever and anon he could not help expressing his resentment against the tories and jacobites to whom he imputed that sudden run upon the bank which happened on this occasion  a great man whom at this time it may not be prudent to name employed all the wednesday morning to make up such an account as might appear fair in case he should be called upon to produce it on the friday but was forced to desist after having for several hours together attempted it not being able to bring himself to a resolution to trust the many hundred articles of his secret transactions upon paper  another seemed to be very melancholy which his flatterers imputed to his dread of losing his power in a day or two but i rather take it that his chief concern was the terror of being tried in a court that could not be influenced and where a majority of voices could avail him nothing it was observed too that he had few visitors that day this added so much to his mortification that he read through the first chapter of the book of job and wept over it bitterly in short he seemed a true penitent in every thing but in charity to his neighbor no business was that day done in his comptinghouse it is said too that he was advised to restitution but i never heard that he complied with it any farther than in giving half a crown a piece to several crazed and starving creditors who attended in the outward room  three of the maids of honor sent to countermand their birthday clothes two of them burnt all their collections of novels and romances and sent to a booksellers in pall mall to buy each of them a bible and taylors holy living and dying but i must do all of them the justice to acknowledge that they showed a very decent behavior in the drawing room and restrained themselves from those innocent freedoms and little levities so commonly incident to young ladies of their profession so many birthday suits were countermanded the next day that most of the tailors and mantuamakers discharged all their journeymen and women a grave elderly lady of great erudition and modesty who visits these young ladies seemed to be extremely shocked by the apprehensions that she was to appear naked before the whole world and no less so that all mankind was to appear naked before her which might so much divert her thoughts as to incapacitate her to give ready and apt answers to the interrogatories that might be made her the maids of honor who had both modesty and curiosity could not imagine the sight so disagreeable as was represented nay one of them went so far as to say she perfectly longed to see it for it could not be so indecent when every body was to be alike and they had a day or two to prepare themselves to be seen in that condition upon this reflection each of them ordered a bathingtub to be got ready that evening and a lookingglass to be set by it so much are these young ladies both by nature and custom addicted to cleanly appearance  a westcountry gentleman told me he got a churchlease filled up that morning for the same sum which had been refused for three years successively i must impute this merely to accident for i cannot imagine that any divine could take the advantage of his tenant in so unhandsome a manner or that the shortness of the life was in the least his consideration though i have heard the same worthy prelate aspersed and malignd since upon this very account  the term being so near the alarm among the lawyers was inexpressible though some of them i was told were so vain as to promise themselves some advantages in making their defense by being versed in the practice of our earthly courts it is said too that some of the chief pleaders were heard to express great satisfaction that there had been but sew statetryals of late years several attorneys demanded the return of fees that had been given the lawyers but it was answered the fee was undoubtedly charged to their client and that they could not connive at such injustice as to suffer it to be sunk in the attorneys pockets our sage and learned judges had great consolation insomuch as they had not pleaded at the bar for several years the barristers rejoiced in that they were not attorneys and the attorneys felt no less satisfaction that they were not pettifoggers scriveners and other meaner officers of the law  as to the army far be it from me to conceal the truth every soldiers behavior was as undismayed and undaunted as if nothing was to happen i impute not this to their want of faith but to their martial disposition though i cannot help thinking they commonly accompany their commands with more oaths than are requisite of which there was no remarkable diminution this morning on the parade in st jamess park but possibly it was by choice and on consideration that they continued this way of expression not to intimidate the common soldiers or give occasion to suspect that even the fear of damnation could make any impression upon their superior officers a duel was fought the same morning between two colonels not occasioned as was reported because the one was put over the others head that being a point which might at such a juncture have been accommodated by the mediation of friends but as this was upon the account of a lady twas judged it could not be put off at this time above all others but demanded immediate satisfaction i am apt to believe that a young officer who desired his surgeon to defer putting him into a salivation till saturday might make this request out of some opinion he had of the truth of the prophecy for the apprehensions of any danger in the operation could not be his motive the surgeon himself having assured me that he had before undergone three severe operations of the like nature with great resignation and fortitude  there was an order issued that the chaplains of the several regiments should attend their duty but as they were dispersed about in several parts of england it was believed that most of them could not be found or so much as heard of till the great day was over  most of the considerable physicians by their outward demeanor seemed to be unbelievers but at the same time they every where insinuated that there might be a pestilential malignancy in the air occasioned by the comet which might be armed against by proper and timely medicines this caution had but little effect for as the time approached the christian resignation of the people increased and most of them which was never before known had their souls more at heart than their bodies  if the reverend clergy showed more concern than others i charitably impute it to their great charge of souls and what confirmed me in this opinion was that the degrees of apprehension and terror could be distinguished to be greater or less according to their ranks and degrees in the church  the like might be observed in all sorts of ministers though not of the church of england the higher their rank the more was their fear  i speak not of the court for fear of offense and i forbear inserting the names of particular persons to avoid the imputation of slander so that the reader will allow this narrative must be deficient and is therefore desired to accept hereof rather as a sketch than a regular circumstantial history  i was not informed of any persons who showed the least joy except three malefactors who were to be executed the monday following and one old man a constant churchgoer who being at the point of death expressed some satisfaction at the news  on thursday morning there was little or nothing transacted in changealley there were a multitude of sellers but so few buyers that one cannot affirm the stocks bore any certain price except among the jews who this day reaped great profit by their infidelity there were many who called themselves christians who offered to buy for time but as these were people of great distinction i choose not to mention them because in effect it would seem to accuse them both of avarice and infidelity  the run upon the bank is too well known to need a particular relation for it never can be forgotten that no one person whatever except the directors themselves and some of their particular friends and associates could convert a bill all that day into specie all hands being employed to serve them  in the several churches of the city and suburbs there were seven thousand two hundred and forty five who publicly and solemnly declared before the congregation that they took to wife their several kept mistresses which was allowed as valid marriage the priests not having time to pronounce the ceremony in form  at st brides church in fleetstreet mr woolston who writ against the miracles of our savior in the utmost terrors of conscience made a public recantation dr mandevil who had been groundlessly reported formerly to have done the same did it now in good earnest at st jamess gate as did also at the temple church several gentlemen who frequent coffeehouses near the bar so great was the faith and fear of two of them that they dropped dead on the spot but i will not record their names lest i should be thought invidiously to lay an odium on their families and posterity  most of the players who had very little faith before were now desirous of having as much as they could and therefore embraced the roman catholic religion the same thing was observed of some bawds and ladies of pleasure  an irish gentleman out of pure friendship came to make me a visit and advised me to hire a boat for the ensuing day and told me that unless i gave earnest for one immediately he feared it might be too late for his countrymen had secured almost every boat upon the river as judging that in the general conflagration to be upon the water would be the safest place  there were two lords and three commoners who out of a scruple of conscience very hastily threw up their pensions as imagining a pension was only an annual retaining bribe all the other great pensioners i was told had their scruples quieted by a clergyman or two of distinction whom they happily consulted  it was remarkable that several of our very richest tradesmen of the city in common charity gave away shillings and sixpences to the beggars who plied about the church doors and at a particular church in the city a wealthy churchwarden with his own hands distributed fifty twelvepenny loaves to the poor by way of restitution for the many great and costly feasts which he had eaten of at their expense  three great ladies a valet de chamber two lords a customhouse officer five halfpay captains and a baronet all noted gamesters came publicly into a church at westminster and deposited a very considerable sum of money in the ministers hands the parties whom they had defrauded being either out of town or not to be found but so great is the hardness of heart of this fraternity that among either the noble or vulgar gamesters though the profession is so general i did not hear of any other restitution of this sort at the same time i must observe that in comparison of these through all parts of the town the justice and penitence of the highwaymen housebreakers and common pickpockets was very remarkable  the directors of our public companies were in such dreadful apprehensions that one would have thought a parliamentary enquiry was at hand yet so great was their presence of mind that all the thursday morning was taken up in private transfers which by malicious people was thought to be done with design to conceal their effects  i forbear mentioning the private confessions of particular ladies to their husbands for as their children were born in wedlock and of consequence are legitimate it would be an invidious task to record them as bastards and particularly after their several husbands have so charitably forgiven them  the evening and night through the whole town were spent in devotions both public and private the churches for this one day were so crowded by the nobility and gentry that thousands of common people were seen praying in the public streets in short one would have thought the whole town had been really and seriously religious but what was very remarkable all the different persuasions kept by themselves for as each thought the other would be damned not one would join in prayer with the other  at length friday came and the people covered all the streets expecting watching and praying but as the day wore away their fears first began to abate then lessened every hour at night they were almost extinct till the total darkness that hitherto used to terrify now comforted every freethinker and atheist great numbers went together to the taverns bespoke suppers and broke up whole hogsheads for joy the subject of all wit and conversation was to ridicule the prophecy and railly each other all the quality and gentry were perfectly ashamed nay some utterly disowned that they had manifested any signs of religion  but the next day even the common people as well as their betters appeared in their usual state of indifference they drank they whord they swore they lyd they cheated they plundered they gamd they quarreled they murdered in short the world went on in the old channel  i need not give any instances of what will so easily be credited but i cannot omit relating that mr woolston advertised in that very saturdays eveningpost a new treatise against the miracles of our savior and that the few who had given up their pensions the day before solicited to have them continued which as they had not been thrown up upon any ministerial point i am informed was readily granted  the journal of a modern lady it was a most unfriendly part in you who ought to know my heart so well acquainted with my zeal for all the female commonweal how could it come into your mind to pitch on me of all mankind against the sex to write a satyr and brand me for a womanhater on me who think them all so fair they rival venus to a hair their virtues never ceased to sing since first i learned to tune a string methinks i hear the ladies cry will he his character belie must never our misfortunes end and have we lost our only friend ah lovely nymphs remove your fears no more let fall those precious tears

bid him fix  the ladies here to night by six madam the goldsmith waits below he says his business is to know if you will redeem the silver cup you pawned to him  first show him up your dressingplate he will be content to take for interest cent per cent and madam there is my lady spade has sent this letter by her maid  well i remember what she won  and has she sent so soon to dun  here carry down

wish ye may but have enough and while with all this paultry stuff she sits tormenting every guest nor gives her tongue one moments rest in phrases battered stale and trite which modern ladies call polite you see the booby husband sit in admiration at her wit but let me now a while survey our madam over her evening tea surrounded with her noisy clans of prudes coquets and harridans when frighted

know when instead of five you scord me ten spadillo here has got a mark a child may know it in the dark i guess the hand it seldom fails i wish some folks would pare their nails while thus they rail and scold and storm it passes but for common form most conscious that they all speak true and give each other but their due it never interrupts the game or makes em sensible of shame the time too precious now to waste and supper gobbled up in haste again afresh to cards they run as if they had but just begun yet shall i not again repeat how often they squabble snarl and cheat at last they hear the watchman knock a frosty morn  past four aclock the chairmen are not to be found  come let us play the the other round now all in hastle they huddle on their hoods their cloaks and get them gone but first the winner must invite the company tomorrow night unlucky madam left in tears who now again quadrill forswears with empty purse and aching head steals to her sleeping spouse to bed the country life thalia tell in sober lays how george nim dan dean pass their days begin my muse first from our bowers we issue forth at difsrent hours at seven the dean in nightgown dressed goes round the house to wake the rest at nine grave nim and george facetious go to the dean to read lucretius at ten my lady comes and hectors and kisses george and ends our lectures and when she has him by the neck fast hauls him and scolds us down to break fast we squander there an hour or more and then all hands boys to the oar all heteroctil dan except who neither time nor order kept but by peculiar whimsies drawn peeps in the ponds to look for spawn oersees the work or dragon my lords boat rows or spoils a text or mends his hose or  but proceed we in our journal  at two or after we return all from the four elements assembling warned by the bell all folks come trembling from airy garrets some descend some from the lakes remotest end my lord and dean the fire forsake dan leaves the earthly spade and rake the loitrers quake no corner hides them and lady betty soundly chides them now waters brought and dinners done with church and king the ladys gone not reckoning half an hour we pass in talking over a moderate glass dan growing drowsy like a thief steals off to dose away his beef and this must pass for reading hammond  while george and dean go to backgammon george nim and dean set out at four and then again boys to the oar but when the sun goes to the deep not to disturb him in his sleep or make a rumbling over his head his candle out and he abed we watch his motions to a minute and leave the flood when he goes in it now stinted in the shortning day we go to prayers and then to play till supper comes and after that we sit an hour to drink and chat it is late  the old and younger pairs by the footman adam lighted walk up stairs the weary dean goes to his chamber and nim and dan to garret clamber so when the circle we have run the curtain falls and we have done i might have mentioned several facts like episodes between the acts and tell who loses and who wins who gets a cold who breaks his shins how dan caught nothing in his net and how the boat was overset for brevity i have retrenched how in the lake the dean was drenched it would be an exploit to brag on how valiant george rode over the dragon how steady in the stern he sat and saved his oar but lost his hat how nim no hunter ever could match him still brings us hares when he can catch em how skilfully dan mends his nets how fortune fails him when he sets or how the dean delights to vex the ladies or lampoon the sex or how our neighbor lifts his nose to tell what every schoolboy knows then with his finger on his thumb explaining strikes opposures dumb or how his wife that female pedant but now there need no more be said on it shows all her secrets of housekeeping for candles how she trucks her dripping was forced to send three miles for yest to brew her ale and raise her paste tells every thing that you can think of how she cured tommy of the chincough what gave her brats and pigs the meazles and how her doves were killed by wheezles how jowler howled and what a fright she had with dreams the other night but now since i have gone so far on a word or two of lord chief baron and tell how little weight he sets on all whig papers and gazetts but for the politics of pue a newswriter  thinks every syllable is true and since he owns the king of sweden is dead at last without evading now all his hopes are in the czar  why muscovy is not so sar  down the black sea and up the streights and in a month he is at your gates  perhaps from what the packet brings  by christmas we shall see strange things why should i tell of ponds and drains what carps we met with for our pains of sparrows tamed and nuts innumerable to choke the girls and to consumearabble but you who are a scholar know how transient are all things below how prone to change is humane life last night arrived clem and his wife  this grand event half broke our measures their reign began with cruel seizures the dean must with his quilt supply the bed in which these tyrants lie nim lost his whig block dan his jordan my lady says she cannot afford one george is half scared out of his wits for clem gets all the dainty bits henceforth expect a different survey this house will soon turn topsyturvy they talk of further alterations which causes many speculations on cutting down the old thorn at market hill at market hill as well appears by chronicle of ancient date there stood for many a hundred years a spacious thorn before the gate hither came every village maid and on the boughs her garland hung and here beneath the spreading shade secure from satyrs sat and sung sir archibald acheson secretary of state for scotland sir archibald that valrous knight the lord of all the fruitful plain would come and listen with delight for he was fond of rural strain sir archibald whose favorite name shall stand for ages on record by scottish bards of highest fame drummond of hawthorden and sir william alexander e of sterling both famous for their poetry who were friends to sir archibald wise hawthorden and sterlines lord but time with iron teeth i ween has cankered all its branches round no fruit or blossom to be seen its head reclining toward the ground this aged sickly sapless thorn which must alas no longer stand behold the cruel dean in scorn cuts down with sacreligious hand dame nature when she saw the blow astonished gave a dreadful shriek and mother tellus trembled so she scarce recovered in a week the silvan powers with fear perplexed in prudence and compassion sent for none could tell whose turn was next sad omens of the dire event the magpye lighting on the stock stood chattring with incessant din and with her beak gave many a knock to rouse and warn the nymph within the owl foresaw in pensive mood the ruin of her ancient seat and fled in haste with all her brood to seek a more secure retreat last trolled forth a gentle swine to ease her itch against the stump and dismally was heard to whine all as she scrubbd her meazly rump the nymph who dwells in every tree if all be true that poets chant condemned by fates supreme decree must die with her expiring plant thus when the gentle spina found the thorn committed to her care receive its last and deadly wound she fled and vanished into air but from the root a dismal groan first issuing struck the murdrers ears and in a shrill revengeful tone this prophecy he trembling hears  thou chief contriver of my fall  relentless dean to mischief born  my kindred often thine hide shall gall  thy gown and cassock often be torn  and thy consedrate dame who brags  that she condemned me to the fire  shall rent her petticoats to rags  and wound her legs with every bryr  nor thou lord sir arthur acheson arthur shall escape  to thee i often called in vain  against that assassin in crape  yet thou could tamely see me slain  nor when i felt the dreadful blow  or chid the dean or pinched thy spouse  since you could see me treated so  an old retainer to your house  may that fell dean by whose command  was formed this machivillian plot  not leave a thistle on the land  then who will own thee for a scot  pigs and fanatics cows and teagues  through all thy empire i forsee  to tear thy hedges join in leagues  sworn to revenge my thorn and me  and thou the wretch ordained by fate  neal gabagan hibernian clown  with hatchet blunter than thy pate  to hack my hallowed timber down  when thou suspended high in air  dyst on a more ignoble tree  for thou shall steal thy landlords mare  then bloody caitiff think on me a pastoral dialogue dermot sheelah a nymph and swain sheelah and dermot hight who wont to weed the court of gosford knight while each with stubbed knife removed the roots that raised between the stones their daily shoots as at their work they sat in counterview with mutual beauty smit their passion grew sing heavenly muse in sweetly flowing strain the soft endearments of the nymph and swain  dermot my love to sheelah is more firmly fixed than strongest weeds that grow these stones betwixt my spud these nettles from the stones can part no knife so keen to weed thee from my heart  sheelah my love for gentle dermot faster grows than yon tall dock that rises to thy nose cut down the dock

sowins comes  then let us rise and rest our weary bums  mary the cookmaids letter to dr sheridan well if ever i saw such another man since my mother bound my head you a gentleman marry come up i wonder where you were bred i am sure such words does not become a man of your cloth i would not give such language to a dog faith and troth yes you called my master a knave fie mr sheridan it is a shame for a parson who should know better things to come out with such a name knave in your teeth mr sheridan it is both a shame and a sin and the dean my master is an honester man than you and all your kin he has more goodness in his little finger than you have in your whole body my master is a parsonable man and not a spindleshankd hoddy doddy and now whereby i find you would fain make an excuse because my master one day in anger called you goose which and i am sure i have been his servant four years since october and he never called me worse than sweetheart drunk or sober not that i know his reverence was ever concerned to my knowledge though you and your comerogues keep him out so late in your college you say you will eat grass on his grave a christian eat grass whereby you now confess your self to be a goose or on ass but that is as much as to say that my master should die before ye well well that is as god pleases and i dont believe that is a true story and so say i told you so and you may go tell my master what care i and i dont care who knows it it is all one to mary every body knows that i love to tell truth and shame the devil i am but a poor servant but i think gentlefolks should be civil besides you found fault with our vittles one day that you was here i remember it was on a tuesday of all days in the year and saunders the man says you are always jesting and mocking mary said he one day as i was mending my masters stocking my master is so fond of that minister that keeps the school i thought my master a wise man but that man makes him a fool saunders said i i would rather than a quart of ale he would come into our kitchen and i would pin a dishclout to his tail and now i must go and get saunders to direct this letter for i write but a sad scrawl but my sister marget she writes better well but i must run and make the bed before my master comes from prayers and see now it strikes ten and i hear him coming up stairs whereof i could say more to your verses if i could write written hand and so i remain in a civil way your servant to command a dialogue between mad mullinix and timothy m i own it is not my bread and butter but prithee tim why all this clutter why ever in these raging fits damning to hell the jacobites when if you search the kingdom round there is hardly twenty to be found no not among the priests and friars  t twixt you and me g damn the liars  m the tories are gone every man over to our illustrious house of hanover from all their conduct this is plain and then   t g damn the liars again did not an earl but lately vote to bring in i could cut his throat our whole accounts of public debts  m lord how this frothy coxcomb frets aside t did not an able statesmanb this dangerous horrid motion dishup as popish craft did he not rail on it show fire and faggot in the tail on it proving the earl a grand offender and in a plot for the pretender whose fleet it is all our friends opinion was then embarking at avignon these brangling jars of whig and tory are stale and worn as troytown story the wrong it is certain you were both in and now you find you fought for nothing your faction when their game was new might want such noisy fools as you but you when all the show is past resolve to stand it out the last like martin marral gaping on not minding when the song is done when all the bees are gone to settle you clatter still your brazen kettle the leaders whom you listed under have dropped their arms and seized the plunder and when the war is past you come to rattle in their ears your drum and as that hateful hideous grecian thersites he was your relation was more abhorred and scorned by those with whom he served than by his foes so thou art grown the detestation of all thy party through the nation thy peevish and perpetual teazing with plots and jacobites and treason thy busy nevermeaning face thy screwdup front thy state grimace thy formal nods important sneers thy whisprings foisted in all ears which are whatever you may think but nonsese wrapped up in a stink have made thy presence in a true sense to thy own side so damned a nuisance that when they have you in their eye as if the devil drove they fly  t my good friend mullinix sorbear i vow to g youre too severe if it could ever yet be known i took advice except my own it should be yours but d my blood i must pursue the public good the faction is it not notorious keck at the memory of glorious it is true nor need i to be told my quondam friends are grown so cold that scarce a creature can be found to prance with me his statue round the public safety i foresee henceforth depends alone on me and while this vital breath i blow or from above or from below i will sputter swagger curse and rail the tories terror scourge and flail  m tim you mistake the matter quite the tories you are their delight and should you act a differens part be grave and wise  twould break their heart why tim you have a taste i know and often see a puppetshow observe the audience is in pain while punch is hid behind the scene but when they hear his rusty voice with what impatience they rejoice and then they value not two straws how solomon decides the cause which the true mother which pretender nor listen to the witch of endor should faustus with the devil behind him enter the stage they never mind him if punch to spur their fancy shows in at the door his monstrous nose then sudden draws it back again o what a pleasure mixed with pain you every moment think an age till he appears upon the stage and first his bum you see him clap upon the queen of shebas lap the duke of lorrain drew his sword punch roaring ran and running roared reviled all people in his jargon and sold the king of spain a bargain st george himself he plays the wag on and mounts astride upon the dragon he gets a thousand thumps and kicks yet cannot leave his roguish tricks in every action thrusts his nose the reason why no mortal knows in doleful scenes that break our heart punch comes like you and lets a ft there is not a puppet made of wood but what would hang him if they could while teizing all by all he is teased how well are the spectators pleased who in the motion have no share but purely come to hear and stare have no concern for sabras sake which gets the better saint or snake provided punch for there is the jest be foundly mawld and plague the rest thus tim philosophers suppose the world consists of puppetshows where petulant conceited fellows perform the part of punchinelloes so at this booth which we call dublin tim you are the punch to stir up trouble in you wriggle fidge and make a rout put all your brother puppets out run on in a perpetual round to teaze perplex disturb confound intrude with monkey grin and clatter to interrupt all serious matter are grown the nuisance of your clan who hate and scorn you to a man but then the lookerson the tories you still divert with merry stories they would consent that all the crew were hanged before they would part with you but tell me tim upon the spot by all this coyl what have thou got if tories must have all the sport i fear you will be disgraced at court  t got d my blood i frank my letters walk by my place before my betters and simple as i now stand here expect in time to be a p got d me why i got my will never hold my peace and never stand still i ft with twenty ladies by they call me beast and what care i i bravely call the tories jacks and sons of whores  behind their backs but could you bring me once to think that when i strut and stare and stink revile and slander fume and storm betray make oath impeach inform with such a constant loyal zeal to serve my self and commonweal and fret the tories souls to death i did but lose my precious breath and when i damn my soul to plague em am as you tell me but their may game consume my vitals they shall know i am not to be treated so i would rather hang my self by half than give those rascals cause to laugh but how my friend can i endure once so renowned to live obscure no little boys and girls to cry there is nimble tim a passing by no more my dear delightful way tread of keeping up a partyhatred will none the tory dogs pursue when through the streets i cry hallooe must all my dmees bloods and wounds pass only now for empty sounds shall tory rascals be elected although i swear them disaffected and when i roar a plot a plot will our own party mind me not so qualified to swear and lie will they not trust me for a spy dear mullinix your good advice i beg you see the case is nice o were i equal in renown like thee to please this thankless town or blessed with such engaging parts to win the truant schoolboys hearts thy virtues meet their just reward attended by the sable guard charmed by thy

latin too that you may see how much improved by dr  i have a coat at home that youmaytry it is just like this which hangs by geometry my hat has much the nicer air your block will fit it to a hair

be studious well to imitate my portly motion mein and gate mark my address and learn my style when to look scornful when to smile nor sputter out your oaths so fast but keep your swearing to the last then at your leisure well be witty and in the streets divert the city the ladies from the windows gaping the children all our motions aping your conversation to refine i will take you to some friends of mine choice spirits who employ their parts to mend the world by useful arts some cleansing hollow tubes to spy direct the zenith of the sky some have the city in their care from noxious steams to purge the air some teach us in these dangerous days how to walk upright in our ways some whose reforming hands engage to lash the lewdness of the age some for the public service go perpetual envoys to and fro whose able heads support the weight of twenty mrs of state we scorn for want of talk to jabber of parties over our bonnyclabber nor are we studious to enquire who votes for manours who for hire our care is to improve the mind with what concerns all human kind the various scenes of mortal life who beats her husband who his wife or how the bully at a stroke knocked down the boy the lanthorn broke one tells the rise of cheese and oatmeal another when he got a hot meal one gives advice in proverbs old instructs us how to tame a scold or how by almanacks it is clear that herrings

one that bears the name of savil and of boil alas one bad example shown how quickly all the sex pursue see madam see the arts overthrown between john overton and you on a certain lady at court i know the thing that is most uncommon envy be silent and attend i know a reasonable woman handsome and witty yet a friend not warped by passion awed by rumor not grave through pride or gay through folly an equal mixture of good humor and sensible soft melancholy  has she no faults then envy says sir yes she has one i must aver when all the world conspires to praise her the womans deaf and does not hear a soldier and a scholar or a ladys judgment on those two characters thus spoke to my lady the knight full of care let me have your advice in a weighty affair this hamiltons bawn while it sticks on my hand i lose by the house what i get by the land but how to dispose of it to the best bidder for a barrack or malthouse we now must consider first let me suppose i make it a malthouse here i have computed the profit will fall tus there is nine hundred pounds for labor and grain i increase it to twelve so three hundred remain a handsome addition for wine and good cheer three dishes a day and ten hogsheads a year with a dozen large vessels my vaules shall be stored no little scrub joint shall ever come on my board and you and the dean no more shall combine to stint me at night to one bottle of wine nor shall i for his humors permit you to purloin a stone and a half of good beef from my surloin if i make it a barrack the crown is my tenant my dear i have pondered again and again on it in poundage and drawback i lose half my rent whatever they give me i must be content or join with the court in every debate and rather than that i would lose my estate thus ended the knight thus began the meek wife it must and it shall be a barrack my life i am grown a mere mopus no company comes but a rabble of tenants and rusty dull rums with parsons what lady can keep her self clean i am all over daubed when i sit by the dean of st patricks dean but if you will give us a barrack my dear the captain i am sure will always come here i then shall not value his deanship a straw for the captain i will warrant will keep him in awe or should he pretend to be brisk and alert well tell him that chaplains should not be so pert that men of his coat should be minding their prayers and not among ladies to give themselves airs thus argued my lady but argued in vain the knight his opinion resolved to maintain but hannah who listened to all that was past and could not endure so vulgar a taste as soon as her ladyship called to be dressed cried madam why surely my masters possessed sir arthur the malster how fine it would sound i would rather the bawn were funk under ground but madam i guessed there would never come good when i saw him so often with sir a as receiver and one of his tenants darby and wood and now my dreams out for i was adreamd that i saw a huge rat o dear how i screamd and after methought i lost my new shoes and molly she said i should hear some ill news dear madam had you but the spirit to teaze you might have a barrack whenever you please and madam i always believed you so stout that for twenty denials you would not give out if i had a husband like him i protest till he gave me my will i would give him no rest and rather than come in the same pair of sheets with such a cross man i would lie in the streets but madam i beg you will contrive and invent and worry him out till he gives his consent dear madam whenever on a barrack i think an i were to be hanged i cannot sleep a wink for if a new crotchet comes into my brain i cannot get it out though i would never so fain i fancy already a barrack contrived at hamiltons bawn and the troop is arrived of this to be sure sir arthur has warning and waits on the captain betimes in the morning now see when they meet how their honors behave  noble captain your servant  sir arthur your slave you honor me much  the honor is mine twas a sad rainy night  but the morning is fine pray how does my lady  my wifes at your service i think i have seen her picture at jervais good morrow good captain  i will wait on you down you shall not stir a foot  you will think me a clown for all the world captain not half an inch farther  you must be obeyed your servant sir arthur my humble respects to my lady unknown  i hope you will use my house as your own  go bring me my smock and leave off your prate  thou have certainly gotten a cup in thy pate pray madam be quiet what was it i said you had like to have put it quite out of my head next day to be sure the captain will come at the head of his troop with his trumpet and drum now madam observe how he marches in state the man with the kettledrum enters the gate dub dub a dub dub the trumpeters follow tantara tantara while all the boys halloo see now comes the captain all daubed with gold lace o law the sweet gentleman look in his face and see how he rides like a lord of the land and the fine flamingsword he holds in his hand and his horse the dear creature it prances and rears with ribbands in knots at his tail and his ears at last comes the troop at the word of command drawn up in our court till the captain cries stand your ladyship lifts up the sash to be seen for sure i had dizend you out like a queen the captain to show he is proud of the favor looks up to the window and cocks up his beaver his beaver is cockt pray madam mind that for a captain of horse never takes off his hat because he has never a hand that is idle for the right holds the sword and the left holds the bridle then he flourishes thrice his sword in the air as a compliment due to a lady so fair how i tremblo to think of the blood it has spilt then he lowers the point then he kisses the hilt your ladyship smiles and thus you begin  pray captain be pleased to alight and walk in the captain salutes you with congee profound and your ladyship curtsies halfway to the ground  kit run for your master and bid him come to us  i am sure he will be proud of the honor you do us  and captain you will do us the favor to stay  and take a short dinner here with us to day  youre heartily welcome but as for good cheer  you are come in the very worst time of the year  had i but expected so worthy a guest  lord madam your ladyship sure is in jest you banter me madam the kingdom must grant   you officers captain are so complaisant  hist hussy i think i hear somebody coming  no madam it is only sir arthur a humming to shorten my tale for i hate a long story the captain at dinner appears in his glory the dr swift dean and the dr jenny doctor have humbled their pride for the captains entreated to sit by your side and because he is their betters you carve for him first the parsons for envy are ready to burst the servants amazed are scarce ever able to keep off their eyes as he sits at the table and molly and i have thrust in our nose to peep at the captain in all his fine clothes dear madam be sure he is a finespoken man do but hear on the clergy how glib his tongue ran  and madam said he if such dinners you give  you will never want parsons as long as you live  i never knew a parson without a good nose  but the devils as welcome wherever he goes  g d me they bid us reform and repent  but zds by their looks they never keep lent  mr curate for all your grave looks i am afraid  you cast a sheeps eye on her ladyships maid  i wish she would lend you her lillywhite hand  in mending your gown and smoothing your band  for the dean was so shabby and looked like a ninny  that the captain supposed he was curate to jenny  whenever you see a cassock and gown  an hundred to one but it covers a clown  observe how a parson comes into a room  g d me he hobbles as bad as my groom  a scholar when just from the college broke loose  can hardly tell how to cry bo to a goose  your novids and bluturks and omers and stuff  by g they dont signify this pinch of snuff  to give a young gentleman right education  the armys the very best school in the nation  my schoolmaster called me a dunce and a fool  but at cuffs i was always the cock of the school  i never could take to my books for the blood of me  and the puppy consest he expected no good of me  now madam you will think it a strange thing to say  but the sight of a book makes me sick to this day never since i was born did i hear so much wit and madam i laughed till i thought i should split so then you looked scornful and sniffd at the dean as who should say now am i skinny and lean but he durst not so much as once open his lips and the doctor was plaguily down in the hips thus merciless hannah run on in her talk till she heard the dean call will your ladyship walk her ladyship answers  i am just coming down then turning to hannah and forcing a frown although it was plain in her heart she was glad oryd hussy why sure the wench is gone mad how could these chimeras get into your brains come hither and take this old gown for your pains but the dean if this secret should get to his ears will never have done with his jibes and his jeers for your life not a word of this matter i charge you give me but a barrack a fig for the clergy to doctor dly on the libels writ against him as some raw youth in country bred to arms by thirst of honor led when at a skirmish first he hears the bullets whistling round his ears will duck his head aside will start and feel a trembling at his heart till scaping often without a wound lessens the terror of the sound fly bullets now as thick as hops he runs into a cannons chops an author thus who pants for fame begins the world with fear and shame when first in print you see him dread each potgun levelled at his head the lead yon criticks quill contains is destined to beat out his brains as if he heard loud thunders roll cries lord have mercy on his soul concluding that another shot will strike him dead upon the spot but when with squibbing flashing popping he cannot see one creature dropping that missing fire or missing aim his life is safe i mean his fame the danger past takes heart of grace and looks a critic in the face though splendour gives the fairest mark to poisoned arrows  the dark yet in seipso totus teres atque rotundus in your self when smooth and round they glance aside without a wound it is said the gods tried all their art how pain they might from pleasure part but little could their strength avail both still are fastned by the tail thus fame and censure with a tether by fate are always linked together why will you aim to be preferred in wit before the common herd and yet grow mortified and vexed to pay the penalty annexed it is eminence makes envy rise as fairest fruits attract the flies should stupid libels grieve your mind you soon a remedy may find lie down obscure like other folks below the lash of snarlers jokes their faction is five hundred odds for every coxcomb lends them rods and sneers as learnedly as they like females over their morning tea you say the muse will not contain and write you must or break a vein then if you find the terms too hard no longer my advice regard but raise your fancy on the wing the irish senates praises sing how jealous of the nations freedom and for corruptions how they weed em how each the public good pursues how far their hearts from private views make all true patriots up to shoeboys huzza their brethren at the blueboys and dread no more the rage of grub you then may soon be of the club how often am i for rhyme to seek to dress a thought i toil a week and then how thankful to the town if all my pains will earn a crown whilst every critic can devour my work and me in half an hour would men of genius cease to write the rogues must die for want of spite must die for want of food and raiment if scandal did not find them payment how cheerfully the hawkers cry a satire and the gentry buy while my hardlabourd poem pines unsold upon the printers lines a genius in the reverend gown must ever keep its owner down it is an unnatural conjunction and spoils the credit of the function round all your brethren cast your eyes point out the surest men to rise that club of candidates in black the least deserving of the pack aspiring factious fierce and loud with grace and learning unendowd will sooner coin a thousand lies than suffer men of parts to rise they crowd about preferments gate and press you down with all their weight for as of old mathematicans were by the vulgar thought magicians so academick dull aledrinkers pronounce all men of wit freethinkers wit as the chief of virtues friends disdains to serve ignoble ends observe what loads of stupid rhimes oppress us in corrupted times what pamphlets in a courts defense show reason grammar truth or sense for though the muse delights in fiction she never inspires against conviction then keep your virtue still unmixt and let not faction come betwixt by party steps no grandeur clime at though it would make you englands primate first learn the science to be dull you then may soon your conscience lull if not however seated high your genius in your face will fly when jove was from his teeming head of wits fair goodness brought to bed there followed at his lyingin for afterbirth a sooterkin which as the nurse pursued to kill attained by flight the muses hill there in the soil began to root and litterd at parnassus foot from hence the critic vermin sprung with harpy claws and poisonous tongue who fatten on poetic scraps too cunuing to be caught in traps dame nature as the learned show provides each animal its foe hounds hunts the hare the wily fox devours your geese the wolf your flocks thus envy pleads a natural claim to persecute the muses fame on poets in all times abusive from homer down to pope inclusive yet what avails it to complain you try to take revenge in vain a rat your utmost rage defies that safe behind the wainscot lies say did you ever know by sight in cheese an individual mite show me the same numerick flea that bit your neck but yesterday you then may boldly go in quest to find the grubstreet poets nest what spunginghouse in dread of jayl receives them while they wait for bayl what ally they are neftled in to flourish over a cup of ginn find the last garrat where they lay or cellar where they starve to day suppose you had them all trepanned with each a libel in his hand what punishment would you inflict or call em rogues or get em kicked these they have often tried before you but oblige em so much more themselves would be the first to tell to make their trash the better sell you have been libeld  let us know what senseless coxcomb told you so will you regard the hawkers cries who in his titles always lies whatever the noisy scoundrel says it might be something in your praise and praise bestowed in grubstreet rhimes would vex one more a thousand times till blockheads blame and judges praise the poet cannot claim his bays on me when dunces are satyrick i take it for a penegyrick hated by fools and fools to hate be that my motto and my fate finis books
