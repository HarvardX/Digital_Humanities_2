 john the shopkeeper etc long has the muse her tale delayed has stopped to talk of johnnys trade wife daughter mother too of john and quite forgot to travel on long has the muse with trembling fear viewed the sad scene that now is near hung back indeed from very fright and shrunk and started at the sight as the tall steed if he should spy some unknown form of danger nigh starts from his path his eye balls glare his feet fly prancing in the air round on the spot and round he wheels upright upon his mere hind heels so have we started at the view of what our john is now to do have gaily friskd it round and round nor gained as you an inch of ground come gentle muse the tale declare sing how this bold adventurous pair with mother brave and willing daughter marched to the borders of the water sing how they trod the beech so steep gazed at the wonders of the deep and stopped to view as in a trance the awful oceans vast expanse then gazed at every passing boat till they quite longed to get on float   the boatmen as they cross the strand spring from an alehouse just at hand all on the party down they burst and each is sure that he was first oh how they press and fill the ground and push and elbow all around each to a lady makes his suit till nancy starts as at a brute while prudent johnny marching down hires a snug boat for half a crown of smaller size but stiff and tight and having seen that all is right rallies his daughter claims his wife bursts through the crowd and ends the strife and now with selfcomplacent grin the favored boatman hands them in but first he plants as is his rule on the waves edge his little stool and while he begs them to take care presents his elbow high in air   all in they stepped all down they sat all safe all even and all lat the boatman pushes off the boat was ever such treasure all afloat and now amid the suns bright gleam see how they cut the silver stream see how the breeze begins to play see how it wafts them far away scarce had the party left the shore when ruffman longs to spare his oar points to the bench where lies a sail and begs to profit by the gale at first the boatmans words appal and all the female faces fall and madam bets ten thousand pound this instant we shall be drowned mean time old ruffman with a sneer forbids each vain and silly fear talks of the seas that he has crossed beaten and blown and tempest tossed tells of his dangers now no more while a green youth in days of yore of feats performed by way of fun and boasts of matches he has won then drops his tone and quite allays all the new fears he seemed to raise pleads his great care asserts his skill begs each dear ladyll dread no ill for if he keeps the rope in hand the waters just as safe as land thus all objections down he beat and now the awful sail is set ah how they plough the whitning seas so fine so glorious is the breeze how fresh and cooling too the air while the sail shades them from the glare the boatman who a while before sat coatless heated at the oar now lolls his ease observes the wind steers with one careful hand behind while his right fist holds hard the sa resists or humors well the gale then halfappearing to turn back at once he stops and makes a tack points at the distant and once more and seems to run you right ashore but ere he lets you quite touch ground again he spins his vessel round and shifts across with skill so nice the fluttering canvas in a trice scuds over the spacious seas again again he plows the mighty main again the lessening shore retires woods hills depart and distant spires while the bright sun yon clouds between shines forth and gilds the glorious scene the party eased of all their fright gaze round and round with sweet delight praise with one voice both land and seas and now they languish for a breeze dread lest the slackning wind should fail and welcome every growing gale swift over the swelling waves they fly and pleasure beams in every eye but ah how often with genial fun while the gay course of life we run and fancy as we taste the treat our human bliss is now complete  how often in that same favored hour does the whole sky begin to lour the cheering sunshines passed away there comes a dreary doleful day afflictions gather like a cloud the swelling tempest roars aloud while from yon threatening heavens so dark it thunders round our little bark unskilled to struggle through the breeze we toss in new and troubled seas and lifes gay morning all so bright ends in some woeful tale at night the end of the third part
