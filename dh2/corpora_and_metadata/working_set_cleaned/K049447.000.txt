observations on the fifth article of the treaty of union humbly offered to the consideration of the parliament relating to foreign ships the matter of difficulty upon this head i take to be as follows  by the article all ships any of whose owners were foreigners at the signing of the treaty shall be deemed still foreign bottoms within the terms of the act of navigation  the reason of this is plain most of the shipping employed on the southeast of scotland are foreign bottoms and severals of them owned by foreigners principally dutch now as england is very careful to encourage her own shipping and as britain will after the union still be so the increase employment and building of ships being one of the principal foundations of her wealth  it would be hard to admit any ships which are foreign built to be free ships in scotland when none that are so in england can be admitted  england freely admits all ships built in scotland to be free in all the ports and trade of britain  nay to go further england allows by the union even dutch ships if bought by scots men and belonging to scots owners to be free which is more than any englishman can be allowed  nay if a foreign built ship lay now at leith road and her owners were all englishmen she would not be deemed a free ship by the union but the english owners would loose the benefit of employing her and the reason of this is to encourage our own shipping on which so much depends and this benefit will be plainly scotlands at last  but the objection here is we have a great many ships in our trade that are foreign built and that are chiefly owned by scotsmen but perhaps may have one or more owners abroad and it would be hard that these scotsmen should lose the benefit of their ships which they employ in the trade of their native country only because they have some dutchmen concerned with them  when at the same time it is plain that if these dutchmen were not concerned the trade of scotland would with great difficulty be carried on  the expedient proposed for this as i meet with it is that a reasonable time should be given for the subjects of scotland to buy out their dutch owners or sell their own interest  or that it should have been said all ships etc whose owners were scotsmen at the end or ratification of the treaty etc since till the treaty is concluded every scotsman has a right to employ any ship whatever  to answer this i crave leave to say that this tho plausible in its self has yet inconveniences of a nature intolerable because by this any man in england as well as in scotland may in the name of scotsmen buy what number of ships in holland they please and at the end of the union they become free ships to the general ruin of the shipping in the whole island  and this was remarkably true to englands prodigious loss when in the last dutch war the ships taken from holland as prize were made free the people bought dutch ships caused sham privateers to take them and for several years some hundereds of them were employed in their coal trade to the ruin of the town of ipswick where all the large coal ships used to be built  which loss that town never recovered  to give a time therefore to have all ships owned by scotsmen come in to be free is to open a door to a mischief which it cannot be desired england should suffer in trade and the value now supposed to be touched here is but very small  all that i can see in this is that a medium be found out which if it must be tho i do not grant that necessity neither is this that at the time of the treaty the major part of such vessel did belong to the subjects of scotland i confess this seems to have some color of reason in it that the majority should denominate the whole and i would hope england would not dispute it since they do not deny any foreigners holding or owning any share of an english vessel but the legitimacy of the vessel consists in her bottom  now if the majority of owners as to the value i mean were not scots no ship can be accounted legitimate if a scots merchant owns of a ship and a dutchman she cannot be accounted in reason any thing but a dutch ship especially when her bottom is dutch too for the denomination must go with the major and it is not the dutch merchant is a part owner of the scotsmans ship but the scotsman is a part owner of the dutchmans ship  this small medium i think will reduce this article to a square and an explanatorie clause to that purpose will in two lines determine that point  all which is humbly remitted to the consideration of the right honorable the estates of parliament
