an essay on crimes and punishments by the marquis beccaria of milan with a commentary by m de voltaire a new edition corrected in rebus quibuscunque difficilioribus non expectandum ut quis simul  serat  metat sed præparatione opus est ut per gradus maturescant bacon new edition albany w c little  co          preface of the translator penal laws so considerable a part of every system of legislation and of so great importance to the happiness peace and security of every member of society are still so imperfect and are attended with so many unnecessary circumstances of cruelty in all nations that an attempt to reduce them to the standard of reason must be interesting to all mankind it is not surprising then that this little book hath engaged the attention of all ranks of people in every part of europe it is now about eighteen months since the first publication in which time it hath passed no less than six editions in the original language the third of which was printed within six months after its first appearance it hath been translated   into french that translation hath also been several times reprinted and perhaps no book on any subject was ever received with more avidity more generally read or more universally applauded the author is the marquis beccaria of milan upon considering the nature of the religion and government under which he lives the reasons for concealing his name are obvious the whole was read at different times in a society of learned men in that city and was published at their desire as to the translation i have preserved the order of the original except in a paragraph or two which i have taken the liberty to restore to the chapters to which they evidently belong and from which they must have been accidentally detached the french translator hath gone much farther he hath not only transposed every chapter but every paragraph in the whole book but in this i conceive he hath assumed a right which belongs not to any translator and which cannot be justified his disposition may appear more systematical but certainly the author has as undoubted a right to the arrangement of his own ideas as to the ideas themselves and therefore to destroy that arrangement is to pervert his meaning if he had any meaning in his plan the contrary to which can hardly be supposed   with regard to the commentary attributed to mons de voltaire my only authority for supposing it his is the voice of the public which indeed is the only authority we have for most of his works let those who are acquainted with the peculiarity of his manner judge for themselves the facts above mentioned would preclude all apology for this translation if any apology were necessary for translating into our language a work which from the nature of the subject must be interesting to every nation but must be particularly acceptable to the english from the eloquent and forcible manner in which the author pleads the cause of liberty benevolence and humanity it may however be objected that a treatise of this kind is useless in england where from the excellence of our laws and government no examples of cruelty or oppression are to be found but it must also be allowed that much is still wanting to perfect our system of legislation the confinement of debtors the filth and horror of our prisons the cruelty of jailors and the extortion of the petty officers of justice to all which may be added the melancholy reflection that the number of criminals put to death in england is much greater than in any other part of europe are considerations which will sufficiently   answer every objection these are my only reasons for endeavouring to diffuse the knowledge of the useful truths contained in this little essay and i say with my author that if i can be instrumental in rescuing a single victim from the hand of tyranny or ignorance his transports will sufficiently console me for the contempt of all mankind    0    introduction in every human society there is an effort continually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness and misery the intent of good laws is to oppose this effort and to diffuse their influence universally and equally but men generally abandon the care of their most important concerns to the uncertain prudence and discretion of those whose interest it is to reject the best and wisest institutions and it is not till they have been led into a thousand mistakes in matters the most essential to their lives and liberties and are weary of suffering that they can be induced to apply a remedy to the evils with which    they are oppressed it is then they begin to conceive and acknowledge the most palpable truths which from their very simplicity commonly escape vulgar minds incapable of analysing objects accustomed to receive impressions without distinction and to be determined rather by the opinions of others than by the result of their own examination if we look into history we shall find that laws which are or ought to be conventions between men in a state of freedom have been for the most part the work of the passions of a few or the consequences of a fortuitous or temporary necessity not dictated by a cool examiner of human nature who knew how to collect in one point the actions of a multitude and had this only end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number happy are those few nations who have not waited till the slow succession of human vicissitudes should from the extremity of evil produce a transition to good but by prudent laws have facilitated the progress from one to the other and how great are the obligations due from mankind to that philosopher who from the obscurity of his closet had the courage to scatter among the multitude the seeds of useful truths so long unfruitful    the art of printing has diffused the knowledge of those philosophical truths by which the relations between sovereigns and their subjects and between nations are discovered by this knowledge commerce is animated and there has sprung up a spirit of emulation and industry worthy of rational beings these are the produce of this enlightened age but the cruelty of punishments and the irregularity of proceeding in criminal cases so principal a part of the legislation and so much neglected throughout europe has hardly ever been called in question errors accumulated through many centuries have never been exposed by ascending to general principles nor has the force of acknowledged truths been ever opposed to the unbounded licentiousness of illdirected power which has continually produced so many authorized examples of the most unfeeling barbarity surely the groans of the weak sacrificed to the cruel ignorance and indolence of the powerful the barbarous torments lavished and multiplied with useless severity for crimes either not proved or in their nature impossible the filth and horrors of a prison increased by the most cruel tormentor of the miserable uncertainty ought to have roused the attention of those whose business is to direct the opinions of mankind    the immortal montesquieu has but slightly touched on this subject truth which is eternally the same has obliged me to follow the steps of that great man but the studious part of mankind for whom i write will easily distinguish the superstructure from the foundation i shall be happy if with him i can obtain the secret thanks of the obscure and peaceful disciples of reason and philosophy and excite that tender emotion in which sensible minds sympathise with him who pleads the cause of humanity    an essay on crimes and punishments by m de voltaire chapter i of the origin of punishments laws are the conditions under which men naturally independent united themselves in society weary of living in a continual state of war and of enjoying a liberty which became of little value from the uncertainty of its duration they sacrificed one part of it to enjoy the rest in peace and security the sum of all these portions of the liberty of each individual constituted the sovereignty    of a nation and was deposited in the hands of the sovereign as the lawful administrator but it was not sufficient only to establish this deposit it was also necessary to defend it from the usurpation of each individual who will always endeavour to take away from the mass not only his own portion but to encroach on that of others some motives therefore that strike the senses were necessary to prevent the despotism of each individual from plunging society into its former chaos such motives are the punishment established against the infractors of the laws i say that motives of this kind are necessary because experience shews that the multitude adopt no established rules of conduct and because society is prevented from approaching to that dissolution to which as well as all other parts of the physical and moral world it naturally tends only by motives that are the immediate objects of sense and which being continually presented to the mind are sufficient to counterbalance the effects of the passions of the individual which oppose the general good neither the power of eloquence nor the sublimest truths are sufficient to restrain for any length of time those passions which are excited by the lively impression of present objects ⚓ ✪    chapter ii of the right to punish every punishment which does not arise from absolute necessity says the great montesquieu is tyrannical a proposition which may be made more general thus every act of authority of one man over another for which there is not an absolute necessity is tyrannical it is upon this then that the sovereigns right to punish crimes is founded that is upon the necessity of defending the public liberty intrusted to his care from the usurpation of individuals and punishments are just in proportion as the liberty preserved by the sovereign is sacred and valuable let us consult the human heart and there we shall find the foundation of the sovereigns right to punish for no advantage in moral policy can be lasting which is not founded on the indeliable sentiments of the heart of man whatever law deviates from this principle will always meet with a resistance which will destroy it in the end for the smallest force continually applied    will overcome the most violent motion communicated to bodies no man ever gave up his liberty merely for the good of the public such a chimera exists only in romances every individual wishes if possible to be exempt from the compacts that bind the rest of mankind the multiplication of mankind though slow being too great for the means which the earth in its natural state offered to satisfy necessities which every day became more numerous obliged men to separate again and form new societies these naturally opposed the first and a state of war was transferred from individuals to nations thus it was necessity that forced men to give up a part of their liberty it is certain then that every individual would chuse to put into the public stock the smallest portion possible as much only as was sufficient to engage others to defend it the aggregate of these the smallest portions possible forms the right of punishing all that extends beyond this is abuse not justice observe that by justice i understand nothing more than that bond which is necessary to keep the interest of individuals united without which men would return to the original state of barbarity all punishments which exceed the necessity of    preserving this bond are in their nature unjust we should be cautious how we associate with the word justice an idea of anything real such as a physical power or a being that actually exists i do not by any means speak of the justice of god which is of another kind and refers immediately to rewards and punishments in a life to come chapter iii consequences of the foregoing principles the laws only can determine the punishment of crimes and the authority of making penal laws can only reside with the legislator who represents the whole society united by the social compact no magistrate then as he is one of the society can with justice inflict on any other member of the same society punishment that is not ordained by the laws but as a punishment increased beyond the degree fixed by the law is the just punishment with the addition of another it follows that no magistrate even under a pretence  0 of zeal or the public good should increase the punishment already determined by the laws if every individual be bound to society society is equally bound to him by a contract which from its nature equally binds both parties this obligation which descends from the throne to the cottage and equally binds the highest and lowest of mankind signifies nothing more than that it is the interest of all that conventions which are useful to the greatest number should be punctually observed the violation of this compact by any individual is an introduction to anarchy the sovereign who represents the society itself can only make general laws to bind the members but it belongs not to him to judge whether any individual has violated the social compact or incurred the punishment in consequence for in this case there are two parties one represented by the sovereign who insists upon the violation of the contract and the other is the person accused who denies it it is necessary then that there should be a third person to decide this contest that is to say a judge or magistrate from whose determination there should be no appeal and this determination should consist of a simple affirmation or negation of fact    if it can only be proved that the severity of punishments though not immediately contrary to the public good or to the end for which they were intended viz to prevent crimes be useless then such severity would be contrary to those beneficent virtues which are the consequence of enlightened reason which instructs the sovereign to wish rather to govern men in a state of freedom and happiness than of slavery it would also be contrary to justice and the social compact chapter iv of the interpretation of laws judges in criminal cases have no right to interpret the penal laws because they are not legislators they have not received the laws from our ancestors as a domestic tradition or as the will of a testator which his heirs and executors are to obey but they receive them from a society actually existing or from the sovereign its representative even the authority of the laws is not    founded on any pretended obligation or ancient convention which must be null as it cannot bind those who did not exist at the time of its institution and unjust as it would reduce men in the ages following to a herd of brutes without any power of judging or acting the laws receive their force and authority from an oath of fidelity either tacit or expressed which living subjects have sworn to their sovereign in order to restrain the intestine fermentation of the private interests of individuals from hence springs their true and natural authority who then is their lawful interpreter the sovereign that is the representative of society and not the judge whose office is only to examine if a man have or have not committed an action contrary to the laws in every criminal cause the judge should reason syllogistically the major should be the general law the minor the conformity of the action or its opposition to the laws the conclusion liberty or punishment if the judge be obliged by the imperfection of the laws or chuses to make any other or more syllogisms than this it will be an introduction to uncertainty there is nothing more dangerous than the common axiom the spirit of the laws is to be considered to adopt it is to give way to the torrent of opinions    this may seem a paradox to vulgar minds which are more strongly affected by the smallest disorder before their eyes than by the most pernicious though remote consequences produced by one false principle adopted by a nation our knowledge is in proportion to the number of our ideas the more complex these are the greater is the variety of positions in which they may be considered every man hath his own particular point of view and at different times sees the same objects in very different lights the spirit of the laws will then be the result of the good or bad logic of the judge and this will depend on his good or bad digestion on the violence of his passions on the rank and condition of the abused or on his connections with the judge and on all those circumstances which change the appearance of objects in the fluctuating mind of man hence we see the fate of a delinquent changed many times in passing through the different courts of judicature and his life and liberty victims to the false ideas or ill humour of the judge who mistakes the vague result of his own confused reasoning for the just interpretation of the laws we see the same crimes punished in a different manner at different times in the same tribunals the consequence of not    having consulted the constant and invariable voice of the laws but the erring instability of arbitrary interpretation the disorders that may arise from a rigorous observance of the letter of penal laws are not to be compared with those produced by the interpretation of them the first are temporary inconveniencies which will oblige the legislator to correct the letter of the law the want of preciseness and uncertainty of which has occasioned these disorders and this will put a stop to the fatal liberty of explaining the source of arbitrary and venal declamations when the code of laws is once fixed it should be observed in the literal sense and nothing more is left to the judge than to determine whether an action be or be not conformable to the written law when the rule of right which ought to direct the actions of the philosopher as well as the ignorant is a matter of controversy not of fact the people are slaves to the magistrates the despotism of this multitude of tyrants is more insupportable the less the distance is between the oppressor and the oppressed more fatal than that of one for the tyranny of many is not to be shaken off but by having recourse to that of one alone it is more cruel as it meets with more opposition and the    cruelty of a tyrant is not in proportion to his strength but to the obstacles that oppose him these are the means by which security of person and property is best obtained which is just as it is the purpose of uniting in society and it is useful as each person may calculate exactly the inconveniencies attending every crime by these means subjects will acquire a spirit of independence and liberty however it may appear to those who dare to call the weakness of submitting blindly to their capricious and interested opinions by the sacred name of virtue these principles will displease those who have made it a rule with themselves to transmit to their inferiors the tyranny they suffer from their superiors i should have every thing to fear if tyrants were to read my book but tyrants never read    chapter v of the obscurity of laws if the power of interpreting laws be an evil obscurity in them must be another as the former is the consequence of the latter this evil will be still greater if the laws be written in a language unknown to the people who being ignorant of the consequences of their own actions become necessarily dependent on a few who are interpreters of the laws which instead of being public and general are thus rendered private and particular what must we think of mankind when we reflect that such is the established custom of the greatest part of our polished and enlightened europe crimes will be less frequent in proportion as the code of laws is more universally read and understood for there is no doubt but that the eloquence of the passions is greatly assisted by the ignorance and uncertainty of punishments hence it follows that without written laws no society will ever acquire a fixed form of government    in which the power is vested in the whole and not in any part of the society and in which the laws are not to be altered but by the will of the whole nor corrupted by the force of private interest experience and reason shew us that the probability of human traditions diminishes in proportion as they are distant from their sources how then can laws resist the inevitable force of time if there be not a lasting monument of the social compact hence we see the use of printing which alone makes the public and not a few individuals the guardians and defenders of the laws it is this art which by diffusing literature has gradually dissipated the gloomy spirit of cabal and intrigue to this art it is owing that the atrocious crimes of our ancestors who were alternately slaves and tyrants are become less frequent those who are acquainted with the history of the two or three last centuries may observe how from the lap of luxury and effeminacy have sprung the most tender virtues humanity benevolence and toleration of human errors they may contemplate the effects of what was so improperly called ancient simplicity and good faith humanity groaning under implacable superstition the avarice and ambition of a few staining with    human blood the thrones and palaces of kings secret treasons and public massacres every noble a tyrant over the people and the ministers of the gospel of christ bathing their hands in blood in the name of the god of all mercy we may talk as we please of the corruption and degeneracy of the present age but happily we see no such horrid examples of cruelty and oppression chapter vi of the proportion between crimes and punishments it is not only the common interest of mankind that crimes should not be committed but that crimes of every kind should be less frequent in proportion to the evil they produce to society therefore the means made use of by the legislature to prevent crimes should be more powerful in proportion as they are destructive of the public safety and happiness and as the inducements to commit them are stronger therefore there    ought to be a fixed proportion between crimes and punishments it is impossible to prevent entirely all the disorders which the passions of mankind cause in society these disorders increase in proportion to the number of people and the opposition of private interests if we consult history we shall find them increasing in every state with the extent of dominion in political arithmetic it is necessary to substitute a calculation of probabilities to mathematical exactness that force which continually impels us to our own private interest like gravity acts incessantly unless it meets with an obstacle to oppose it the effects of this force are the confused series of human actions punishments which i would call political obstacles prevent the fatal effects of private interest without destroying the impelling cause which is that sensibility inseparable from man the legislator acts in this case like a skilful architect who endeavours to counteract the force of gravity by combining the circumstances which may contribute to the strength of his edifice the necessity of uniting in society being granted together with the conventions which the opposite interests of individuals must necessarily require a scale of crimes may be formed  0 of which the first degree should consist of those which immediately tend to the dissolution of society and the last of the smallest possible injustice done to a private member of that society between these extremes will be comprehended all actions contrary to the public good which are called criminal and which descend by insensible degrees decreasing from the highest to the lowest if mathematical calculation could be applied to the obscure and infinite combinations of human actions there might be a corresponding scale of punishments descending from the greatest to the least but it will be sufficient that the wise legislator mark the principal divisions without disturbing the order lest to crimes of the first degree be assigned punishments of the last if there were an exact and universal scale of crimes and punishments we should then have a common measure of the degree of liberty and slavery humanity and cruelty of different nations any action which is not comprehended in the above mentioned scale will not be called a crime or punished as such except by those who have an interest in the denomination the uncertainty of the extreme points of this scale hath produced a system of morality which contradicts the laws    a multitude of laws that contradict each other and many which expose the best men to the severest punishments rendering the ideas of vice and virtue vague and fluctuating and even their existence doubtful hence that fatal lethargy of political bodies which terminates in their destruction whoever reads with a philosophic eye the history of nations and their laws will generally find that the ideas of virtue and vice of a good or a bad citizen change with the revolution of ages not in proportion to the alteration of circumstances and consequently conformable to the common good but in proportion to the passions and errors by which the different lawgivers were successively influenced he will frequently observe that the passions and vices of one age are the foundation of the morality of the following that violent passion the offspring of fanaticism and enthusiasm being weakened by time which reduces all the phenomena of the natural and moral world to an equality become by degrees the prudence of the age and an useful instrument in the hands of the powerful or artful politician hence the uncertainty of our notions of honour and virtue an uncertainty which will ever remain because they change with the revolutions of time    and names survive the things they originally signified they change with the boundaries of states which are often the same both in physical and moral geography pleasure and pain are the only springs of action in beings endowed with sensibility even among the motives which incite men to acts of religion the invisible legislator has ordained rewards and punishments from a partial distribution of these will arise that contradiction so little observed because so common i mean that of punishing by the laws the crimes which the laws have occasioned if an equal punishment be ordained for two crimes that injure society in different degrees there is nothing to deter men from committing the greater as often as it is attended with greater advantage    chapter vii of estimating the degree of crimes the foregoing reflections authorise me to assert that crimes are only to be measured by the injury done to society they err therefore who imagine that a crime is greater or less according to the intention of the person by whom it is committed for this will depend on the actual impression of objects on the senses and on the previous disposition of the mind both which will vary in different persons and even in the same person at different times according to the succession of ideas passions and circumstances upon that system it would be necessary to form not only a particular code for every individual but a new penal law for every crime men often with the best intention do the greatest injury to society and with the worst do it the most essential services others have estimated crimes rather by the dignity of the person offended than by their consequences to society if this were the true standard    the smallest irreverence to the divine being ought to be punished with infinitely more severity than the assassination of a monarch in short others have imagined that the greatness of the sin should aggravate the crime but the fallacy of this opinion will appear on the slightest consideration of the relations between man and man and between god and man the relations between man and man are relations of equality necessity alone hath produced from the opposition of private passions and interests the idea of public utility which is the foundation of human justice the other are relations of dependence between an imperfect creature and his creator the most perfect of beings who has reserved to himself the sole right of being both lawgiver and judge for he alone can without injustice be at the same time both one and the other if he hath decreed eternal punishments for those who disobey his will shall an insect dare to put himself in the place of divine justice to pretend to punish for the almighty who is himself allsufficient who cannot receive impressions of pleasure or pain and who alone of all other beings acts without being acted upon the degree of sin depends on the malignity of the heart which is impenetrable to finite being how    then can the degree of sin serve as a standard to determine the degree of crimes if that were admitted men may punish when god pardons and pardon when god condemns and thus act in opposition to the supreme being chapter viii of the division of crimes we have proved then that crimes are to be estimated by the injury done to society this is one of those palpable truths which though evident to the meanest capacity yet by a combination of circumstances are only known to a few thinking men in every nation and in every age but opinions worthy only of the despotism of asia and passions armed with power and authority have generally by insensible and sometimes by violent impressions on the timid credulity of men effaced those simple ideas which perhaps constituted the first philosophy of infant society happily the philosophy of the present enlightened    age seems again to conduct us to the same principles and with that degree of certainty which is obtained by a rational examination and repeated experience a scrupulous adherence to order would require that we should now examine and distinguish the different species of crimes and the modes of punishment but they are so variable in their nature from the different circumstances of ages and countries that the detail would be tiresome and endless it will be sufficient for my purpose to point out the most general principles and the most common and dangerous errors in order to undeceive as well those who from a mistaken zeal for liberty would introduce anarchy and confusion as those who pretend to reduce society in general to the regularity of a convent some crimes are immediately destructive of society or its representative others attack the private security of the life property or honour of individuals and a third class consists of such actions as are contrary to the laws which relate to the general good of the community the first which are of the highest degree as they are most destructive to society are called crimes of lezemajesty tyranny and ignorance    which have confounded the clearest terms and ideas have given this appellation to crimes of a different nature and consequently have established the same punishment for each and on this occasion as on a thousand others men have been sacrificed victims to a word every crime even of the most private nature injures society but every crime does not threaten its immediate destruction moral as well as physical actions have their sphere of activity differently circumscribed like all the movements of nature by time and space it is therefore a sophistical interpretation the common philosophy of slaves that would confound the limits of things established by eternal truth to these succeed crimes which are destructive of the security of individuals this security being the principal end of all society and to which every citizen hath an undoubted right it becomes indispensably necessary that to these crimes the greatest of punishments should be assigned the opinion that every member of society has a right to do anything that is not contrary to the laws without fearing any other inconveniencies than those which are the natural consequences of the action itself is a political dogma which    should be defended by the laws inculcated by the magistrates and believed by the people a sacred dogma without which there can be no lawful society a just recompence for our sacrifice of that universal liberty of action common to all sensible beings and only limited by our natural powers by this principle our minds become free active and vigorous by this alone we are inspired with that virtue which knows no fear so different from that pliant prudence worthy of those only who can bear a precarious existence attempts therefore against the life and liberty of a citizen are crimes of the highest nature under this head we comprehend not only assassinations and robberies committed by the populace but by grandees and magistrates whose example acts with more force and at a greater distance destroying the ideas of justice and duty among the subjects and substituting that of the right of the strongest equally dangerous to those who exercise it and to those who suffer    chapter ix of honour there is a remarkable difference between the civil laws those jealous guardians of life and property and the laws of what is called honour which particularly respects the opinion of others honour is a term which has been the foundation of many long and brilliant reasonings without annexing to it any precise or fixed idea how miserable is the condition of the human mind to which the most distant and least essential matters the revolution of the heavenly bodies are more distinctly known than the most interesting truths of morality which are always confused and fluctuating as they happen to be driven by the gales of passion or received and transmitted by ignorance but this will cease to appear strange if it be considered that as objects when too near the eye appear confused so the too great vicinity of the ideas of morality is the reason why the simple ideas of which they are composed are easily confounded but which must be separated before  0 we can investigate the phenomena of human sensibility and the intelligent observer of human nature will cease to be surprised that so many ties and such an apparatus of morality are necessary to the security and happiness of mankind honour then is one of those complex ideas which are an aggregate not only of simple ones but of others so complicated that in their various modes of affecsing the human mind they sometimes exclude part of the elements of which they are composed retaining only some few of the most common as many algebraic quantities admit one common divisor to find this common divisor of the different ideas attached to the word honour it will be necessary to go back to the original formation of society the first laws and the first magistrates owed their existence to the necessity of preventing the disorders which the natural despotism of individuals would unavoidably produce this was the object of the establishment of society and was either in reality or in appearance the principal design of all codes of laws even the most pernicious but the more intimate connections of men and the progress of their knowledge gave rise to an infinite number of necessities and mutual acts of friendship between the members    of society these necessities were not foreseen by the laws and could not be satisfied by the actual power of each individual at this epocha began to be established the despotism of opinion as being the only means of obtaining those benefits which the law could not procure and of removing those evils against which the laws were no security it is opinion that tormentor of the wise and the ignorant that has exalted the appearance of virtue above virtue itself hence the esteem of men becomes not only useful but necessary to every one to prevent his sinking below the common level the ambitious man grasps at it as being necessary to his designs the vain man sues for it as a testimony of his merit the honest man demands it as his due and the most men consider it as necessary to their existence honour being produced after the formation of society could not be a part of the common deposite and therefore whilst we act under its influence we return for that instant to a state of nature and withdraw ourselves from the laws which in this case are insufficient for our protection hence it follows that in extreme political liberty and in absolute despotism all ideas of honour disappear or are confounded with others in the first case reputation becomes useless from    the despotism of the laws and in the second the despotism of one man annulling civil existence reduces the rest to a precarious and temporary personality honour then is one of the fundamental principles of those monarchies which are a limited despotism and in these like revolutions in despotic states it is a momentary return to a state of nature and original equality chapter x of duelling from the necessity of the esteem of others have arisen single combats and they have been established by the anarchy of the laws they are thought to have been unknown to the ancients perhaps because they did not assemble in their temples in their theatres or with their friends suspiciously armed with swords and perhaps because single combats were a common spectacle exhibited to the people by gladiators who were slaves and whom freemen disdained to imitate    in vain have the laws endeavoured to abolish this custom by punishing the offenders with death a man of honour deprived of the esteem of others foresees that he must be reduced either to a solitary existence insupportable to a social creature or become the object of perpetual insult considerations sufficient to overcome the fear of death what is the reason that duels are not so frequent among the common people as amongst the great not only because they do not wear swords but because to men of that class reputation is of less importance than it is to those of a higher rank who commonly regard each other with distrust and jealousy it may not be without its use to repeat here what has been mentioned by other writers viz that the best method of preventing this crime is to punish the aggressor that is the person who gave occasion to the duel and to acquit him who without any fault on his side is obliged to defend that which is not sufficiently secured to him by the laws    chapter xi of crimes which disturb the public tranquillity another class of crimes are those which disturb the public tranquillity and the quiet of the citizens such as tumults and riots in the public streets which are intended for commerce and the passage of the inhabitants the discourses of fanatics which rouse the passions of the curious multitude and gain strength from the number of their hearers who though deaf to calm and solid reasoning are always affected by obscure and mysterious enthusiasm the illumination of the streets during the night at the public expense guards stationed in different quarters of the city the plain and moral discourses of religion reserved for the silence and tranquillity of churches and protected by authority and harangues in support of the interest of the public delivered only at the general meetings of the nation in parliament or where the sovereign resides are all means to prevent the dangerous effects of the misguided passions of the people    these should be the principal objects of the vigilance of a magistrate and which the french call police but if this magistrate should act in an arbitrary manner and not in conformity to the code of laws which ought to be in the hand of every member of the community he opens a door to tyranny which always surrounds the confines of political liberty i do not know of any exception to this general axiom that every member of the society should know when he is criminal and when innocent if censors and in general arbitrary magistrates be necessary in any government it proceeds from some fault in the constitution the uncertainty of crimes hath sacrificed more victims to secret tyranny than have ever suffered by public and solemn cruelty what are in general the proper punishments for crimes is the punishment of death really useful or necessary for the safety or good order of society are tortures and torments consistent with justice or do they answer the end proposed by the laws which is the best method of preventing crimes are the same punishments equally useful at all times what influence have they on manners these problems should be solved with that geometrical precision which the mist of    sophistry the seduction of eloquence and the timidity of doubt are unable to resist if i have no other merit than that of having first presented to my country with a greater degree of evidence what other nations have written and are beginning to practise i shall account myself fortunate but if by supporting the rights of mankind and of invincible truth i shall contribute to save from the agonies of death one unfortunate victim of tyranny or of ignorance equally fatal his blessings and tears of transport will be a sufficient consolation to me for the contempt of all mankind chapter xii of the intent of punishments from the foregoing considerations it is evident that the intent of punishments is not to torment a sensible being nor to undo a crime already committed is it possible that torments and useless cruelty the instruments of furious fanaticism or    of impotency of tyrants can be authorized by a political body which so far from being influenced by passion should be the cool moderator of the passions of individuals can the groans of a tortured wretch recal the time past or reverse the crime he has committed the end of punishment therefore is no other than to prevent others from committing the like offence such punishments therefore and such a mode of inflicting them ought to be chosen as will make strongest and most lasting impressions on the minds of others with the least torment to the body of the criminal chapter xiii of the credibility of witnesses to determine exactly the credibility of a witness and the force of evidence is an important point in every good legislation every man of common sense that is every one whose ideas have some connexion with each other and whose sensations    are conformable to those of other men may be a witness but the credibility of his evidence will be in proportion as he is interested in declaring or concealing the truth hence it appears how frivolous is the reasoning of those who reject the testimony of women on account of their weakness how puerile it is not to admit the evidence of those who are under sentence of death because they are dead in law and how irrational to exclude persons branded with infamy for in all these cases they ought to be credited when they have no interest in giving false testimony the credibility of a witness then should only diminish in proportion to the hatred friendship or connexions subsisting between him and the delinquent one witness is not sufficient for whilst the accused denies what the other affirms truth remains suspended and the right that every one has to be believed innocent turns the balance in his favour the credibility of a witness is the less as the atrociousness of the crime is greater from the improbability of its having been committed as in cases of witchcraft and acts of wanton cruelty the writers on penal laws have adopted a contrary principle viz that the credibility of a witness is greater as the crime is more atrocious behold    their inhuman maxim dictated by the most cruel imbecility in atrocissimis leviores conjecturæ sufficiunt  licet judici jura transgredi let us translate this sentence that mankind may see one of the many unreasonable principles to which they are ignorantly subject in the most atrocious crimes the slightest conjectures are sufficient and the judge is allowed to exceed the limits of the law the absurd practices of legislators are often the effect of timidity which is a principal source of the contradictions of mankind the legislators or rather lawyers whose opinions when alive were interested and venal but which after their death become of decisive authority and are sovereign arbiters of the lives and fortunes of men terrified by the condemnation of some innocent person have burdened the law with pompous and useless formalities the scrupulous observance of which will place anarchical impunity on the throne of justice at other times perplexed by atrocious crimes of difficult proof they imagined themselves under a necessity of superseding the very formalities established by themselves and thus at one time with despotic impatience and at another with feminine timidity they transform their solemn judgments into a game of hazard but to return in the case of witchcraft it  0 is much more probable that a number of men should be deceived than that any person should exercise a power which god hath refused to every created being in like manner in cases of wanton cruelty the presumption is always against the accuser without some motive of fear or hate there are no spontaneous or superfluous sentiments in the heart of man they are all the result of impressions on the senses the credibility of a witness may also be diminished by his being a member of a private society whose customs and principles of conduct are either not known or are different from those of the public such a man has not only his own passions but those of the society of which he is a member finally the credibility of a witness is null when the question relates to the words of a criminal for the tone of voice the gesture all that precedes accompanies and follows the different ideas which men annex to the same words may so alter and modify a mans discourse that it is almost impossible to repeat them precisely in the manner in which they were spoken besides violent and uncommon actions such as real crimes leave a trace in the multitude of circumstances that attend them and in their effects but words    remain only in the memory of the hearers who are commonly negligent or prejudiced it is infinitely easier then to found an accusation on the words than on the actions of a man for in these the number of circumstances urged against the accused afford him variety of means of justification chapter xiv of evidence and the proofs of a crime and of the form of judgment the following general theorem is of great use in determining the certainty of fact when the proofs of a crime are dependent on each other that is when the evidence of each witness taken separately proves nothing or when all the proofs are dependent upon one the number of proofs neither increase nor diminish the probability of the fact for the force of the whole is no greater than the force of that on which they depend and if this fails they all fall to the ground when the proofs are independent on each other    the probability of the fact increases in proportion to the number of proofs for the falsehood of one does not diminish the veracity of another it may seem extraordinary that i speak of probability with regard to crimes which to deserve a punishment must be certain but this paradox will vanish when it is considered that strictly speaking moral certainty is only probability but which is called a certainty because every man in his senses assents to it from an habit produced by the necessity of acting and which is anterior to all speculation that certainty which is necessary to decide that the accused is guilty is the very same which determines every man in the most important transactions of his life the proofs of a crime may be divided into two classes perfect and imperfect i call those perfect which exclude the possibility of innocence imperfect those which do not exclude this possibility of the first one only is sufficient for condemnation of the second as many are required as form a perfect proof that is to say that though each of these separately taken does not exclude the possibility of innocence it is nevertheless excluded by their union it should be also observed that the imperfect proofs of    which the accused if innocent might clear himself and does not become perfect but it is much easier to feel this moral certainty of proofs than to define it exactly for this reason i think it an excellent law which establishes assistants to the principal judge and those chosen by lot for that ignorance which judges by its feelings is less subject to error than the knowledge of the laws which judges by opinion where the laws are clear and precise the office of the judge is merely to ascertain the fact if in examining the proofs of a crime acuteness and dexterity be required if clearness and precision be necessary in summing up the result to judge of the result itself nothing is wanting but plain and ordinary good sense a less fallacious guide than the knowledge of a judge accustomed to find guilty and to reduce all things to an artificial system borrowed from his studies happy the nation where the knowledge of the law is not a science it is an admirable law which ordains that every man shall be tried by his peers for when life liberty and fortune are in question the sentiments which a difference of rank and fortune inspire should be silent that superiority with which the fortunate look upon the unfortunate and that    envy with which the inferior regard their superiors should have no influence but when the crime is an offence against a fellowsubject one half of the judges should be peers to the accused and the other peers to the person offended so that all private interest which in spite of ourselves modifies the appearance of objects even in the eyes of the most equitable is counteracted and nothing remains to turn aside the direction of truth and the laws it is also just that the accused should have the liberty of excluding a certain number of his judges where this liberty is enjoyed for a long time without any instance to the contrary the criminal seems to condemn himself all trials should be public that opinion which is the best or perhaps the only cement of society may curb the authority of the powerful and the passions of the judge and that the people may say we are protected by the laws we are not slaves a sentiment which inspires courage and which is the best tribute to a sovereign who knows his real interest i shall not enter into particulars there may be some persons who expect that i should say all that can be said upon this subject to such what i have already written must be unintelligible    chapter xv of secret accusations secret accusations are a manifest abuse but consecrated by custom in many nations where from the weakness of the government they are necessary this custom makes men false and treacherous whoever suspects another to be an informer beholds in him an enemy and from thence mankind are accustomed to disguise their real sentiments and from the habit of concealing them from others they at last even hide them from themselves unhappy are those who have arrived at this point without any certain and fixed principles to guide them they fluctuate in the vast sea of opinion and are busied only in escaping the monsters which surround them to those the present is always embittered by the uncertainty of the future deprived of the pleasures of tranquillity and security some fleeting moments of happiness scattered thinly through their wretched lives console them for the misery of existing shall we amongst such men find    intrepid soldiers to defend their king and country amongst such men shall we find incorruptible magistrates who with the spirit of freedom and patriotic eloquence will support and explain the true interest of their sovereign who with the tributes offer up at the throne the love and blessing of the people and thus bestow on the palaces of the great and the humble cottage peace and security and to the industrious a prospect of bettering their lot that useful ferment and vital principle of states who can defend himself from calumny armed with that impenetrable shield of tyranny secrecy what a miserable government must that be where the sovereign suspects an enemy in every subject and to secure the tranquillity of the public is obliged to sacrifice the repose of every individual by what arguments is it pretended that secret accusations may be justified the public safety say they and the security and maintenance of the established form of government but what a strange constitution is that where the government which hath in its favour not only power but opinion still more efficacious yet fears its own subjects the indemnity of the informer do not the laws defend him sufficiently and are there subjects more powerful than the laws the    necessity of protecting the informer from infamy when secret calumny is authorised and punished only when public the nature of the crime if actions indifferent in themselves or even useful to the public were called crimes both the accusation and the trial could never be too secret but can there be any crime committed against the public which ought not to be publicly punished i respect all governments and i speak not of any one in particular such may sometimes be the nature of circumstances that when abuses are inherent in the constitution it may be imagined that to rectify them would be to destroy the constitution itself but were i to dictate new laws in a remote corner of the universe the good of posterity ever present to my mind would hold back my trembling hand and prevent me from authorising secret accusations public accusations says montesquieu are more conformable to the nature of a republic where zeal for the public good is the principal passion of a citizen than of a monarchy in which as this sentiment is very feeble from the nature of the government the best establishment is that of commissioners who in the name of the public accuse the infractors of the laws but in all governments as well in a republic as in a monarchy    the punishment due to the crime of which one accuses another ought to be inflicted on the informer chapter xvi of torture the torture of a criminal during the course of his trial is a cruelty consecrated by custom in most nations it is used with an intent either to make him confess his crime or explain some contradictions into which he had been led during his examination or discover his accomplices or for some kind of metaphysical and incomprehensible purgation of infamy or finally in order to discover other crimes of which he is not accused but of which he may be guilty no man can be judged a criminal until he be found guilty nor can society take from him the public protection until it have been proved that he has violated the conditions on which it was granted what right then but that of power can authorise the punishment of a citizen so long    as there remains any doubt of his guilt the dilemma is frequent either he is guilty or not guilty if guilty he should only suffer the punishment ordained by the laws and torture becomes useless as his confession is unnecessary if he be not guilty you torture the innocent for in the eye of the law every man is innocent whose crime has not been proved besides it is confounding all relations to expect that a man should be both the accuser and accused and that pain should be the test of truth as if truth resided in the muscles and fibres of a wretch in torture by this method the robust will escape and the feeble be condemned these are the inconveniencies of this pretended test of truth worthy only of a cannibal and which the romans in many respects barbarous and whose savage virtue has been too much admired reserved for the slaves alone what is the political intention of punishments to terrify and to be an example to others is this intention answered by thus privately torturing the guilty and the innocent it is doubtless of importance that no crime should remain unpunished but it is useless to make a public example of the author of a crime hid in darkness a crime already committed and for which there can be no remedy can only be punished by a  0 political society with an intention that no hopes of impunity should induce others to commit the same if it be true that the number of those who from fear or virtue respect the laws is greater than of those by whom they are violated the risk of torturing an innocent person is greater as there is a greater probability that cæteris paribus an individual hath observed than that he hath infringed the laws there is another ridiculous motive for torture namely to purge a man from infamy ought such an abuse to be tolerated in the eighteenth century can pain which is a sensation have any connection with a moral sentiment a matter of opinion perhaps the rack may be considered as a refiners furnace it is not difficult to trace this senseless law to its origin for an absurdity adopted by a whole nation must have some affinity with other ideas established and respected by the same nation this custom seems to be the offspring of religion by which mankind in all nations and in all ages are so generally influenced we are taught by our infallible church that those stains of sin contracted through human frailty and which have not deserved the eternal anger of the almighty are to be purged away in another life by an    incomprehensible fire now infamy is a stain and if the punishments and fire of purgatory can take away all spiritual stains why should not the pain of torture take away those of a civil nature i imagine that the confession of a criminal which in some tribunals is required as being essential to his condemnation has a similar origin and has been taken from the mysterious tribunal of penitence where the confession of sins is a necessary part of the sacrament thus have men abused the unerring light of revelation and in the times of tractable ignorance having no other they naturally had recourse to it on every occasion making the most remote and absurd applications moreover infamy is a sentiment regulated neither by the laws nor by reason but entirely by opinion but torture renders the victim infamous and therefore cannot take infamy away another intention of torture is to oblige the supposed criminal to reconcile the contradictions into which he may have fallen during his examination as if the dread of punishment the uncertainty of his fate the solemnity of the court the majesty of the judge and the ignorance of the accused were not abundantly sufficient to account for contradictions which are so common to men even in a state of tranquillity and which must    necessarily be multiplied by the perturbation of the mind of a man entirely engaged in the thought of saving himself from imminent danger this infamous test of truth is a remaining monument of that ancient and savage legislation in which trials by fire by boiling water or the uncertainty of combats were called judgments of god as if the links of that eternal chain whose beginning is in the breast of the first cause of all things could never be disunited by the institutions of men the only difference between torture and trials by fire and boiling water is that the event of the first depends on the will of the accused and of the second on a fact entirely physical and external but this difference is apparent only not real a man on the rack in the convulsions of torture has it as little in his power to declare the truth as in former times to prevent without fraud the effect of fire or of boiling water every act of the will is invariably in proportion to the force of the impression on our senses the impression of pain then may increase to such a degree that occupying the mind entirely it will compel the sufferer to use the shortest method of freeing himself from torment his answer therefore will be an effect as necessary as that of fire or boiling water and he will    accuse himself of crimes of which he is innocent so that the very means employed to distinguish the innocent from the guilty will most effectually destroy all difference between them it would be superfluous to confirm these reflections by examples of innocent persons who from the agony of torture have confessed themselves guilty innumerable instances may be found in all nations and in every age how amazing that mankind have always neglected to draw the natural conclusion lives there a man who if he have carried his thoughts ever so little beyond the necessities of life when he reflects on such cruelty is not tempted to fly from society and return to his natural state of independence the result of torture then is a matter of calcution and depends on the constitution which differs in every individual and is in proportion to his strength and sensibility so that to discover truth by this method is a problem which may be better resolved by a mathematician than a judge and may be thus stated the force of the muscles and the sensibility of the nerves of an innocent person being given it is required to find the degree of pain necessary to make him confess himself guilty of a given crime the examination of the accused is intended to    find out the truth but if this be discovered with so much difficulty in the air gesture and countenance of a man at ease how can it appear in a countenance distorted by the convulsions of torture every violent action destroys those small alterations in the features which sometimes disclose the sentiments of the heart these truths were known to the roman legislators amongst whom as i have already observed slaves only who were not considered as citizens were tortured they are known to the english a nation in which the progress of science superiority in commerce riches and power its natural consequences together with the numerous examples of virtue and courage leave no doubt of the excellence of its laws they have been acknowledged in sweden where torture has been abolished they are known to one of the wisest monarchs in europe who having seated philosophy on the throne by his beneficent legislation has made his subjects free though dependent on the laws the only freedom that reasonable men can desire in the present state of things in short torture has not been thought necessary in the laws of armies composed chiefly of the dregs of mankind where its use should seem most necessary strange phenomenon that a set of men hardened by    slaughter and familiar with blood should teach humanity to the sons of peace it appears also that these truths were known though imperfectly even to those by whom torture has been most frequently practised for a confession made during torture is null if it be not afterwards confirmed by an oath which if the criminal refuses he is tortured again some civilians and some nations permit this infamous petitio principii to be only three times repeated and others leave it to the discretion of the judge and therefore of two men equally innocent or equally guilty the most robust and resolute will be acquitted and the weakest and most pusillanimous will be condemned in consequence of the following excellent method of reasoning i the judge must find some one guilty thou who art a strong fellow hast been able to resist the force of torment therefore i acquit thee thou being weaker hath yielded to it i therefore condemn thee i am sensible that the confession which was extorted from thee has no weight but if thou dost not confirm by oath what thou hast already confessed i will have thee tormented again a very strange but necessary consequence of the use of torture is that the case of the innocent is worse than that of the guilty with regard to    the first either he confesses the crime which he has not committed and is condemned or he is acquitted and has suffered a punishment he did not deserve on the contrary the person who is really guilty has the most favourable side of the question for if he supports the torture with firmness and resolution he is acquitted and has gained having exchanged a greater punishment for a less the law by which torture is authorised says men be insensible to pain nature has indeed given you an irresistible selflove and an unalienable right of selfpreservation but i create in you a contrary sentiment an heroical hatred of yourselves i command you to accuse yourselves and to declare the truth midst the tearing of your flesh and the dislocation of your bones torture is used to discover whether the criminal be guilty of other crimes besides those of which he is accused which is equivalent to the following reasoning thou art guilty of one crime therefore it is possible that thou mayst have committed a thousand others but the affair being doubtful i must try it by my criterion of truth the laws order thee to be tormented because thou art guilty because thou mayst be guilty and because i chuse thou shouldst be guilty    torture is used to make the criminal discover his accomplices but if it has been demonstrated that it is not a proper means of discovering truth how can it serve to discover the accomplices which is one of the truths required will not the man who accuses himself yet more readily accuse others besides is it just to torment one man for the crime of another may not the accomplices be found out by the examination of the witnesses or of the criminal from the evidence or from the nature of the crime itself in short by all the means that have been used to prove the guilt of the prisoner the accomplices commonly fly when their comrade is taken the uncertainty of their fate condemns them to perpetual exile and frees society from the danger of further injury whilst the punishment of the criminal by deterring others answers the purpose for which it was ordained    chapter xvii of pecuniary punishments there was a time when all punishments were pecuniary the crimes of the subjects were the inheritance of the prince an injury done to society was a favour to the crown and the sovereign and magistrates those guardians of the public security were interested in the violation of the laws crimes were tried at that time in a court of exchequer and the cause became a civil suit between the person accused and the crown the magistrate then had other powers than were necessary for the public welfare and the criminal suffered other punishments than the necessity of example required the judge was rather a collector for the crown an agent for the treasury than a protector and minister of the laws but according to this system for a man to confess himself guilty was to acknowledge himself a debtor to the crown which was and is at present the effects continuing after the causes have ceased the intent of all criminal causes thus the criminal    who refuses to confess his crime though convicted by the most undoubted proofs will suffer a less punishment than if he had confessed and he will not be put to the torture to oblige him to confess other crimes which he might have committed as he has not confessed the principal but the confession being once obtained the judge becomes master of his body and torments him with a studied formality in order to squeeze out of him all the profit possible confession then is allowed to be a convincing proof especially when obtained by the force of torture at the same time that an extrajudicial confession when a man is at case and under no apprehension is not sufficient for his condemnation all inquiries which may serve to clear up the fact but which may weaken the pretensions of the crown are excluded it was not from compassion to the criminal or from considerations of humanity that torments were sometimes spared but out of fear of losing those rights which at present appear chimerical and inconceivable the judge becomes an enemy to the accused to a wretch a prey to the horrors of a dungeon to torture to death and an uncertain futurity more terrible than all he inquires not into the truth of the fact but the nature of the crime he lays  0 snares to make him convict himself he fears lest he should not succeed in finding him guilty and lest that infallibility which every man arrogates to himself should be called in question it is in the power of the magistrate to determine what evidence is sufficient to send a man to prison that he may be proved innocent he must first be supposed guilty this is what is called an offensive prosecution and such are all criminal proceedings in the eighteenth century in all parts of our polished europe the true prosecution for information that is an impartial inquiry into the fact that which reason prescribes which military laws adopt and which asiatic despotism allows in suits of one subject against another is very little practiced in any courts of justice what a labyrinth of absurdities absurdities which will appear incredible to happier posterity the philosopher only will be able to read in the nature of man the possibility of there ever having been such a system    chapter xviii of oaths there is a palpable contradiction between the laws and the natural sentiments of mankind in the case of oaths which are administered to a criminal to make him speak the truth when the contrary is his greatest interest as if a man could think himself obliged to contribute to his own destruction and as if when interest speaks religion was not generally silent religion which in all ages hath of all other things been most commonly abused and indeed upon what motive should it be respected by the wicked when it has been thus violated by those who were esteemed the wisest of men the motives which religion opposes to the fear of impending evil and the love of life are too weak as they are too distant to make any impression on the senses the affairs of the other world are regulated by laws entirely different from those by which human affairs are directed why then should we endeavour to compromise matters between them why    should a man be reduced to the terrible alternative either of offending god or of contributing to his own immediate destruction the laws which require an oath in such a case leave him only the choice of becoming a bad christian or a martyr for this reason oaths become by degrees a mere formality and all sentiments of religion perhaps the only motive of honesty in the greatest part of mankind are destroyed experience proves their utility i appeal to every judge whether he has ever known that an oath alone has brought truth from the lips of a criminal and reason tells us it must be so for all laws are useless and in consequence destructive which contradict the natural feelings of mankind such laws are like a dyke opposed directly to the course of a torrent it is either immediately overwhelmed or by a whirlpool formed by itself it is gradually undermined and destroyed    chapter xix of the advantage of immediate punishment the more immediately after the commission of a crime a punishment is inflicted the more just and useful it will be it will be more just because it spares the criminal the cruel and superfluous torment of uncertainty which increases in proportion to the strength of his imagination and the sense of his weakness and because the privation of liberty being a punishment ought to be inflicted before condemnation but for as short a time as possible imprisonments i say being only the means of securing the person of the accused until he be tried condemned or acquitted ought not only to be of short duration but attended with as little severity as possible the time should be determined by the necessary preparation for the trial and the right of priority in the oldest prisoners the confinement ought not to be closer than is requisite to prevent his flight or his concealing the proofs of the crime and the trial should be conducted with all possible    expedition can there be a more cruel contrast than that between the indolence of a judge and the painful anxiety of the accused the comforts and pleasures of an insensible magistrate and the filth and misery of the prisoner in general as i have before observed the degree of the punishment and the consequences of a crime ought to be so contrived as to have the greatest possible effect on others with the least possible pain to the delinquent if there be any society in which this is not a fundamental principle it is an unlawful society for mankind by their union originally intended to subject themselves to the least evils possible an immediate punishment is more useful because the smaller the interval of time between the punishment and the crime the stronger and more lasting will be the association of the two ideas of crime and punishment so that they may be considered one as the cause and the other as the unavoidable and necessary effect it is demonstrated that the association of ideas is the cement which unites the fabric of the human intellect without which pleasure and pain would be simple and ineffectual sensations the vulgar that is all men who have no general ideas or universal principles act in consequence of the most immediate and familiar associations but the more    remote and complex only present themselves to the minds of those who are passionately attached to a single object or to those of greater understanding who have acquired an habit of rapidly comparing together a number of objects and of forming a conclusion and the result that is the action in consequence by these means becomes less dangerous and uncertain it is then of the greatest importance that the punishment should succeed the crime as immediately as possible if we intend that in the rude minds of the multitude the seducing picture of the advantage arising from the crime should instantly awake the attendant idea of punishment delaying the punishment serves only to separate these two ideas and thus affects the minds of the spectators rather as being a terrible sight than the necessary consequence of a crime the horror of which should contribute to heighten the idea of the punishment there is another excellent method of strengthening this important connection between the ideas of crime and punishment that is to make the punishment as analagous as possible to the nature of the crime in order that the punishment may lead the mind to consider the crime in a different point of view from that in which it was    placed by the flattering idea of promised advantages crimes of less importance are commonly punished either in the obscurity of a prison or the criminal is transported to give by his slavery an example to societies which he never offended an example absolutely useless because distant from the place where the crime was committed men do not in general commit great crimes deliberately but rather in a sudden gust of passion and they commonly look on the punishment due to a great crime as remote and improbable the public punishment therefore of small crimes will make a greater impression and by deterring men from the smaller will effectually prevent the greater    chapter xx of acts of violence some crimes relate to person others to property the first ought to be punished corporally the great and rich should by no means have it in their power to set a price on the security of the weak and indigent for then riches which under the protection of the laws are the reward of industry would become the aliment of tyranny liberty is at an end whenever the laws permit that in certain cases a man may cease to be a person and become a thing then will the powerful employ their address to select from the various combinations of civil society all that is in their own favour this is that magic art which transforms subjects into beasts of burden and which in the hands of the strong is the chain that binds the the weak and incautious thus it is that in some governments where there is all the appearance of liberty tyranny lies concealed and insinuates itself into some neglected corner of the constitution where it gathers strength insensibly mankind    generally oppose with resolution the assaults of barefaced and open tyranny but disregard the little insect that gnaws through the dyke and opens a sure though secret passage to inundation chapter xxi of the punishment of the nobles what punishments shall be ordained for the nobles whose privileges make so great a part of the laws of nations i do not mean to inquire whether the hereditary distinction between nobles and commoners be useful in any government or necessary in a monarchy or whether it be true that they form an intermediate power of use in moderating the excesses of both extremes or whether they be not rather slaves to their own body and to others confining within a very small circle the natural effects and hopes of industry like those little fruitful spots scattered here and there in the sandy deserts of arabia or    whether it be true that a subordination of rank and condition is inevitable or useful in society and if so whether this subordination should not rather subsist between individuals than particular bodies whether it should not rather circulate through the whole body politic than be confined to one part and rather than be perpetual should it not be incessantly produced and destroyed be these as they may i assert that the punishment of a nobleman should in no wise differ from that of the lowest member of society every lawful distinction either in honours or riches supposes previous equality founded on the laws on which all the members of society are considered as being equally dependent we should suppose that men in renouncing their natural despotism said the wisest and most industrious among us shall obtain the greatest honours and his dignity shall descend to his posterity the fortunate and happy may hope for greater honours but let him not therefore be less afraid than others of violating those conditions on which he is exalted it is true indeed that no such decrees were ever made in a general diet of mankind but they exist in the invariable relations of things nor do they destroy the advantages which are supposed to be produced by the class of nobles but prevent the inconveniencies  0 and they make the laws respectable by destroying all hopes of impunity it may be objected that the same punishment inflicted on a nobleman and a plebeian becomes really different from the difference of their education and from the infamy it reflects on an illustrious family but i answer that punishments are to be estimated not by the sensibility of the criminal but by the injury done to society which injury is augmented by the high rank of the offender the precise equality of a punishment can never be more than external as it is in proportion to the degree of sensibility which differs in every individual the infamy of an innocent family may be easily obliterated by some public demonstration of favour from the sovereign and forms have always more influence than reason on the gazing multitude    chapter xxii of robbery the punishment of robbery not accompanied with violence should be pecuniary he who endeavours to enrich himself with the property of another should be deprived of part of his own but this crime alas is commonly the effect of misery and despair the crime of that unhappy part of mankind to whom the right of exclusive property a terrible and perhaps unnecessary right has left but a bare existence besides as pecuniary punishment may increase the number of poor and may deprive an innocent family of subsistence the most proper punishment will be that kind of slavery which alone can be called just that is which makes the society for a time absolute master of the person and labour of the criminal in order to oblige him to repair by this dependence the unjust despotism he usurped over the property of another and his violation of the social compact when robbery is attended with violence corporal    punishment should be added to slavery many writers have shown the evident disorder which must arise from not distinguishing the punishment due to robbery with violence and that due to theft or robbery committed with dexterity absurdly making a sum of money equivalent to a mans life but it can never be superfluous to repeat again and again those truths of which mankind have not profited for political machines preserve their motion much longer than others and receive a new impulse with more difficulty these crimes are in their nature absolutely different and this axiom is as certain in politics as in mathematics that between qualities of different natures there can be no similitude chapter xxiii of infamy considered as a punishment those injuries which affect the honour that is that just portion of esteem which every citizen has a right to expect from others should be punished with infamy infamy is a mark of the    public disapprobation which deprives the object of all consideration in the eyes of his fellow citizens of the confidence of his country and of that fraternity which exists between members of the same society this is not always in the power of the laws it is necessary that the infamy inflicted by the laws should be the same with that which results from the relations of things from universal morality or from that particular system adopted by the nation and the laws which governs the opinion of the vulgar if on the contrary one be different from the other either the laws will no longer be respected or the received notions of morality and probity will vanish in spite of the declamations of moralists which are weak to resist the force of example if we declare those actions infamous which are in themselves indifferent we lessen the infamy of those which are really infamous the punishment of infamy should not be too frequent for the power of opinion grows weaker by repetition nor should it be inflicted on a number of persons at the same time for the infamy of many resolves itself into the infamy of none painful and corporal punishments should never be applied to fanaticism for being founded on pride it glories in persecution infamy and ridicule    only should be employed against fanatics if the first their pride will be overbalanced by the pride of the people and we may judge of the power of the second if we consider that even truth is obliged to summon all her force when attacked by error armed with ridicule thus by opposing one passion to another and opinion to opinion a wise legislator puts an end to the admiration of the populace occasioned by a false principle the original absurdity of which is veiled by some welldeduced consequences this is the method to avoid confounding the immutable relations of things or opposing nature whose actions not being limited by time but operating incessantly overturn and destroy all those vain regulations which contradict her laws it is not only in the fine arts that the imitation of nature is the fundamental principle it is the same in sound policy which is no other than the art of uniting and directing to the same end the natural and immutable sentiments of mankind    chapter xxiv of idleness a wise government will not suffer in the midst of labour and industry that kind of political idleness which is confounded by rigid declaimers with the leisure attending riches acquired by industry which is of use to an increasing society when confined within proper limits i call those politically idle who neither contribute to the good of society by their labour nor their riches who continually accumulate but never spend and are reverenced by the vulgar with stupid admiration and regarded by the wise with disdain who being victims to a monastic life and deprived of all incitement to the activity which is necessary to preserve or increase its comforts devote all their vigour to passions of the strongest kind the passions of opinion i call him not idle who enjoys the fruits of the virtues or vices of his ancestors and in exchange for his pleasures supports the industrious poor it is not then the    narrow virtue of austere moralists but the laws that should determine what species of idleness deserves punishment chapter xxv of banishment and confiscation he who disturbs the public tranquillity who does not obey the laws who violates the conditions on which men mutually support and defend each other ought to be excluded from society that is banished it seems as if banishment should be the punishment of those who being accused of an atrocious crime are probably but not certainly guilty for this purpose would be required a law the least arbitrary and the most precise possible which should condemn to banishment those who have reduced the community to the fatal alternative either of fearing or punishing them unjustly still however leaving them the sacred right of proving their innocence the    reasons ought to be stronger for banishing a citizen than a stranger and for the first accusation than for one who hath been often excused should the person who is excluded for ever from society be deprived of his property this question may be considered in different lights the confiscation of effects added to banishment is a greater punishment than banishment alone there ought then to be some cases in which according to the crime either the whole fortune should be confiscated or part only or none at all the whole should be forfeited when the law which ordains banishment declares at the same time that all connections between the society and the criminal are annihilated in this case the citizen dies the man only remains and with respect to a political body the death of the citizen should have the same consequences with the death of the man it seems to follow then that in this case the effects of the criminal should devolve to his lawful heirs but it is not on account of this refinement that i disapprove of confiscations if some have insisted that they were a restraint to vengeance and the violence of particulars they have not reflected that though punishments be productive of good they are not on that account more just to be just they must be necessary    even an useful injustice can never be allowed by a legislator who means to guard against watchful tyranny which under the flattering pretext of momentary advantages would establish permanent principles of destruction and to procure the ease of a few in a high station would draw tears from thousands of the poor the law which ordains confiscations sets a price on the head of the subject with the guilty punishes the innocent and by reducing them to indigence and despair tempts them to become criminal can there be a more melancholy spectacle than a whole family overwhelmed with infamy and misery from the crime of their chief a crime which if it had been possible they were restrained from preventing by that submission which the laws themselves have ordained    chapter xxvi of the spirit of family in states it is remarkable that many fatal acts of injustice have been authorised and approved even by the wisest and most experienced men in the freest republics this has been owing to their having considered the state rather as a society of families than of men let us suppose a nation composed of an hundred thousand men divided into twenty thousand families of five persons each including the head or master of the family its representative if it be an association of families there will be twenty thousand men and eighty thousand slaves if of men there will be an hundred thousand citizens and not one slave in the first case we behold a republic and twenty thousand little monarchies of which the heads are the sovereigns in the second the spirit of liberty will not only breathe in every public place of the city and in the assemblies of the nation but in private houses where men find the greatest part of their happiness or misery as laws  0 and customs are always the effect of a republic if the society be an association of the heads of families the spirit of monarchy will gradually make its way into the republic itself as its effects will only be restrained by the opposite interests of each and not by an universal spirit of liberty and equality the private spirit of family is a spirit of minuteness and confined to little concerns public spirit on the contrary is influenced by general principles and from facts deduces general rules of utility to the greatest number in a republic of families the children remain under the authority of the father as long as he lives and are obliged to wait until death for an existence dependent on the laws alone accustomed to kneel and tremble in their tender years when their natural sentiments were less restrained by that caution obtained by experienee which is called moderation how should they resist those obstacles which vice always opposes to virtue in the languor and decline of age when the despair of reaping the fruits is alone sufficient to damp the vigour of their resolutions in a republic where every man is a citizen family subordination is not the effect of compulsion but of contract and the sons disengaged from the natural dependence which the weakness    of infancy and the necessity of education required become free members of society but remain subject to the head of the family for their own advantage as in the great society in a republic of families the young people that is the most numerous and most useful part of the nation are at the discretion of their fathers in a republic of men they are attached to their parents by no other obligation than that sacred and inviolable one of mutual assistance and of gratitude for the benefits they have received a sentiment destroyed not so much by the wickedness of the human heart as by a mistaken subjection prescribed by the laws these contradictions between the laws of families and the fundamental laws of a state are the source of many others between public and private morality which produce a perpetual conflict in the mind domestic morality inspires submission and fear the other courage and liberty that instructs a man to confine his beneficence to a small number of persons not of his own choice this to extend it to all mankind that commands a continual sacrifice of himself to a vain idol called the good of the family which is often no real good to any one of those who compose it this teaches him to consider his own advanatge    without offending the laws or excites him to sacrifice himself for the good of his country by rewarding him beforehand with the fanaticism it inspires such contradictions are the reason that men neglect the pursuit of virtue which they can hardly distinguish midst the obscurity and confusion of natural and moral objects how frequently are men upon a retrospection of their actions astonished to find themselves dishonest in proportion to the increase of society each member becomes a smaller part of the whole and the republican spirit diminishes in the same proportion if neglected by the laws political societies like the human body have their limits circumscribed which they cannot exceed without disturbing their economy it seems as if the greatness of a state ought to be inversely as the sensibility and activity of the individuals if on the contrary population and inactivity increase in the same proportion the laws will with difficulty prevent the crimes arising from the good they have produced an overgrown republic can only be saved from despotism by subdividing it into a number of confederate republics but how is this practicable by a despotic dictator who with the courage of sylla has as much genius for building up as that roman had for pulling down    if he be an ambitious man his reward will be immortal glory if a philosopher the blessings of his fellow citizens will sufficiently console him for the loss of authority though he should not be insensible to their ingratitude in proportion as the sentiments which unite us to the state grow weaker those which attach us to the objects which more immediately surround us grow stronger therefore in the most despotic government friendships are more durable and domestic virtues which are always of the lowest class are the most common or the only virtues existing hence it appears how confined have been the views of the greatest number of legislators chapter xxvii of the mildness of punishments the course of my ideas has carried me away from my subject to the elucidation of which i now return crimes are more effectually prevented by the certainty than the severity of punishment    hence in a magistrate the necessity of vigilance and in a judge of implacability which that it may become an useful virtue should be joined to a mild legislation the certainty of a small punishment will make a stronger impression than the fear of one more severe if attended with the hopes of escaping for it is the nature of mankind to be terrified at the approach of the smallest inevitable evil whilst hope the best gift of heaven hath the power of dispelling the apprehension of a greater especially if supported by examples of impunity which weakness or avarice too frequently afford if punishments be very severe men are naturally led to the perpetration of other crimes to avoid the punishment due to the first the countries and times most notorious for severity of punishments were always those in which the most bloody and inhuman actions and the most atrocious crimes were committed for the hand of the legislator and the assassin were directed by the same spirit of ferocity which on the throne dictated laws of iron to slaves and savages and in private instigated the subject to sacrifice one tyrant to make room for another in proportion as punishments become more cruel the minds of men as a fluid rises to the    same height with that which surrounds it grow hardened and insensible and the force of passions still continuing in the space of an hundred years the wheel terrifies no more than formerly the prison that a punishment may produce the effect required it is sufficient that the evil it occasions should exceed the good expected from the crime including in the calculation the certainty of the punishment and the privation of the expected advantage all severity beyond this is superfluous and therefore tyrannical men regulate their conduct by the repeated impression of evils they know and not by those with which they are unacquainted let us for example suppose two nations in one of which the greatest punishment is perpetual slavery and in the other the wheel i say that both will inspire the same degree of terror and that there can be no reasons for increasing the punishments of the first which are not equally valid for augmenting those of the second to more lasting and more ingenious modes of tormenting and so on to the most exquisite refinements of a science too well known to tyrants there are yet two other consequences of cruel punishments which counteract the purpose of their institution which was to prevent crimes    the first arises from the impossibility of establishing an exact proportion between the crime and punishment for though ingenious cruelty hath greatly multiplied the variety of torments yet the human frame can suffer only to a certain degree beyond which it is impossible to proceed be the enormity of the crime ever so great the second consequence is impunity human nature is limited no less in evil than in good excessive barbarity can never be more than temporary it being impossible that it should be supported by a permanent system of legislation for if the laws be too cruel they must be altered or anarchy and impunity will succeed is it possible without shuddering with horror to read in history of the barbarous and useless torments that were coolly invented and executed by men who were called sages who does not tremble at the thoughts of thousands of wretches whom their misery either caused or tolerated by the laws which favoured the few and outraged the many had forced in despair to return to a state of nature or accused of impossible crimes the fabric of ignorance and superstition or guilty only of having been faithful to their own principles who i say can without horror think of their being torn to pieces with slow and studied    barbarity by men endowed with the same passions and the same feelings a delightful spectacle to a fanatic multitude chapter xxviii of the punishment of death the useless profusion of punishments which has never made men better induces me to inquire whether the punishment of death be really just or useful in a wellgoverned state what right i ask have men to cut the throats of their fellowcreatures certainly not that on which the sovereignty and laws are founded the laws as i have said before are only the sum of the smallest portions of the private liberty of each individual and represent the general will which is the aggregate of that of each individual did any one ever give to others the right of taking away his life is it possible that in the smallest portions of the liberty of each sacrificed to the good of the public can be obtained the greatest    of all good life if it were so how shall it be reconciled to the maxim which tells us that a man has no right to kill himself which he certainly must have if he could give it away to another but the punishment of death is not authorised by any right for i have demonstrated that no such right exists it is therefore a war of a whole nation against a citizen whose destruction they consider as necessary or useful to the general good but if i can further demonstrate that it is neither necessary nor useful i shall have gained the cause of humanity the death of a citizen cannot be necessary but in one case when though deprived of his liberty he has such power and connections as may endanger the security of the nation when his existence may produce a dangerous revolution in the established form of government but even in this case it can only be necessary when a nation is on the verge of recovering or losing its liberty or in times of absolute anarchy when the disorders themselves hold the place of laws but in a reign of tranquillity in a form of government approved by the united wishes of the nation in a state fortified from enemies without and supported by strength within and opinion    perhaps more efficacious where all power is lodged in the hands of the true sovereign where riches can purchase pleasures and not authority there can be no necessity for taking away the life of a subject if the experience of all ages be not sufficient to prove that the punishment of death has never prevented determined men from injuring society if the example of the romans if twenty years reign of elizabeth empress of russia in which she gave the fathers of their country an example more illustrious than many conquests bought with blood if i say all this be not sufficient to persuade mankind who always suspect the voice of reason and who chuse rather to be led by authority let us consult human nature in proof of my assertion it is not the intenseness of the pain that has the greatest effect on the mind but its continuance for our sensibility is more easily and more powerfully affected by weak but by repeated impressions than by a violent but momentary impulse the power of habit is universal over every sensible being as it is by that we learn to speak to walk and to satisfy our necessities so the ideas of morality are stamped on our minds by repeated impressions the death of a criminal  00 is a terrible but momentary spectacle and therefore a less efficacious method of deterring others than the continued example of a man deprived of his liberty condemned as a beast of burden to repair by his labour the injury he has done to society if i commit such a crime says the spectator to himself i shall be reduced to that miserable condition for the rest of my life a much more powerful preventive than the fear of death which men always behold in distant obscurity the terrors of death make so slight an impression that it has not force enough to withstand the forgetfulness natural to mankind even in the most essential things especially when assisted by the passions violent impressions surprise us but their effect is momentary they are fit to produce those revolutions which instantly transform a common man into a lacedæmonian or a persian but in a free and quiet government they ought to be rather frequent than strong the execution of a criminal is to the multitude a spectacle which in some excites compassion mixed with indignation these sentiments occupy the mind much more than that salutary terror which the laws endeavour to inspire but in the contemplation of continued suffering terror is the only or at least the predominant sensation  0  the severity of a punishment should be just sufficient to excite compassion in the spectators as it is intended more for them than for the criminal a punishment to be just should have only that degree of severity which is sufficient to deter others now there is no man who upon the least reflection would put in competition the total and perpetual loss of his liberty with the greatest advantages he could possibly obtain in consequence of a crime perpetual slavery then has in it all that is necessary to deter the most hardened and determined as much as the punishment of death i say it has more there are many who can look upon death with intrepidity and firmness some through fanaticism and others through vanity which attends us even to the grave others from a desperate resolution either to get rid of their misery or cease to live but fanaticism and vanity forsake the criminal in slavery in chains and fetters in an iron cage and despair seems rather the beginning than the end of their misery the mind by collecting itself and uniting all its force can for a moment repel assailing grief but its most vigorous efforts are insufficient to resist perpetual wretchedness in all nations where death is used as punishment every example supposes a new crime committed  0  whereas in perpetual slavery every criminal affords a frequent and lasting example and if it be necessary that men should often be witnesses of the power of the laws criminals should often be put to death but this supposes a frequency of crimes and from hence this punishment will cease to have its effect so that it must be useful and useless at the same time i shall be told that perpetual slavery is as painful a punishment as death and therefore as cruel i answer that if all the miserable moments in the life of a slave were collected into one point it would be a more cruel punishment than any other but these are scattered through his whole life whilst the pain of death exerts all its force in a moment there is also another advantage in the punishment of slavery which is that it is more terrible to the spectator than to the sufferer himself for the spectator considers the sum of all his wretched moments whilst the sufferer by the misery of the present is prevented from thinking of the future all evils are increased by the imagination and the sufferer finds resources and consolation of which the spectators are ignoran who judge by their own sensibility of what passes in a mind by habit grown callous to misfortune  0  let us for a moment attend to the reasoning of a robber or assassin who is deterred from violating the laws by the gibbet or the wheel i am sensible that to develop the sentiments of ones own heart is an art which education only can teach but although a villain may not be able to give a clear account of his principles they nevertheless influence his conduct he reasons thus what are these laws that i am bound to respect which make so great a difference between me and the rich man he refuses me the farthing i ask of him and excuses himself by bidding me have recourse to labour with which he is unacquainted who made these laws the rich and the great who never deigned to visit the miserable hut of the poor who have never seen him dividing a piece of mouldy bread amidst the cries of his famished children and the tears of his wife let us break those ties fatal to the greatest part of mankind and only useful to a few indolent tyrants let us attack injustice at its source i will return to my natural state of independence i shall live free and happy on the fruits of my courage and industry a day of pain and repentance may come but it will be short and for an hour of grief i shall enjoy years of pleasure and liberty king of a small number as determined  0  as myself i will correct the mistakes of fortune and shall see those tyrants grow pale and tremble at the sight of him whom with insulting pride they would not suffer to rank with dogs and horses religion then presents itself to the mind of this lawless villain and promising him almost a certainty of eternal happiness upon the easy terms of repentance contributes much to lessen the horror of the last scene of the tragedy but he who foresees that he must pass a great number of years even his whole life in pain and slavery a slave to those laws by which he was protected in sight of his fellow citizens with whom he lives in freedom and society makes an useful comparison between those evils the uncertainty of his success and the shortness of the time in which he shall enjoy the fruits of his transgression the example of those wretches continually before his eyes makes a much greater impression on him than a punishment which instead of correcting makes him more obdurate the punishment of death is pernicious to society from the example of barbarity it affords if the passions or necessity of war have taught men to shed the blood of their fellow creatures the laws which are intended to moderate the ferocity of mankind should not increase it by examples  0  of barbarity the more horrible as this punishment is usually attended with formal pageantry is it not absurd that the laws which detect and punish homicide should in order to prevent murder publicly commit murder themselves what are the true and most useful laws those compacts and conditions which all would propose and observe in those moments when private interest is silent or combined with that of the public what are the natural sentiments of every person concerning the punishment of death we may read them in the contempt and indignation with which every one looks on the executioner who is nevertheless an innocent executor of the public will a good citizen who contributes to the advantage of society the instrument of the general security within as good soldiers are without what then is the origin of this contradiction why is this sentiment of mankind indelible to the scandal of reason it is that in a secret corner of the mind in which the original impressions of nature are still preserved men discover a sentiment which tells them that their lives are not lawfully in the power of any one but of that necessity only which with its iron sceptre rules the universe what must men think when they see wise  0  magistrates and grave ministers of justice with indifference and tranquillity dragging a criminal to death and whilst a wretch trembles with agony expecting the fatal stroke the judge who has condemned him with the coldest insensibility and perhaps with no small gratification from the exertion of his authority quits his tribunal to enjoy the comforts and pleasures of life they will say ah those cruel formalities of justice are a cloak to tyranny they are a secret language a solemn veil intended to conceal the sword by which we are sacrificed to the insatiable idol of despotism murder which they would represent to us as an horrible crime we see practiced by them without repugnance or remorse let us follow their example a violent death appeared terrible in their descriptions but we see that it is the affair of a moment it will be still less terrible to him who not expecting it escapes almost all the pain such is the fatal though absurd reasoning of men who are disposed to commit crimes on whom the abuse of religion has more influence than religion itself if it be objected that almost all nations in all ages have punished certain crimes with death i answer that the force of these examples vanishes when opposed to truth against which prescription  0  is urged in vain the history of mankind is an immense sea of errors in which a few obscure truths may here and there be found but human sacrifices have also been common in almost all nations that some societies only either few in number or for a very short time abstained from the punishment of death is rather favourable to my argument for such is the fate of great truths that their duration is only as a flash of lightning in the long and dark night of error the happy time is not yet arrived when truth as falsehood has been hitherto shall be the portion of the greatest number i am sensible that the voice of one philosopher is too weak to be heard amidst the clamours of a multitude blindly influenced by custom but there is a small number of sages scattered on the face of the earth who will echo to me from the bottom of their hearts and if these truths should happily force their way to the thrones of princes be it known to them that they come attended with the secret wishes of all mankind and tell the sovereign who deigns them a gracious reception that his fame shall outshine the glory of conquerors and that equitable posterity will exalt his peaceful trophies above those of a titus an antoninus or a trajan  0  how happy were mankind if laws were now to be first formed now that we see on the thrones of europe benevolent monarchs friends to the virtues of peace to the arts and sciences fathers of their people though crowned yet citizens the increase of whose authority augments the happiness of their subjects by destroying that intermediate despotism which intercepts the prayers of the people to the throne if these humane princes have suffered the old laws to subsist it is doubtless because they are deterred by the numberless obstacles which oppose the subversion of errors established by the sanction of many ages and therefore every wise citizen will wish for the increase of their authority chapter xxix of imprisonment that a magistrate the executor of the laws should have a power to imprison a citizen to deprive the man he hates of his liberty upon  0  frivolous pretences and to leave his friend unpunished notwithstanding the strongest proofs of his guilt is an error as common as it is contrary to the end of society which is personal security imprisonment is a punishment which differs from all other in this particular that it necessarily precedes conviction but this difference does not destroy a circumstance which is essential and common to it with all other punishments viz that it should never be inflicted but when ordained by the law the law should therefore determine the crime the presumption and the evidence sufficient to subject the accused to imprisonment and examination public report his flight his extrajudicial confession that of an accomplice menaces and his constant enmity with the person injured the circumstances of the crime and such other evidence may be sufficient to justify the imprisonment of a citizen but the nature of this evidence should be determined by the laws and not by the magistrates whose decrees are always contrary to political liberty when they are not particular applications of a general maxim of the public code when punishments become less severe and prisons less horrible when compassion and humanity shall penetrate the iron gates of dungeons and direct the   0 obdurate and inexorable ministers of justice the laws may then be satisfied with weaker evidence for imprisonment a person accused imprisoned tried and acquitted ought not to be branded with any degree of infamy among the romans we see that many accused of very great crimes and afterwards declared innocent were respected by the people and honoured with employments in the state but why is the fate of an innocent person so different in this age it is because the present system of penal laws presents to our minds an idea of power rather than of justice it is because the accused and convicted are thrown indiscriminately into the same prison because imprisonment is rather a punishment than a means of securing the person of the accused and because the interior power which defends the laws and the exterior which defends the throne and kingdom are separate when they should be united if the first were under the common authority of the laws combined with the right of judging but not however immediately dependent on the magistrate the pomp that attends a military corps would take off the infamy which like all popular opinions is more attached to the manner and form than to the     thing itself as may be seen in military imprisonment which in the common opinion is not so disgraceful as the civil but the barbarity and ferocity of our ancestors the hunters of the north still subsist among the people in our customs and our laws which are always several ages behind the actual refinements of a nation chapter xxx of prosecution and prescription the proofs of the crime being obtained and the certainty of it determined it is necessary to allow the criminal the time and means for his justification but a time so short as not to diminish that promptitude of punishment which as we have shewn is one of the most powerful means of preventing crimes a mistaken humanity may object to the shortness of the time but the force of the objection will vanish if we consider that the danger of the innocent increases with the defects of the legislation     the time for inquiry and for justification should be fixed by the laws and not by the judge who in that case would become legislator with regard to atrocious crimes which are long remembered when they are once proved if the criminal have fled no time should be allowed but in less considerable and more obscure crimes a time should be fixed after which the delinquent should be no longer uncertain of his fate for in the latter case the length of time in which the crime is almost forgotten prevents the example of impunity and allows the criminal to amend and become a better member of society general principles will here be sufficient it being impossible to fix precisely the limits of time for any given legislation or for any society in any particular circumstance i shall only add that in a nation willing to prove the utility of moderate punishment laws which according to the nature of the crime increase or diminish the time of inquiry and justification considering the imprisonment or the voluntary exile of the criminal as a part of the punishment will form an easy division of a small number of mild punishments for a great number of crimes but it must be observed the time for inquiry and justification should not increase in direct     proportion to the atrociousness of crimes for the probability of such crimes having been committed is inversely as their atrociousness therefore the time for inquiring ought in some cases to be diminished and that for justification increased and vice versa this may appear to contradict what i have said above namely that equal punishments may be decreed for unequal crimes by considering the time allowed the criminal or the prison as a punishment in order to explain this idea i shall divide crimes into two classes the first comprehends homicide and all greater crimes the second crimes of an inferior degree this distinction is founded in human nature the preservation of life is a natural right the preservation of property is a right of society the motives that induce men to shake off the natural sentiment of compassion which must be destroyed before great crimes can be committed are much less in number than those by which from the natural desire of being happy they are instigated to violate a right which is not founded in the heart of man but is the work of society the different degrees of probability in these two classes require that they should be regulated on different principles in the greatest crimes as they are less frequent     and the probability of the innocence of the accused being greater the time allowed him for his justification should be greater and the time of inquiry less for by hastening the definitive sentence the flattering hopes of impunity are destroyed which are more dangerous as the crime is more atrocious on the contrary in crimes of less importance the probability of the innocence being less the time of inquiry should be greater and that of justification less as impunity is not so dangerous but this division of crimes into two classes should not be admitted if the consequences of impunity were in proportion to the probability of the crime it should be considered that a person accused whose guilt or innocence is not determined for want of proofs may be again imprisoned for the same crime and be subject to a new trial if fresh evidence arises within the time fixed this is in my opinion the best method of providing at the same time for the security and liberty of the subject without favouring one at the expence of the other which may easily happen since both these blessings the inalienable and equal patrimony of every citizen are liable to be invaded the one by open or disguised despotism and the other by tumultuous and popular anarchy     chapter xxxi of crimes of difficult proof with the foregoing principles in view it will appear astonishing that reason hardly ever presided at the formation of the laws of nations that the weakest and most equivocal evidence and even conjectures have been thought sufficient proof for crimes the most atrocious and therefore most improbable the most obscure and chimerical as if it were the interest of the laws and the judge not to inquire into the truth but to prove the crime as if there was not a greater risk of condemning an innocent person when the probability of his guilt is less the generality of men want that vigour of mind and resolution which are as necessary for great crimes as for great virtues and which at the same time produce both the one and the other in those nations which are supported by the activity of their government and a passion for the public good for in those which subsist by their greatness or power or by the goodness     of their laws the passions being in a weaker degree seem calculated rather to maintain than to improve the form of government this naturally leads us to an important conclusion viz that great crimes do always produce the destruction of a nation there are some crimes which though frequent in society are of difficult proof a circumstance admitted as equal to the probability of the innocence of the accused but as the frequency of these crimes is not owing to their impunity so much as to other causes the danger of their passing unpunished is of less importance and therefore the time of examination and prescription may be equally diminished these principles are different from those commonly received for it is in crimes which are proved with the greatest difficulty such as adultery and sodomy that presumptions halfproofs etc are admitted as if a man could be half innocent and half guilty that is half punishable and half absolvable it is in these cases that torture should exercise its cruel power on the person of the accused the witnesses and even his whole family as with unfeeling indifference some civilians have taught who pretend to dictate laws to nations     adultery is a crime which politically considered owes its existence to two causes viz pernicious laws and the powerful attraction between the sexes this attraction is similar in many circumstances to gravity the spring of motion in the universe like this it is diminished by distance one regulates the motions of the body the other of the soul but they differ in one respect the force of gravity decreases in proportion to the obstacles that oppose it the other gathers strength and vigour as the obstacles increase if i were speaking to nations guided only by the laws of nature i would tell them that there is a considerable difference between adultery and all other crimes adultery proceeds from an abuse of that necessity which is constant and universal in human nature a necessity anterior to the formation of society and indeed the founder of society itself whereas all other crimes tend to the destruction of society and arise from momentary passions and not from a natural necessity it is the opinion of those who have studied history and mankind that this necessity is constantly in the same degree in the same climate if this be true useless or rather pernicious must all laws and customs be which tend to diminish the sum total of the effects of     this passion such laws would only burden one part of the society with the additional necessities of the other but on the contrary wise are the laws which following the natural course of the river divide the stream into a number of equal branches preventing thus both sterility and inundation conjugal fidelity is always greater in proportion as marriages are more numerous and less difficult but when the interest or pride of families or paternal authority not the inclination of the parties unite the sexes gallantry soon breaks the slender ties in spite of common moralists who exclaim against the effect whilst they pardon the cause but these reflections are useless to those who living in the true religion act from sublimer motives which correct the eternal laws of nature the act of adultery is a crime so instantaneous so mysterious and so concealed by the veil which the laws themselves have woven a veil necessary indeed but so transparent as to heighten rather than conceal the charms of the object the opportunities are so frequent and the danger of discovery so easily avoided that it were much easier for the laws to prevent this crime than to punish it when committed     to every crime which from its nature must frequently remain unpunished the punishment is an incentive such is the nature of the human mind that difficulties if not insurmountable nor too great for our natural indolence embellish the object and spur us on to the pursuit they are so many barriers that confine the imagination to the object and oblige us to consider it in every point of view in this agitation the mind naturally inclines and fixes itself to the most agreeable part studiously avoiding every idea that might create disgust the crime of sodomy so severely punished by the laws and for the proof of which are employed tortures which often triumph over innocence itself has its source much less in the passions of man in a free and independent state than in society and a slave it is much less the effect of a satiety in pleasures than of that education which in order to make men useful to others begins by making them useless to themselves in those public seminaries where ardent youth are carefully excluded from all commerce with the other sex as the vigour of nature blooms it is consumed in a manner not only useless to mankind but which accelerates the approach of old age   0 the murder of bastard children is in like manner the effect of a cruel dilemma in which a woman finds herself who has been seduced through weakness or overcome by force the alternative is her own infamy or the death of a being who is incapable of feeling the loss of life how can she avoid preferring the last to the inevitable misery of herself and her unhappy infant the best method of preventing this crime would be effectually to protect the weak woman from that tyranny which exaggerates all vices that cannot be concealed under the cloak of virtue i do not pretend to lessen that just abhorrence which these crimes deserve but to discover the sources from whence they spring and i think i may draw the following conclusions that the punishment of a crime cannot be just that is necessary if the laws have not endeavoured to prevent that crime by the best means which times and circumstances would allow     chapter xxxii of suicide suicide is a crime which seems not to admit of punishment properly speaking for it cannot be inflicted but on the innocent or upon an insensible dead body in the first case it is unjust and tyrannical for political liberty supposes all punishments entirely personal in the second it has the same effect by way of example as the scourging a statue mankind love life too well the objects that surround them the seducing phantom of pleasure and hope that sweetest error of mortals which makes men swallow such large draughts of evil mingled with a very few drops of good allure them too strongly to apprehend that this crime will ever be common from its unavoidable impunity the laws are obeyed through fear of punishment but death destroys all sensibility what motive then can restrain the desperate hand of suicide he who kills himself does a less injury to society than he who quits his country for ever     for the other leaves his property behind him but this carries with him at least a part of his substance besides as the strength of a society consists in the number of citizens he who quits one nation to reside in another becomes a double loss this then is the question whether it be advantageous to society that its members should enjoy the unlimited privilege of migration every law that is not armed with force or which from circumstances must be ineffectual should not be promulgated opinion which reigns over the minds of men obeys the slow and indirect impressions of the legislator but resists them when violently and directly applied and useless laws communicate their insignificance to the most salutary which are regarded more as obstacles to be surmounted than as safeguards of the public good but further our perceptions being limited by enforcing the observance of laws which are evidently useless we destroy the influence of the most salutary from this principle a wise dispenser of public happiness may draw some useful consequences the explanation of which would carry me too far from my subject which is to prove the inutility of making the nation a prison such a law is vain because unless inaccessible rocks or impassable     seas divide the country from all others how will it be possible to secure every point of the circumference or how will you guard the guards themselves besides this crime once committed cannot be punished and to punish it before hand would be to punish the intention and not the action the will which is entirely out of the power of human laws to punish the absent by confiscating his effects besides the facility of collusion which would inevitably be the case and which without tyranny could not be prevented would put a stop to all commerce with other nations to punish the criminal when he returns would be to prevent him from repairing the evil he had already done to society by making his absence perpetual besides any prohibition would increase the desire of removing and would infallibly prevent strangers from settling in the country what must we think of a government which has no means but fear to keep its subjects in their own country to which by the first impressions of their infancy they are so strongly attached the most certain method of keeping men at home is to make them happy and it is the interest of every state to turn the balance not only of commerce but of felicity in favour     of its subjects the pleasures of luxury are not the principal sources of this happiness though by preventing the too great accumulation of wealth in few hands they become a necessary remedy against the too great inequality of individuals which always increases with the progress of society when the populousness of a country does not increase in proportion to its extent luxury favours despotism for where men are most dispersed there is least industry the dependence of the poor upon the luxury of the rich is greatest and the union of the oppressed against the oppressors is least to be feared in such circumstances rich and powerful men more easily command distinction respect and service by which they are raised to a greater height above the poor for men are more independent the less they are observed and are least observed when most numerous on the contrary when the number of people is too great in proportion to the extent of a country luxury is a check to despotism because it is a spur to industry and because the labour of the poor affords so many pleasures to the rich that they disregard the luxury of ostentation which would remind the people of their dependence hence we see that     in vast and depopulated states the luxury of ostentation prevails over that of convenience but in the countries more populous the luxury of convenience tends constantly to diminish the luxury of ostentation the pleasures of luxury have this inconvenience that though they employ a great number of hands yet they are only enjoyed by a few whilst the rest who do not partake of them feel the want more sensibly on comparing their state with that of others security and liberty restrained by the laws are the basis of happiness and when attended by these the pleasures of luxury favour population without which they become the instrument of tyranny as the most noble and generous animals fly to solitude and inaccessible deserts and abandon the fertile plains to man their greatest enemy so men reject pleasure itself when offered by the hand of tyranny but to return if it be demonstrated that the laws which imprison men in their own country are vain and unjust it will be equally true of those which punish suicide for that can only be punished after death which is in the power of god alone but it is no crime with regard to man because the punishment falls on     an innocent family if it be objected that the consideration of such a punishment may prevent the crime i answer that he who can calmly renounce the pleasure of existence who is so weary of life as to brave the idea of eternal misery will never be influenced by the more distant and less powerful considerations of family and children chapter xxxiii of smuggling smuggling is a real offence against the sovereign and the nation but the punishment should not brand the offender with infamy because this crime is not infamous in the public opinion by inflicting infamous punishments for crimes that are not reputed so we destroy that idea where it may be useful if the same punishment be decreed for killing a pheasant as for killing a man or for forgery all difference between those crimes will shortly vanish it is thus that moral sentiments are destroyed in the heart of man     sentiments the work of many ages and of much bloodshed sentiments that are so slowly and with so much difficulty produced and for the establishment of which such sublime motives and such an apparatus of ceremonies were thought necessary this crime is owing to the laws themselves for the higher the duties the greater is the advantage and consequently the temptation which temptation is increased by the facility of perpetration when the circumference that is guarded is of great extent and the merchandise prohibited is small in bulk the seizure and loss of the goods attempted to be smuggled together with those that are found along with them is just but it would be better to lessen the duty because men risk only in proportion to the advantage expected this crime being a theft of what belongs to the prince and consequently to the nation why is it not attended with infamy i answer that crimes which men consider as productive of no bad consequences to themselves do not interest them sufficiently to excite their indignation the generality of mankind upon whom remote consequences make no impression do not see the evil that may result from the practice of smuggling     especially if they reap from it any present advantage they only perceive the loss sustained by the prince they are not then interested in refusing their esteem to the smuggler as to one who has committed a theft or a forgery or other crimes by which they themselves may suffer from this evident principle that a sensible being only interests himself in those evils with which he is acquainted shall this crime then committed by one who has nothing to lose go unpunished no there are certain species of smuggling which so particularly affect the revenue a part of government so essential and managed with so much difficulty that they deserve imprisonment or even slavery but yet of such a nature as to be proportioned to the crime for example it would be highly unjust that a smuggler of tobacco should suffer the same punishment with a robber or assassin but it would be most conformable to the nature of the offence that the produce of his labour should be applied to the use of the crown which he intended to defraud     chapter xxxiv of bankrupts the necessity of good faith in contracts and the support of commerce oblige the legislature to secure for the creditors the persons of bankrupts it is however necessary to distinguish between the fraudulent and the honest bankrupt the fraudulent bankrupt should be punished in the same manner with him who adulterates the coin for to falsify a piece of coin which is a pledge of the mutual obligation between citizens is not a greater crime than to violate the obligations themselves but the bankrupt who after a strict examination has proved before proper judges that either the fraud or losses of others or misfortunes unavoidable by human prudence have stript him of his substance upon what barbarous pretence is he thrown into prison and deprived of the only remaining good the melancholy enjoyment of mere liberty why is he ranked with criminals and in despair compelled to repent of his honesty conscious of his innocence   0 he lived easy and happy under the protection of those laws which it is true he violated but not intentionally laws dictated by the avarice of the rich and accepted by the poor seduced by that universal flattering hope which makes men believe that all unlucky accidents are the lot of others and the most fortunate only their share mankind when influenced by the first impressions love cruel laws although being subject to them themselves it is the interest of every person that they should be as mild as possible but the fear of being injured is always more prevalent than the intention of injuring others but to return to the honest bankrupt let his debt if you will not be considered as cancelled till the payment of the whole let him be refused the liberty of leaving the country without leave of his creditors or of carrying into another nation that industry which under a penalty he should be obliged to employ for their benefit but what pretences can justify the depriving an innocent though unfortunate man of his liberty without the least utility to his creditors but say they the hardships of confinement will induce him to discover his fraudulent transactions an event that can hardly be supposed after a rigorous examination of his conduct and     affairs but if they are not discovered he will escape unpunished it is i think a maxim of government that the importance of the political inconveniences arising from the impunity of a crime are directly as the injury to the public and inversely as the difficulty of proof it will be necessary to distinguish fraud attended with aggravating circumstances from simple fraud and that from perfect innocence for the first let there be ordained the same punishment as for forgery for the second a less punishment but with the loss of liberty and if perfectly honest let the bankrupt himself chuse the method of reestablishing himself and of satisfying his creditors or if he should appear not to have been strictly honest let that be determined by his creditors but these distinctions should be fixed by the laws which alone are impartial and not by the arbitrary and dangerous prudence of judges     with what ease might a sagacious legislator prevent the greatest part of fraudulent bankruptcies and remedy the misfortunes that befal the honest and industrious a public register of all contracts with the liberty of consulting it allowed to every citizen a public fund formed by a contribution of the opulent merchants for the timely assistance of unfortunate industry were establishments that could produce no real inconveniences and many advantages but unhappily the most simple the easiest yet the wisest laws that wait only for the nod of the legislator to diffuse through nations wealth power and felicity laws which would be regarded by future generations with eternal gratitude are either unknown or rejected a restless and trifling spirit the timid prudence of the present moment a distrust and aversion to the most useful novelties possess the minds of those who are empowered to regulate the actions of mankind     chapter xxxv of sanctuaries are sanctuaries just is a convention between nations mutually to give up their criminals useful in the whole extent of a political state there should be no place independent of the laws their power should follow every subject as the shadow follows the body sanctuaries and impunity differ only in degree and as the effect of punishment depends more on their certainty than their greatness men are more strongly invited to crimes by sanctuaries than they are deterred by punishment to increase the number of sanctuaries is to erect so many little sovereignties for when the laws have no power new bodies will be formed in opposition to the public good and a spirit established contrary to that of the state history informs us that from the use of sanctuaries have arisen the greatest revolutions in kingdoms and in opinions some have pretended that in whatever country     a crime that is an action contrary to the laws of society be committed the criminal may be justly punished for it in any other as if the character of subject were indelible or synonimous with or worse than that of slave as if a man could live in one country and be subject to the laws of another or be accountable for his actions to two sovereigns or two codes of laws often contradictory there are also who think that an act of cruelty committed for example at constantinople may be punished at paris for this abstracted reason that he who offends humanity should have enemies in all mankind and be the object of universal execration as if judges were to be the knightserrant of human nature in general rather than guardians of particular conventions between men the place of punishment can certainly be no other than that where the crime was committed for the necessity of punishing an individual for the general good subsists there and there only a villain if he has not broke through the conventions of a society of which by my supposition he was not a member may be feared and by force banished and excluded from that society but ought not to be formally punished by the laws which were only intended to maintain the social compact     and not to punish the intrinsic malignity of actions whether it be useful that nations should mutually deliver up their criminals although the certainty of there being no part of the earth where crimes are not punished may be a means of preventing them i shall not pretend to determine this question until laws more conformable to the necessities and rights of humanity and until milder punishments and the abolition of the arbitrary power of opinion shall afford security to virtue and innocence when oppressed and until tyranny shall be confined to the plains of asia and europe acknowledge the universal empire of reason by which the interests of sovereigns and subjects are best united chapter xxxvi of rewards for apprehending or killing criminals let us now inquire whether it be advantageous to society to set a price on the head of a criminal and so to make of every citizen an executioner     if the offender hath taken refuge in another state the sovereign encourages his subjects to commit a crime and to expose themselves to a just punishment he insults that nation and authorises the subjects to commit on their neighbours similar usurpations if the criminal still remain in his own country to set a price upon his head is the strongest proof of the weakness of the government he who has strength to defend himself will not purchase the assistance of another besides such an edict confounds all the ideas of virtue and morality already too wavering in the mind of man at one time treachery is punished by the laws at another encouraged with one hand the legislator strengthens the ties of kindred and friendship and with the other rewards the violation of both always in contradiction with himself now he invites the suspecting minds of men to mutual confidence and now he plants distrust in every heart to prevent one crime he gives birth to a thousand such are the expedients of weak nations whose laws are like temporary repairs to a tottering fabric on the contrary as a nation becomes more enlightened honesty and mutual confidence become more necessary and are daily tending to unite with sound policy     artifice cabal and obscure and indirect actions are more easily discovered and the interest of the whole is better secured against the passions of the individual even the times of ignorance when private virtue was encouraged by public morality may afford instruction and example to more enlightened ages but laws which reward treason excite clandestine war and mutual distrust oppose that necessary union of morality and policy which is the foundation of happiness and universal peace chapter xxxvii of attempts accomplices and pardon the laws do not punish the intention nevertheless an attempt which manifests the intention of committing a crime deserves a punishment though less perhaps than if the crime were actually perpetrated the importance of preventing even attempts to commit a crime sufficiently     authorises a punishment but as there may be an interval of time between the attempt and the execution it is proper to reserve the greater punishment for the actual commission that even after the attempt there may be a motive for desisting in like manner with regard to the accomplices they ought not to suffer so severe a punishment as the immediate perpetrator of the crime but this for a different reason when a number of men unite and run a common risk the greater the danger the more they endeavour to distribute it equally now if the principals be punished more severely than the accessaries it will prevent the danger from being equally divided and will increase the difficulty of finding a person to execute the crime as his danger is greater by the difference of the punishment there can be but one exception to this rule and that is when the principal receives a reward from the accomplices in that case as the difference of the danger is compensated the punishment should be equal these reflections may appear too refined to those who do not consider that it is of great importance that the laws should leave the associates as few means as possible of agreeing among themselves     in some tribunals a pardon is offered to an accomplice in a great crime if he discover his associates this expedient has its advantages the disadvantages are that the law authorises treachery which is detested even by the villains themselves and introduces crimes of cowardice which are much more pernicious to a nation than crimes of courage courage is not common and only wants a benevolent power to direct it to the public good cowardice on the contrary is a frequent selfinterested and contagious evil which can never be improved into a virtue besides the tribunal which has recourse to this method betrays its fallibility and the laws their weakness by imploring the assistance of those by whom they are violated the advantages are that it prevents great crimes the effects of which being public and the perpetrators concealed terrify the people it also contributes to prove that he who violates the laws which are public conventions will also violate private compacts it appears to me that a general law promising a reward to every accomplice who discovers his associates would be better than a special declaration in every particular case because it would prevent the union of those villains as it would inspire a mutual distrust and   0 each would be afraid of exposing himself alone to danger the accomplice however should be pardoned on condition of transportation      but it is in vain that i torment myself with endeavouring to extinguish the remorse i feel in attempting to induce the sacred laws the monument of public confidence the foundation of human morality to authorise dissimulation and perfidy but what an example does it offer to a nation to see the interpreters of the laws break their promise of pardon and on the strength of learned subtleties and to the scandal of public faith drag him to punishment who hath accepted of their invitation such examples are not uncommon and this is the reason that political society is regarded as a complex machine the springs of which are moved at pleasure by the most dexterous or most powerful     chapter xxxviii of suggestive interrogations the laws forbid suggestive interrogations that is according to the civilians questions which with regard to the circumstances of the crime are special when they should be general or in other words those questions which having an immediate reference to the crime suggest to the criminal an immediate answer interrogations according to the law ought to lead to the fact indirectly and obliquely but never directly or immediately the intent of this injunction is either that they should not suggest to the accused an immediate answer that might acquit him or that they think it contrary to nature that a man should accuse himself but whatever be the motive the laws have fallen into a palpable contradiction in condemning suggestive interrogations whilst they authorise torture can there be an interrogation more suggestive than pain torture will suggest to a robust villain an obstinate silence that he may exchange a greater punishment for a less     and to a feeble man confession to relieve him from the present pain which affects him more than the apprehension of the future if a special interrogation be contrary to the right of nature as it obliges a man to accuse himself torture will certainly do it more effectually but men are influenced more by the names than the nature of things he who obstinately refuses to answer the interrogatories deserves a punishment which should be fixed by the laws and that of the severest kind that criminals should not by their silence evade the example which they owe the public but this punishment is not necessary when the guilt of the criminal is indisputable because in that case interrogation is useless as is likewise his confession when there are without it proofs sufficient this last case is most common for experience shews that in the greatest number of criminal prosecutions the culprit pleads not guilty     chapter xxxix of a particular kind of crimes the reader will perceive that i have omitted speaking of a certain class of crimes which has covered europe with blood and raised up those horrid piles from whence midst clouds of whirling smoke the groans of human victims the crackling of their bones and the frying of their still panting bowels were a pleasing spectacle and agreeable harmony to the fanatic multitude but men of understanding will perceive that the age and country in which i live will not permit me to inquire into the nature of this crime it were too tedious and foreign to my subject to prove the necessity of a perfect uniformity of opinions in a state contrary to the examples of many nations to prove that opinions which differ from one another only in some subtile and obscure distinctions beyond the reach of human capacity may nevertheless disturb the public tranquillity unless one only religion be established by authority and that some opinions by     being contrasted and opposed to each other in their collision strike out the truth whilst others feeble in themselves require the support of power and authority it would i say carry me too far were i to prove that how odious soever is the empire of force over the opinions of mankind from whom it only obtains dissimulation followed by contempt and although it may seem contrary to the spirit of humanity and brotherly love commanded us by reason and authority which we more respect it is nevertheless necessary and indispensible we are to believe that all these paradoxes are resolved beyond a doubt and are conformable to the true interest of mankind if practised by a lawful authority i write only of crimes which violate the laws of nature and the social contract and not of sins even the temporal punishments of which must be determined from other principles than those of a limited human philosophy     chapter xl of false ideas of utility a principal source of errors and injustice are false ideas of utility for example that legislator has false ideas of utility who considers particular more than general conveniences who had rather command the sentiments of mankind than excite them and dares say to reason be thou a slave who would sacrifice a thousand real advantages to the fear of an imaginary or trifling inconvenience who would deprive men of the use of fire for fear of being burnt and of water for fear of their being drowned and who know of no means of preventing evil but by destroying it the laws of this nature are those which forbid to wear arms disarming those only who are not disposed to commit the crime which the laws mean to prevent can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity and the most important of the code will respect the less considerable and arbitrary     injunctions the violation of which is so easy and of so little comparative importance does not the execution of this law deprive the subject of that personal liberty so dear to mankind and to the wise legislator and does it not subject the innocent to all the disagreeable circumstances that should only fall on the guilty it certainly makes the situation of the assaulted worse and the assailants better and rather encourages than prevents murder as it requires less courage to attack armed than unarmed persons it is a false idea of utility that would give to a multitude of sensible beings that symmetry and order which inanimate matter is alone capable of receiving to neglect the present which are the only motives that act with force and constancy on the multitude for the more distant whose impressions are weak and transitory unless increased by that strength of imagination so very uncommon among mankind finally that is a false idea of utility which sacrificing things to names separates the public good from that of individuals there is this difference between a state of society and a state of nature that a savage does no more mischief to another than is necessary to     procure some benefit to himself but a man in society is sometimes tempted from a fault in the laws to injure another without any prospect of advantage the tyrant inspires his vassals with fear and servility which rebound upon him with double force and are the cause of his torment fear the more private and domestic it is the less dangerous is it to him who makes it the instrument of his happiness but the more it is public and the greater number of people it affects the greater is the probability that some mad desperate or designing person will seduce others to his party by flattering expectations and this will be the more easily accomplished as the danger of the enterprize will be divided amongst a great number because the value the unhappy set upon their existence is less as their misery is greater     chapter xli of the means of preventing crimes it is better to prevent crimes than to punish them this is the fundamental principle of good legislation which is the art of conducting men to the maximum of happiness and to the minimum of misery if we may apply this mathematical expression to the good and evil of life but the means hitherto employed for that purpose are generally inadequate or contrary to the end proposed it is impossible to reduce the tumultuous activity of mankind to absolute regularity for midst the various and opposite attractions of pleasure and pain human laws are not sufficient entirely to prevent disorders in society such however is the chimera of weak men when invested with authority to prohibit a number of indifferent actions is not to prevent the crimes which they may produce but to create new ones it is to change at will the ideas of virtue and vice which at other times we are told are eternal and immutable to what a situation should we be     reduced if every thing were to be forbidden that might possibly lead to a crime we must be deprived of the use of our senses for one motive that induces a man to commit a real crime there are a thousand which excite him to those indifferent actions which are called crimes by bad laws if then the probability that a crime will be committed be in proportion to the number of motives to extend the sphere of crimes will be to increase that probability the generality of laws are only exclusive privileges the tribute of all to the advantage of a few would you prevent crimes let the laws be clear and simple let the entire force of the nation be united in their defence let them be intended rather to favour every individual than any particular classes of men let the laws be feared and the laws only the fear of the laws is salutary but the fear of men is a fruitful and fatal source of crimes men enslaved are more voluptuous more debauched and more cruel than those who are in a state of freedom these study the sciences the interest of nations have great objects before their eyes and imitate them but those whose views are confined to the present moment endeavour midst the distraction of riot and debauchery to forget their situation accustomed   0 to the uncertainty of all events for the laws determine none the consequence of their crimes becomes problematical which gives an additional force to the strength of their passions in a nation indolent from the nature of the climate the uncertainty of the laws confirms and increases mens indolence and stupidity in a voluptuous but active nation this uncertainty occasions a multiplicity of cabals and intrigues which spread distrust and diffidence through the hearts of all and dissimulation and treachery are the foundation of their prudence in a brave and powerful nation this uncertainty of the laws is at last destroyed after many oscillations from liberty to slavery and from slavery to liberty again chapter xlii of the sciences would you prevent crimes let liberty be attended with knowledge as knowledge extends the disadvantages which attend it diminish and     the advantages increase a daring impostor who is always a man of some genius is adored by the ignorant populace and despised by men of understanding knowledge facilitates the comparison of objects by shewing them in different points of view when the clouds of ignorance are dispelled by the radiance of knowledge authority trembles but the force of the laws remains immoveable men of enlightened understanding must necessarily approve those useful conventions which are the foundation of public safety they compare with the highest satisfaction the inconsiderable portion of liberty of which they are deprived with the sum total sacrificed by others for their security observing that they have only given up the pernicious liberty of injuring their fellowcreatures they bless the throne and the laws upon which it is established it is false that the sciences have always been prejudicial to mankind when they were so the evil was inevitable the multiplication of the human species on the face of the earth introduced war the rudiments of arts and the first laws which were temporary compacts arising from necessity and perishing with it this was the first philosophy and its few elements were     just as indolence and want of sagacity in the early inhabitants of the world preserved them from error but necessities increasing with the number of mankind stronger and more lasting impressions were necessary to prevent their frequent relapses into a state of barbarity which became every day more fatal the first religious errors which peopled the earth with false divinities and created a world of invisible beings to govern the visible creation were of the utmost service to mankind the greatest benefactors to humanity were those who dared to deceive and led pliant ignorance to the foot of the altar by presenting to the minds of the vulgar things out of the reach of their senses which fled as they pursued and always eluded their grasp which as they never comprehended they never despised their different passions were united and attached to a single object this was the first transition of all nations from their savage state such was the necessary and perhaps the only bond of all societies at their first formation i speak not of the chosen people of god to whom the most extraordinary miracles and the most signal favours supplied the place of human policy but as it is the nature of error to subdivide     itself ad infinitum so the pretended knowledge which sprung from it transformed mankind into a blind fanatic multitude jarring and destroying each other in the labyrinth in which they were inclosed hence it is not wonderful that some sensible and philosophic minds should regret the ancient state of barbarity this was the first epocha in which knowledge or rather opinions were fatal the second may be found in the difficult and terrible passage from error to truth from darkness to light the violent shock between a mass of errors useful to the few and powerful and the truths so important to the many and the weak with the fermentation of passions excited on that occasion were productive of infinite evils to unhappy mortals in the study of history whose principal periods after certain intervals much resemble each other we frequently find in the necessary passage from the obscurity of ignorance to the light of philosophy and from tyranny to liberty its natural consequence one generation sacrificed to the happiness of the next but when this flame is extinguished and the world delivered from its evils truth after a very slow progress sits down with monarchs on the throne and is worshiped in the assemblies of     nations shall we then believe that light diffused among the people is more destructive than darkness and that the knowledge of the relations of things can never be fatal to mankind ignorance may indeed be less fatal than a small degree of knowledge because this adds to the evils of ignorance the inevitable errors of a confined view of things on this side the bounds of truth but a man of enlightened understanding appointed guardian of the laws is the greatest blessing that a sovereign can bestow on a nation such a man is accustomed to behold truth and not to fear it unacquainted with the greatest part of those imaginary and insatiable necessities which so often put virtue to the proof and accustomed to contemplate mankind from the most elevated point of view he considers the nation as his family and his fellow citizens as brothers the distance between the great and the vulgar appears to him the less as the number of mankind he has in view is greater the philosopher has necessities and interests unknown to the vulgar and the chief of these is not to belie in public the principles he taught in obscurity and the habit of loving virtue for its own sake a few such philosophers would constitute the happiness of a nation which however     would be but of short duration unless by good laws the number were so increased as to lessen the probability of an improper choice chapter xliii of magistrates another method of preventing crimes is to make the observance of the laws and not their violation the interest of the magistrate the greater the number of those who constitute the tribunal the less is the danger of corruption because the attempt will be more difficult and the power and temptation of each individual will be proportionably less if the sovereign by pomp and the austerity of edicts and by refusing to hear the complaints of the oppressed accustom his subjects to respect the magistrates more than the laws the magistrates will gain indeed but it will be at the expence of public and private security     chapter xliv of rewards yet another method of preventing crimes is to reward virtue upon this subject the laws of all nations are silent if the rewards proposed by academies for the discovery of useful truths have increased our knowledge and multiplied good books is it not probable that rewards distributed by the beneficent hand of a sovereign would also multiply virtuous actions the coin of honour is inexhaustible and is abundantly fruitful in the hands of a prince who distributes it wisely     chapter xlv of education finally the most certain method of preventing crimes is to perfect the system of education but this is an object too vast and exceeds my plan an object if i may venture to declare it which is so intimately connected with the nature of government that it will always remain a barren spot cultivated only by a few wise men a great man who is persecuted by that world he hath enlightened and to whom we are indebted for many important truths hath most amply detailed the principal maxims of useful education this chiefly consists in presenting to the mind a small number of select objects in substituting the originals for the copies both of physical and moral phenomena in leading the pupil to virtue by the easy road of sentiment and in withholding him from evil by the infallible power of necessary inconveniences rather than by command which only obtains counterfeit and momentary obedience     chapter xlvi of pardons as punishments become more mild clemency and pardon are less necessary happy the nation in which they will be considered as dangerous clemency which has often been deemed a sufficient substitute for every other virtue in sovereigns should be excluded in a perfect legislation where punishments are mild and the proceedings in criminal cases regular and expeditious this truth will seem cruel to those who live in countries where from the absurdity of the laws and the severity of punishments pardons and the clemency of the prince are necessary it is indeed one of the noblest prerogatives of the throne but at the same time a tacit disapprobation of the laws clemency is a virtue which belongs to the legislator and not to the executor of the laws a virtue which ought to shine in the code and not in private judgment to shew mankind that crimes are sometimes pardoned and that punishment is not the necessary consequence is     to nourish the flattering hope of impunity and is the cause of their considering every punishment inflicted as an act of injustice and oppression the prince in pardoning gives up the public security in favour of an individual and by his illjudged benevolence proclaims a public act of impunity let then the executors of the laws be inexorable but let the legislator be tender indulgent and humane he is a wise architect who erects his edifice on the foundation of selflove and contrives that the interest of the public shall be the interest of each individual who is not obliged by particular laws and irregular proceedings to separate the public good from that of individuals and erect the image of public felicity on the basis of fear and distrust but like a wise philosopher he will permit his brethren to enjoy in quiet that small portion of happiness which the immense system established by the first cause permits them to taste on this earth which is but a point in the universe a small crime is sometimes pardoned if the person offended chuses to forgive the offender this may be an act of good nature and humanity but it is contrary to the good of the public the right of punishing belongs not to any individual in particular but to society in general or the   0 sovereign he may renounce his own portion of this right but cannot give up that of others chapter xlvii conclusion i conclude with this reflection that the severity of punishments ought to be in proportion to the state of the nation among a people hardly yet emerged from barbarity they should be most severe as strong impressions are required but in proportion as the minds of men become softened by their intercourse in society the severity of punishments should be diminished if it be intended that the necessary relation between the object and the sensation should be maintained from what i have written results the following general theorem of considerable utility though not conformable to custom the common legislator of nations that a punishment may not be an act of violence     of one or of many against a private member of society it should be public immediate and necessary the least possible in the case given proportioned to the crime and determined by the laws         a commentary on the book of crimes and punishments chapter i the occasion of this commentary having read with infinite satisfaction the little book on crimes and punishments which in morality as in medicine may be compared to one of those few remedies capable of alleviating our sufferings i flattered myself that it would be a means of softening the remains of barbarism in the laws of many nations i hoped for some reformation in mankind when i was     informed that within a few miles of my abode they had just hanged a girl of eighteen beautiful well made accomplished and of a very reputable family she was culpable of having suffered herself to be got with child and also of having abandoned her infant this unfortunate girl flying from her fathers house is taken in labour and without assistance is delivered of her burden by the side of a wood shame which in the sex is a powerful passion gave her strength to return home and to conceal her situation she left her child exposed it is found the next morning the mother is discovered condemned and executed the first fault of this unhappy victim ought to have been concealed by the family or rather claims the protection of the laws because it was incumbent on her seducer to repair the injury he had done because weakness hath a right to indulgence because concealing her pregnancy may endanger her life because declaring her condition destroys her reputation and because the difficulty of providing for her infant is a great additional misfortune her second fault is more criminal she abandons the fruit of her weakness and exposes it to perish     but because a child is dead is it absolutely necessary to kill the mother she did not kill the child she flattered herself that some passenger would have compassion on the innocent babe it is even possible that she might intend to return and provide for it a sentiment so natural in the breast of a mother that it ought to be presumed the law in the country of which i am speaking is indeed positively against her but is it not an unjust inhuman and pernicious law unjust because it makes no distinction between her who murders and her who abandons her infant inhuman because it punishes with death a too great desire of concealing a weakness pernicious because it deprives the state of a fruitful subject in a country that wants inhabitants charity hath not yet established in that nation houses of reception for exposed infants where charity is wanting the law is always cruel it were much better to prevent than to think only of punishing these frequent misfortunes the proper object of jurisprudence is to hinder the commission of crimes rather than condemn to death a weak woman when it is evident that her transgression was unattended with malice and that she hath already been severely punished by the pangs of her own heart     insure as far as possible a resource to those who shall be tempted to do evil and you will have less to punish chapter ii of punishments this misfortune and this very hard law with which i was so sensibly affected prompted me to cast my eyes on the criminal code of nations the humane author of the essay on crimes and punishments had but too much cause to complain that the latter frequently exceed the former and are sometimes detrimental to the state they were intended to serve those ingenious punishments the ne plus ultra of the human mind endeavouring to render death horrible seem rather the inventions of tyranny than of justice the punishment of the wheel was first introduced in germany in the times of anarchy when those who usurped the regal power resolved to     terrify with unheardof torments those who should dispute their authority in england they ripped open the belly of a man guilty of hightreason tore out his heart dashed it in his face and then threw it into the fire and wherein did this hightreason frequently consist in having been during a civil war faithful to an unfortunate king or in having spoken freely on the doubtful right of the conqueror at length their manners were softened they continued to tear out the heart but not till after the death of the offender the apparatus is dreadful but the death is mild if death can ever be mild chapter iii on the punishment of heretics the denunciation of death to those who in certain dogmas differed from the established church was peculiarly the act of tyranny no christian emperor before the tyrant maximus ever thought of condemning a man to punishment     merely for points of controversy it is true indeed that two spanish bishops pursued to death the priscilianists under maximus but it is also true that this tyrant was willing to gratify the reigning party with the blood of heretics barbarity and justice were to him indifferent jealous of theodosius a spaniard like himself he endeavoured to deprive him of the empire of the east as he had already obtained that of the west theodosius was hated for his cruelties but he had found the means of gaining to his party the heads of the church maximus was willing to display the same zeal and to attach the spanish bishops to his faction he flattered both the old and the new religion he was as treacherous as inhuman as indeed were all those who at that time either pretended to or obtained empire that vast part of the world was then governed like algiers at present emperors were created and dethroned by the military power and were often chosen from among nations that were reputed barbarous theodosius opposed to his competitor other barbarians from scythia he filled the army with goths and surprised alaric the conqueror of rome in this horrible confusion each endeavoured to strengthen his party by every means in his power     maximus having caused the emperor gratian the colleague of theodosius to be assassinated at lyons meditated the destruction of valentinian the second who during his infancy had been made successor to gratian he assembled at treves a powerful army composed of gauls and germans he caused troops to be levied in spain when two spanish bishops idacio and ithacus or itacius both men of credit came and demanded of him the blood of priscilian and all his adherents who were of opinion that souls were emanations from god that the trinity did not contain three hypostases and moreover they carried their sacrilege so far as to fast on sundays maximus half pagan and half christian soon perceived the enormity of these crimes the holy bishops idacio and itacius obtained leave to torture priscilian and his accomplices before they were put to death they were both present that things might be done according to order and they returned blessing god and numbering maximus the defender of the faith among the saints but maximus being afterward defeated by theodosius and assassinated at the feet of his conqueror had not the good fortune to be canonized it is proper to observe that saint martin   0 bishop of tours who was really a good man solicited the pardon of priscilian but being himself accused of heresy by the bishops he returned to tours for fear of the torture at treves as to priscilian he had the consolation after he was hanged of being honoured by his sect as a martyr his feast was celebrated and would be celebrated still if there were any priscilianists remaining this example made the entire church tremble but it was soon after imitated and surpassed priscilianists had been put to death by the sword the halter and by lapidation a young lady of quality suspected to have fasted on a sunday was at bourdeaux only stoned to death these punishments appeared too mild it was proved that god required that heretics should be roasted alive the peremptory argument in support of this opinion was that god punishes them in that manner in the next world and that every prince or his representative even down to a petty constable is the image of god in this sublunary world on this principle it was that all over europe they burnt witches and sorcerers who were manifestly under the empire of the devil and also heterodox christians which were deemed still more criminal and dangerous     it is not certainly known what was the crime of those priests who were burnt at orleans in the presence of king robert and his wife constantia in the year  0   how indeed should it be known there being at that time but a small number of clerks and monks that could write all we certainly know is that robert and his wife feasted their eyes with this abominable spectacle one of the sectaries had been confessor to her majesty who thought she could not better repair the misfortune of having confessed to a heretic than by seeing him devoured by the flames custom becomes law from that period to the present time a space of more than seven hundred years the church hath continued to burn those that are guilty or supposed guilty of an error in opinion     chapter iv on the extirpation of heresy it seems necessary to distinguish an heresy of opinion from faction from the first ages of christianity opinions have been different the christians of alexandria were in many points of a different opinion from those of antioch the achaians differed from the asiatics this diversity of opinion existed from the beginning and probably will continue for ever jesus christ who could have united all the faithful in the same sentiments did it not and therefore we may conclude that it was not his design but that he chose rather to exercise all his churches in acts of indulgence and charity by permitting different systems yet all agreeing to acknowledge him their lord and master these several sects so long as they were tolerated by the emperors or concealed from their sight had it not in their power to prosecute each other being equally subject to the roman magistrates they could only dispute if they were persecuted they equally     claimed the privilege of nature suffer us they said to adore our god in peace and do not refuse us the liberty you grant to the jews every sect may now urge the same argument to their oppressors they may say to those who want privileges to the jews treat us as you treat the sons of jacob let us like them pray to god according to our conscience our opinion will no more injure your state than judaism you tolerate the enemies of jesus christ tolerate us who adore him and who differ from you only in theological subtleties do not deprive yourselves of useful subjects useful in your manufactures your marine and the cultivation of your lands of what importance is it that their creed be somewhat different from yours you want their labour and not their catechism faction is quite a different thing it always happens that a persecuted sect degenerates into faction the oppressed naturally unite and animate each other and are generally more industrious in strengthening their party than their persecutors in their extermination they must either destroy or be destroyed so it happened after the persecution excited in  0  by galerius in the two last years of dioclesian the christians having been favoured by that emperor     during eighteen years were become too numerous and too rich to be exterminated they joined chlorus they fought for his son constantine and a total revolution of the empire was the consequence small events may be compared with great when they are produced by the same spirit revolutions of a similar kind happened in holland in scotland and in switzerland when ferdinand and isabella drove the jews out of spain where they were established not only before the reigning family but before the moors the goths or even the carthaginians if the jews had been as warlike as they were rich they might easily in conjunction with the arabs have effected a revolution in short no sect ever changed the government unless excited by despair mahomed himself succeeded only because he was driven from mecca and a reward offered for his head would you prevent a sect from overturning the state imitate the present wise conduct of england of germany of holland use toleration the only methods in policy to be taken with a new sect are to put to death the chief and all his adherents men women and children without sparing one individual or to tolerate them when     numerous the first method is that of a monster the second of a wise man chain your subjects to the state by their interest let the quaker and the turk find their advantage in living under your laws religion is of god to man the civil law is of you to your people chapter v of profanation lewis ix king of france who for his virtues was numbered among the saints made a law against blasphemers he condemned them to a new punishment their tongues were pierced with a hot iron it was a kind of retaliation the sinning member suffering the punishment but it was somewhat difficult to determine what was blasphemy expressions frequently escape from a man in a passion from joy or even in conversation which are merely expletives such as the sela and the vab of the hebrews the pol and the     ædepol of the latins as also per deos immortales an expression frequently used without the least intention of swearing by the immortal gods the words which are called oaths and blasphemy are commonly vague terms that may be variously interpreted the law by which they are punished seems to be founded on that of the jews which says thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain the best commentators are of opinion that this commandment relates to perjury and there is the more reason to believe them right as the word shave which is translated in vain properly signifies perjury now what analogy can there be between perjury and cabo de dios cadedis sangbleu ventrebleu corpo de dio etc it was customary with the jews to swear by the life of god as the lord liveth the phrase was common so that it was lying in the name of god that was forbidden philip augustus in      condemned the nobility who should pronounce the words which are softened in the terms tetebleu ventrebleu corbleu sangbleu to pay a fine and the plebeians to be drowned the first part of this law seems puerile the latter abominable it was an outrage to nature to drown one man for a crime for which another paid a few pence of the money of those     times so that this law like many other remained unexecuted especially when the king was excommunicated and his kingdom interdicted by pope celestine iii saint lewis transported with zeal ordered indiscriminately that whosoever should pronounce these indecent words should have his tongue bored or his upper lip cut off a citizen of paris having suffered this punishment complained to pope innocent iv this pontiff remonstrated to the king that the punishment was too great for the crime which however had no effect upon his majesty happy had it been for mankind if the popes had never affected any other superiority over kings the ordinance of lewis xiv says those who shall be convicted of having sworn by or blasphemed the holy name of god of his most holy mother or of his saints shall for the first offence pay a fine for the second third and fourth a double triple and quadruple fine for the fifth shall be put in the stocks for the sixth shall stand in the pillory and lose his upper lip for the seventh shall have his tongue cut out this law appears to be humane and just as it inflicts a cruel punishment only on a sevenfold repetition which can hardly be presumed     but with regard to more atrocious profanations which are called sacrilege the criminal ordinance mentions only robbing of churches it takes no notice of public impieties perhaps because they were not supposed to happen or were too difficult to specify they are left therefore to the discretion of the judge and yet nothing ought to be left to discretion in such extraordinary cases how is the judge to act he should consider the age of the offender the nature and degree of his offence and particularly the necessity of a public example pro qualitate personæ quoque rei conditione et temporis et ætatis et sexus vel clementius statuendum if the law does not expressly say that such a crime shall be punished with death what judge shall think himself authorised to pronounce that sentence if the law be silent if nevertheless a punishment be required the judge ought certainly without hesitation to decree the least severe because he is a man sacrilegious profanations are never committed except by young debauchees would you punish them as severely as if they had murdered a brother their youth pleads in their favour they are not suffered to dispose of their possessions because they are supposed to want maturity     of judgment sufficient to foresee the consequences of an imprudent transaction is it not therefore natural to suppose that they are incapable of foreseeing the consequences of their impiety would you treat a wild young man who in his phrenzy had profaned a sacred image without stealing it with the same rigour that you punished a brinvilliers who poisoned his father and his whole family there is no law against the unhappy youth and you are determined to make one that shall condemn him to the severest punishment he deserved chastisement but did he deserve such excruciating torture and the most horrible death but he had offended god true most grievously imitate god in your proceedings against him if he be penitent god forgives him impose a penance and let him be pardoned your illustrious montesquieu hath said it is our duty to honour the deity and not to revenge him let us weigh these words they do not mean that we should neglect the maintenance of public decorum but as the judicious author of the preceding essay observes that it is absurd for an insect to pretend to revenge the supreme being a village magistrate or the magistrate of a city is neither a moses nor a joshua   0 chapter vi of the indulgence of the romans in matters of religion the amazing contrast between the roman laws and the barbarous institutions by which they were succeeded hath often been the subject of conversation among the speculative part of mankind doubtless the roman senate held the supreme god in as great veneration as we and professed as much esteem for their secondary deities as we for our saints ab jove principium was their common formule pliny in his panegyric on the good trajan attests that the romans never omitted to begin their discourse and affairs by invoking the deity cicero and livy tell us the same thing no people were more religious but they were too wise and too great to descend to the punishment of idle language or philosophic opinions they were incapable of inflicting barbarous punishments on those who with cicero himself an augur had no faith in auguries or     on those who like cæsar asserted in full senate that the gods do not punish men after death it hath often been remarked that the senate permitted the chorus in the troad to sing there is nothing after death and death itself is nothing you ask what becomes of the dead they are where they were ere they were born was ever profanation more flagrant than this from ennius to ausonius all his profanation notwithstanding the respect for divine worship why were these things disregarded by the senate because they did not in any wise affect the government of the state because they disturbed no institution nor religious ceremony the police of the romans was nevertheless excellent they were nevertheless absolute masters of the best part of the world till the reign of theodosius the second it was a maxim of the romans deorum offensæ diis curæ offences against the gods concern the gods only the senate by the wisest institution being at the head of religion were under no apprehensions that a convocation of priests should force them to revenge the priesthood under a pretext of revenging heaven they never said let us tear the impious asunder lest we ourselves     be deemed impious let us shew the priesthood by our cruelty that we are no less religious than they but our religion is more holy than that of the romans and consequently impiety is a greater crime granted god will punish it the part of man is to punish that which is criminal in the public disorder which the impiety hath occasioned but if in the act of impiety the delinquent hath not even stolen a handkerchief if the ceremonies of religion have been in no wise disturbed shall we as i said before punish the impiety as we would punish parricide the marshal dancre had caused a white cock to be killed when the moon was at full ought we therefore to burn the marshal dancre   est modus in rebus sunt certi denique fines   nec scutica dignum horribili sectere flagello     chapter vii on the crime of preaching and of anthony a calvanist teacher who in certain provinces preaches to his flock if he be detected is punished with death and those who have given him a supper or a bed are sent to the gallies for life in other countries if a jesuit be caught preaching he is hanged is it to avenge god that this calvinist and this jesuit are put to death have both parties built upon the following evangelical law if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican but the evangelist does not order that this heathen and this publican should be hanged or have they built on this passage in deuteronomy if among you a prophet arise and that which he hath said come to pass and he sayeth unto you let us follow strange gods and if thy brother or thy son or thy wife or the friend of thy heart say unto thee come let us follow strange gods let them     be straightways killed strike thou first and all the people after thee but neither this jesuit nor the calvanist said unto you come let us follow strange gods the counsellor dubourg the monk jehan chouvin named calvin the spanish physician servetus the calabrian gentilis all worshipped the same god and yet the president minard caused counsellor dubourg to be burnt and dubourgs friends caused president minard to be assassinated jehan calvin caused the physician servetus to be roasted and had likewise the consolation to be a principal means of bringing the calabrian gentilis to the block and the successors of jehan calvin burnt anthony was it reason or piety or justice that committed these murders this history of anthony is one of the most singular which the annals of phrenzy hath preserved i read the following account in a very curious manuscript it is in part related by jacob spon anthony was born at brieu in lorrain of catholic parents and he was educated by the jesuits at pont a mousson the preacher feri engaged him in the protestant religion at metz having returned to nancy he was prosecuted as     a heretic and had he not been saved by a friend would certainly have been hanged he fled for refuge to sedan where being taken for a papist he narrowly escaped assassination seeing by what strange fatality his life was not in safety either among papists or protestants he went to venice and turned jew he was positively persuaded even to the last moments of his life that the religion of the jews was the only true religion for that if it was once true it must always be so the jews did not circumcise him for fear of offending the state but he was no less internally a jew he now went to geneva where concealing his faith he became a preacher was president of the college and finally what is called a minister the perpetual combat in his breast between the religion of calvin which he was obliged to preach and that of moses which was the only religion he believed produced a long illness he became melancholy and at last quite mad crying aloud that he was a jew the ministers of the gospel came to visit him and endeavoured to bring him to himself but he answered that he adored none but the god of israel that it was impossible for god to change that god could never have given a law and inscribed it with his     own hand with an intention that it should be abolished he spoke against christianity and afterwards retracted all he had said and even wrote his confession of faith to escape punishment but the unhappy persuasion of his heart would not permit him to sign it the council of the city assembled the clergy to consult what was to be done with the unfortunate anthony the minority of these clergy were of opinion that they should have compassion on him and rather endeavour to cure his disease than punish him the majority determined that he should be burnt and he was burnt this transaction is of the year      a hundred years of reason and virtue are scarce sufficient to expiate such a deed     chapter viii the history of simon morin the tragical end of simon morin is not less horrible than that of poor anthony it was midst the feasting pleasures and gallantry of a brilliant court it was even in the times of the greatest licentiousness that this unfortunate madman was burnt at paris in the year      imagining that he had seen visions he carried his folly so far as to believe that he was sent from god and that he was incorporated with jesus christ the parliament very wisely condemned him to be confined in a madhouse what was very remarkable there happened to be confined in the same madhouse another fool who called himself god the father simon morin was so struck with the folly of his companion that he acknowledged his own and appeared for a time to have recovered his senses he declared his repentance and unfortunately for himself obtained his liberty     some time after he relapsed into his former nonsense and began to dogmatize his unhappy destiny brought him acquainted with st sorlin desmarets who for some months was his friend but who afterwards from jealousy became his most cruel persecutor this desmarets was no less a visionary than morin his first follies indeed were innocent he printed the tragicomedies of erigone and mirame with a translation of the psalms the romance of ariane and the poem of clovis with the office of the holy virgin turned into verse he likewise published dithyrambic poems enriched with invectives against homer and virgil from this kind of follies he proceeded to others of a more serious nature he attacked portroyal and after confessing that he had perverted some women to atheism he commenced prophet he pretended that god had given him with his own hand the key to the treasure of the apocalypse that with this key he would reform the whole world and that he should command an army of an hundred and forty thousand men against the jansenists nothing could have been more reasonable and more just than to have confined him in the same place with simon morin but can it be     believed that he found credit with the jesuit annat the kings confessor whom he persuaded that this poor simon morin would establish a sect almost as dangerous as the jansenists themselves in short carrying his infamy so far as to turn informer he obtained an order to seize the person of his rival shall i tell it simon morin was condemned to be burnt alive in conducting him to the stake there was found in one of his stockings a paper in which he begged forgiveness of god for all his errors this ought to have saved him but no the sentence was confirmed and he was executed without mercy such deeds are enough to make a mans hair bristle with horror yet where is the country that hath not beheld such shocking spectacles mankind universally forget that they are brothers and persecute each other even to death let us console ourselves with the hope that such dreadful times are passed never more to return   0 chapter ix of witches in the year      in the bishopric of wurtsburg an old woman was convicted of witchcraft and burnt this was an extraordinary phenomenon in the present century but how incredible it seems that a people who boasted of their reformation and of having trampled superstition under their feet and who flattered themselves that they had brought their reason to perfection is it not wonderful i say that such a people should have believed in witchcraft should have burnt old women accused of this crime and that above a hundred years after the pretended reformation of their reason in the year      a country woman named michelle chaudron of the little territory of geneva met the devil in her way from the city the devil gave her a kiss received her homage and imprinted on her upper lip and on her right breast the mark which he is wont to bestow upon his favourites this seal of the devil is a     little sign upon the skin which renders it insensible as we are assured by all the demonographical civilians of those times the devil ordered michelle chaudron to bewitch two young girls she obeyed her master punctually the parents of the two girls accused her of dealing with the devil the girls being confronted with the criminal declared that they felt a continual prickling in some parts of their bodies and that they were possessed physicians were called at least men that passed for physicians in those days they visited the girls they sought for the seal of the devil on the body of michelle which seal is called in the verbal process the satanical mark into one of these marks they plunged a long needle which was already no small torture blood issued from the wound and michelle testified by her cries that the part was not insensible the judges not finding sufficient proof that michelle chaudron was a witch ordered her to be tortured which infallibly produced the proof they wanted the poor wretch overcome by torment confessed at last every thing they desired the physicians sought again for the satanical mark and found it in a little black spot on one of her thighs into this they plunged their     needle the poor creature exhausted and almost expiring with the pain of the torture was insensible to the needle and did not cry out she was instantly condemned to be burnt but the world beginning at this time to be a little more civilized she was previously strangled at this period every tribunal in europe resounded with such judgments and fire and faggot were universally employed against witchcraft as well as heresy the turks were reproached with having amongst them neither sorcerers witches nor demoniacs and the want of the latter was considered as an infallible proof of the falsity of their religion a zealous friend to the public welfare to humanity and to true religion in one of his writings in favour of innocence informs us that there have been above a hundred thousand witches condemned to die by christian tribunals if to these lawful massacres we add the much superior number of heretics sacrificed our part of the globe will appear one vast scaffold covered with executioners and victims and surrounded by judges guards and spectators     chapter x on the punishment of death it hath long since been observed that a man after he is hanged is good for nothing and that punishments invented for the good of society ought to be useful to society it is evident that a score of stout robbers condemned for life to some public work would serve the state in their punishment and that hanging them is a benefit to nobody but the executioner thieves in england are seldom punished with death but are transported to the colonies this is also practised in russia where not one criminal was executed during the whole reign of the autocratical elisabeth catherine ii who hath succeeded her with much more genius follows her example yet crimes are not multiplied by this humanity and it generally happens that the criminals sent to siberia in time become honest people the same is observed in the english colonies we are astonished at the change and yet nothing can be more natural the condemned are forced to     continual labour for a livelihood the opportunities of vice are wanting they marry and multiply oblige men to work and you certainly make them honest it is well known that atrocious crimes are not committed in the country unless when there is too much holiday and consequently too much idleness and consequently too much debauchery the romans never condemned a citizen to death unless for crimes which concerned the safety of the state these our masters our first legislators were careful of the blood of their fellowcitizens but we are extravagant with the blood of ours the question hath been frequently debated whether a judge ought to have the power to punish with death when the punishment is undetermined by the law this question was solemnly agitated in the presence of the emperor henry vii who decreed that no judge should have such a power there are some criminal cases which are either so new so complicated and so unaccountable as to have escaped the provision of the laws and which therefore in some countries are left to the discretion of the judge but for one case in which the laws permit the death of a criminal     whom they have not condemned there are a thousand wherein humanity should save whom the laws have condemned to suffer the sword of justice is in our hands but we ought rather to blunt than to sharpen its edge it remains within its sheath in the presence of kings to inform us that it ought seldom to be drawn there have been some judges who were passionately fond of spilling human blood such was jefferies in england and such in france was the man whom they called coupetete nature never intended such men for magistrates but for executioners chapter xi on death warrants must we go to the end of the world must we have recourse to the laws of china to learn how frugal we ought to be of human blood it is now more than four thousand years that the tribunals of that empire have existed and it is also more than four thousand years that the     meanest subject at the extremity of the empire hath not been executed without first transmitting his case to the emperor who causes it to be thrice examined by one of his tribunals after which he signs the death warrant alters the sentence or entirely acquits but it is unnecessary to travel so far for examples of this nature europe will abundantly supply us in england no criminal is put to death whose death warrant is not signed by the king it is also practised in germany and in most parts of the north such likewise was formerly the custom in france and such it ought to be in all polished nations a sentence at a distance from the throne may be dictated by cabal prejudice or ignorance such little intrigues are unknown to monarchs who are continually surrounded by great objects the members of the supreme council are more enlightened less liable to prejudice and better qualified than a provincial judge to determine whether the state require severe punishments in short when inferior courts have judged according to the letter of the law which possibly may be rigorous the council mitigates the sentence according to the true spirit of all laws which teaches never to sacrifice a man but in evident necessity     chapter xii on torture all mankind being exposed to the attempts of violence or perfidy detest the crimes of which they may possibly be the victims all desire that the principal offender and his accomplices may be punished nevertheless there is a natural compassion in the human heart which makes all men detest the cruelty of torturing the accused in order to extort confession the law has not condemned them and yet though uncertain of their crime you inflict a punishment more horrible than that which they are to suffer when their guilt is confirmed possibly thou mayst be innocent but i will torture thee that i may be satisfied not that i intend to make thee any recompence for the thousand deaths which i have made thee suffer in lieu of that which is preparing for thee who does not shudder at the idea st augustin opposed such cruelty the romans tortured their slaves only and quintilian recollecting that they     were men reproved the romans for such want of humanity if there were but one nation in the world which had abolished the use of torture if in that nation crimes were no more frequent than in others and if that nation be more enlightened and more flourishing since the abolition its example surely were sufficient for the rest of the world england alone might instruct all other nations in this particular but england is not the only nation torture hath been abolished in other countries and with success the question therefore is decided shall not a people who pique themselves on their politeness pride themselves also on their humanity shall they obstinately persist in their inhumanity merely because it is an ancient custom reserve at least such cruelty for the punishment of those hardened wretches who shall have assassinated the father of a family or the father of his country but that a young person who commits a fault which leaves no traces behind it should suffer equally with a parricide is not this an useless piece of barbarity i am ashamed of having said any thing on this subject after what hath been already said by the author of the essay on crimes and punishments     i ought to have been satisfied with wishing that mankind may read with attention the work of that friend to humanity chapter xiii of certain sanguinary tribunals is it credible that there formerly existed a supreme tribunal more horrible than the inquisition and that this tribunal was established by charlemagne it was the judgment of westphalia otherwise called the vhemic court the severity or rather cruelty of this court went so far as to punish with death every saxon who broke his fast during lent the same law was also established in franchecomte in the beginning of the seventeenth century in the archives of a little place called st claude situated in a remote corner of the most mountainous part of the county of burgundy are preserved the particulars of the sentence and verbal process of execution of a poor gentleman named claude  00 guillon who was beheaded on the   th of july      being reduced to the utmost poverty and urged by the most intolerable hunger he eat on a fishday a morsel of horse flesh which had been killed in a neighbouring field this was his crime he was found guilty of sacrilege had he been a rich man and had spent two hundred crowns in a supper of seafish suffering the poor to die of hunger he would have been considered as a person fulfilling every duty the following is a copy of his sentence having seen all the papers of the process and heard the opinions of the doctors learned in the law we declare the said claude guillon to be truly attainted and convicted of having taken away part of the flesh of a horse killed in the meadow of that town of having caused the said flesh to be dressed and of eating the same on saturday the   st of march etc what infamous doctors must these have been who gave their opinions on this occasion was it among the topinambous or among the hottentots that these things happened the vhemic court was yet more horrible delegates from this court were secretly spread over all germany taking informations unknown to the accused who were condemned without being heard and frequently  0  in want of an executioner the youngest judge performed the office himself it was requisite in order to be safe from the assassination of this court to procure letters of exemption from the emperor and even these were sometimes ineffectual this chamber of assassins was not entirely abolished till the reign of maximilian i it ought to have been dissolved in the blood of its members the venetian council of ten was in comparison with this a court of mercy what shall we think of such horrid proceedings is it sufficient to bewail humanity there were some cases that cried aloud for vengeance  0  chapter xiv on the difference between political and natural laws i call natural laws those which nature dictates in all ages to all men for the maintenance of that justice which she say what they will of her hath implanted in our hearts theft violence homicide ingratitude to beneficent parents perjury against innocence conspiracies against ones country are crimes that are universally and justly punished though with more or less severity i call political laws those that are made in compliance with present necessity whether it be to give stability to the government or to prevent misfortune for example being apprehensive that the enemy may receive intelligence from the inhabitants of the city you shut the gates and forbid any one to pass the ramparts on pain of death or fearful of a new sect of people who publicly disclaim all obedience to their sovereign  0  and secretly consult of means to divest themselves of that obedience who preach that all men are equal and that obedience is due to god alone who accusing the reigning sect of superstition mean to destroy that which is consecrated by the state you denounce death against those who in publicly dogmatizing in favour of this sect may instigate the people to revolt or two ambitious princes contend for a crown the strongest gains the prize and punishes with death the partizans of the weaker the judges become the instruments of vengeance of the new sovereign and the supports of his authority when richard the third the murderer of his two nephews was acknowledged king of england the jury found sir william collinburn guilty of having written to a friend of the duke of richmond who was at that time raising an army and who afterwards reigned by the name of henry vii they found two ridiculous lines of sir williams writing which were sufficient to condemn him to a horrible death history abounds with such examples of justice the right of reprisal is also a law adopted by nations for example your enemy has hanged one of your brave captains for having defended an old ruined castle against a whole army one  0  of his captains falls into your hands he is a worthy man and you esteem him nevertheless you hang him by way of reprisal you say it is the law that is to say because your enemy has been guilty of an enormous crime you must be guilty of another these political sanguinary laws exist but for a time they are temporary because they are not founded in truth they resemble the necessity which in cases of extreme famine obliges people to eat each other they cease to eat men as soon as bread is to be had chapter xv on the crime of hightreason on titus oates and on the death of augustin de thou hightreason is an offence committed against the security of the commonwealth or of the king its representative it is considered as parricide and therefore ought not to be extended to offences which bear no analogy to that crime  0  in making it hightreason to commit a theft in any house belonging to the state or even to speak seditious words you lessen the horror which the crime of hightreason ought to inspire in our ideas of great crimes there should be nothing arbitrary if a theft from or imprecation against a father be considered as parricide you break the bond of filial piety the son will then regard his parent as a terrible monster every exaggeration in a law tends to its destruction in common crimes the laws of england are favourable to the accused but in cases of hightreason they are against him the jesuit titus oates being legally interrogated in the house of commons and having upon his oath declared that he had related the whole truth yet afterwards accused the secretary of the duke of york and several others of hightreason and his information was admitted he likewise swore before the kings council that he had not seen the secretary and afterwards that he had notwithstanding these illegalities and contradictions the secretary was executed the same titus oates and another witness deposed that fifty jesuits had conspired to assassinate charles ii and that they had seen commissions  0  signed by father oliva general of the jesuits for the officers that were to command an army of rebels this evidence was sufficient to authorize the tearing out the hearts of several people and dashing them in their faces but seriously can two witnesses be thought sufficient to convict a man whom they have a mind to destroy at least one would imagine they ought not to be notorious villains neither ought that which they depose to be improbable let us suppose that two of the most upright magistrates in the kingdom were to accuse a man of having conspired with the mufti to circumcise the whole council of state the parliament the archbishop and the sorbonne in vain these two magistrates might swear that they had seen the letters of the mufti it would naturally be supposed that they were wrong in their heads it was equally ridiculous to imagine that the general of the jesuits should raise an army in england as that the mufti intended to circumcise the court of france but unhappily titus oates was believed that there might remain no species of atrocious folly which hath not entered into the heart of man the laws of england do not consider as guilty of conspiracy those who are privy to it and do  0  not inform they suppose the informer as infamous as the conspirator is culpable in france if any one be privy to a conspiracy and does not reveal it he is punished with death lewis xi against whom conspiracies were frequent made this law a law which a lewis xii or a henry iv could never have imagined it not only obliges an honest man to divulge a crime which by his resolution and advice he might possibly prevent but it renders him liable to be punished as a calumniator it being easy for the accused to manage their affairs in such a manner as to elude conviction this was exactly the case of the truly respectable augustin de thou counsellor of state and son of the only good historian of which france can boast equal to guicciardini in point of abilities and perhaps superior in point of impartiality this conspiracy was against cardinal de richelieu rather than against lewis xiii the design was not to betray france to an enemy for the kings brother who was the principal author of the plot could never intend to betray a kingdom to which he was the presumptive heir there being only between him and the crown a dying brother and two children in the cradle  0  de thou was neither guilty in the sight of god nor man one of the agents of the kings brother of the duke of bouillon sovereign prince of sedan and of the grand equerry deffiat st mars had communicated their intention to de thou who immediately went to st mars and endeavoured to dissuade him from the enterprize if he had informed against him he had no proof and must inevitably have fallen a sacrifice to the resentment of the presumptive heir of a sovereign prince of the kings favourite and to public execration in short he would have been punished as a malignant calumniator the chancellor seguier was convinced of this in confronting de thou with the grand equerry when de thou asked the latter the following question do you not remember sir that there never passed a day in which i did not endeavour to dissuade you from the attempt st mars acknowledged it to be true so that de thou deserved a recompence rather than death from a tribunal of equity he certainly deserved to have been saved by cardinal richelieu but humanity was not his virtue there is in this case something more than summum jus summa injuria in the sentence of this worthy man we read for having had knowledge and participation  0  of the said conspiracy it does not say for not having revealed so that his crime was his having been informed of a crime and he was punished for having had ears and eyes all that we can say in extenuation of the severity is that it was not the act of justice herself but of a delegated power the letter of the law was positive but i appeal not only to the lawyers but to all mankind whether the spirit of the law was not perverted it is a melancholy absurdity that a small number of people should condemn as criminal a man judged innocent by a whole nation and worth their esteem chapter xvi of religious confession jaurigny and balthazar gerard who assassinated william i prince of orange clement the dominican chatel ravaillac and all the other parricides of those times went to confession before they committed their crimes fanaticism   0 in that deplorable age was carried to such excess that confession was an additional engagement to the perpetration of villainy an engagement deemed sacred because confession is a sacrament strada himself says that jaurigny non ante facinus aggredi sustinuit quam expiatam necis animam apud dominicanum sacerdotem cælesti pane firmaverit it appears in the interrogatory of ravaillac that coming from the feuillants and going towards the jesuits college he addressed himself to the jesuit daubigny that after talking to him of several apparitions which he had seen he shewed him a knife on the blade of which was engraved a heart and a cross and that he said this heart signifies that the heart of the king should be induced to make war against the huguenots if this daubigny had informed the king of these words and described the man the best of kings might possibly have escaped assassination on the  0th of august    0 three months after the death of henry iv whose wounds were yet bleeding in the hearts of his subjects the advocategeneral servin of illustrious memory required that the jesuits should be obliged to sign the four following articles i that the council is superior to the pope     ii that the pope cannot deprive the king of any of his rights by excommunication iii that the ecclesiastics are like other people entirely subject to the king iv that a priest who by confession is apprized of a conspiracy against the king or the state should reveal it to the magistrates on the   d the parliament published an arret forbidding the jesuits to instruct youth until they had signed those four articles but the court of rome was at that time so powerful and that of france so weak that the arret was disregarded it is worth notice that this court of rome which would not suffer confession to be revealed when the life of a sovereign was concerned obliged the confessors to inform the inquisition in case any female should accuse another priest of having seduced or attempted to seduce her paul iv pius iv clement viii and gregory xv ordered this revelation it was a dangerous snare both for the confessor and the penitent it was converting a sacrament into a register of accusations and sacrilege for by the ancient canons and particularly by the lateran council under innocent iii every confessor who reveals confession of whatsoever nature it may be shall be interdicted and imprisoned for life     thus we see four different popes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ordering the revelation of a sin of impurity and forbidding it in cases of parricide a woman confesses or supposes in her confession to a carmelite that a cordelier attempted to seduce her the carmelite must impeach the cordelier a fanatical assassin believing that he shall serve god by killing his prince consults his confessor on this case of conscience the confessor is guilty of sacrilege if he save the life of his sovereign this horrible absurdity is one of the unhappy consequences of the continual opposition which hath subsisted for so many ages between the ecclesiastical and civil law mankind have in a thousand instances been suspended between the crimes of sacrilege and hightreason and the distinctions of right and wrong have been buried in a chaos from which they are not yet emerged confession of sins hath been authorised in all times and in all nations the ancients accused themselves in the mysteries of orpheus of isis of ceres of samothrace the jews confessed their sins on the day of solemn expiation and still continue the same practice each penitent chuses his confessor who becomes his penitent in turn and each receives from his companion     thirtynine lashes whilst he is repeating three times the formule of confession which consists only in thirteen words and which consequently must be general none of these confessions were particular and consequently could never serve for a pretence to those secret consultations under the shadow of which fanatical penitents think to sin with impunity a pernicious practice by which a salutary institution is corrupted confession which was intended as a curb to iniquity hath frequently in times of confusion and seduction become an incentive to wickedness probably it was for this reason that so many christian states have abolished a holy institution which appeared to be as dangerous as useful     chapter xvii of false money the crime of coining false money is deemed hightreason in the second degree and justly to rob all the people is to be a traitor to the state but it is asked whether a merchant who imports ingots of gold from america and privately converts them into good money be guilty of hightreason and merit death which is the punishment annexed to this crime in almost all countries nevertheless he has robbed nobody on the contrary he has done service to the state by increasing the currency but he hath defrauded the king of the small profit upon the coin he hath indeed coined good money but he hath led others into the temptation of coining bad yet death is a severe punishment i knew a lawyer who was of opinion that such a criminal should be condemned as a useful hand to work in the royal mint with irons to his legs     chapter xviii on domestic theft in countries where a trifling domestic theft or breach of trust is punished with death is not the disproportioned punishment dangerous to society is it not even an encouragement to larceny if in this case a master prosecutes his servant and the unhappy wretch suffer death the whole neighbourhood hold the master in abhorrence they perceive that the law is contrary to nature and consequently that it is a bad law what is the result masters to avoid opprobrium content themselves with discharging the thief who afterwards steals from another and gradually becomes familiar with dishonesty the punishment being the same for a small theft as for a greater he will naturally steal as much as he can and at last will not scruple to turn assassin to prevent detection if on the contrary the punishment be proportioned to the crime if those who are guilty     of a breach of trust be condemned to labour for the public the master will not hesitate to bring the offender to justice and the crime will be less frequent so true it is that rigorous laws are often productive of crimes chapter xix on suicide the celebrated du verger de hauranne abbè de st cyran one of the founders of port royal in the year   0  wrote a treatise on suicide which is become one of the scarcest books in europe the decalogue says that author forbids us to commit murder in which precept selfmurder seems no less to be understood than the murder of another if therefore there be cases in which it is lawful to kill another there may be cases also wherein suicide may be allowed but a man ought not to attempt his own life till after having consulted his reason public     authority which is the representative of god may dispose of our lives the reason of man may also represent that of the deity it being a ray of the eternal light st cyran extends his argument to a great length which after all is a mere sophism but when he comes to exemplify he is not quite so easily answered a man may kill himself says he for the good of his prince for the good of his country or for the good of his parents it does not appear that we could with justice condemn a codrus or a curtius what prince would dare to punish the family of a man who had sacrificed himself for his service or rather is there any prince who would dare not to reward them st thomas before st cyran said the same thing but there was no need of either of thomas of bonaventure nor of huranne to inform us that a man who dies for his country deserves our praise st cyran concludes that it is lawful to do for ones own sake that which is praiseworthy if done for another the arguments of plutarch of seneca of montaigne and a hundred others are well known i do not pretend to apologise for an action which the laws have condemned but i do not recollect that either the old or     new testament forbid a man to relinquish his life when it is no longer supportable by the roman laws suicide was not forbidden on the contrary in a law of mark antony which was never repealed we find it thus written if your brother or your father being convicted of no crime hath put himself to death either to avoid pain or being weary of life or from despair or madness his will shall nevertheless be valid or his heirs inherit according to law notwithstanding this humane law of our ancient masters we ordain that a stake shall be driven through the corps of the offender and his memory becomes infamous we do all in our power to dishonour his family we punish a son for having lost a father and a widow because she is deprived of her husband we even confiscate the effects of the deceased and rob the living of that which is justly their due this custom with many others is derived from our canon law which denies christian burial to those who are guilty of suicide concluding thence that it is not lawful to inherit on earth from one who hath himself no inheritance in heaven the cannon law assures us that judas committed a greater crime in hanging himself than in betraying jesus christ     chapter xx on a certain species of mutilation we find in the pandect a law of adrian which denounces death to the physicians who should make an eunuch either by castration or by bruising the testes by the same law the possessions of those who suffered castration were confiscated origen ought certainly to have been punished who submitted to this operation from the rigid interpretation of that passage in st matthew which says there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake things changed in the reigns of succeeding emperors who adopted the luxury of asia especially in the lower empire of constantinople where eunuchs became patriarchs and generals of armies in these our own times it is the custom at rome to castrate young children to render them worthy of being musicians to his holiness so that castrato and musico del papa are synonimous it is not long since you might have seen at naples   0 written in great letters over the doors of certain barbers qui si castrano mar avigliosamente i puti here boys are castrated in the best manner chapter xxi on confiscation it is a maxim received at the bar that he who forfeits his life forfeits his effects a maxim which prevails in those countries where custom serves instead of law so that as we have already observed the children of one who puts an end to his own life are condemned to perish with hunger equally with those of an assassin thus in every case a whole family is punished for the crime of an individual thus when the father of a family is condemned to the gallies for life by an arbitrary sentence whether it be for having harboured a preacher or for hearing his sermon in a cavern or a desert his wife and children are reduced to beg their bread that law which consists in depriving an orphan     of support and in giving to one man the possessions of another was unknown in the times of the roman republic it was first introduced by sylla in his proscriptions whose example one would scarce have thought worthy imitation nor indeed was this law adopted by cesar by trajan or by antoninus whose name is still pronounced with respect by all nations and under justinian confiscation took place only in case of hightreason it seems that in the times of feudal anarchy princes and lords not being very rich sought to increase their revenue by the condemnation of their subjects their laws being arbitrary and the roman jurisprudence unknown customs either cruel or ridiculous prevailed but now that the power of princes is founded on immense and certain revenues there can be no need to swell their treasuries with the inconsiderable wreck of an unfortunate family in countries where the roman law is established confiscation is not admitted except within the jurisdiction of the parliament of toulouse it was formerly the law at calais but was abolished by the english whilst that city was in their possession it is strange that the inhabitants of the capital should be subject to a severer law     than the people in the country but laws like the cottages in a village were generally established by accident and without attention to the regularity of a general plan who would believe that in the year      in the most brilliant period of the kingdom of france the advocategeneral omer talon did in full parliament express himself on the subject of a young lady named canillac in the following words god says in the   th chapter of deuteronomy if thou comest into a city where idolatry reigneth thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is therein and thou shalt gather all the spoil thereof into the midst of the street and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof for the lord thy god and it shall be an heap for ever and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand in like manner in the crime of hightreason the children were deprived of their inheritance which became forfeited to the king naboth being prosecuted quia maledixerat regi king ahab took possession of his effects david being informed that mephibosheth had rebelled gave all his possessions to ziba who brought him the news tua sint omnia quæ fuerunt mephibosheth     the question in dispute was who should inherit the paternal estate of mlle de canillac which having been confiscated was abandoned by the king to a lord of the treasury and afterwards bequeathed by him to the testatrix in this cause concerning a girl of auvergne it was that an advocategeneral referred to ahab king of a part of palestine who confiscated the vineyard of naboth after assassinating the owner with the sword of justice an action so abominable as to have passed into a proverb intended to inspire mankind with detestation for such acts of tyranny there was certainly no analogy between the vineyard of naboth and the inheritance of mlle de canillac nor hath the murder and confiscation of the possessions of mephibosheth the grandson of saul and son of jonathan the friend and protector of david the least affinity with the will of this lady it was with such pedantry with such foolish quotations foreign to the subject with such ignorance of the first principles of human nature with such prejudices ill conceived and ill applied that laws have been explained and executed by men who acquired reputation in their sphere i leave to the reader that which to tell him were superfluous     chapter xxii on criminal procedure and other forms if in france it should ever happen that the laws of humanity soften some of our rigorous customs without facilitating the commission of crimes we may hope for reformation in those legal proceedings wherein our legislators seem to have been influenced by too much severity our criminal procedure appears in many instances to point only at the destruction of the accused it is the only law which is uniform throughout the whole kingdom a law which ought certainly to be no less favourable to the innocent than terrible to the guilty in england a man may recover damages for false imprisonment in france on the contrary an innocent person who has had the misfortune to be thrown into a dungeon and tortured almost to death has no consolation no damages to hope for no action against any one and to add to his misfortune he has for ever lost his reputation why because his joints have been dislocated     a circumstance which ought rather to inspire compassion and respect the discovery of crimes say they requires severity it is a war of human justice against iniquity but there is generosity and compassion even in war the brave are ever compassionate and shall the law delight in barbarity let us compare the criminal procedure of the romans with ours with them the evidence were heard publicly in presence of the accused who might answer or interrogate them or employ counsel this procedure was open and noble it breathed roman magnanimity with us all is conducted in secret a single judge only attended by his clerk hears each witness separately this custom established by francis i was confirmed by the commissioners who were employed to digest the ordinance of lewis xiv in    0 which confirmation was entirely owing to a mistake they imagined in reading the code de testibus that the words testes intrare judicii secretum signified that the witnesses were examined in private but secretum means here the chamber of the judge intrare secretum if intended to signify private interrogation would be false latin this part of our law therefore is founded on a solecism     the evidence in these cases are commonly the dregs of the people whom the judge may in such private examination make say whatever he pleases they are examined a second time but still privately and if after this reexamination they retract from their deposition or vary in any material circumstance they are punished as false evidence so that if a simple honest fellow recollecting that he has said too much that he misunderstood the judge or the judge him revoke his deposition from a principle of justice he is punished as a reprobate the natural consequence of this is that men will confirm a false testimony rather than expose themselves for their honesty to certain punishment the law seems to oblige the magistrate to be the enemy of the accused rather than his judge it being left in the power of the magistrate to confront the evidence with the accused or not as he shall think proper amazing that so necessary a part of the procedure should be left undetermined a man being suspected of a crime knowing that he is denied the benefit of counsel flies his country a step to which he is encouraged by every maxim of the law but he may be condemned in his absence whether the crime be     proved or not strange laws if a man be charged with owing a sum of money before he can be condemned to pay the demand it is required that the debt be proved but if his life be in question he may be condemned by default without any proof of the crime is money then of more importance than life o ye judges and legislators consult the pious antoninus and the good trajan they suffered not the absent to be condemned do your laws then allow the privilege of counsel to an extortioner or a fraudulent bankrupt and refuse it to one who may possibly be a very honest and honourable man if there ever were an instance of innocence being justified by means of counsel the law which deprives the accused of that benefit is evidently unjust the parliament of toulouse hath a very singular custom relative to the validity of evidence in other places demiproofs are admitted which is a palpable absurdity there being no such thing as demitruth but at toulouse they admit of quarters and eighths of a proof for instance an hearsay may be considered as a quarter and another hearsay more vague than the former as an eighth so that eight hearsays which in fact are no other than an echo of a groundless report     constitute a full proof upon this principle it was that poor calas was condemned to the wheel chapter xxiii the idea of reformation magistrates are in themselves so respectable that the inhabitants of the only country in which they are venal sincerely pray to be delivered from this custom they wish that the civilian may by his merit establish that justice which in his writings he hath so nobly defended we may then possibly hope to see a regular and uniform system of laws shall the law of the provinces be always at variance with the law in the capital shall a man be right in britanny and wrong in languedoc nay there are as many laws as there are towns and even in the same parliament the maxims of one chamber are not the maxims of another     what astonishing contrariety in the laws of one kingdom in paris a man who has been an inhabitant during one year and a day is reputed a citizen in franchecomte a freeman who during a year and a day inhabits a house in mortmain becomes a slave his collateral heirs are excluded from inheriting his foreign acquisitions and even his children are deprived of their inheritance if they have been a year absent from the house in which the father died this province is called franche but where is their freedom were we to attempt to draw a line between civil authority and ecclesiastical customs what endless disputes would ensue in short to what side soever we turn our eyes we are presented with a confused scene of contradictions uncertainty hardships and arbitrary power in the present age we seem universally aiming at perfection let us not therefore neglect to perfect the laws on which our lives and fortunes depend  hightreason  it may be alledged that the interest of commerce and property should be secured but commerce and property are not the end of the social compact but the means of obtaining that end and to oppose all the members of society to cruel laws to preserve them from evils necessarily occasioned by the infinite combinations which result from the actual state of political societies would be to make the end subservient to the means a paralogism in all sciences and particularly in politics in the former editions of this work i myself fell into this error when i said that the honest bankrupt should be kept in custody as a pledge for his debts or employed as a slave to work for his creditors i am ashamed of having adopted so cruel an opinion i have been accused of impiety i did not deserve it i have been accused of sedition i deserved it as little but i insulted all the rights of humanity and was never reproached  post mortem nihil est mors ipsaque
