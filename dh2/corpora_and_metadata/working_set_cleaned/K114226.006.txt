cxl containing golden rules of economy and the pages that close the history     liberal opinions etc the history of benignus chap cxvii the driver considering us as so many riotous young blades a little too joyous had a mind to humor our frolic and so rattled over the pavement to our hearts content for it is very well known one of the greatest raptures of rakeism consists in making the horses draw their carriage rapidly through a town and the more noise they make the more clatter occasioned by the wheels and the nearer they can go to a post or a passenger without touching the greater reputation they acquire from those who understand coachmanship and the more like puppies or madmen they look in the eyes of those grave persons who want taste or as these young gentlemen more elegantly term it spunk for such exercises  with the advantage of all this eclat we arrived at the common and were introduced not only to mr blakes pretty villa but to mr blakes pretty housekeeper as he called her and to do her justice as fine a woman she was in point of person as ever adorned a house  i was sober enough to discern the indelicacy of blakes carrying us before a lady in the pickle we then were and indeed this became more glaring before we had been half an hour in her company for green had so inebriated himself with the champaigne and the violent joys attending it that it was necessary to remove him into a less elegant apartment where he might once more try the restorative virtues of sleep and mr smack whose eyes worked in his head like a whirligig proposed a walk in the garden as the most salu  tif  er  a  riously thing in the world as the po  et says in these cases while mrs blake for so she was sometimes called though much oftener housekeeper kitty prepared the tea mr blake who appeared to be a dull obliging harddrinking man conducted us into his garden which really exhibited insinitely more taste than i imagined belonged to the proprietor yet now the choice of his garden and the choice of his wife much more indeed than the choice of his companions raised him very considerably in my opinion mr smack dizzy as he was was in an extacy and said that he was then in his element  i congratulated mr blake on a residence at once so pleasing and so contiguous to the metropolis it is an agreeable spot i must confess replied blake and it is rendered more so by being my own property and yet there is a material objection  an objection that sometimes keeps me away from it whole months in the middle of summer do you see that house immediately opposite to me if that house had been placed in any other part of the universe i might have been happy but as that is not the case drunk or sober i look at it with indignation why so said i surely it is rather a decoration than a disgrace methinks the scene would want something without it  now i think resumed blake it is a most abominable eyesore and i cannot bear to look upon it it is the habitation of a fellow without either heart or soul who has done me the basest injury and whom i would not save from the tortures of the rack if it were to be done without inconvenience or expense cursed be the moment in which he purchased that villa  he bought it  yes benignus the rascal bought it on purpose to overlook me and turn my poor little retreat into a seat of torment  here the agonies of a violent antipathy increased so fast upon him that his housekeeper who overheard him and knew his humor desired mr smack to persuade him in to tea  this unaccountable execration perfectly petrified me and i was fairly sobered by surprise god protect us said i in one of my whispers what very poor creatures we are here is a man now placed by thy indulgence in a perfect eden has the love and society of a fair and no doubt amiable companion seems to command all the real prosperities of life even to a degree of luxury and yet torn to pieces by a hateful passion even aversion to his neighbor might as well have been placed by thy destiny in a dungeon into which the blessed beams of thy animating sun never penetrated nor any of his present comforts be permitted to visit him  not forgive triumph in malice cherish implacability one fellow creature set his heart propensely against another sie upon it ah wherefore am i thus perpetually upon the hunt to examine and promote felicity how shall how can it be promoted when those whom providence have so peculiarly favored resolve to be at once impious and what indeed i begin to feel is the consequence of impiety to be wretched  mr blakes fit of spleen was soon over and he drank his tea with that dull composure which was characteristic of him except when as in the late instance his passions were worked upon by any immediate object of their detestation his housekeeper appeared very agreeable at the teatable and save that now and then a word dropped from her not quite so feminine such as consume it confound it pax rat it and the deel meaning the devil abbreviated she sustained herself vastly well to me she was particularly civil and asked me the common edifying questions of the teatable such as whether my cup was sweet or not etc etc with such a smile upon her face that had not blake been present her own heart engaged and the object smiled upon more of a coxcomb than benignus it certainly might have been interpreted into a sort of an overture for the language of smiles is really very intelligible to a keen observer and they often mark the sentiment of the soul so obviously and distinctly that he must be a novice indeed who mistakes them however i took it for granted this fair housekeeper was in truth blakes wife and so her smile passed off as the courtesy of a mighty goodnatured woman who finding her husband not in a very entertaining humor thought it incumbent upon her to make the visit as pleasing to her guests as possible a brimming basin of tea was sent to mr green who soon after drinking it made his appearance again in the parlour and mr smack observing that the sun was down said he must take his leave a motion which i readily seconded blake urged us to stay supper or at least insisted that now i had been showed the way i would come often to kennington aye do sir said mrs blake and when he is not at home i will do my best to deserve the favor of your company so name the day  this request was accompanied by another of those smiles that made it irresistible and i promised to wait upon them on the next sunday this satisfied them mr green took me aside under pretense of doing a little business for him in town and bid me half blind as he was not at any time to go to blakes without him alexander green and then declaring that i was a lad of a thousand suffered me to depart  chap cxviii mr smack and i walked leisurely to town and what is strange without an adventure smack indeed frequently made a pause against the pales of a garden and told me that he was very certain the owners ought to think themselves thrice happy as the poet says though once continued he once benignus i knew a man a mr budbright that had the finest garden in all kent as wretched a mortal as ever was born this mr budbright was a professed florist if his tulips were more prettily streaked this year than the last he was happy but then if he saw in any other mans garden a finer tulip than he could show in his he would be taken sick upon it directly lord how have i heard him curse the weather the sun for being too hot the shade for being too cool the hail for pattering down a pink the rain for drowning this flower the heat for drying up that why i remember i was once at his house on a very fine day which tempted him to uncover several little nurseries of xoticks as the poet says and he was just going to display the beauty of these to me when a dark cloud made him take to his legs and knock down one of his children as it stood in the way that he might cover his precious plants before they received any injury from the wet but who can manage the fates as the poet has it the shower fell very heavy on the sudden before he got to the plants and this put budbright into such a passion that he quarrelled with his wife all dinnertime and made my visit so disagreeable that i left him to his humors as soon as i decently could for though i love flowers mr benignus i love the god that made them still better and i dont in the least doubt but he knows better than i though i am a tolerable judge to be sure when to keep the shower and when to let it fall upon the tender yerb as the poet says  i told mr smack that i perfectly agreed with him as to the knowledge of providence and asked him what opinion he had of his friends blake and green as the poet says the least is said the sooner is it mended replied smack they are two merry men and i now and then am treated by both of them very civilly but what think you said i of mrs blake why as to mrs blake said smack shutting one eye  the least is said the sooner is it mended there too  as to mrs blake i think she is  a  very merry woman  as it was evident mr smack had some reasons for speaking so reservedly possibly because he was now and then treated civilly i had not curiosity enough to fish for intelligence where the prey was prepared to expect a hook under the bait and so finding we had by this time got pretty far into town i called a coach wished mr smack a good evening as the poet has it and then made the best of my way to mr drapers  chap cxix poor said i as i rolled along poor and ineffectual are the pleasures of dissipation i went out in the morning with an aching heart and i come home in the evening with an aching head nor is the heart much lighter than it was i have passed or rather thrown away many hours like a wretched stroller as i am in search of a benefit i have not yet found and the vanity that led me to hope relief from the gaieties of giddy company have produced little more than additional vexation  as i approached doverstreet my heart began to beat more briskly and as i saw the door of draper i trembled from top to bottom upon going in i asked for mr draper and was told by his valet that several letters were for me upon the library table and amongst others one from his master who was not to be at home till the next day i hurried up stairs the faster for this intelligence and shutting the library door approached the table no less than four letters were waiting my perusal and three of them in the same character  a character i did not even look upon without emotion the other was a billet from my friend draper which in flat opposition to the impulses of my heart i was resolved to read first i here give a copy of it to the reader   draper is well and happy but the less so as an indispensible circumstance that shall not long be concealed will detain him to night and perhaps tomorrow from the company of benignus  this card without date etc sent by a porter who was to stay for no answer puzzled me however as my thoughts were too partially engaged another way i left the unriddling of it to himself who was indeed pretty enigmatical in his own conduct and character and now came on the moment of trial the others were evidently from lucy and every one of them bore the marks of a hand and heart disturbed even in the folding and sealing i debated whether i should read them or destroy them unread i put them into my pocket and twisting my arms into a kind of philosophical fold traversed the room yes said i i am equal even to this to read is to ruin i will repress the fatal curiosity yet surely there can be no harm in hearing what she says  perhaps she has goodnaturedly taken leave of me  perhaps she applauds my design  perhaps she may want some little additional accommodation  perhaps  perhaps   here i drew one of the letters again out of my pocket and fumbling at the wax even as i had again begun a meditation on the danger of it had broken it gradually open and held it up to my face half unfolded i saw the tender epithet of most dear benignus at the top and had the courage to shut my eyes then pressing it gently up buttoned it into my bosom and sat down in a chair  and art thou grown inhuman benignus said i not read the letter of thy lucy art not thou enough master of thyself to persevere in the rigid plan thou have laid down as the rule of thy future conduct but thou suspectest thy relapsing even on the receipt of a letter put more confidence in thyself thou art stronger than thou think  this mode of reasoning soon reconciled me to the matter in hand and i believe i should have been able with the assistance of the seducing passions that were now in arms to argue myself into the propriety of shooting a bolt or picking a lock i took another letter from my pocket and unfolded it with a violence that tore the paper you have worthy reader a fair copy of the contents underneath  to benignus i am above hanging upon a mans hands after he is tired of me so can only say that i am resolved to take vengeance on draper and am  your insulted lucy p s as you ordered the jewels i cannot persuade the man to take them back and so enclose his bill for payment of which he will call tonight but if you had not bespoke them i would not have received them and yet it is ten to one but i shall be fool enough to shed a tear when i look upon them and think that they were the last present of the too dear benignus heigho  farewell    poor girl said i on reading this the touches of nature and tenderness are too evident but i am glad to find her bear it so well how could i be afraid to open letters that contain nothing whatever to alarm or to soften me into a relapse i perceive i may read them all very safely this encouraged me to open the second epistle that which remained in the pocket  to benignus ah benignus it is too cruel in you to leave me all at once give me but a month  a fortnight  a week to wean myself gradually from a man who has now been my companion for almost half a year i cannot part with you without some preparation indeed i cannot nor is it in the nature of benignus to deny softening as much as he consistently can the misery of everlasting absence from  lucy p s in my confusion i forgot to acquaint you that you have left your sword here but i will not send it you if you come take it but if you resolve to continue cruel i shall you may depend upon it find a proper employment for it and order it when i am going indeed to leave both you and the world to be brought to the man who directed it to the heart of  lucy     this letter occasioned too much agitation notwithstanding the old hackneyed rosamondpond images of death bowls and daggers in it to permit remarks and so in order to wound myself completely i took from my bosom what follows  to benignus most dear benignus allow me only the warning of a day  come and give me the last embraces to night  sleep within my arms this one night and i will without complaining suffer you to forsake them tomorrow besides this i have a secret to impart to you that must not be concealed  ah benignus it cannot will not much longer be concealed  every hour will bring onward the tender discovery  the whole world must shortly know it  why then should it be hid from benignus a moment why should he not be told what so nearly concerns him heaven first taught letters for some wretchs aid some banished lover or some captive maid especially since they so well hide the blush and pour out all the heart  take then oh my benignus the interesting fact a fact which nature love and duty unite to urge a disclosure of  our passion will soon be rewarded with a dear pledge of it  i carry about with me the image of benignus  i am with child by him  i  i can say no more  lucy   here the paper dropped from my trembling hand i struck that hand upon my heart and the heart obedient to the blow brought the tears of remorse and agony into my eye as soon as words found their way i exclaimed in a reprobating tone of voice  a bastard and have i after all my benevolence all my affected delicacy been instrumental to the life of a being that must pass its days in shame ridicule and ignominy  and yet  shall the poor parent suffer for this  shall the weary and painful hours of the woman in travail be made more bitter by the neglect of the very man who has brought on her growing calamity  ah no forbid it humanity forbid it nature it would now be impious to leave her i will go this moment  perhaps even now she  even now   i put the letters into my pocket and went expeditiously down stairs the clock striking ten as i reached the last step i shall sleep out to night crimpa said i and went into the street without thinking of my supper  chap cxx i continued absolutely to run till i arrived at the lodgings of lucy which i no sooner entered than the bewitching creature ran to me and gave me such a kiss of welcome as completely did for me in the diningroom was sitting even at that time of the night an illlooking but welldressed elderly woman lucy met me on the stairs and telling me she had been very ill all day and very lonesome had been obliged to an old country acquaintance to sit a little with her but you may go now mrs trickmaid said she i shall be very well now my dear benignus is come the old lady curtesied ceremoniously and paraded down stairs with great pomp and not thinking her worth a question or rather not having time to ask uninteresting questions i had a tongue only for lucy whom i treated with much greater tenderness than ever and are you not angry with me benignus said she for the additional expense i am likely to bring upon you or are you now come to take leave of me for ever however be that as it may the happiness of this night shall not be made worse than it ought to be by painful anticipation saying this she took me in her arms dropped her head as if unable to support it upon my bosom and  we did not sleep in separate chambers  early in the morning the servant came into the bed room to inform lucy that the jeweller was come again hang the fellow said lucy for disturbing us what shall we say to him benignus  say my dear replied i pay him this moment to be sure and i ask your pardon that i should have forgotten to enclose a sufficient bill for the purpose but the disorder i was in yesterday morning will excuse it to you nay said lucy i am now very indifferent as to such matters i have got you again benignus and no other jewel upon earth can add to the luster of my present happiness  the welltimed tenderness of this speech would have made me pay with pride and pleasure a bill of larger amount than the present although the earings were no trifles in point of price neither bearing no less a valuation than  00 guineas upon talking with the trader i could not help saying it appeared to me a most monstrous price for so small a trinket  the smaller the more elegant my dear said lucy but i think as well as you mr knicknack might abate something  abate madam said knicknack  not a sixpence  i dont get a guinea by them and i would not sell them so cheap to any body else in the world  but as you are likely to be a customer why  i will not stand with you and therefore i have been at a word but will not you have the necklace along with them madam it is a thousand pities to part them they are for all the world like brother and sister or rather like man and wife and so pray madam let them go together  oh fie  how can you wear the earings without the necklace it is impossible is it not sir  dont tell me said lucy i am sorry to put the gentleman to the charge of the earings and i will give you ten guineas out of my own pocket to take them again  i was so well pleased with this generous conduct of lucys that i was resolved to reward it and pray mr knicknack said i what would be the charge of this necklace i can afford it to you sir at two hundred more and i would not sell it so dog cheap to my own father  poor lucy had suffered so much upon my account on the yesterday and had given such manifest tokens of a good disposition that i even desired to use the jewellers phrase this brilliant couple might be strictly united and gave him a draft upon mr parsons of chancery lane for the sum of four hundred guineas lucy took me again into her arms and said that i had now made her happy beyond expression  chap cxxi i thought myself so bound to lucy by the ties of nature at least till the birth of the child and provision of the mother that instead of finding more arguments against i did every thing to favor those ideas which suggested the contrary and as to the guilt of the connection i thought of that as little as possible indeed the fact was i had not the confidence to give way to reflections of that sort lest i should be tempted a second time to desert the now pregnant lucy nay i will fairly own to the reader even at the hazard of sinking in his estimation that i had two or three severe conflicts with myself whether as an honest man notwithstanding the loose life of lucy i ought not before the birth of the babe to sanctify as it were its appearance in this world by a lawful acknowledgement of lucy as my wife whom said i whom have i to fear but the terrors of my own conscience whom have i to please but my own heart and the good god that gave it  by an act of indubitable equity it is now in my power to render honorable the life of that creature i have begotten which will otherwise be spent in disgrace the mother too has been indiscreet but is young in error and may by being led into the purer path walk in it the residue of her days with delicacy with dignity and proper attention to the double duties of wife and parent what hinders me then from yielding to such benevolence why should i hesitate to do that which is thus urged by the approbation of reason and justice i know not indeed as yet any of lucys family i know not from whom she sprang by whom she was ruined nor to whom she is related hitherto i have considered her as the object of dalliance and i was also cautious of entering into subjects that might heighten my perplexity but the case is now altered she has certainly been constant to me and the effect of that constancy is unless i provide against it likely to be her greatest misfortune were i to suffer this i should be a discourager of fidelity and an enemy to that tenderness which is the very cement of continued and progressive society  on the other hand i argued what many a man no doubt in similar circumstances has argued before me that such a union would subject me to the ridicule of all my friends and the absolute desertion of all my relations that it would particularly pique the pride of the darlingtons and that even drapers negative would be flat against it  well said i and what of all this shall the foolish censure of a world led in the triumphant shackles of custom browbeat me from a point i feel to be so very consistent with what is right i thank heaven neither systems nor adventures nor the contradictory sentiments they have exhibited to me have as yet had any weight with me to alter the great duty i first cherished of doing to others as i would they should do unto me and in poor lucys circumstances i am sure the duty to be done is too apparent to be neglected nay it comes recommended to me under the most touching and pathetic incidents methinks i hear the helpless little infant plead its own tender cause imagination assists me even to personify the scene see see the unfriended being beseeches me to own it  the father is supplicated to acknowledge his own child  the mother too prevented by delicacy from making the request looks up to me for protection points out to me the features that most resemble the parent kisses the beloved similitude and only ventures to observe in a whisper that had it been born in wedlock it might one day become a joy to the wife an ornament to the father and a credit to society  and were these arguments made to be resisted were such advocates ever suffered to plead in vain avert it nature avert it all that is godlike in the composition of man  the conclusion of the whole matter was this i will certainly have some very serious conversation with lucy on this subject and if i find her as deserving in other respects as i know her to be in some i will overlook the circumstance of her first misfortune and make her in spite of all the opposing world neither more nor less than the lawful wife of benignus  chap cxxii let the reader say what he pleases the very center of my heart was cheared by this resolution and promising lucy i would dine with her i took my morningwalk with a satisfaction to which till then i had been a stranger  and now i paid my second visit to the unfortunate wife of the grocer in conformity to my intention i found mrs brawn at the place appointed and gave her five guineas with a desire that she should get herself decently equipped and in a comfortable lodging and then told her i had a scheme in view that i hoped would make her once more happy that is said i upon the supposition that you would not oppose any thing that might have a tendency to bring you and your husband together again mrs brawn was so elevated at the sight of the money that she promised any thing though it is probable she scarce knew to what she assented she would go she said and do as i bid her directly and hoped god would bless every step i took from this would to the next in a few days then mrs brawn added i you will give me a call agreeable to a direction and i now gave her one of drapers printed cards containing his address which mrs brawn wrapped up in a piece of paper and put in her bosom having taken notice that her handerchief was clean her cap new and her apron fresh washed since i saw her the day before i told her that i perceived my last money was well bestowed  that i saw she was still a housewife and that she gave me encouragement from these prospects to continue my assistance while it should be wanted which said i both for your sake and your husbands who is no doubt by this time sorry for his imprudence will not be long  from mrs brawn i took a strole into doverstreet to see if any fresh messages had arrived from the absent draper nothing from my master sir said the servants but here is a letter from some other person and the porter has been waiting near an hour for an answer if the sentiments of this letter surprise the reader as much as they did me he will be surprised indeed  dear nigg luck is changed after you went away last night blake and i set to it and left off about half an hour ago i am now going into bed half past  0 oclock in the day time but as every shilling i had is fairly won i desire you will send me a guinea which i will send you in return when fortune comes about again i bought very luckily about  0 pounds worth of wearing apparel for my wife and i have new rigged my children but it would be d  m  d hard to give and take away from the poor things already so send i say the   l   s just for the potboiling business and who knows what tomorrow may bring forth for  your alexander green   without either date or address was this very wonderful epistle sent to doverstreet nor could the porter give me any satisfactory answer for the answer was to be carried to a coffeehouse and wait till called for however i sealed up the only three guineas i had about me and trusted it as desired by the messenger he was scarce gone before i discovered a slip of paper that was enclosed in greens letter to the following purport greens postscript was  ps you have been a good while upon the hunt after a man really happy i beg therefore dear nigg you will carry the enclosed as directed whenever you set off upon the next sally good by the enclosed was open and addressed to mr lemuel dab in poets nook at mr pepers the  d door   pair of stairs st giless  dear lem the best man i know is the bearer hereof and he wants to see the happiest which i know to be you pray use him as the friend of  a green ps i have no cash or i would send it you good by     chap cxxiii that mr green could preserve the same equality of temper  or rather that he could so soon accommodate himself to the sudden reverses of fortune was astonishing the more especially that he could be calm enough to talk about happiness without sixpence in his pocket yet i must own i was exceedingly struck with the direction and recommendatory letter he had given me to mr lemuel dab whom as i had two or three hours upon my hands before dinner i was resolved to visit upon the mere principles of curiosity without more delay then i began for the first time in my life my journey into st giless where after infinite difficulty i found out the dark passage that led me to mr pepers the landlord of mr lemuel  the coachman had no sooner opened the door than a difficulty arose for lo i had not a single sixpence in my pocket having sent the very last running cash i had to green the fare was only a shilling and yet that was twelve pence more than i could command i told the driver very fairly my situation and added if he would call on me where he took me up tomorro morning i would double his pay as to that master said the coachman i dont know you nor do you know me so i think the best way would be not to trust one another besides many gentlemen come out of great houses that never get admittance into them again and yet very few gentlemen come out of such a house as that where i took your honor up and come to such a d  m  d upanddown place as this and though i dont suppose this to be your honors case seeing that you are very well dressed yet i doubt if your honor cannot pay me one shilling to day it may not be quite so convenient to pay two tomorrow moreover sir it is but a good twelve pennyworth and to be sure the friend you are going to see can lend your honor such a trifle  odso said i that is true friend i will step up to the gentleman and borrow the value of your debt stand to your horses therefore and i will be with you in a minute this trouble however the coachman was too polite to put me to rather choosing like a wellbred man that knew his business to attend me closely till we had no farther to do with one another after passing through many strange labyrinths even before we ascertained the tenement and then climbing a flight of stairs at once broken and dirty we came to a dark little door on which was pasted a paper label with the words lemuel dab thereon as i knocked for admittance the coachman looked at me as much as to signify his suspicions that out of that house would come no shillings i took it for granted and told him by way of reply that he might stare but that whatever he might think of it the happiest man in england lived in that hut notwithstanding his suspicions  by this time the lord of the mansion opened the door and demanded our business i delivered my testimonials and while he was reading them i recollected in his features the marks of the very lemuel whom i had already seen at the shop of mr luton the bookseller with whose ingenious method of dealing with his authors the reader is pre acquainted  mr lemuel dab now offered his hand with great tokens of hospitality and invited me into his apartments but here the coachman again insisted upon his share of attention without more ado i told lemuel my embarrassment and the awkward state of my uvelle perplexity concluding with desiring the loan of a shilling i have but three halfpence sir said lemuel or you should have it joyfully but what of that these trifles are settled instantly what have you got about you of value i took out of my pocket a tweezercase which very luckily happened to be of silver an opera glass and a pocketbook with silver clasps why sir cried lemuel you carry the indies about you and can you possibly be distressed about a shilling sit down three minutes and i will accommodate you  lemuel took the tweezercase and went out while the coachman and i remained in his lucubratory which in point of exterior surpassed every thing but the lucubrator  sweet heaven said i what a variety of minds have thou created some people would shudder to be only in possession of three halfpence while another accounts it sufficient to his felicity but with how little ceremony does this man set off to fell my property if he is not the happiest man he has the happiest way of doing an unaccountable thing i ever knew since i was born but the tweezercase is a bauble and so let it go besides i have no other way of getting rid of this fellow and it is all very well  these cogitations were interrupted by the return of lemuel who put into my hand the value of half a guinea in silver and a little slip of pasteboard written upon and notched at the edges  that said lemuel you will put into your pocketbook and so the business is settled i gave the man his shilling and an additional sixpence for waiting which he took without pulling off his hat or pretending to thank me and went sneering down stairs  chap cxxiv mr lemuel and i soon entered into familiar conversation in the course of which i gave him at his request a partial sketch of my adventures suppressing what i thought would not tell to my advantage and at the conclusion i asked him whether he thought any of the ways i had pursued or seen were the ways to happiness  the way to happiness why how can thou be so preposterous said lemuel the road is as plain as a pike staff your adventures are diversified and agreeable without being useful and they prove to me but one single truth  and what is that said i  that all thy faculties rejoined the philosopher were given thee only to torment thee that curiosity is the bowl and sensibility the dagger by which thou art destroyed  that every sensible property about thee touch taste sight smell and every thing else organic animal and homuncular is of no more use to thee than the freckles upon thy chin or the mole upon thy cheekbone and that in one sentence thou art altogether the most unaccountable biped that ever snapt at thy own shadow and mistook the real reasons for which the substance was created reduce happiness into a system indeed reduce the manycoloured clouds into a nutshell what the pestilence is the matter with thee always complaining of ill treatment and going about the world to complain of matters that are mighty well as they are i am glad however that by means of my friend mr green you are come in my way i will take compassion on thy inexperience and it shall be thy own fault if thou art ever unhappy again let what will befall thee  sit still  attend  in the gratitude of my soul i put up a silent ejaculation and made myself certain that my hour was now really come and that i should pass the rest of my life in smiles  our threehalfpenny philosopher caught up his pen with a gravity of muscles that portended something extraordinary then giving a mystical flourish with his elbow waving it semicircularly he wrote upon a small piece of blotted copypaper the following words in large scrambling capitals  the art of being always happy now for it said i throbbing with expectation the ceremony is so aweful that i dare say the system or precept to which it leads is solid and infallible there is an air of divination in the very posture of the penman as he now sits swelling over the majesty of his subject i would not interrupt him for the universe  chap cxxvi after two or three minutes parade he wrote under this promising title one pithy period in which the rules of horace were so strictly observed that it consisted only of six words which he wrote in a roman text hand thus take things as you find them  here he laid down his pen pointed with his finger to the maxim and looked me full in the face at last he addressed me thus what think you now sir eh have not i done your business completely  pray go on dear friend said i hastily pray go on go on rejoined lemuel knitting his brows aye i thought so i knew you would be at that sport why where the pestilence would you have me go to no sir i shall go no farther i can go no farther the great nicety to be observed in every thing human is this know when to stop why i have done man totally done engrave it in letters of adamant  engrave it on a plate of gold surrounded by gems of precious price and let it be hung by a silver chain around thy neck  engrave what mr lemuel said i  what replied he oh blindness why the golden rule i have given thee there it is the greatest wisest and the most wholesome system upon the face of the earth take things as you find them  preach to eternity you can prove no more unsettle by systems and longlaboured literary roundabouts the very marrow in the hollow of your bones you can come no closer to the ultimatum of all things defirable that you may depend upon only observe this rule and if it does not bring you through even as it brought me through why my name is not lemuel dab why sir i found my system on a basis of brass even upon the fundamentals of  0 years experience and if i were to last  00 years longer which i scarcely shall it would remain the same infallible axiom well do i remember the time when made petulant by prosperity and softened by a worse because a higher situation than that in which you now find me rendered peevish and effeminate i say by these things i used to quarrel with every thing around me that did not hit my humor to a tittle i gave the slack rein to my passions and they hurried me into many sorry scrapes that only made me more wayward when i was angry i made no scruple to knock down a table a chair a glass or a flower pot if it stood in my way i fell out even with these inanimate objects i could not eat if my dinner had the turn of the spit too much or too little without cursing the cook i could not drink if my beer tasted too much or too little of the hop without damning the brewer i saw or fancied i saw imperfections in every thing but god took pity on me sir and deprived me of what is called my prosperous circumstances in order to open the eyes of my perverted undestanding a few good substantial strokes upon the heart cooled me wonderfully  the loss of an estate to which i was born that fell a prey to the lawyers settled me perfectly and a little observation upon the affairs of men assured me that i might kick and prance and give myself airs but it would all be to no purpose that i should only live anxious and go down into the grave sooner for acting the selftormentor and tearing my body and constitution all to pieces so in progress of my practicing these wiser sentiments i found myself gradually better and better able to go through the twentyfour hours let what will happen in them without acting either like a stoic or a madman i still felt but i found it now and then politic not to show that i did so i was obliged to live by dealing in a commodity few know to value and still fewer choose to purchase even by retailing out the few wits that the lord had lent me i still continue to tug at this oar and i cannot boast of my riches to be sure but then i am sure i am as contented as if i had the possession of the bank i have my own set of pleasures and they alleviate my pains i can look upon a coach without wishing to be in it at a cart without thinking that is preferable to a coach at a wheelbarrow without wishing to trundle it and at this stupendous city of london with a sigh to think that i know there are so very few a match in respect to happiness for a fellow who has but threehalfpence and an essay on fortune that will produce two shillings upon the face of the earth in short sir i have brought myself to this and have done it all by adhering to the only rule that was able to accomplish such a task even by taking things as i found them  chap cxxv you see how happy i am continued the philosopher semper eadem the same to day to morrow and for ever but enough of this follow my little rule and you will be as happy as myself in the mean time what say you to adjourning to some snug apartment for the enjoyment of a crust and a can of twopenny drink for the deities i have no money indeed as i told you except just sufficient for a good dinner yet three farthings should have been deducted from my three halfpence to accommodate you had it been necessary this however is out of the question you have a wealthy pocket you today i tomorrow such is the balance of things such is the fair and square of heavenly government hill and dale up hill down hill and all for variety come then my friend let us go forth to our regalement  we went forth as he called it and in traveling down stairs the philosopher observed there was a purity in the air of his lucubratory that we should sorely miss when we got lower into a denser atmosphere the higher we climb said he the nearer to the gods benignus as we verge toward earth and the mundane system we convolve with the dirt but we must take things as we find them you know and so on my friend to the place that was made to receive the foot of man  chap cxxvi this mr lemuel was really so prejudicing a figure that even his darling rule of taking things as we find them could scarce reconcile one to him from top to toe he was so uniformly uncouth that so far from its being possible to consider any peculiar oddity he was all over a compound of most ridiculous nature the scalp of his skull was totally bald so that he was as it were all face from his chin forward to the nape of his neck backward and yet he affected to despise a wig but what made this the more preposterous was the grotesque shape of his scull which tapering away pyramidically from the ear formed at the top a complete cone not very unlike one of those cheeses known by the name of the stilton cheese under an immense depth of socket lay encaverned our philosophers eyes overhung by such a profusion of brow that nature seemed to have made a small mistake in suffering the hair to cover the face instead of the head for had it been her divine pleasure to thin the eyebrow in order to accommodate the pate both might have been becomingly furnished but certainly her ladyship was in her merriest mood at the birth of this her ludicrous lemuel for besides these singularities the nasal organ obtruded upon the oral a pair of rawlooking lips always on the gape and twisted awry exhibited a pair of jaws that had not the chin by curling upwards modesty aimed at concealing the abyss it might not be safe for women in certain situations to look upon them  such was the appearance which was now stalking into the street and let me hope pardon for the decent pride of human nature if i fairly confess i was somewhat ashamed of my companion for what was concealed or but darkly visible in the attic story in which the man and the mansion were of a piece now they came to be separated and our philosopher set his face to the sun i began to fear the fate of king richard would be again realized and the very dogs bark as mr lemuel halted by them sober reasons justified these suspicions for his habiliments were of such a cut and such a color the thing that he wore by way of hat so uncommonly absurd so thin his carcass to which was subjoined such an emaciated thigh and such longitude of leg over which were drawn such harlequin hose that he was altogether a moveable wonder yet feeling a mixed sensation of pity and surprise as i saw him like a dark shadow lengthen before me i had the courage to keep within a yard of him in the public streets of this laughterloving london  curiosity however threw her eyes upon him in a moment and we were attended by a great multitude as i knew not the place where lemuel was accustomed to enjoy his twopenny he took the lead and after turning through nameless dark passages and dirty alleys amid the hoot of boys the giggle of girls and the silent astonishment of fullgrown people lemuel without seeming to regard the spectators that he had drawn around him stopped at the door of a miserable building which displayed at once the slope of age and bad architecture from hence issued a smoke that ascended to the nostrils and lemuel telling me we were landed ducked his head to fix his foot upon the steps and then taking hold of my hand we both sunk like a pair of theatrical gosts into a cellar  for some time amazement had fixed her seal on my lips and now had my existence depended on a syllable it could not have been articulated the fumigations of the place at my first entrance into this infernal ordinary not only blinded my eyes but took away my breath and i was absolutely inveloped in a mist of meat lemuel on the contrary to whom the fog was familiar sat collected in himself and told me with appetite in his very look that we were in a land flowing with milk and honey even in the land of canaan  a flowing land i will be sworn said i for we are up to the ancles in water in broth my dear lad you mean said the philosopher a man of my principles a man with any sort of moderation about him might live and prosper upon what is here thrown away we wade in marrow and the richness of the bones my best youth we do indeed replied i and if we stay much longer here shall i do verily believe wax exceeding fat i am in a thriving way already mr lemuel pshaw rejoined lemuel sit thee down upon this form and let us consider what dainty we shall six on the worst of it is in these places ones appetite is always distracted by such delicious variety  i sat down and as well as i was able kept myself from bathing in the broth and now my sight being in some degree restored i had an opportunity to survey the cellar and its inhabitants never surely did the human eye behold a more miscellaneous heap of dead and living subjects on one side were displayed the quarters of an ox the limbs of a lamb and the entrails of a pig raw and roasted baked and boiled mingling together the cook in a greasy nightcap and his shirt stripped and folded in a truss to his elbow was scorching at the fire on the other side sat a row of shabby customers in silent expectation and to give a finishing to the whole the window was blockaded by a parcel of poor creatures who unable to purchase the substance were contenting themselves with the shadow and actually dining upon the effluvia that came steaming from the pots  as i by this time had received a surfeit lemuel had looked himself into longing i am for a slice of that ham said he my friend ham is a promoter of twopenny in compliment to lemuel i attempted to eat this ham is too fat said i these greens are too much like yellows this bread is too stale ods pestilence cried the philosopher take things as you find them come do as i do man impossible said i then read this cried the philosopher taking a little dirty manuscript out of his pocket and presenting it to me  read that and i will finish in a minute  i opened the book and read the title which ran thus the essence of truth or the art of being happy at all times in all places now for it said i friend lemuel if thou can prove it possible for a man to sit stewing in a little subterraneous cellar and yet be cooly contented both in mind and body thou art indeed a philosopher i do prove it every day of my life said the philosopher with the meat in his mouth shut the book and behold ocular demonstration look at that lattice all things are comparative these people would give their ears for the sat and greens at which you toss up your nose do thou think so replied i eagerly i shall save some pieces upon my plate as i always do and then you shall see rejoined lemuel  here waiter said i give each of those women at the window sixpenny worth of what they like best sixpennyworth cried the philosopher in a loud voice laying down his knife and fork in astonishment why man there never was heard such a speech here since the foundations of the house were laid lord how little do thou know how to live well may so extravagant a man be miserable if the rich could conceive how many of the indigent as they are falsely called were subsisted they would be taught at the same time more sensibility and more economy as to this place notwithstanding the delicacies which surround you a penny is competent threehalfpence is giving a little into indulgence three pence is intemperate spending and fourpence farthing is a downright debauch  these observations excited in me the very first reflections on my own extravagance and i was fully resolved to be more oeconomical  soon after this the philosopher said he would regale with the luxuries of a pipe asserting that it answered two excellent purposes first by promoting meditation and secondly by promoting digestion i told him i was summoned by a particular engagement which would at present deprive me of his company he took hold of my hand and with great composure bade me farewell reserving only a shilling which i was wise enough to keep for accidents i begged his acceptance of the remainder leaving the fate of the poor people at the lattice to his discretion then promising to repeat my visit i took leave of this truly practical philosopher and after many enquiries got out of the lanes into a main street where luckily seeing a stand of coaches i made use of one to convey me once more to the apartments of lucy  chap cxxvii how much more real happiness appeared to reside in the cellar of the philosopher than in the lodgings of lucy at the time i arrived the first object i met at the foot of the stairs was lucys servant arguing the point in seeming earnestness with a shabby man who was leaning against the bannisters the next groupe of figures were disposed in the diningroom in the following order on the one hand was lucy who upon perceiving me burst into a violent flood of tears opposite to her was the very old woman who yesterday appeared as lucys friend and at the other end of the room sat my worthy and wellrecollected acquaintance mr dodge without more preface the case stood thus lucy had as she said previous to my connection with her resided at the house of this mrs trickmaid who for board lodging and money lent had run up a bill to the amount of  00 pounds which she was resolved to have at a moments warning and upon application meeting an excuse had taken out a writ and put it for serving into the trusty hands of mr dodge lucy took me into the bedroom and told me she could not bear the thoughts of my paying any more and that with my leave as she would not live in the debt of such a base woman she would send her ear rings to be pledged i told her it was a very unlucky affair as i had lately drawn pretty deeply on parsons but that i thought it my duty to pay it if she knew it to be a reasonable demand  the old woman said she had sworn to the debt and mr dodge hoped i would pardon him for serving his majesty without teazing the reader with the disagreeable particulars of this affair i shall just inform him that it ended in my paying debt and cost with sending a second messenger to mr archibald parsons when the parties were gone and lucy and i left alone she told me the surprise and confusion of that cruel womans unexpected behavior was too much for her and she begged permission to lie down on the bed here as i attended her she said in a whisper that the very babe within her was disturbed and she would not hurt the dear pledge for ten thousand worlds this affected me so much i wept in the sincerity of my tenderness and quite forgot the expensive circumstance of the old woman and her hundred pounds  after dinner i talked with lucy upon several subjects on purpose to sound the depth of her judgment and understanding both which were so much beyond women in her sad circumstances that i was more and more convinced of her deserving a sacred situation in the course of the afternoon she became very agreeable and showed a good heart by wishing with a sigh that she had seen me before she had ever known guilt but that as it was she might die first why so lucy said i because then benignus she replied your child will not want a friend and a protector in him whom he will not be permitted to call father one thing she said sat heavy upon her bosom but if i would grant one request it would be infinitely relieved it is only that you will allow me to turn all my trinkets into money and place it in the bank for the use of our infant lest after you have left me it should be destitute and after such a measure no wants or temptations could prevail with me to touch it nay i will with your leave by a deed of settlement put it out of my own power  hearts of marble or adamant only could support this and in the glow of my feelings i assured her a decent competency should very shortly be made by way of annuity upon the mother of the infant not said i lucy that i have any design to leave you but because you should have a little comfortable dependence of your own and be properly provided for and set above the necessity of future improprieties should any thing happen to me lucy said i was goodness itself and entreated she might withdraw to indulge the sensibility i had excited  the happiness i had communicated to another radiated upon myself and i walked out into the street and from thence into an adjoining square to soothe myself as usual by soliloquy  oh generosity what a source of joy art thou to thyself and others thou art the sun of the soul the clouds of distress flee from before thee the storms of misery are dispersed and as thy impartial beam spreads comforts and blessings on every side thou appearest only to shine the brighter in proportion to the felicity that is thus benignly extended continue then oh continue to illume my bosom let this hand forget its employment and this heart cease its motion when it ceases to feel thy amiable energy  a thinking man frequently walks fast my reflections so assisted my legs that i found myself at the farthest end of a distant street when coming out of a house i beheld the figure of a man which immediately struck me and as he was going the opposite way i walked along briskly to overtake him  chap cxxviii in the person of this man i saw  whom do thou think my good reader  even the grocer of grassington whom i no sooner accosted than he recognized me and spoke thus ah  ha my young hero have i found you you are a fine benevlent chap indeed with a pax to ye you kidnab peoples children do you gim me my daughter damme gim me my daughter it is you have got her now i find after she was turned out of doors this is your fine sarch after happiness is it  i have come all the way from grassington ater you your names pretty well up there i can tell you that master nignus the nevolent gimme my daughter i say or i will send you over the herringpond take my word for it  the least that i supposed was that the poor grocers misfortunes in the loss of his wife and daughter had turned the little wits he had and that he was now being in the middle of the moon in the height of his delirium i told him i knew nothing of his daughter but believed i could help him to his wife if he wished such a circumstance  my wife  what have got her too have do keep um both then  eh i will have thee hung drawn and quartered thee may talk of thy nevolence and such like but i will not budge from thee the length of my nail till have given me my daughter as to martha she may stay where she is i have almost lost all my substance for want of a woman to look sharp to shop and so it cannot be much worse with me but thee shall pay for all master nignus i promise thee  by this time a mob collected it was in vain i protested i knew nothing of his daughter though i owned i had rendered some little services to his poor destitute wife he swore he would fetch a warrant and sarch my house and send both me and his b  h of a daughter to newgate before night adding that he was sure the wench was now in my house and so says he thee had better gee her up at once for i tell thee again and again you nevolent son of a w  i will not leave thee  as nothing would satisfy him but a conviction that i was really innocent of the crime imputed to me i even agreed to take him with me first to lucys then to drapers and indeed i now began to consider the charge of too important a nature both to my character and the grocers peace of mind not to clear myself i suffered the grocer therefore to waddle by the side of me till i got to the door of my mistress which being accidentally left open the grocer rushed in and i after him lucys maid seeing us ran as fast as possible up stairs without speaking to acquaint her mistress as i then supposed that a stranger was coming mr brawn now in a violent perspiration mounted the stairs and without knocking broke open the door that the maid had just shut after her which he had so sooner done than he roared out in a voice inconceivably dreadful did not i tell thee so  eh did not i tell thee thou had got her what do you say to this mr nignus the nevolent and what do you say to it you fine dizendout hussy  eh with your silks and tricks and your trinkumbobs and such like  eh  the vehement scream of lucy the confusion of the maid and the language of brawn soon convinced me that i had really been all this time connected with the grocers debauched daughter and yet the whole matter appeared to me so like a dream that i was as little able to answer as to account for it all that i was able to say was to ask what all this meant what is it replied the grocer why that you have made a w  of my daughter or at least you have harbored her and that is enough for me nay i can bring witness that thee said thee had my wife and i dont doubt but thou have made a w  of she  mayhap she is in next room i am  solved to see howsomdever  here he made an effort to open the door of the bedroom but was opposed both by lucy and the maid each protesting nobody was there but as brawn continued to persist in his resolutions to search the whole apartment i went myself to second him and we met the most obstinate resistance from the women a letter in the scuffle dropped out of lucys pocket which to prevent farther mischief imagining it to be one of mine i took up and the grocer at last gained his point at the same time gave lucy a thrust with his hand against the wainscoat that brought her upon the carpet in a swoon  brawn now ran raving up and down the room tossed about the bed cloths shook the curtains examined the closets and was coming disappointed into the dining room when he bethought himself to look under the bed where lo after stooping down to the task with great difficulty he saw and pulled out by the left leg a something very like a man that had upon its back a very glittering coat and upon its belly a still more glittering waistcoat who art thee eh said the grocer turning him over another nevolent chap i spose  upon this the figure arose and convinced the whole company he was alive though infinitely drunk he swore as well as he was able to make out the matter that that lady was his property that he would not de  de  liver her to the crim of tar  tar nor the z  aar of muscovy and that as he had already killed one man upon her account he would kill two more if  if they did not instantly quit the prem  i  ses  this heroic resolution was very near producing a battle for our staggering young gentlemen drew his sword which was really stained with blood and waved it at the breast first of the grocer and then me while the grocer flew to the fire place and seized the poker it was no time for dallying and i was at the risque of my life resolved to quiet this spark accordingly i stole behind the chair where he had by this time seated himself got the sword from his grasp and drawing him on the floor examined his pockets for that information which he was himself unable to give me verbally not a trace however remained to lead me not a single clue to this enigma and all that either threats or persuasions could extort from either lucy or her maid were that he was a drunken rake who seeing the door open had forced himself up stairs and could not be persuaded to go away till hearing us coming the mistress had prevailed upon him to go through the bedroom down stairs as soon as we were in the dining room  very true as you say fair lady  very true  i am but a dr  drun  drunken rake as you observe cried the man and so  gem  gentel  lemen your humble servant i  i  i am  o  only a rake  he got up and reeling to the stairs fallied into the street the mystery increased the puzzle was more intricate than ever one thing howsomdever is plain said brawn this here is my daughter my property and i seize her in the kings name i will have her home if its only to vex her and as for thee master nignus i will take care of thee as soon as i can talk to layer i promise thee so come along miss  he was proceeding to lay violent hands on her when the landlady of the house came up with a letter which she said was to be given into no hand but mrs lucy brawns i told the woman that brought it maam there was no such person here as you go by the name of silborn silborn be d  d said the grocer what do talk of silborn she was born and christened brawn and she is every inch a brawn and my brawn i will swear to her so gee the letter to me or else i will send ye to the herringpond for i am her lawful father and such like  the landlady delivered the letter and very prudently retired while my grief indignation and amazement increased so fast upon me that i was almost distracted brawn having opened the letter swore it was written with such a d  d up and down fist he could not cipher it and threw it to me but it signifies nothing talking i will have laa and my daughter so saying he caught lucy by the arm and she falling upon her knees asked pardon and said if he would be less violent and come tomorrow she would tell every thing and do every thing he would have her  i did love thee once lucy  know i did  would have given the best at the sugar loaf to make thee happy but now you are gone and martha is gone and my substance is at rack and ruin i dont know what to do what to say nor whither to betake me why poor bob blewit is better off than i am now lawyer limbos come back as rich as a jew and bobs going to have all his fortin again and they say will be richest man in county but i i luckee have nothing to hope now why should i get money i love nobody i cannot find my wife i am ashamed of my daughter and i ant so fat as i was by several stone i am half melted with fretting  the poor grocer began to weep and his whole speech together with the intelligence concerning mr blewit who by the by returned my last present with a grateful letter in which he told me his present circumstances did not require assistance all wrought upon me but too powerfully and i did every thing my sensibility suggested on so trying an occasion to ease the heart of this offended and afflicted father i told him every circumstance that related to his wife at whose situation he forgot his usual ferocity and cried like the child of nature that gives way only to natural impressions i promised to bring about an interview i assured him that with respect to his daughter i had protected her for some time from worse conditions and that while i lived she should never want a friend nay i even went so far as to promise him if i did not make her my wife i would never see her again in an improper way though i would sufficiently provide for her the notion of making her my wife had wonderful weight with the grocer who took me by the hand and said you did not ruin she i know that and so can the easier forgive but i am now so much the talk of grassington and the sugar loaf is so loansome that i cannot smoke nor i cannot go about nor i cannot bustle nor i cannot do nothing for what after all is a mans gettings if he has neither wife nor daughter to share them these remarks ended with his kissing lucy and telling me that the whole matter of my having his daughter was discovered by one i little thought on but that he would tell me all tomorrow and desired i would get martha to see him and that we might all have a meeting at the same house in the morning upon my promising this he insisted on lucys going with him to the inn where he set up and said she should come with him again in the morning the poor girl dared not refuse such was her astonishment and i had not the courage to oppose it so off she walked in an agony of halfstifled distress with the grocer  they were no sooner gone than i mastered my amazement sufficiently to recollect the letters and read them with the astonishment they commanded that which had dropped from lucys pocket begins the next chapter  chap cxxix to lucy silborn dear creature i am glad you think so well of me as to employ me without ceremony may i never enjoy another moment in your society and make a dupe of benignus if i do not revenge your cause by pinking the fellow who has seduced this precious prize away before you have got all that is good out of him i should be a most ungrateful rascal not to hazard my life to please you to whom i owe not only the necessaries but the splendours of it lose no time in getting a settlement the old woman our friend mrs trickmaid is the best person in the world to tell you how to fleece such an openhanded softhearted fool as him ask and he gives knock at his purse though ever so gently and he opens it unto thee in a word if you can carry on the affair of the child till you have got a good round sum and nailed him down to an annuity then let the gudgeon go i am glad he continues to bite so eagerly  i will lay a plan for draper instantly and never see you again till he is some how or other disposed of i would send a thousand such fellows as he to the devil for the love i bear to the divine lucy by the bye i am sorry mrs trickmaid gave you that d  d medicine for if it had spoiled your shape and busifiness ever so much twas my child and twas a pity to play it such a trick burn this as soon as you have read it for if it should get air we might all be hanged and that would be the devil while benignus is worth sixpence and you play your cards well i need not risque my neck again by taking an evenings ride with a charge in my pocket  i am dear lucy thine eternally l l   the next letter was addressed to the same lady and presented me with the following agreeable intelligence  to miss brawn your father is again in town and knows the whole affair even to my being privy to your first granting the favor to l l he behaved here just now like one distracted and is gone out to see if he can find you or your keeper as for me he vows he will ruin me and leave me at trial directly but as to that i snap my singers for the justices have too much reason to stand up for mrs trickmaid besides most of them are customers i know not what to advise where is l l i have not seen him these four days the affair of the hundred pounds was a good stroke and if we had a little more time you and i would pluck every feather that was worth any thing out of this goose and eat him into the bargain but for gods sake be cautious the old grocer runs about the streets like a madman dont go the windows nor walk out for your life how could he get all this information i suspect your friend dennis however be sure to make hay while the sun shines get every shilling you can out of your cully tie him down to  fairly coax and kiss him out of an annuity and then if you cannot quarrel with him get off in the dead of the night you know where and if possible i will put into play the other wheels my house may be watched and i dare not yet walk your way i charge you to commit every slip of paper you receive either from me or l l into the flames consider lucy i am a mantuamaker and it would ruin my character if  but i need not say more you are a sensible girl and if it was not for your love to l l who you know is an arrant highwayman would be the richest woman and the best friend that ever came into the unspected house of  your teresa trickmaid p s i have directed to miss brawn as you for what reason i know not last desired     not to trouble the reader with my reflections upon the perusal of these truly original epistles i shall only say that i found myself as complete a bubble as ever fell into the hands of a woman i found that besides all this mrs trickmaid was a procuress lucy her pupil and the fellow whom the grocer had drawn from under the bed was her favorite that he had suffered his own child to be murdered by drugs used by unhappy wretches on such occasions lest her shape should not be sufficiently attracting to delude fools and simpletons like benignus i found also that there was no truth in either the affair of the infant for whose imaginary creation i had undergone so many paternal pangs nor in the hundred pounds debt supposed to be due to the diabolical mrs trickmaid and i did not doubt but the jewels the necklace and every thing else were conducted upon the same ingenious principle  rage and anger prevailed and i threw myself in the severest selfcondemnation upon the bed cursing the simplicity that had misled and made me a dupe to seduction in every form in every shape in every sex but recollecting the revenge denounced against my dear mr draper i rose up in an agony of apprehension and though i saw lucys maid tying up a bundle with her hat and cloak on and in a violent hurry  all which denoted guilt i took my hat without speaking to her hung on my sword without hardly knowing about what i was employed and ran to his house  chap cxxx here oh my good reader i had no sooner arrived than i saw every thing in the utmost confusion and such an unexpected assemblage of people as cut me to the soul  the very first object was benjamin who came resolved if possible to see me because nancy denniss cousin had told him something which frighted him almost to death nancy denniss cousin sir said he was some time ago in place at a mantuamakers one mrs trickmaids but left her house because of some bad doings going on and she came with tears in her eyes sir to me and nancy to whom i was yesterday married sir by my uncles consent and she related such things to us  good lord sir i have not the face to tell you what she said about you and her and the grocers daughter nancys cousin sir wrote a letter of the whole affair to the poor grocer her father and i am afraid sir she mentioned you in it i am afraid she did but indeed i knew nothing about it more did nancy as i have a soul to be saved sir but continued benjamin its no time to talk now  poor mr draper is  is  is  dead sir  poor mr draper is dead  draper dead  said   the servants who remained hitherto dumb now delivered me a letter from an unknown hand and another enclosed therein  to benignus at theobald drapers esquire doverstreet sir your friend mr draper is no more he expired this morning a martyr to the sincerity of his friendship i have given directions to have him conveyed home his murderer cannot long be concealed and i who was his friend in a late engagement and have been long known to him will never leave his body till it is deposited in his grave   to the everdear benignus most beloved companion i cannot suffer the breath utterly to leave me which must be the case in a few hours for a mortification has taken place till i have exerted myself to write to you the other day i heard you aspersed in public company with names i know you never merited by a man who had the appearance of a gentleman as such i met him in the cause of an injured friend we fought with swords i disarmed him twice but he refused to make apologies and even renewed his abuse upon the character of the dear benignus i struck with a violence inspired by my regard full at his heart the point of the unfaithful sword struck against the button of his coat and snapt and then villain  i cannot call the desperate wretch a coward  villain as he was he took me in the moment of my disadvantage and thrust his weapon with all his force into my body and contrary to my expectation and the first hopes of a surgeon whom i took with me to the ground the stroke was vital i am now dying at the surgeons house unwilling till the last minute to communicate the tidings to benignus as to my estate it is entailed by a foolish father upon a more foolish cousin and therefore cannot be in the possession of the only man i love in the world my house in doverstreet and all the furniture and the library are yours and other little testimonies of tender friendship mentioned in a memorandum just drawn up by a person of my surgeons acquaintance ah benignus i can hardly hold the pen yet i will not if it be possible i will not drop it till i have enjoined benignus to quit the society of lucy and all her set to enter as soon as is expedient into chaster connections to take more care of his worldly affairs to be less the prey of parasites and  and  i write  in great ag  any benignus  to remember the name and the friendship of his expiring  theobald draper p s who the man i fought with is i do not know nor would i suffer my friend to detain him he fought brave and i charge you to take care of your own affairs since mine in this world are now  for i have resolution to write to benignus at the point of death  supported by many people and many pillows since my affairs i say are all  all  now  nothing be  benignus     chap cxxxi scarce had i read this letter before the dead body of draper came to the door attended by the surgeon and another friend who was present at the engagement words would wrong what past within my mind at this sight and poor benjamin was only inferior to me in misery forgetting quite his joys with the newmarried nancy the woman of his heart  three days did i hunt with a vigilance scarce to be equalled after the murderer of my friend three days did i search every corner of the metropolis for the abandoned l l who was palpably the wretch and that very blood i saw was the blood of draper of draper who fought and fell to vindicate the most extravagant benignus i could not find him i could not find the perpetrator of a deed that should have been paid for with his life or with mine  on the fourth day it became necessary to give the remains of this noble youth to the dust and on that evening were put into the grave the remains of the finest truest and most accomplished man in england  he was buried in the tomb with his ancestors and when every attendant was gone and all the people that flock round a pompous funeral were dispersed i bribed the sexton and the clerk to give me the key of the church where i past the whole night upon the cold tomb of my poor draper and i half execrated the morning that tore me from him  the next day elapsed before i had a thought to bestow on lucy yet let me not said i repay evil with evil since i cannot find the villain that seduced her and murdered draper let me not like a vindictive spirit add to the misery even of the guilty these reflections gave me courage to address the father in the following manner  sir i restore your daughter whom i will never again see or speak to totally to your dominion and i enclose such a direction as will be likely to find your wife who would i believe wish to be reconciled to you should you retain any anger in your breast against me i can only say that i am at this minute as wretched as one man can possibly wish another to be  benignus   this produced the following reply which being perfectly characteristic of the grocer would at any other hour than the present have produced a smile  sir mr be nignus as to you not spekin agin to my dater i does not design thee should if thee would and as to my wif i will go and take her to zugarloaf at grassington purpose to let you see i am a better kristian nor you and such like as to the matter of your misurry i am glad to hear you have got a bad breast because why the worse the better seeing as it will make you nevolent for the time to come and such like i dont think you worth going to laa about else would send you over the herringpond so i sees you wont make my dater a wif thof you made her a w  and such like i can mantan her yet  aye and my wife too and i will not leave em behind me again for such nevolent rogues to ruin as ye and so master nignus as all your fammurly are ashamed of you i rest  your humble servant benjamin brawn grocer and such like   thus ended my intercourse and in this manner was dissolved my connection with the perfidious lucy and her father the wife was i understood soon after restored to the arms of her greasy lord who set off with his family after misrepresenting me to all his friends for grassington where however their return was neither happy nor harmonious for the misfortunes of the wife the daughter and the husband were everlasting fources of domestic reproach while i was reprobated as the cursed cause of all the mischief and the name and conduct of the blundering benignus ignominiously circulated round the country even till the scandal thereof reached my native village the idea of these calamities with the death of draper and the displeasure of mrs darlington drove me to the very verge of despair  chap cxxxii in some degree to bury if possible the anguish of my soul in the whirl of worldly recreation i yielded to entreaties and being ashamed to meet the eye of mrs darlington paid a visit to mr blake who began to administer the old ineffectual cordials  such as we were all mortal that we were here today and gone tomorrow that it was foolish to grieve for what could not be helped  sooner or later we must all follow mr draper and that if i was to fret myself to death what was done could not be undone  but all these stale commonplace maxims had no other effect upon me than to make me despise the vulgarity by which they were dictated and yet in the society of this man and his fair house keeper i sometimes found a refuge rather than give myself wholly up to the embraces of solitude and sorrow i made it however a solemn custom well suited to the present gloomy habits of my life to pay a nocturnal visit once in the week to the tomb of the admirable draper or rather to the churchyard near to which the remains of this beloved companion were inurned  i was one night offering my devotions to the shade of my friend and walking pensively near to the porch of the church day being at odds with morning when i beheld two men coming with stealing steps into the churchyard and after some little ceremony they sat themselves down by the side of a grave  alas said i poor creatures they are doubtless upon an errand no less melancholy than mine they are upon a visit to the newmade grave of some dear departed friend perhaps two affectionate brothers are mourning over the ashes of a father  perhaps their tributary tears are devoted to a friend in the dust  perhaps a wife  a mother  or a sister much loved and much lamented is crowded into the narrow mansion of mortality or perhaps   i was interrupted in the progress of these reflections by perceiving one of the men digging up the earth as if with a spade while the other still remained sitting as before this excited my curiosity and under favor of a very cloudy atmosphere i went softly along the yard till i came near enough to observe the event of their business and yet by the shelter of an opposite tomb that was raised of stone in the center i escaped any danger of their observation such a conversation soon passed between these two men as may very well be disbelieved by those who are happily ignorant of the arts of this wonderful metropolis or who are not intimately conversant with the great truth that is couched in the trite saying  one half of the people of london do not know how the other half live  i was a witness my worthy reader to the following dialogue   st man what do you mean by that i will take no such money and so you may tell doctor gashman i never buried a finer body in my life  besides he died of a something that none of the faculty could make any thing of d  n it mr nabflesh you dont know what you are talking about this mans inwards are worth a jews eye  i will not sell him for less to my father so avast digging    d man look mr sexton you are too hard upon my master  he is a good customer and you ought to consider a little  is he not always sure dont he pay for every carcass upon the nail did he not take off your hands or rather your ground the author there who died in grubstreet because he would never move out of his room and so got a hurt in his sedantaries did he not purchase the body of the man for whom the interest of his friends procured christian burial who was hanged last monday fortnight and if i had a mind i could tell you a secret that would stop your avaricious mouth at once     st man what is that mr nabflesh     d man why the doctor is at this time attending a lady of your parish who is troubled with a complication as they call it and as she will be buried in that very church and is certainly upon the move you will be well paid for her and she is expected to be as fine a resurrection as ever the doctor handled he thinks she cannot hold it out more than a week or ten days longer and then      st man say no more mr nabflesh  dig away and he is your man i have thrown the mold over him as ligntly as possible and so you will soon get at him it is a fine night for the purpose of raising our dead and we shall have done presently  upon this the purchaser of insulted humanity proceeded and set his spade into the earth with an air of determination while he was thus employed the worthy sexton whom by his voice i discovered to be the very man that sold to me the key of the church on the night of mr drapers interment amused his copartner with the characteristic remarks which follow    d man i am a thinking mr nabflesh what a friend i have been to the faculty in the course of my fextonship and how much the dissectors and anatomisers are obliged to me for this is you must know  this very spot is the most populous and best inhabited churchyard in christendom it is amazing to think what a number of souls  bodies i should say come through my hands every week and as i am very intimate with the parish apothecary and make it moreover my business to know a little how folks go off i can tell which commodity to recommend to my friends for there are a set of fellows who are not worth a resurrection and therefore god rest em and rot em for us those who die as it were a natural vulgar death in a featherbed are not worth a single sixpence except indeed they die of a contagious distemper and so bury in lead and that you know turns to account as to your wooden tenements they put nowadays so little timber in em and build them so slightly that they will not make a kettle boil and scarce pay for the trouble of turning the body out of them it is your unaccountable deaths that make us live master nabflesh and between you and i and the man we are raising i have a shrewd guess our old rector will make a subject by and by i dont know what the plague ails him but he is certainly upon the go and i have some reason to think dr gashman has an eye upon him all in good time however i have nothing to do with a man while he is upon the face of the earth nor do i ever consider him as my property till i have got him underground  by this time the dealer in the dead had pretty nearly finished his work and told the sexton that he felt his pickaxe strike against the nails of the coffin i have knocked at the door master sexton said he and i fancy we may make ourselves pretty certain of finding the gentleman at home i warrant ye now he little expects to rise again so soon though to say the truth we do come to make him take the air at an unseasonable hour after all mr earthworm what truly great men we are we are in the fullest manner your workers of miracles we cause the dead to rise and with the assistance of our pharmacopelic friends bid them live as it were again and be in good spirits yea verily we command this mortal to quit its corruptible flesh and be hung forth in all the immortality of bone o master earthworm we are very serviceable members of society indeed   a second pause was made in this curious dialogue by the actual resurrection of the coffin which these gentlemen with peculiar dexterity set upright and one proceeded to open the lid while the other spread upon the ground a sort of coarse sheet in order as i presumed to receive and wrap up the body sensibility de manded her soliloquy upon this occasion  oh most horrible barbarians said i gently not yet discovering myself  ah sacrilegious assassins  what are not our very ashes secure from this venal world  must our very bodies be sold after they are fixed many feet deep in the earth  how often then does the afflicted surviver shed his tear upon the spot which he vainly supposes is consecrated by the sacred dust of a friend when happily the corpse of that very friend has been clandestinely mangled by the insecting knife and the beloved anatomy all the while decorating the dreadful repository  or rather charnelroom of the surgeon  is this practice necessary to the experiments of a useful science do the lives and healths of the surviving world depend in any degree upon it it may be so  but what a pang to a feeling heart is it that those who are employed in this formidable business should be so destitute of   i was inclined to check the pursuit of these reflections for the present by the appearance of a third man on horseback who came to the side of the churchwall and gave the signal of a whistle to the other two this fellow was i apprehend to carry off the corpse which to my utter astonishment they had now dislodged from its peaceful apartment and were going to bear it without any noise to the horseman at this awful crisis of the transaction the moon which had been all the preceding part of the night obscured by the heaviness of the atmosphere now broke forth glimmeringly and displayed the figure of the dead man and his robbers to my eye i saw the pallid countenance the livid lips the closed eye and the sunk cheek enfolded by the shroud  i saw the lifeless limbs passive and obedient to the designs of the plunderer   z  ds cries the sexton i feel something hard hanging at his breast here  what the devil can it be  after a minutes search the sexton went on by heavens master nabflesh its one of your little breast pictures and look  it is tied by a ribband round his neck  you must know he was a devil for the wenches and i will lay my life this is the picture of one of his mistresses it shines a bit i think and may be valuable however good or good for nothing it has no business here and being found upon my dead it is by the sexton laws settled ever since men took it into their heads to die my property i cannot pretend master earthworm replied the other fellow to deny your perquisite  every man of honor ought to have his dues and so i wish you joy but what a whimsical dog thou must be here he struck the corpse ludicrously upon the face to have such a pretty thing buried with thee  a picture  eh d  n me i thank ye for that master dead man  aye thee were a wag i warrant thee  here he shook him by the chin and the sexton was just going to tug at his perquisite the third man again whistled  every atom of my soul and body was offended and knowing the nature of guilt i threw aside my coat and waistcoat and folded a white pocket handerchief over my head in conformity to the vulgar idea of ghosts and stalked away toward the graverobbers they saw  dropped their spoil and ran very rapidly away  my design succeeded and i set myself soberly to work in order to rebury the insulted dead resolving nevertheless to have ample justice inflicted upon the mercenary sexton in due season  mean time the daylight broke upon my efforts and yet i was resolved to finish my pious undertaking i had deposited the corpse from which however i found the picture was stolen in its solemn habitation put it as decently as i could in the ground and was proceeding to close up the grave with the mould when two the reader not well skilled in the metropolitan rogueries of midnight will perhaps wonder that a london churchyard should not be included within the precincts of the watchmans walk which were that the case might be the means of detecting all similar robberies but be it observed that besides the neglect of our police to place any guards about the dead and the feebleness of those guards that are stationed to  crawl about the streets for the service of the living  it now and then happens in the chain of human connections that the watchman the sexton the bodyraiser the bodybuyer and the justice are all linked together in a strict social compact for the good of the community watchmen returning from their stands dizzy as they were with their potations pottle deep discovered me  versed as these worthy gentlemen are in all the ways and wickedness of the town they concluded that i had outstayed my time and was notwithstanding afraid to leave the grave i had pillaged in disorder eyeing me therefore as lawful game they soon surrounded and in the kings name while they shook their lantherns and struck the ground with their staves took me prisoner and without a single slice of ceremony bore me off in triumph to a place of security commonly called a roundhouse  chap cxxxiii it was to no manner of purpose i asserted the piety of my business since my conquerors protested that they caught me in the fact and would make their affidavy of it before the justice i entered therefore this midnight mansion as a criminal and was represented to the company therein assembled as a disturber of the dead and a fellow who lives by selling human flesh to the surgeons this introduction insured me a very unfavourable reception and every one threw at me either a sarcasm or a satirical sentiment  a more filthy habitation or more extraordinary inhabitants never came within my notice such an infernal groupe was surely never before crowded into such a contracted space yet there was a blazing fire and a general appearance of merriment into this little round room were huddled upwards of a dozen persons of both sexes besides myself and the two watchmen who brought me  i was now committed in form to the constable who was the president of the place and he desired i would content myself till i could be taken to the justice and from him to bridewell bridewell said one of the company  probably a person who loved wit  what do you mean by that mr constable if the gentleman has any luck he will be hanged or transported at least for is he not a housebreaker is not a coffin a mans castellum and is it not felony to break it open i say answer me prisoner would not you have stolen out the furniture if you could have got at it  come come i know a turn or two of the law  confess therefore would you not have done very serious and grave matters if you had not been detected in your underhand business  every mans house friend whether of wood or of stone of straw or of tile above ground or beneath it is private property and private property is sacred and what is sacred should not be meddled with and if it is it is felony and felony makes a rogue and a rogue deserves preferment  this proves logice that you are in the suds which is anglice being interpreted that you will be hanged and so  tip us your manus  here is to your elevation which is being interpreted success to a broken neck  the wit had no sooner finished than a second gentleman in a tarnished tinselbound waistcoat a dirty shirt and a laced hat thought proper to make some smart observations in my defense amongst other bright remarks he said that with regard to mr goosequills argument he conceived it to be not only dull but null for that so far from a dead man being private property he thought him no property upon earth but property under the earth so that if any body had a right to punish for such a theft it was his opinion that as the property properly belonged only to the worms the matter ought to be submitted to their worshipful wormships they being the only persons robbed and defrauded for his part he said he was sole manager of a country company of comedians and if the gentleman could help him to a stock coffin as his old one was quite shabby and as he meant to open with the funeral he should be greatly obliged to him  this second man of humor had something so particularly grotesque about him his eye was so vacant and his countenance so comic that he was socially speaking the life of the company and like a true son of the scenes fairly set the roundhouse in a roar what added to the pleasantry of his character was the professional strokes which he threw into his common conversation a dash of the drama mingled in all his discourse gentlemen and ladies said he in these deep solitudes and midnight cells it is foolish to be miserable what though we be now in durance vile the soul secure in her existence smiles at the justice and defies his mittimus for my own part my fellow sufferers i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than this same constable i am here my friends for a mere frolic as my worthy ranger says tipsy dance and jollity was the word for two hours by the covent garden clock and so being hot with the tuscan grape and high in blood happily i stole into a ladys chamber and in a dark corner of the room i found  a female  might i but kiss  one kiss  rubies outparagoned how dearly they would do it said i  when the candle entered by all my hopes gentlemen i found her neither old nor ugly then ladies my blood beat high and eager for the transport with moving softness then i straight assailed her  how could i dwell for ever on those lips oh i could kiss em pale with eagerness so soft by heaven and such a juicy sweet that ripened peaches have not half their flavor although i uttered this ladies and gentlemen better than it was ever delivered by man before yet would you believe it this obdurate fair threw me away like a detested sin nay more as at her feet i kneeled and sued for mercy with a reproachful hand she dashed a blow  she struck me gentlemen by heaven she struck me buffetted slapt me on the face kicked me on the breech and called the watchman  for which sirs  if i forget her but soft  methinks i scent the morning air  brief let me be  the watchman came and brought me to the place where i have told this round unvarnished tale  is it not passing strange is is not pitiful  ha  who comes here  stop  who goes there at this late hour  jaffier  oh it is a constable  he brings good tidings  here another constable introduced another prisoner and the constable desired we would clear the fire for that he knew he was a gentleman of consequence and had got money in his pocket  he comes here only to amuse himself till the morning and in order as a body may say to go for to see life yes ladies and gentlemen said this lover of seeing life mr constable tells you true i am a fellow of an odd humor and take a pleasure in walking and waking when most other people are asleep i love to see as much of this world as possible  because as to the next we must take that upon trust you know  very true sir replied the player  there is the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause    this sir as you very justly say puzzles the will and makes us rather take those joys we have than trust to others that we know not of   the young lawyer put in a rejoinder  as to that gentlemen said he i am entirely of your opinion for we proficients of the long robe do not approve of demurrs except in certain cases made and provided for my part i dont approve of giving long credit and i had rather have chambers in lincolns inn rentfree than take any of my fathers mansions which are in heaven upon trust  in other words and to speak by a bolder figure sir said the comedian you had rather reign in hell than serve in heaven i agree with you for who would fardels bear but that  d  m your fardels replies the lawyer let us all club our shillings and treat the ladies to a bowl of punch for we are here for a piece of diversion a mere frolic and so let us be as merry as we can this proposal was readily accepted and a collection was made by the lawyer who afterward dispatched the constable to neighboring house which was open at all hours of the night  the player was particularly pleased at this prospect and expressed his joy by a rhapsodical quotation to do him justice not very inapplicable considering that there were several females in company love and wine give ye gods or take back what ye gave for my part i love a fresh bottle and a fair lady as well as any man in england  tell me of one bottle or one bowl or one woman i say give me twenty  the more the merrier  my mighty love has stomach for them all old cowley for that  i never yet could see that face which had no dart for me from fifteen years to fiftys space they all victorious be color or shape good limbs or face goodness or wit in all i find in motion or in speech a grace and if all fail it is woman kind if tall the name of proper slays if fair she is pleasant as the light if low her prettiness does please if black what lover loves not night the fat like plenty fills my heart the lean with love make me so too if straight her bodys cupids dart to me if crooked it is his bow well said mr player cried the lawyer those are very pretty verses and prettily spoken too i believe replied the player  but here comes the punch  although i had no inclination either for liquor or laughter yet as i was under a necessity to stay till i could clear myself from the charge alleged against me i sat down upon an inverted tub and made myself as contented as i could under such disagreeable circumstances  the conversation shifted from love to politics and from politics to religion  and now the gentleman who came merely for his amusement began to display himself he was touched upon his darling topic and observing a singularity in his sentiments i entered into conversation his replies to my several questions were so shrewd and so very much beyond what i expected from the speakers appearance that i told him the general outlines of my story not concealing even the present mistake which brought me into his society  the company seemed very attentive and the gentleman whom i particularly addressed smiled at the conclusion of my narrative and with a liberty both of sentiment and language peculiar to himself made me the following circumstantial reply  i thank you sir for your story although every part of it convinces me that you have not nor ever had a single sentiment of your own well may you be miserable  well may you go about the world without either being wiser or happier one man tells you you must do nothing but laugh another you must do nothing but cry one bids you take things as you find them another says you must learn to improve what you meet with in the name of common sense what are you doing how can a young fellow of any spirit submit so vilely to perpetual leading strings i am ashamed of you  what would you have me do said i  i would have you said he only to be consistent with yourself hunt not after eternal advice use your own eyes and your own understanding hear what others have to say and look into what others have thought but never trust either books or men implicitly  it is childish it is cowardly weigh the whole in the scale of sober reflection and dare to differ from the highest human authority if after a fair bosom examination it will not stand the test  but perhaps sir my understanding is not equal to the severe investigations of original truths  perhaps  said i  nonsense replied he the power of no property is known till it is tried the bird without effort would never be able to use its wing nor does the soul know what a flight she is able to soar till she magnanimously puts forth her strength in the endeavor you do not so much want understanding as you want fortitude you are afraid to think  you are chained down by an old wowomanish veneration to a set of ideas transmitted from one silly lip to another silly lip and to be sure what was thought right so long ago and never thought to be otherwise than right since must be all gospel thus superstition in sentiment becomes general and it is almost sacrilege to dispute it  i would dispute all the sayings which were ever said if on mature deliberate rational consultation with my own reason and natural feelings i could not square and reconcile them if a man solemnly assures me stones are a softer substance than brown paper or that fire is more a fluid than water am i therefore to believe him  that would be a flat contradiction said i  it may be so he rejoined but have you taken the pains to consider nicely the nature of this contradiction  i dare say not but let me tell you equal contradictions are daily advanced by our sagest philosophers  if i tell you stones are harder bodies than paper you laugh but when i assure you that all the children of this world were originally designed to be happy and that stealing a paltry apple created an universal curse the moment it was swallowed and that there has been the devil to play in the world ever since you put on a solemn face and exclaim against the cursed curiosity of a sex which is still so incorrigible that a forbidden apple would set even at this moment every daughter of adam a longing yet in the name of truth which is the most glaring absurdity  do you dispute the scriptures do you hold in disbelief the sacred lessons of human faith  a figs end for faith i steadfastly believe in that sir which i feel to be most conducive to my happiness  if a dream affords a man better and more pleasant things than he can furnish for himself with his eyes open who would not rather sleep than wake if by taking a nap the beggar can forget his rags and wants and suppose himself a monarch should we not with justice call himself a simpleton if he resisted the approaches of slumber if fiction can produce an happier moment than faith why i will trust implicitly to fiction to be sure  would you sir said i aye would i said he though it should carry me away upon the wings of imagination and show me all the good old notions of my nursery the dogmas of my schoolmaster and the maturer maxims of my manhood totally inverted  good god what can be your reason for this licentious singularity  there it is again singularity the luckiest thing that i ever heard you speak of in your adventures was your meeting with the man who assured you there was hardly any such thing as singularity  there is not one man in a thousand but would give himself the lie if he dare and who does not privately disbelieve the greatest part of his public credenda the mob surely said i  who ever mentions said he the mob  those who have just capacity enough to add two to two and are mathematically certain that by uniting those numbers know they constitute an aggregate of four would not easily believe you or me if we averred that two and two made twenty million and yet mark the absurd manners of men should any person of great authority endeavor to prove that twenty million and twice two were exactly one and the same number the multitude would affect to believe it religiously and swallow down such a preposterous contradiction and when once an ignorant mind receives a notion sanctified as it imagines by a scholard i e a man who can read and talk so very fine and unintelligible that it does ones heart good to hear him then farewell to all future demonstration fixed in its first prejudice it is in vain to attempt its conversion and there is no absurdity in the world too mighty or impalpable for it to adopt  a very arch looking man whose face was covered with the corner of his hat as soon as this libertine finished spoke thus  thou art master of much pleasant argument and i cannot but congratulate the young gentleman on so able a monitor i have listened very attentively to thee ever since i lighted my pipe and am much edified  here he knocked out the ashes and then surveying the gentleman slyly he continued neither have i more than a single caveat to enter against thy doctrine and pray what may that be replied the gentleman contemptuosly so trifling an objection rejoined the other as that of being able to prove to a demonstration that you have not advanced one single fact that all you have said is upon the superficial surface and that you are not equal to the solid center of a subject of ratiocination  oh ho cried the free speaking gentleman if i have driven you to the subterfuge of disguising your ignorance under the plausible mask of a hard word i give it up when a man once begins to batter me with seven syllable words it is all over sir i am infinitely obliged to you for the symptom of your ratiocination and am your most obedient servant  here both the disputants exchanged sneers and were silent the player insisted that religion was an improper subject to be discussed in a roundhouse and that for his part he was of the great mr popes opinion whose genius indeed said he has been thought by some of the best judges of the age to be similar to mine and he observes for modes of faith let graceless bigots fight his cannot be wrong whose life is in the right as to a future state  d  n me there is nothing so certain i am so well convinced of it gentlemen that i am sure of immortality both here and hereafter  it is the divinity that stirs within me and intimates eternity to frederick eternity thou pleasing dreadful thought you see gentlemen what a master i am of the subject in that indeed consists the superiority of our profession we are the brief chronicles of the times and i frederick fable who am now a prisoner for that i was too well skilled in the soft parts of speech am like the knight of the shire and at different periods represent you all  here the door of our enchanted castle again turned upon its hinge and ushered into our society a figure which threw our comedian into an attitude after being fixed in which he exclaimed in a hollow voice  angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit in health or goblin damned here he shifted his posture raised the tone of his voice and proceeded bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell thou come in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee   by this time the person who was thus theatrically addressed appeared in full view and in a great measure justified the ridicule of the player it was another watchman who came to inform us that it was past six oclock and that in a couple of hours his worship would be ready to hear and see us  prepare therefore ladies and gentlemen your several speeches charges complaints and defenses for you are to appear before one of the cleverest justices in the city of london you however sir continued the man pointing to me whom my brother watchman brought are to be discharged because they say they believe you to be innocent and have heard your story  but they hope your honor will leave with me a little money to drink your health upon looking round me i now perceived the fellows were really gone probably upon the presumption of being found before the justice in a lame story however be that as it may i distributed some loose silver amongst the watchmen and constables that remained and bowing to the company departed from the roundhouse  chap cxxxiv when the watchmen discovered me in the churchyard they carried me through various allies and bystreets for the space of a mile or more to the roundhouse so that as i never was in that part of the town before or at least to my remembrance it became necessary for me to ask the way to doverstreet especially as the shops were yet scarce half opened and the face of the prospect thereby altered  the air of simplicity is easily seen and generally played upon  amongst the inhabitants of every town and city there are a set of people who profess the science of being funny the mobility of london are remarkably addicted to this pleasantry which consists principally in playing petty tricks that are productive of much hooting laughing howling and vulgar merriment for instance if a stranger discovers any thing rural in dress or is awkward in his questions he is directly marked down as a proper object of fun if a horse falls in the street and throws the rider from his back so as to leave him in a ludicrous situation but more particularly if he has the good fortune to pitch in a kennel and thereby spoil his clothes it becomes a very funny accident to the lazy spectators two puppies either bipede or quadrupede setting upon each other till the blood trickles into the shoes and the eyes swell up to the part for which hats are usually made is thought so irresistible a joke that he must be a very dull fellow indeed who refuses to enjoy it  there are other examples of this diversion equally agreeable such as running a burnt cork over a mans face as he lies asleep common however as this smutty piece of business is some readers might nevertheless be at a loss to account for the fun of the thing if they were not informed by me who am resolved to be as serviceable to my fellow creatures as solitude will let me informed i say that the cream of this stroke of humor lies in the mans waking with a black face and sinding the company all upon the giggle without knowing why  probably he after sleeping rubs his eyes  is then bid to look at his hands  this increases the wit exceedingly  they present him at length with a glass in which he sees what they have been about this brings on the last burst of joy and so then  then  there ends the joke pinning a piece of brown paper to the tail of a coat or gown is also a jest founded upon the same ingenious principle none of these frolicks however happened to me yet did i not totally escape the lovers of fun at the top of a street i begged the favor to be informed in a tone that i am sure might have changed illnature into civility whether i was right for doverstreet  now although i was then near the haymarket yet this illtempered guide instead of putting the wanderer into the right path protested that he was sorry he could not exactly inform me as to the matter i asked being a stranger to that end of the town but that he knew i was near tyburn turnpike tyburn turnpike said i  and which is the way then to doverstreet sir why you must go straight down this street replied he pointing his stick down the haymarket then ask for westminster bridge as soon as you have got to which you must make a short cut across st georges fields and  and  st georges fields sir said i why that is the way to the borough  surely you are mistaken  bam  said the man and ran away laughing into piccadilly it may just be noted here by the way that setting passengers into a wrong road is supposed to be fun of the first consequence the next person that passed me was also mighty merrily inclined and upon my putting to him a similar question and telling him my former usage i was briskly answered in this manner  really that was barbarous and ungentleman like i will put you right directly sir with great pleasure there are a parcel of pert puppies about the streets that make the difficulty of a stranger their sport such fellows deserve the application of a horsewhip here sir follow me this is your way  i followed this plausible spark after bowing in silence fully persuaded that he was an honest man at the middle of a lane or rather dark passage he took my hand and conducting me to the gloomiest end of it thrust his fist in my face rifled my pocket and ran off  chap cxxxv i arrived however at last in doverstreet at the now melancholy mansion of my dear draper where i received the following card from blake who became particularly sollicitous of late for my company chiefly as i then fondly imagined for the social purpose of soothing the dejection that was settling upon my spirits  to benignus blakes compliments to benignus inviting him to a snug party tomorrow evening at a particular friend and neighbor of mr blakes whose oddity of humor and singular method of life will perhaps dissipate uneasy thoughts   as i found greater relief any where than in the house which had so recently lost its amiable proprietor i accepted any random invitation that offered rather than subject myself to the misery of such poignant contemplation and accordingly i obeyed the summons i called upon blake at the proper time and he saluted me thus  cheer up my dear benignus  as the play says do not for ever with thy veiled lids grieve for thy noble draper in the dust but endeavor to call pleasanter images to your aid  imitate in some degree the vivacity and even the vacancy of your friend green whom i should have appointed to meet you had he not changed his lodgings and left us in the lurch  but he is a citizen of the world and so all changes and chances of this mortal life are alike to him and we shall again hear from him when the recollection of the moment puts him in mind that there are such persons as you and i existing  i will now take you in my hand to dine with a most extraordinary character who lives at the edge of the common and in the evening i expect a couple of friends to play a rubber so that upon our return you shall without any ceremony join us and we will make a sociable night of it  do not say a word for i will have no excuses benignus  it is three oclock  draw on your gloves and let us be gone  i was introduced in great form to dine with this remarkable person whom we found filling a large elbow chair and altogether unable to pay his first salutations to us in any other way than by a gentle slope of the body and even that seemed to cost him no small fatigue it was on the   th of july and at twelve oclock of a day which was intensely sultry when we reached mr pinguefonts house which was as elegant and superb as if it had been designed for the temple of voluptuousness in going along blake told me that i must not be surprised at several customs at mr pinguefonts however new or out of the way they might be notwithstanding which previous caution and prepared as i was for something wonderful such and so many were the oddities i was witness to in the course of this memorable visit that i could not help betraying by looks gestures and even words the entire astonishment of my soul  there was in every room through which we past either a couch a sopha or a kind of tent bed and when we came to pinguefont himself at our first entrance the enormous bulk of his body so upheaved its vastness and swelled upon the eye that what i had before considered as the extravagance of fable i now found unexaggerated truth and from that very moment gave swift credit for the history of the brobdignagians  have thou my good reader never taken a journey through the romantic roads of derbyshire or made an excursion beside the boundaries of bristol or rambled round the rocky regions of scotland or any other country pregnant with poetical sentiment and favorable to the alliterative bard  has it not sometimes happened in these thy wanderings that trusting to the sure foot of thy steed or yielding to the lassitude of a chaise thou have inadvertently fallen into a momentary nap out of which some jolt or stumble has on a sudden aroused thee at that instant peradventure the first and indeed only object that can command thy attention is the dead blank of some mighty mountain displaying its unweildly length and breadth before thee if thou recollectest the surprise of such a sight thou will conceive some idea of the sensation which the preposterous pinguefont occasioned in my breast when i first beheld him and that even though i saw him as was said before wedged in his chair his person however and especially his face was pleasing in spite of plenitude nor was it perhaps in nature to perserve more of the agreeable in features which maintained such a profusion of flesh his complexion was almost femininely fair and the only apparent defects about him were in his eyes which were heavy large and lethargic  as soon as he saw us he very cordially desired us to sit down apologizing at the same time for his own rudeness in keeping his seat but said he smiling you see gentlemen how it is you might as well move the house as the master  what of that laugh and grow fat is my rule and i will maintain it against all the starveling maxims upon earth eat drink and sleep  that is the science eat and sleep care away drink and be merry  heh  what say you  then turning his eyes to me  you will excuse me sir  every man in own humor you know by all means said i sir bowing he applied to the bell which was at his elbow a servant came creeping on tiptoe and cocked his eye through a little oval hole in the door which was concealed on the outside by a small green curtain after which he disappeared a few moments and then came into the room without ceremony the alderman for such he was inquired about dinner and being told that it was not to be ready till four oclock and that now it was but barely one protested he must have a snack for all that assuring us at the same time that he had not eat any thing these three hours the man disappeared a second time and we now were all seated on the aforesaid   th of july round such a fire as in the severity of a siberian winter might have been extremely comfortable and agreeably scorching my friend reading a sufficient degree of astonishment in my features was going i believe in a whisper to relieve me but on casting his eye upon the late laughing pinguefont he found a whisper unnecessary for the alderman had forgone his snack and without giving us the least warning of his intentions was fast warning of his intentions was fast asleep with his face parallel to the first bar of the grate heaven said i if the gentleman  hush said blake  the footman again came squinting to the door but how he got off i know not for my eye saw not neither did my ear hear any thing like the fall of a foot my friend now informed me that the alderman was subject to somnific fits which often set him to sleep in a minute and that he has been actually known to stand entranced while his own horse on whose success great betts were depending while he was galloping round the course that cut in the door is on purpose for the servants to see whether the alderman is sleeping or waking if the former they must on no account disturb him although the most urgent business require it and this is a stipulated article in his agreement with all his adherents a breach of which is the forfeiture of their places perhaps he will continue in this situation a great while and possibly he may wake in a moment and when he does he will make ample amends to you for the loss of time he had scarce finished when the alderman exclaimed  what are you at rascals  zounds and the devil bring up the dinner this exclamation appeared to be a vagarie of sleep but as if the idea of eating even in a dream was sufficient to beat an alarm to appetite pinguefont unclosed his eyes and again fixed his finger as if mechanically upon the bell at the same time looking at us  ah my dear friends said he pray forgive me  pray forgive me young stranger your companion knows my humor and all the world can tell you that i sleep more than all things on earth but come perhaps i shall now have an uninterrupted hour and if i dont have sixty minutes festivity for it i shall accuse myself of murder dinner this moment timotheus said he to the servant who now came into the room after the usual prefatory peep for it seems if the company were ever so numerous no domestic was suffered to answer any bell which was not rung by the master mr timotheus made a nimble exit and in less than ten minutes came to inform us the table waited and the company were all come  i looked significantly ignorant at my friend he mustered a smile  and we walked solemn and slow in the rear of the mighty pinguefont  after pinguefont had plentifully appeased the vehement attacks of his appetite and was preparing to enjoy the jollity of his friend and bottle a somnific fit again overtook him his vacant eye closed upon the company and in the next instant he was snoring in his chair  bountiful heaven said i upon what an animal the sun of thy prosperity shines and can it be possible that a creature endowed with such faculties as man formed also for immortal purposes should limit his ambition to the pleasures of food and sleep can that be happiness can the soaring mind be contented with such gross corporeal gratifications or can he whose existence is confined to the narrow circle of a few fleeting years suffer them to escape without leaving any traces that deserves recollection the business of that mortals life is to eat drink and sleep and by such marks alone shall be remembered in his generation how is it then that trifler as he is plenty smiles at his table and peace spreads her plumes over his pillow how many beds are there in this house which neither the sleeping proprietor nor his friends can occupy ah that the limbs of the wanderer the widow the fatherless and those who are now vainly in search of a shelter might find it here  the course of these reflections were impeded by a tap upon the shoulder from mr blake who informing me in a whisper that the joke was passed and that pinguefont had discovered as much of himself as was worth seeing proposed that we should take advantage of his present situation and under cover of the closed eyelid make the best of our way to a dish of tea with his blakes housekeeper  never was there a more serene or beautiful afternoon than that which was now before us and every object was gilded by the mildest beams of the sun blake bade me take notice of the scene and derive from it fresh sources of entertainment  ah mr blake said i those circumstances which were lately so agreeable have lost their power neither the oddities of a pinguefont nor the cheerful rays of an evening sun can inspire the vivacity which a few weeks since broke out upon every occasion and believe me sir the scene you recommend to my attention might as well have been inveloped in a fog  my friend is in the grave and the woman whom i loved has deceived me  pshaw rejoined blake  dont despair admitting that friend to be valuable and that mistress handsome have they do you suppose monopolized all the merit and beauty to themselves no surely prithee then benignus cast thine eye upon some other objects and never doubt but your present loss however great admits of reparation as you are a book man let the poets administer consolation they may properly be called the sons of hope and a youth of imagination as you are may be entertained with the prospects of the muse that is an ingenious head when all the suggestions of the soul which is mightily addicted to plain prose  will only serve to vex and make you melancholy recollect what old shakespeare says upon the subject of a lost mistress some verses are at this moment flowing to the tip of my tongue exactly in point pray thee give liberty unto thine eyes take thou some new infection to thy heart and the rank poison of the old will die examine other beauties if this will not satisfy you hear more  you saw her fair none else being by her self poised with herself but let be weighed your ladys love against some other fair and she will show scant well in short benignus to end the whole matter and if you will allow me once more to reinforce my argument with those of the poet go but with me and with unattainted eye compare her face with some that i shall show earthtreading stars that make dim heavens light and i will make thee think thy swan a crow hear all all see try all and like her most that most shall merit thee for the present however let us walk briskly toward the teatable where i dare say by this time the few worthy friends i expected are in waiting for us  though i received but little comfort from his quotations i thanked him and presently came within view of his handsome housekeeper  chap cxxxvi under all this appearance of honesty and good humor i had soon too much reason to discover that blake was a villain the company he expected consisting of two strangers to whom he introduced me as his particular friend were assembled in the front parlour about five minutes before us and the housekeeper was entertaining them with her usual vivacity  this same housekeeper i have already described as a lively buxom plump pleasurable woman and her company was so cheerful that it was impossible for melancholy itself not to abate something of its usual gloom in it but how just as proper is it upon all occasions to remember that all which glitters is not gold and to act indeed as if we apprehended people were imposing upon us a much baser metal gaudily gilded upon the surface in order to make it pass current  the fatal evening was however now before me soon after tea mr blake who by the by was unusually lively informed us that he had received a present of which he insisted upon it we should have the maidenhead no less gentlemen said he than a hamper of the best burgundy that ever sparkled to the eye and invited the sons of sorrow to good spirits  the strangers assented to the proposal and i whose business was to prevent melancholy either by drowning it in the glass or any other way did not remain obstinate bumpers were the word  blake and his friends who hospitably insisted on my swallowing more than i could bear affected at length to be subdued and were rolling before supper under the table from whence the servants with much seeming difficulty bore them up stairs  mrs blake herself had indulged in a glass extraordinary on this occasion  it was a calm night  the claret took possession of my brain  folly and forgetfulness triumphed  mrs blake looked nothing loath  there was a couch in the room  she was but a housekeeper  occasion assisted the revel of the pulses  reason toppled and  to my shame be it spoken i indulged the delicious insanity and rioted in the overwhelming temptation of the moment  at this crisis the door was burst open  blake and his companions rushed in the former running to his pistols which were slung across the chimneypiece and roaring out as he ran  oh villain villain  you have made a prostitute of my lawful wife i will shoot you through the head  you have taken advantage of my gratitude and friendship to dishonor my sacred wife  oh villain villain i will kill you on the spot at the end of this harangue he actually cocked the pistol apparently in a great rage and presented it to my head when one of his companions catching him by the arm dissuaded him from the horrible crime of murder alleging that mrs blake was not worth it  but advised him nevertheless to seek redress for this bleeding injury from the laws of the land then struggling with him they by main force got him out of the room and left us again together  the consequences of this conduct to tell my folly in a few words were my being cast in a court of justice  having my name ten times more blown upon than before  feeling more poignantly than ever the stings of my own conscience and being compelled to pay into the hands of blake two thousand five hundred pounds by way of damages  chap cxxxvii though i was soon convinced mrs blake was in the plot respecting the prosecution yet it hitherto never once entered my head that she was at once a wife and a prostitute for she really acted the blushful business so well and yielded in so coy a manner that i always supposed the kissing part of the story according to the proverb went so far by favor that i was the second person who had subdued the citadel of her virtue but the very day after i had paid my damage money i found certain symptoms that pretty plainly denoted the husband was not the only person who literally speaking received an injury in a word i was obliged to make enquiries after a doctor but i did not much like to ask benjamim or a servant about physical people so suspicious is guilt lest he might guess the nature of my complaint to prevent which i sneaked into a coffeehouse and setting myself down like a dejected wretch as i was in a solitary box began to read the papers which i recollected were commonly half filled with the nostrums of these gentry  amongst a number of advertisers each of which professed to cure the most dreadful disorder sooner than any other medicine in europe i was principally attracted by one that undertook to make a man of me again for five gnineas and that too by the gentlest remedy in the world without loss of time hindrance of business or personal confinement but what weighed most with me was his n b at the bottom wherein he engaged himself as a man of honor to keep my secret and that moreover there was a private door for the convenience of customers who for the sake of delicacy might not choose to come into the open shop  this was the very thing i wanted and taking down the direction from the advertisement i made the best of my way to the private door  it is really surprising to consider how often the soul extracts honey from poison or in other words good from evil  as i went along the street i thought myself under some sort of obligation to mrs blake for to own the truth i had now some little suspicion that her husband might have drawn her into this infamous measure of obtaining a sum of money and that i had on my part a charge against my conscience for being only the secondary instrument of her debauchery upon the whole therefore i congratulated myself upon this discovery and as i supposed my health would agreeable to the promises of the advertiser be perfectly restored to me in a fortnight i endeavored to make light of the matter and walked briskly away to a shop a few doors from the bell savage on ludgate hill the master whose name was drug happened to be then in the shop and conducted me into a little parlour  where being seated he bade me not be alarmed for that such misfortunes were quite fashionable and he would set me to rights in a hurry  not however to trouble the reader with a repetition of this fellows abominable crambo conversation be it enough to observe that after having tampered with me for six weeks and picking my pocket of  0 guineas for the five guineas it seems was only a compliment for the care and the rest were for medicines he left me in a situation so much worse that i was forced at last to seek relief from a man of reputation and who had the additional labor to undo every thing that had been done for or rather against me by dr drug  i was not able to quit my chamber for two months during which time i ordered myself to be denied to every body mrs darlington and alicia had long given me up and was thought to be dead by all my acquaintances at last i began to pick up a little benjamin only benjamin was suffered to be admitted to me as a friend i was so weak with grief disease and water gruel that i could hardly crawl from chair to chair and the first time i surveyed my figure in the glass i fainted away at the horror of such an alteration  in the midst of a situation like this it was that i found my affairs were in a desperate condition that my carelessness had subjected me to the most expensive impositions and that to complete the whole mrs darlington had received a visit from the grocer who after having by my means recovered his wife and daughter loaded me with every epithet that could disgrace the human character  chap cxxxviii at this most critical juncture i received a long epistle from mr greaves to whom in the height of my miseries in order to soothe the languid hours of confinement i wrote a fair and full account of myself since his departure his epistle is too estimable and the great fact it elucidates too important either to abridge or suppress as it may be considered in the light of a moral to all my enterprises and all the sad effects arising from them upon which account i shall give it to my reader entire both as a treasure and as a caveat  chap cxxxix from mr greaves to benignus dear unhappy benignus your last letter found me in the peaceful possession of myself my fortune an elegant retreat and a truly penitent daughter and yet all these blessings were absorbed in my sympathy for you the account you give of yourself is indeed alarming yet i prophesied almost as much when i first traveled with you to london to london the destroyer of morals the mark of temptation and seducer of the heart those indeed whom business perpetually chains down to the counter those who pass their lives amid the bustle of employment those of the most rigid resolution and inflexible philosophy those are the only people at your time of life who can live in that great metropolis without danger  i had almost said without destruction  you entered that city benignus and began to encounter the arts of it under all possible disadvantages every one of your antagonists were armed at all points while you were naked you had neither the sword of defense nor the shield of discretion in such a helpless situation what could be expected better than what has really happened  disease disgrace disaster and defeat  can you bear sincerity benignus you were wrong at the outset a young man setting formally out in search of happiness your time has been wasted with your estate and you are infinitely more wretched than when you began your romantic journey  since you began to traverse the city in which so much money has already been squandered what have you on the creditor side to balance the charge one day you have been mortified by neglect and at another you have been wounded by false promises were i the parent of twenty children i sincerely declare to you i had rather have one turn out avaricious another illtempered a third fantastical a fourth licentious and so on of the rest exhausting almost the circle of imperfection  rather i say benignus than any one of them should to such a perfection have your imperfection if you will allow me the phrase dont however mistake me it is not because i think you unamiable it is because of all i ever knew you possess in the most fatal degree the qualities that are in the end the most likely to plunge a poinard in your heart or a bullet in your head  heavens benignus how have you suffered the weakness of the heart to triumph thus long over the solid powers of reason and the understanding how have you permitted that very tenderness which properly regulated might at a third of the expense have circulated joy to be productive of little good and great misery  as to the good you have done it is as far as i can learn in no degree proportioned to the money used to procure it the very essence of it is lost by being indiscriminate if this hour you have comforted the disconsolate bosom of humble merit in the shade you have in the next lavished as large a bounty on a knave a gambler or a coxcomb  into what innumerable temptations have you thrown yourself by the indulgence of a fatal curiosity it is only by flying from temptation that youth and spirits can possibly avoid them believe not the cant of schoolmen when they tell you that virtue is the unmoved rock against which the waves of passion beat ineffectually virtue indeed is in the welldisposed mind a powerful principle but alas when it comes to be assailed in the heyday of the spirits solicited by opportunity  when a thousand softening circumstances treacherously meet together confederating as it were to urge the heart into voluptuous concessions where benignus is the young man where the young woman who can long boast the unsubdued superiority of virtue as there is a temptation suited to every constitution so is there i fear an hour when every constitution must either precipitately retreat or be vanquished to retreat therefore in time is the greatest effort both of prudence wisdom and philosophy when the passions have only exhibited to us their prospects when the eye sparkles to behold them and the heart throbs to enjoy them it is an hundred to one if either reason virtue or principles of any kind are at your age sufficient to save you  and are you still a generous vagabond benignus are you still rambling about the streets of the metropolis a benevolent stroller  a prey to imposture an anguish to your friends and a distress to yourself do you call this going about doing good no sir it is going about doing nothing  by chance indeed the most scattering liberality may blunder into an act of benevolence but when a few a very few of these are excepted you might just as well have jerked your money from londonbridge into the thames as have thrown it about so promiscuously  i write warmly benignus because i write feelingly and because i love you i love you sir for the naturally noble excellencies of your disposition but not for the extravagant abuse of them there are perhaps few men in this kingdom who might have more splendidly figured in it your talents fortune and turn of mind might have done honor to yourself to your society to your connections and to human nature instead of which by rushing madly upon the world the dreadful history of your situation is that you belong to nobody are known to nobody and are nobody  what benignus will be the ultimate event of it i tremble at the prospect in the name of common sense stop stop your career it may not yet be too late i do not perceive you have in all your wanderings purchased a single friend who would give you a dinner should it which god forbid ever be wanting i see you have violent passions which though they might have lain dormant in a village have been called out in london passions always tyrannise in proportion as they are indulged and i much fear  you will pardon me  you are not quite the same benignus you were in point of delicacy be that as it may your case is to be compassionated how applicable to benignus is the language of honest apemantus oh ye gods what a number of men eat timon and he sees them not  let me charge you to beware of becoming as it were a bankrupt in london i know that i appear to you very rude and indeed i am doing a great violence to myself but if this strength of coloring if this picture faithfully drawn by the hand of a friend serves to wean you from an attachment to the place you are now in and can bring you to the quiet spot whence this is dated i shall rejoice in the fortitude of having been sincere  every thing about us by the time you reach us will be in their summer suits to invite you our fruit trees are in blossom our rosetrees are budded there are fish in the ponds and birds build secure within our hedges almeria is goddess of the flowergarden and she smilingly bids me tell you how much she wants an assistant to tie up the tendrils and to hand the wateringpot from the well  i am my dear benignus your sincere wellwisher william greaves p s finding myself too apt to dissipate in the earlier part of my life i bound myself as it were an apprentice to discretion by an observance of certain rules which for more than twice seven years have now been the guide of my pecuniary conduct they are now my dear friend more necessary for your practice than mine and i have set almeria down to her writingdesk to transcribe and enclose them  adieu  golden rules of economy in order to make a man live all the days of his life   the present pleasures produced by a large expense of money by no means balance the future miseries of a wasted patrimony dissipated fortunes and a decayed constitution    there is great reason for us to make a reserve of property against the day of decrepitude because in old age we want chiefly those comforts which only money can procure a comfortable house  a warm fire  delicate living and a little share of authority which in the last stage of life is exceedingly soothing and acceptable    perhaps society cannot show a more pitiable figure than either a very old man or woman who having spent their substance in the flattering gaieties of youth are reduced in the most helpless situation to live upon accidental strokes of generosity and to be at once ridiculed and relieved    if an old person expects to receive the least degree of attention from the world in general or even from his relations in particular it must be by the force of happy circumstances in his favor such for instance as arise out of a fortune accumulated by the industry or ingenuity of youth this will render the veteran respectable amongst his domestics and make even his utmost infirmities supportable whereas if an old man has no testimonies of his economy to show he will crawl contemptibly about the world be upbraided for his former prodigality even by his own children who having no hopes will consider him as an encumbrance and wanting the various attentions which are necessary to the accommodation of the last scene his continuance in the family will be irksome his life must be supported by the contribution of the charitable and he must die unmourned keep the staff in thine hand    the same principle of prudence which makes it necessary for a man to provide against the wants and infirmities of age should prevail with a man to provide against the wants and infirmities of distemper let the sick man rather depend on the panacea of his purse than on the pity of his physician a very healthy person is very soon reduced to his chamber and we are all liable to the most noisome disorders it often happens that a stout young man in the very vigor of existence is brought to such a state as to depend on the servitude of another for assistance in those very points which in a state of health he would blush to make known to a second person if these feeblenesses continue for any length of time nothing but the power of paying our attendants well can make them be done cheerfully if at all a sick spendthrift is therefore a horrid spectacle his nurse becomes negligent his physician gives him now and then a call upon the score of humanity  he wants the strengthening and restoring comforts both of the kitchen and the armchair and what is worse than all he rebukes himself for having squandered in the hour of superfluity what should have been reserved for the moment of exigence    art thou rich place then circumspection as a sentinel over thy passions lest that which thou possessest becomes a prey to artifice  art thou poor be industry thy guard left thou should want the bread of life and in wanting that the path of disgrace is not remote and that path will lead thee peradventure to the pits of misery and destruction condescend not to be the object either of pity or charity while thou have limbs to toil imagination to suggest or health to perform liberty is independence and slavery is a state of pecuniary obligation get honestly and give cautiously whosoever puts in practice these rules shall certainly live all the days of his life     the end
