for the author by s colbert no     capelstreet opposite abbeystreet  m dcc xxxi  the history of miss mortimer and miss fitzgerald letter i miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald nov        according to my promise made this morning at our parting i shall dedicate all my leisure moments to my dear eliza and amuse her with the little occurrences or observations of the day just as they present themselves to my pen i say just as they present themselves by way of giving you warning that you are not to expect much order or method in my letters but i fancy our former correspondence may have given you some idea that my style is not renowned for either however if you are diverted that is the chief point with me for i have my fears that great part of your time will pass but heavily as i am very apprehensive your mothers health will suffer by going from a very warm house in town to a very cold one surrounded by ponds and lakes in the country at this dreary season you know what bad effect it had on her last winter though the weather was uncommonly mild and i really think it was very unnecessary for her to run any hazard as the chief purpose of her going could have been accomplished as well had she staid in town it is i allow a very laudable custom to be kind to the tenants to entertain them and make them happy at the approaching season but i think as she is so delicate mr skeffington might as well have done the honors of christmas to your tenants as his own since it must be done in his house yours being set i hope however my fears may prove without foundation both for her sake and yours for then i know you will be happy any where with her and another person that shall be nameless  you contrived mighty ill to leave town today for by so doing you lost a most glorious sight a large body of our volunteers assembled to honor the memory of king william who made a very fine appearance and fired several vollies even better than the regulars who performed the same ceremony an hour or two after every one looked delighted except some few who want to be thought friends to government but for me who am an enthusiast in the cause of liberty and my country i was wonderfully delighted to see our men of the first rank and property as well as our most eminent citizens voluntarily arming in defense of both i think it warms ones heart and i really pity your lukewarm souls who can see such a sight without emotion   november  th i had wrote thus far yesterday and should perhaps have expatiated for some time on the love of our country but that i was agreeably interrupted by the arrival of an unexpected visitor a thundering rap at the door threw all the family into consternation as it was a very unusual hour for company i who sat by the window stood up and looking through the glass saw a postchaise and four horses up to their bellies in mud the postilions and servants all in black the door was soon opened and out stepped the prettiest young widow i ever saw i believe you will easily recollect this description suits but one of our acquaintance it was no other than our dear emily i flew to welcome her and in a minute a thousand questions were asked by each without either waiting for an answer however when we were seated and began to be more coherent i told her she should be my guest as i had spare beds for her and her maid and the men might go with their horses for i had not room for them and if i had she knew i could not abide to run foul of a servant fellow every step i took about my house she smiled at the expression but said she had as little liking to them as i when they could be dispensed with and that she would gladly accept my invitation that she might have as much of my company as possible while she staid gertrude who you know is the mother of this family no sooner heard this affair regulated than she quitted the room to give the necessary orders for that is a trouble she takes entirely on herself and indeed she makes a much better figure in the office than i should do so i am mighty willing to indulge her in it emily and i being left quite to ourselves till teatime you may imagine we had no lack of chat i found the business that hurried her to town was to administer to her husbands will it seems her tender care of him during an illness of six months touched his conscience and by way of amends for the very unkind treatment he had given her all the while she was his wife he made a will to which he appointed her executrix and left her the interest of a large sum of ready money during her life in addition to her jointure and some part of the principal at her disposal she is also to be guardian to the child and have the care of the estate i know no one more capable of managing it for the childs advantage the man certainly meant well at last but i think the greatest favor he could confer on her was his dying for her own fortune is so large that she only wanted to be allowed to enjoy it in comfort and what he has left her will i am sure be no great addition to her happiness for i know few that value riches less than she nor none that make a better use of them lovely as she was when last you saw her you can scarce have an idea of what she is now she is of the middle size elegantly formed and has a feminine sweetness in her air and manner that is easier imagined than described her weeds become her amazingly and there is a langour in her countenance contracted during the two unhappy years she was a wife so peculiarly suited to her habit that it interests one you cannot think how much in her favor i cannot with any degree of patience reflect on her being sacrificed to a man with whom it was impossible she could be happy merely because his estate and her fathers were contiguous it is astonishing to think that such ridiculous motives can actuate rational creatures in the most material circumstances of life i cannot say i should have been quite so obedient as emily was for a child has a natural right to a negative voice when it concerns the happiness of her life i do not mean by that to justify all the pretty masters and misses who in direct opposition to the will of their parents as well as to every dictate of reason and discretion are daily performing the tragedy of all for love and indeed it usually turns out a very deep tragedy to them for whatever they may think before marriage they soon after discover that a competency according to their rank in life is absolutely necessary to matrimonial felicity but i think in choosing a husband for a girl her friends should be careful to fix on one whose qualities of mind and temper are such as would be capable of inspiring her with that tender esteem which according to my notions is much more likely to be lasting than fierce flaming love for that being more a passion than a sentiment is like all other violent passions very apt to subside and leave no traces but what are unpleasing  i took the opportunity of emilys being out on business to finish my letter for the post as i think you will be uneasy if i defer it longer i hear her carriage stop so shall conclude for as her stay will be but short in town i would not wish to leave her when she is at home she is come up and bid me say a thousand kind things for her to dear eliza gertrude expresses herself much in the same manner but i hope you have more conscience than to expect i should impart all they say i shall therefore leave you to suppose them and subscribe myself  yours in sincerest friendship louisa mortimer mr fitzgerald and charles know how much i esteem them so i need not trouble you to tell them    letter ii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer castleskeffington nov    you cannot imagine louisa how much i was disappointed this morning when the servant returned from the post house without a letter from you i suppose i looked vexed for charles who just then come into the room asked what occasioned my chagrin and when he heard observed you had promised to write but those who relied on womens promises would generally find themselves disappointed and added some unfavourable reflections on female friendship this affronted me and i told him if men were but half so sincere in their friendships there would be a good deal less deceit and fraud in the world than there is at present he saw i was warm and taking my hand said my dear eliza you seem angry sure you cannot suppose i was serious for you know i have the highest respect for miss mortimer and if i had not i would not willingly say any thing to offend you i really did but joke and thought you would take it as such i accepted his apology and we became friends again  but are not you surprised at my warmth on such a trivial matter and what might well be taken as a jest i allow it must seem so to you but i was displeased with and had reason to think he was more serious than on recollection he chose to pretend you must know i have discovered in him a propensity to jealousy which has alarmed me most exceedingly as it may be productive of great unhappiness to us both but to tell my story with some method i must inform you that at the last inn we lay at we were joined by a mr hamilton a young man of large fortune in the county of derry who being alone charles invited to sup with us and we esteemed him no small acquisition to our company for he has had a liberal education is just returned from his travels and makes such observations on the laws customs and manners of different nations as do credit to his understanding and promise fair for his being an ornament to his own country you may think such a companion made us all very cheerful and i who delight in such subjects drew him on to give us a little description of the most material places he passed through which he did in such easy elegant language that when he retired to his chamber he left us full of his praises that is my mother and i for charles had grown very grave and very silent for some time before when my mother observed it she asked the cause and he attributed it to a headache upon which we separated for the night in hopes rest would relieve him in the morning he seemed quite recovered mr hamilton joined us at breakfast politely regretted that he was to take a different road and gave charles a pressing invitation to his house where he should be in less than a month as he was to stay about that time on a visit to a relation in this country charles promised to go on condition he would return with him this point being settled and breakfast over he attended us to our carriage where taking a very respectful leave of my mother and a very gallant one of me we all set out on our different journeys and reached home in the evening without meeting any other adventure i took notice that charles was at times very thoughtful and though i had a small suspicion of the cause i still hoped i was mistaken till i was put out of doubt this morning by kitty who while she attended me said she thought it her duty to inform me mr skeffington had asked her several questions concerning my opinion of mr hamilton whether i had talked of him when she was undressing me last night and in short was so inquisitive that the girl who you know has not much penetration perceived he was jealous i was very sorry he had exposed himself and very much vexed that he had talked in such a manner to my servant which was in effect making her a spy over me besides that if she was ill disposed it was putting it in her power to tell lies and make mischief for sake of a bribe he offered her to tell him the truth his behavior hurt me greatly and was the cause of my anger at what he had said this morning which otherwise i should not have thought worth notice however his being so concerned at displeasing me and the particular attention he has paid me all day show how anxious he is to be agreeable to me and makes it impossible for me to retain any displeasure against him i flatter myself my conduct will cure him of that unhappy propensity but i will be very sure it has before i think of being united to him i have no doubt but tomorrows post will bring a letter from you and will leave this unfinished till then though it is already of a reasonable length but for my own part i think letters of friendship can never be too long nor those of business too short  nov  th as i expected this post has brought a letter from you in which you fully account for the delay the arrival of such a welcome visitor is sufficient apology i am however well pleased she gave you an opportunity of dispatching your epistle next day for i think my patience would not have held out another post and i should have joined charles in exclaiming against the fickleness of woman it was very malapropos of emily not to come into town till the day i left it for i should have great pleasure in seeing her easy and happy and though it is a shocking thing to say yet she certainly never could be either while mr rochfort lived as an unkind husband must destroy any womans peace i am glad for his own sake he had the justice to acknowledge her merit before his death however he was of such an unhappy temper that had he recovered i doubt not he would have relapsed into his former caprice and ill nature i am no great friend to second marriages but i think emily would be very excusable should she make choice of one with whom she is likely to be happy for she is now at an age very subject to tender impressions and the time she passed with her husband can only be reckoned a time of slavery whatever state she chooses i hope she will enjoy all the happiness in it she so well deserves thank her and gertrude for their kind remembrance of me and tell them no one loves them better i shall not be so unreasonable as to expect you will be a very punctual correspondent while your guest is with you as she is not to stay long but i flatter myself when you can steal half an hour you will not forget your promise  o but i was quite unlucky in leaving town the day i did for besides missing emily i lost seeing the volunteers which i am very sorry for as i think them a most respectable body and you know i am as publicspirited as any roman matron in the most virtuous ages of the commonwealth i mean for i would not choose to compare myself to a roman after they were governed by the emperors because that government was the cause of their being degenerated and sunk in luxury and corruption so you see i have no small opinion of myself at least of my public virtue and whatever others may think i am satisfied if women were taught disinterested love for their country there would be more patriots amongst the men than there are at present for several obvious reasons particularly that as there are few of them that dont wish to recommend themselves to our favor they would be very cautious how they acted in their public capacity if they knew our contempt would be the consequence of their apostasy no doubt the ancients were of this opinion for you may find in the most glorious times of greece and rome the women were just as warm in their countrys cause as the men and history has applauded them for it though now people affect to think those things above our capacity and indeed the present mode of education for our sex is so very trifling that i fear there is some truth in the supposition  when i am writing to you my pen i think runs on of itself and i know not when to stop it so pleasing are the communications of unreserved friendship the hour for the post going out reminds me it is time to conclude it is probable you will hear from me very soon again as i dont intend standing on ceremony with you especially while mrs rochfort is in dublin  my mother and charles are perfectly grateful for your esteem you know what a favorite you are with them both  farewell dear louisa ever yours eliza fitzgerald  letter iii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer nov  0  cousin james fitzgerald came here yesterday to stay with us till he sets off for dublin to attend parliament which will be tomorrow and i could not think of letting him go without a line to my dear louisa as i know the first visit he makes in town will be to you for i assure you you stand very high in his opinion and let me tell you all the young ladies in the country set a great value on themselves if they can obtain his approbation for as you have often observed he has a good head and a good heart and is esteemed accordingly there is few of our gentlemen that would not wish him for a soninlaw but though he makes himself perfectly pleasing in womens company and likes being among them no one seems as yet to have made any impression on him i bid him guard his heart against the fair widow but he is no way apprehensive he says however i insist on it to him that mrs rochford will overcome all his sensibility at first sight though i am far from believing what i say as i am certain when he attaches himself to any woman it will be from conviction that she possesses the beauties of the mind even in preference to those of the person which are the only motives to those who fall in love at first look a foundation that promises no great permanency in the passion for i look on it as a proof either of a very weak mind or uncommon susceptibility or perhaps a mixture of both and in any of the cases great fickleness is to be expected  i wrote to you so lately that i have now nothing material to impart except that i hope charless good sense has conquered his late tendency to jealousy for i have not seen the least symptom of it since though there has been several agreeable young men to visit us within these few days this hope has given infinite satisfaction for i confess his affection is necessary to my happiness yet i never could think of being his wife should he continue in that unfortunate disposition  we are to have visitors tomorrow a mr boil and his daughters they came to this neighborhood just before i went last to town i paid my compliments to them but leaving the country two days after i did not see them since so i cannot say much about them if they should prove agreeable they will be an acquisition as they are but a short walk from us i believe i told you bellpark was left to mr boil by his uncle who was a delightful old man i hope his relations may be as pleasing in my next you shall have my opinion of them my mother is pretty well as yet i shall be very happy if she does but continue so till we get to town again for it alarms me much to have her ill here  my dear louisa knows how much i love her eliza fitzgerald  letter iv miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald nov     it is impossible for me to steal a moment since i wrote last to tell my eliza how much i am concerned at the defect you have discovered in mr skeffingtons temper it may cause you a deal of uneasiness for it is seldom cured i depend but little on your hopes of his having conquered it for you are a partial judge being so prejudiced in his favor besides people are apt to believe what they wish but when you all come to town i shall have a watchful eye over him and will not let you deceive yourself in a point so material to your happiness i doubt that you will think yourself much obliged to me though i am sure you ought for you must allow a woman in love stands in need of a friend to see things in a proper light for her as she is utterly incapable of seeing with her own eyes when the beloved object is any way concerned i think if charles does not mend his manners you shall marry mr hamilton that is if i do not for i fancy i should like him for myself by your description of him but we will consider of these matters hereafter at present i want to tell you i received your last epistle by your very agreeable lettercarrier who delivered it himself the day after he arrived in town emily was out when he came but i asked him for the evening and then introduced him to her he admires her as every one does but as to any thing more i do not take his heart to be very vulnerable do you know that a handsome widow of eighteen is too great an attraction for a sober sedate spinster to have in her home  i am absolutely fatigued with entertaining all the fine fellows that come here since she has been my guest they pay me the compliment of their visits but i am not so vain as to take them to myself for i know if she was not here i should not be honored with their company above once in a month and indeed i think it often enough in all conscience to be troubled with them for my spirits are quitewearied with the incessant peal of nonsense they think it necessary to ring in the ears of every woman of this side forty after that age i fancy one would be pretty free from them to be fure some of them could not talk sense but i should be glad those that can would be convinced that women are rational creatures as well as themselves  i really think the generality of young women have more solid sense than the young men at least it is so in the circle of my acquaintance but this is entrenous for should it be known i thought so the whole male sex would be up in arms against me at once because goodsense is one of the things they would willingly make us believe they have an exclusive patent for but i who hate monopolies cannot help putting in a claim to share of the commodity for self and co to speak in the trading style which is mighty convenient when one is in haste though so laconic  you are a good girl in laying aside ceremony in our correspondence it would be quite barbarous to insist on an answer to every letter now my time is not my own it is very well if i can give you a short acknowlegement for two or three at a time  emily will i fancy stay longer than she at first proposed some business has occured that cannot be soon concluded true it is shocking enough to date a womans happiness from the death of her husband but if husbands will be brutes they must expect both their wife and her friends will wish them dead emily behaves with the utmost propriety never speaking a reproachful word of mr rochford for though one must think she is pleased at her release it would not be decent in her to say so i like your political sentiments they exactly coincide with my own i see no reason why women should not be patriots for surely if tyranny and oppression are established in a country they are more liable to suffer from it both in their persons and properties than men because less able to defend themselves it therefore concerns them much to use all their influence in opposing it and doubtless that influence is more powerful than people are aware of they should therefore be taught to use it for the good of mankind both as it relates to individuals and the community at large what a pity you and i were not born in ancient greece we should have made a noble figure in history as spartan wives or mothers  yes i was surprised at your warmth before i knew the cause and for that matter i am surprised still for you are such a soft gentle soul so formed for the tender passion that i did not think it was in nature for you to be displeased with your beloved two minutes together especially when his crime proceeded from his too great affection for you i am glad however to find you are getting a little spirit i often advised you to it and you see what effect it had your anger brought him out of his airs in an instant whereas i will venture to say your tenderness would not have done it in a month nothing like showing ones authority now and then it makes one appear of consequence and is absolutely necessary to keep down the domineering temper of those lords of the creation  i am going with emily and gertrude to spend the evening with a friend oh i have a secret to tell you of gertrude it is a love affair too therefore just fit for your ear how was it she never made you her confidant i cannot tell it now as they wait for me  adieu dear girl yours louisa mortimer  letter v miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer nov     according to promise i go on writing to my dear louisa without waiting for an answer i do not however want to pass it on you as a great obligation for i think i could not exist any time without communicating to you all the little incidents that occur and constitute part of my happiness but i will acknowledge hearing from you is a material addition to it  i informed you in my last mr boil and family were to be with us next day they came much earlier than is usual with strangers to show us as he said they wished to be on a friendly footing and hoped we would follow the example which we did the very next day for we were pleased with each other we did not part till after supper nor would they quit us till we promised to return their visit so immediately i wished for you often you would be infinitely charmed with mr boil who is a true born irishman generous hospitable and humane accompanied with a quality for which our countrymen are not much renowned that is such a prudent economy as prevents him from outrunning his fortune though every thing in his family is in the genteelest style of life and he is continualy doing goodnatured or charitable actions but he does not throw away his money nor do his daughters think it beneath them to attend to the management of household affairs he is mighty cheerful and has i think all the good disposition of his uncle his daughters are rather pretty the youngest most so and she knows it she is about eighteen her sister two years older miss boil pleases me best for she is sensible and agreeable without any airs miss harriet has a good understanding improved by reading but she has a degree of affectation that spoils her when she lays that aside which she can do she is very pleasing i believe it is the effect of a foolish vanity on account of her personal charms and i am surprised that one whose mind is so amply endowed should fall into such a weakness but probably a few years will cure her of that folly and she will then be an amiable woman i am very happy in having them for neighbors as there is not a young person of my own sex in any of the families very near us except one and she is as unfit a companion for a rational being as any vegetable in her garden which is the only thing in life she seems to have any knowledge of unfortunately for the poor girl she will have a very large estate and her mother thinks it unnecessary she should have any thing else to recommend her i really pity the poor thing for no doubt she will some time or other find her ignorance a great inconvenience to her what illjudging people they must be who can look on money as a good substitute for all the useful and agreeable qualifications of the mind  i will lay this by for a while in hopes of hearing from you besides the miss boyles are come in to tea and i dare say i shall have no more time for writing this evening  november   th i guessed right when i said i should have no time for writing that day the young ladies were easily prevailed on to stay supper as their father was not expected home till next day he was gone some miles off to see a friend we had also some gentlemen that charles had brought home with him and we were a very cheerful happy party my mother was quite delighted for you know how happy she is to see me pleased and i had the satisfaction to find that her presence was no restraint on the young folks indeed it need not for though she is elderly and not healthy she does not forget she was once young herself and therefore endeavors to promote innocent mirth in youth which as she says is the proper season for it and she is loved and respected accordingly i am sure her advice would have much greater weight with them than that of any of your formal peevish old ladies who having lost a relish for amusements themselves are continually preaching against them be they ever so innocent or moderately pursued  the gentlemen staid here till this morning and we had a good deal of company in the forenoon some of them staid dinner  yesterday we all spent an agreeable evening at bellpark by invitation both the ladies are proficients on the harpsicord and have sweet voices and one of our gentlemen played enchantingly on the flute so we made up a little concert and the cards were laid aside except mr boil who challenged my mother at picquet and was not a little pleased at beating her because she plays the game infinitely superior to him  i have just received your epistle how could you be so teasing as to say you had a secret to tell me and then leave me to puzzle my brains about it perhaps for this week to come you suppose every one to have as little curiosity as yourself though you know it is a legacy descended to us from our grandmother eve of which very few have not a large share  i have thought of all the young men that visit you but cannot recollect that gertrude ever showed the smallest partiality for one of them though i know some of them admired her much who can it be i may as well bid you adieu for i can neither think or write of any thing but this secret so you need not expect to hear from me again till you tell it me  yours eliza fitzgerald  letter vi miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald nov     i have retired to my chamber rather earlier than usual that i may acknowledge the receipt of my dear elizas last favor and gratify her curiosity which i find is at the highest pitch  i really did not think of distracting your mind so much when i mentioned gertrudes affair as it would not have had that effect on me and when i considered that i had no right to disclose another persons secrets i determined to tell you my seruples on that head and leave you in ignorance till time should discover it however your letter made me alter my mind and gertrude being present i showed it to her and telling her i had thoughtlessly given you a hint of it asked her permission to inform you of the affair she smiled at your eagerness to know the event and said it would be a pity to deprive me of such an agreeable correspondent on that account as she was sure it would be safe with miss fitzgerald and she believed you would make allowances for the weakness of her heart your own was so susceptible so you see my dear your tenderness is very visible though you flattered yourself no one perceived it but me  as to this love tale you may guess it was mere accident discovered it to me for as you observe i have very little curiosity but if i had ever so much it could not have been excited in this case because i had no suspicion and thus it happened  a few days before i wrote to you last i was to have company in the evening and when i was dressed stepped into gertrudes chamber to ask her some questions she sat with her back toward me so lost in thought that she never heard me though i was near enough to see she held in her hand a miniature picture of a beautiful youth in the uniform of the french military on which her eyes were intently fixed you cannot imagine what an awkward situation i found myself in when i saw she had not heard me i selt as if i had purposely stolen on her privacy though i was conscious i had not but it must appear so to her i therefore thought if i could go out unperceived it would save us both a deal of confusion and was turning about to do so when the rustling of my gown against her chair roused her from her reverie and startled her so much that i thought she would have fainted i am sure i looked very silly myself but thinking it best to take no notice of what had passed i asked the question i came about and then saying i supposed she would soon be ready to come down i left her to recover herself from the flutter into which i had unintentionally thrown her  she did not come into the drawingroom till some of the company were come and i could observe her spirits seemed quite distressed but she exerted herself to conceal it and as she is naturally rather serious it passed unnoticed by every one also i paid more than usual attention to her that she might see i was not offended at her reserve for i am certain it proceeded more from bashfulness than want of confidence in my friendship though she lived so long in france she still has that amiable modesty which is there called mau vais honte but which in my opinion is quite becoming in a young girl though it is now reckoned a capital offense against all the rules of goodbreeding to be capable of blushing and it is part of the business of french dancingmasters to cure their pupils of that vulgar propensity and substitute an assurance that will enable a miss of fourteen to come into a room full of company with a broad stare as if she meant to defy them to put her out of countenance an undaunted woman of any age is i think shocking but in a young creature it is absolutely disgustinge besides setting a girl above shame is breaking through one of the strongest barriers of female virtue and we see daily examples of it in england where the fashionable mode of education has introduced a levity amongst the women that even outdoes their neighbors on the continent i much fear we shall catch the infection for where the intercourse is so frequent it will be next to a miracle if the contagion does not spread and i have long observed that neither the manners nor morals of my country people are at all improved by a jaunt to england  you will say i have wandered far from my subject but i intend giving gertrudes story a sheet of paper to itself that your patience may not be put to such a trial as being obliged to go through so much of my letter to come at it  i congratulate you on the acquisition of such agreeable neighbors and hope they will come to town that i may endeavor to rival your mother in mr boyles good graces for i should like of all things to have a flirt above fifty and i suppose he is that age at least and besides that i would try to cure miss harriet of her affectation which by your description is the greatest defect she has well there is none of us perfect so we must take human nature as we find it and make allowance for its frailties it is best to laugh people out of their follies and be severe on their vices  i know who your female vegetable is it was the happiest idea you ever had for you could not choose a more suitable appellation i am by no means surprised that her mother should think a large estate required no other qualification because she herself had no other and to be sure her father is of the same opinion as it was all he thought necessary in a wise is it not amazing that any man of sense can make choice of a woman to pass his life with that has not a sufficient understanding to make her an agreeable companion even for an hour yet one sees such wives every day and the poor things think they are of great consequence and have answered all the purposes of their creation if they can scold their servants and swarm the house with children though they are totally incapable of instructing their children in any one thing that is proper for them to know i have no doubt but the men choose them that their own superiority in wisdom and knowledge may appear to greater advantage by the contrast and some of them i am sure dread a competitor in those things  i should have a bad opinion of your visitors if they disliked your mothers company a woman of her disposition though not very young cannot be a restraint on any one unless they wish to behave improperly good night i must begin my story which will keep me up an hour longer and i feel i shall be very sleepy before it is finished  yours affectionately louisa mortimer  count de roussillon and miss s george gertrude came into my chamber next morning just as i was rising and telling sally she would assist me to dress as she wished to be alone with me the girl withdrew and with much hesitation and visible confusion she began saying the discovery i had made the day before distressed her more than she would express lest i should imagine her reserve proceeded from want of confidence in my affection for her which she earnestly assured me was not the case she should think herself very ungrateful if it was but indeed cousin said she blushing to death the truth is i could never get resolution enough to tell you  i had entangled myself in such an affair while i was so very young  here i interrupted her to clear myself of any design to pry into her secrets and requested she would not think herself under any obligation to disclose them if it gave her the least pain she knew me too well not to be convinced i spoke truth but said she had long wished to break it to me and now that accident had done that for her she would take the opportunity of opening her whole mind to me  you already know my aunt st georges ill health obliged her to reside above two years at montpelier during that time gertrude contracted an intimacy with a young lady of her own age daughter to the count de roussillon whose chatteau was in the neighborhood her mother also became acquainted with the count and countess who were very polite and even friendly to any genteel strangers who frequented the town our friends received uncommon civilities from them for they insisted on their passing great part of their time with them which made their stay very agreeable especially to gertrude who found a most pleasing companion in mademoiselle adelaide she often heard the young count mentioned in the family particularly by his sister who spoke of him with all that fond partiality which the ties of blood and affection are apt to create and frequently wished his return that she might introduce him to her pretty irish woman by which appellation gertrude was known at montpellier she had been more than a year there before the young gentleman who was at the military academy came home  he arrived one day rather unexpected and a messenger was immediately dispatched to bring my aunt and cousin to the chatteau to rejoice with the family on the occasion adelaide presented gertrude to him with a thousand kind expressions in her favor and told him she loved her better than any woman in the world a french man could not say less than he would love her as well as she did which was really the answer he made and it seems it was prophetic for he very soon showed an attachment to her but it passed unnoticed as it would there be thought unpolite in a young man not to behave with some degree of gallantry to a girl who was so often at the house he was only a year older than his sister and there was a remarkable similitude both in their persons and dispositions which was exceedingly amiable the first created admitation the latter esteem no wonder the unguarded heart of my young cousin fell a victim to the charms of mind and person united in this agreeable foreigner whose constant study it was to render himself pleasing to her and the perfect amity that subsisted between him and his sister gave him continual opportunities of recommending himself to her favor in which i find he succeeded so well that when he declared his passion to her she was before they parted brought to acknowledge she would have no objection if the consent of their parents could be obtained  when she related this circumstance she seemed ashamed at having so soon confessed her sentiments to him but told me it happened one evening that the beautiful serenity of the sky invited adelaide and her to take their guitars to a delightful arbor in the garden by which a gentle rivulet murmured there they were entertaining themselves with some of david rizzios most plaintive scotch airs when the young count joined them and while the pleasing effects of the soft melody was still powerful in her heart he made his declaration and his sister pleaded so earnestly in his favor that she could not refuse to their joint solicitations the acknowlegement of sentiments which her prudence told her she should have concealed  the old gentleman having an employment at court was then attending the king at versailles and the young folks agreed not to mention it to their mothers till his return when his son was to ask his approbation which he had no idea would be refused as gertrude was a great favorite with him and her fortune and connexions were such as he could not object to  their time rolled on in uninterrupted scenes of happiness and content during three months that the count remained at court but his return dashed all their prospects of felicity and the disappointment was the more sensibly felt because it was unexpected it was however a chastisement they in some measure deserved for allowing their affections to be so strongly engaged before they knew that their parents would approve it  louis that was the youths name could not mention it to his father the day he came home but determined he would defer it no longer than the morning that evening the count sent for him to his study and after informing him he was appointed to a company in the count dartois regiment said he had still better news which was he had agreed with the marquis de bretagne to conclude a marriage between him and that noblemans only daughter who as he knew was a most amiable young lady the king himself had been so kind to propose it and the marquis and he had joyfully consented to it as it would be a still stronger cement to the friendship that had so long subsisted between them  this discourse was like a thunder clap to the young count and for some minutes totally deprived him of utterance during which time his father went on enumerating the many advantages that would attend his alliance with a family so powerful at court not to speak of the fortune she would bring him which was much larger than his estate though a good one entitled him to expect and concluded by bidding him prepare to set out for versailles in two days to make his acknowlegements to his majesty for his goodness to him as well in that affair as in promoting him before he had ever joined his regiment for it seems he has had a commission since ever he was born which the late king who was his godfather presented him with on that occasion and also to pay his compliments to the young lady for they meant to celebrate the marriage as soon as the necessary preparations could be made  by that time the old gentleman had ceased speaking his son had recovered the use of his speech and ventured to say he was sorry they had gone so far before they knew that the young lady would be disposed to accept of him and hinted the difference of religion as an objection to the match for his family are protestants but his father who could not bear the least contradiction flew in a violent passion at his raising any difficulty and told him the thing was determined and nothing should make him recede from his word or affront the marquis by mentioning such a frivolous obstacle and sternly ordering him to take care that he acquitted himself properly in his addresses to the lady he flung out of the room and left poor louis in a state of mind not be described unable to fix on any rule of conduct for himself he went to his sisters apartment to whom he related the cause of his distress adelaide who tenderly loved her brother and had a sincere affection for gertrude was much affected at the disappointment of their fond hopes but too well knew her fathers determined temper to hope to move him by telling him the true state of his sons heart which she judged would at present only exasperate him she therefore advised he should carefully conceal it from every one but the young lady herself to whom he should reveal it in confidence and if she deserved half the praises she had heard given her she would spare him the indelicacy of refusing her as well as the pain of disobliging his father she was surprised he made light of the difference of religion because he was strongly attached to his own and said she thought it an unsurmountable obstacle even if his heart had no preengagement he assured her he did not mention it merely to raise an objection but because it was his sentiments that people of different persuasions could not be happy in marriage as the education of their children would be a continual source of uneasiness and as mademoiselle was reckoned very sensible he had hopes she would be of the same opinion  he then requested his sister would break the matter to gertrude in the best manner she could and procure him an interview with her the next day she promised to do so and having consoled him greatly by her conversation he retired from her apartment much more composed than when he entered it  next day adelaide ordered her carriage saying she would call on gertrude to take an airing with her which she often did and the countess bid her engage mrs st george too to come and spend the day with them which she accordingly did and my aunt having some morning visitors promised to be at the chatteau by the time they returned from their airing adelaide who was well pleased she did not offer to go with them as soon as she found herself alone with gertrude informed her as cautiously as she could of what had passed between louis and his father and will all the tenderness of friendship pointed out to her the reason they had to expect the lady would refuse him but to prevent her being any way alarmed assured her from her brother that though he held himself bound by duty not to marry without his fathers consent nothing could ever prevail on him to think of any other woman  gertrude says she received this intelligence with more fortitude than she thought she was possessed of but the truth is her pride was hurt that any man should think it necessary to conceal his attachment to her she therefore told adelaide it would give her much concern to be the cause of any misunderstanding between the count and his son to prevent which she would advise him to marry the lady that was chose for him as for her she never would have encouraged his addresses had she thought it probable there could be any objection but since there was her rank in life set her above forcing herself into any family against their consent are not you proud of her spirit  adelaide seemed surprised at her manner of receiving news which she thought would greatly affect her but no doubt quickly penetrating into the real cause she took her hand and said my dear gertrude entirely misconstrues my meaning i can safely affirm that every one of our family would think themselves honored by a connection with you the misfortune lies in my brother not having declared his attachment to you before my father went to paris he left home supposing his sons heart disengaged and at the kings desire agreed to marry him to the daughter of his dearest friend that surely cannot be looked on as an affront to you i acknowledge my fathers fault is obstinacy he never will retract from a resolution once taken and expects unlimited obedience from his children in such a case your own good sense will show you the impropriety of mentioning the affair to him now especially when we have fixed on a scheme very likely to succeed without provoking my father let me then beseech you not to add to the inquietude my poor brother labors under by expressing a displeasure he really does not deserve from you  gertrude who could not but assent to the truth of what adelaide said promised she would not but was determined in her own mind not to be prevailed on to enter into any private engagement with him which she doubted not he would propose at the interview she had consented to give him it being near dinnertime they returned to the chatteau where they found my aunt and a widow lady of the neighborhood the day passed off not so agreeable as usual for the countess and adelaide were lowspirited at parting with louis so soon and he and gertrude you may think could not be very lively so that my aunt and the other lady were the only unconcerned persons and kept the rest from being quite silent after they had taken their coffee the three old ladies and the count sat down to quadrille and the three young folks went into the garden and entering their favorite arbor sat down to enjoy the pleasing scene and listen to the sweet warbling of an infinite variety of birds that inhabited the trees around them the soft notes charmed them for a while to silence but the young count could not long defer the subject next his heart and told his tale so pathetically that gertrude could with difficulty refuse a promise he endeavored to draw from her but she thought it too humiliating to engage herself to wait for a man whose father would perhaps never consent to their union she therefore did refuse it though he solemnly swore never to marry any other woman while she remained single  she had intended to return his picture and demand here is which he had they were both of his own drawing but his distraction was so great at parting with her that she thought it should be barbarous to mention it and i dare say was well pleased to have any excuse for keeping the dear resemblance  the farewell was no doubt very tender on his side and i believe a little so on hers notwithstanding all her discretion however upon the whole she certainly behaved heroically if we consider her youth for she was but fifteen and that she really loved the man his merit and the pains he took to win her heart is sufficient apology she determined not to tell her mother lest she should be uneasy on her account and she had come to a resolution not to let it prey on her spirits but wait patiently to see how matters would turn out   he set off with his father very early the next morning and the first account she had from him was in a letter to his sister wherein he informed her he had waited on the lady but had no ocasion to make her hisconfidant for knowing the motive of his visit she with a pleasing frankness told him he might spare himself the trouble of declaring it for there was an insuperable objection to their union which was his religion she had been educated in a convent where she had imbibed all the uncharitable doctrines of popery and said she hoped he could not take it amiss if she told him she could not think of risking her salvation by marrying a heretic for in this case she thought it best to speak plain that he might know her resolution was fixed  he said all that was proper on the occasion and left her with a heart quite at ease but found it necessary to conceal his satisfaction when he came into his fathers presence to whom he related her answer the count had scarce patience to hear him out taking it for granted the fault was entirely his as he had at first mention of the affair made that objection he was in an absolute rage and though louis gave him all the assurances possible that the lady had pronounced her refusal before he had well spoke it was to no purpose he forbid him to appear in his sight and next day sent him an order from the king to repair to his regiment and not presume to leave it without his majestys particular permission  he was then preparing to obey this unwelcome command and as it was very uncertain when he should be able to plead his own cause he requested his sister to be his advocate with her fair friend and if possible to keep up an interest for him in her heart  he soon after wrote to her under cover to his sister which he still continues to do though she never answers his letters except by messages in those she writes to adelaide  i have seen his letters they are sensible and wellwrote but full of those passionate exclamations with which french love letters always abound but which in our language sounds very ill at least i think ah oh and alas have a mighty bad effect in an english letter but to proceed with my story the war breaking out my aunt determined to set out for ireland and gertrude did not at all regret quitting france as the countess and adelaide were soon to go to paris where the counts employment obliged him to reside during the war the parting was very painful to the young friends who promised a mutual correspondence as often as opportunity would permit and it is still continued though adelaide was married very soon after she went to paris to a man of large fortune m de st veriolle her fathers displeasure against his son is not yet removed nor can they prevail on him to get leave for him to come home to see them before the regiment embarks which is now under orders for america  though gertrude would not give him a promise i believe he is quite as secure of her as if she had for she is now her own mistress and seems not the least inclined to encourage any other she never told her mother a word of it indeed it was useless to give her any disquiet about it as the cold she got on her journey occasioned such a rapid decline of her health before very precarious that as you know she did not survive above two months after her coming home  having always lived with my father since her widowhood and after his death with me she requested gertrude should remain in my house till she was married if agreeable to us both which she hoped it would be for though gertrude was by her fathers will to be of age at sixteen yet she thought that too young for a girl to be left to her own direction and as i was a few years older and had more experience she wished gertrude would be always advised by me whose affection for her she was sure she might depend upon you know it has been my study to make her happy i thought her rather serious for her age and wondered she had not got some of the french vivacity as she went amongst them while a child i did not then suspect her heart had learned a lesson which is apt to give a thoughtful turn to the most sprightly temper  she seemed very apprehensive of losing my good opinion by informing me of this affair as she was perfectly sensible her conduct in it would not bear to be scrutinized by any unprejudiced person i freely blamed her for giving him any encouragement without first acquainting her mother and bid her observe that all the uneasiness she had suffered since was in consequence of that one deviation from the path of duty had they both consulted their parents in proper time it is most probable there would have been no obstacle to their happiness i praised her however for her discretion in the other circumstances particularly refusing to contract herself to him and she was quite happy that i approved any part of her conduct i hope you will acknowledge yourself under uncommon obligations to me for sitting up half a night to write a lovetale for you i now leave you to read it for my eyes are just closing  ever yours louisa mortimer  letter vii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer nov  0  i have just received my dear louisas packet of the   th inst and do indeed acknowledge myself much obliged to you for sacrificing a nights rest to gratify my curiosity could i have had a notion the story would run to such a length i should not have been so unreasonable as to ask you to communicate it but i thought it was something that had lately occurred and would be related in a few lines instead of that it is quite a little novel and has afforded me an hours pleasing amusement i sincerely hope it may end happily for gertrude and her agreeable frenchman  your observations were very just she was certainly wrong in concealing it from her mother at first however i could make a thousand excuses for her and to tell truth i fear had i been in her situation i should not have been above half so prudent i think she must have had an uncommon share of resolution to refuse his request at their last meeting but no doubt being so nearly related she has a tincture of your philosophy nothing less could enable her to resist the solicitations of the man she loved when consistent with virtue i own it was perfectly prudent and i think she deserves great praise for it but you will grant it requires a degree of fortitude seldom to be met with in so young a person to act up to our duty in every respect on an occasion where the heart is so much concerned for my part i am thankful i never had any such trials as i have great doubts of myself for i know i am but too susceptible of tenderness though i hoped no one had made the observation but you who are acquainted with the inmost recesses of my mind for though i have been so fortunate as to place my affections just where my friends wished i should be sorry to deviate from the paths of delicacy in my behavior which i really think would be the case if my attachment to mr skeffington was visible to strangers but i flatter myself gertrude being an adept herself has more denetration in these matters than the generality of people i am satisfied at her discovering my susceptibility as it procured me her confidence and she may be sure i shall make all the allowance for her weakness if it deserves that name which i should hope for myself in like case being in somewhat of similar circumstances usually makes one follow the christian doctrine of doing as we would be done by though i am sorry to say we are but too apt to forget that best of all rules where we do not think the situation is ever likely to be our own  be sure inform me whenever there is news from france for i shall long to hear if the count lets his son go to america without seeing him if he does i shall hate him it will betray such a want of paternal affection  tell gertrude when i go to town i will expect to see the letters now that we are all en confidance i dare say you must both have felt awkward enough when you made the unexpected discovery though she that is so well acquainted with your disposition must at once acquit you of any design to pry into her secrets but accident sometimes leads one into situations extremely disagreeable and which makes one seem to themselves as if they had done wrong though conscious they did not mean it so which i am sure was altogether your case the accident will be of use to gertrude for now the ice is broke she will not be ashamed to consult you on the affair when she has occasion for advice after the hint you had given me i should have scarce admitted your qualm of conscience as an excuse for withholding the rest of the story so you did well to get permission to tell it yet i must acknowledge that without that permission you had no right to divulge it and there was no fear but you could recollect that for i never knew you to deviate from the right path or if you did it was but momentary and you recovered your step immediately why do not i always think so justly especially when your example has been continually before me for you have acted according to the rule of right as long as i have remembered you at least as long as i have been capable of judging   you did not mention emily in your last nor cousin james but once since he went to town he writes to charles often but their correspondence is chiefly on political affairs so we have all that sort of news from him i need not tell you he is a staunch patriot indeed i hope none of my family will ever be otherwise for there is something so unnatural in deserting the interest of our country that i could not have a good opinion of any one that was guilty of it besides it is such a meanness of spirit in a man of family to submit to be made the tool of any administration that i could not help despising such a one if he was my brother i think the king cannot confer any honor equal to that of being an honest man and a steady patriot court favors are no longer desirable when they cease to be the reward of merit charles is of the same opinion so i do not fear he will be disgraced by any when he is a senator  i have often wondered what could be the reason that the very young ladies of this age were so amazingly undaunted when first brought into company but i did not then know it was a science they were made to study under their dancingmasters i am obliged to you for the information for while i thought it was natural to them i cannot but say it gave me very great disgust now i know it is acquired i am in hopes some of them may have a little modesty in their hearts though they are ashamed to show it but i agree with you that taking pains to eradicate the natural bashfulness of the sex may be of very bad consequence to their virtue and certainly a girl that keeps genteel company will of course learn an easy behavior without being taught an impudent stare  what a pretty picture you have drawn of ignorant women and a very just one too it brought fresh to my memory some ladies of our acquaintance who are i think the originals from which your piece is taken i visit them as seldom as i can because i am sure to be entertained with nothing else but the carelessness of their waitingmaid and the wit of their children now though i will allow the little creatures prattle may be perfectly entertaining to a parent or even to a stranger if they were present it will very seldom bear a repetition however i must acknowledge it is generally as sensible as any thing the mother could say for a woman whose mind is uncultivated scarce ever says any thing to the purpose you are rather severe on the men who marry such women yet there is no other way of accounting for their choice and i have often observed that men would rather pass their time with the meerest trifler of our sex than with a girl who is reckoned sensible and has read a good deal which is no great credit to their understanding and a clear proof of their inconsistency for they are ever accusing us of neglecting to improve our minds yet where mental accomplishments are to be found they seem afraid of the possessor i am come to the end of my paper before i observed it and have only room to subscribe myself  your affectionate eliza fitzgerald  letter viii miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald nov     i shall now be more punctual in answering my dear elizas letters than i have been hitherto for as emily will be with me some time i shall not think it necessary to confine myself to her so much as while i thought her stay would be very short and she has requested i would not use any ceremony with her indeed i never meant it in that light but gave up my time to her purely to enjoy as much of her company as i could because she meant to stay but two or three weeks it is now probable you will find her in dublin when you come for her father and mother are coming up  mr oneil had lately a sudden attack of the gout in his stomach it was soon removed but has alarmed him so much that he is coming to town for advice and will stay the winter for fear of a return of his complaint there is not a good physician within many miles of his house and only there was one attending at a neighbors when he was taken ill he might have died before he could get help he never thought of that inconvenience while he was in health but with the fear of death before his eyes it appears very terrible to him  emily has taken lodgings for them very near us it was a house he desired but all the furnished houses were set  which she is not sorry for because she could not have excused herself from staying with them if they had room for her and she would much rather be with me though no child can be fonder of parents than she is but her father has some particularities that makes it not pleasing to live with him such as going to bed at ten oclock and expecting all his family to do the same at least they must be at home at that hour and cannot have company after it as the doors are then locked and the keys taken to his room he makes no allowance for the alteration of customs and manners since he was a young man so if his daughter was with him she could neither pay nor receive any but morning visits unless she could prevail on the people to dine and sup at the same hours they did forty years ago  mr oneil was an old bachelor when he married and had got several oddities as people who live alone are apt to do which he still retains for his wife though a very young woman accommodated herself to his ways by which means he never was broke off them as it is likely he would have been had she gone a little more into the gay world but she was just the gentle temper of emily and feared even a grave look it was all she had to fear for he was not an illtempered man as i have heard my father say who blamed her for not bringing him off these peculiarities which makes men disagreeable that would otherwise be very pleasing if ever i marry an old bachelor i shall take pains to make him as pleasing as i can  you observed i did not mention emily i hope you are satisfied now i have filled half my paper about her and her family as to your cousin james i knew he wrote to mr skeffington and concluded you must know more of him than i could though he often favors me with his company and i am always glad to see him for i do not put him on a footing with some others that visit me because one gets both information and entertainment from his conversation if i am any judge in these matters his heart is not quite so whole as when he came to town not that he has given the smallest hint to the contrary but his behavior to mrs rochford shows it very plain the minute attentions or as the french express it le petit soins are never thought of but by a lover any man of politeness will think of all the civilities which they know we expect from them but none but a man in love will think of attending to every trifling circumstance that may occur i never yet found myself mistaken in the observation however i would not have you mention it to charles lest he should hint it to mr fitzgerald who would know you had it from me and there would be an indelicacy in it is coming from her friends i would not caution you about it only i know you think charles is all discretion and to be entrusted with any secret but i know the men all tell each other those fort of secrets  i have teized emily a good deal on the subject but she affects not to perceive his attachment and when i tell her that is only to make him speak plain she prims and looks so matronly and so discreet that i am obliged to be silent she certainly does not dislike him but i am convinced she would not at present listen to any man on that subject she has too just notions of propriety besides her unhappiness in marriage is so recent in her memory that i think she will consider well before she enters into the state again was i in her place i should have got a complete surfeit  i cannot accept of your compliment because i feel i am by no means the perfect creature which your partial friendship has described me though i am sure you only say what you have persuaded yourself to think it does not however require such a share of philosophy as you seem to imagine to enable us to control our passions when we are accustomed to to give way to them in opposition to our reason and i think myself infinitely obliged to my parents for teaching me to curb them before they grew ungovernable so that what you call philosophy is purely the effects of a proper education enforced i acknowledge by religious motives since i have been capable of comprehending them for though i am of a very cheerful turn of mind i can think seriously on subjects of importance  gertrude is highly flattered by your approbation and says she begins to be better reconciled to herself since you and i think her conduct excusable she bids me tell you she will let you see the letters when you come to town and all that she may yet receive from the count she expects to hear soon as he will certainly write before he goes to america  harry maunsel surprised us just as we sat down to tea last night i did not expect him for i had a letter from his sister very lately which mentioned his intention of going to cork on business but it seems some pressing occasion has brought him to dublin and he says will detain him great part of the winter i find charles and he correspond and by some words he let fall i am sure he has mentioned his uneasiness about mr hamilton to him if so it is probable we shall discover his real sentiments and whether as you think his reason has conquered his jealously but as yet i have no time to enter into a conversation on the subject  harry who has not seen mrs rochfort since she was with me a year before her marriage was so struck with the loveliness of her countenance and figure that i had some hopes she would rival me and observed him closely to see if it was so but have reason to think his admiration was nothing more than the pleasing effect which the first view of something very beautiful always has on the mind but which as it grows familiar to the sight ceases to attract the attention you will think it an odd expression to say i had hopes of being rivalled however for his sake i sincerely wish it had been the case  is charles as great a bookworm as ever you should endeavor to wean him a little from his studies as he is not to follow any profession it is high time he should study the manners of the world which he is really too ignorant of i shall talk to henry about giving him a little advice on that head now i find there is such an intimacy between them  gertrude begs you will not make yourself uneasy at what she said of your susceptibility for though that is very perceptible your delicacy remains unimpeached in which opinion i join and think you a good decent behaved girl notwithstanding you are a perfect turtle in love and constancy i wonder how it is that charles and you have continued to like each other so long it seldom happens that a fancy of that kind taken in childhood subsists when the parties grow up besides from the manner you were reared together i am surprised you did not rather mistake each other for brother and sister was i in your place i should be a little afraid the whole stock of tenderness on both sides would be exhausted before marriage if it is not i can only say you have an amazing fund of it  i wish christmas was over that you might come to town and on consideration i do not see any necessity there was for your going almost two months before that you might be there at the time but mrs fitzgerald is so methodical she does not like to break through old customs and it is very fit you should comply with her inclinations her actions are always governed by some laudable motive  what a long epistle here is with little or nothing in it however as i am in a scribbling vein it is likely it would be still longer but luckily for you who will have the fatigue of reading it i must break off for your cousin james and harry maunsell are to gallant gertrude and i to the play and it is just teatime no doubt they will soon be here emily spent the day at her aunts you may think she does not as yet go to any public place which has confined me a great deal our beaux are arrived have only time to say i am  dear elizas very sincere friend louisa mortimer  letter ix miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald nov     dear eliza a conversation i had with harry maunsell this morning determined me to write directly though i had dispatched a letter to you by last nights post but as i think i have something interesting to say i would not delay it a moment  harry was with me all the forenoon and emily and gertrude being out shoping i had an opportunity to speak to him about the hint he dropped in regard to mr hamilton he immediately told me all he knew of the matter he had it from mr skeffington and taking a letter out of his pocket gave it to me to read when i had finished i went for your first letter and read the account you gave me of the affair then observing to him how necessary it was to your happiness to be acquainted with charless real sentiments upon the occasion obtained permission to take a copy of it for your perusal nothing but that consideration could have tempted him to give it but i assured him he might rely on your discretion that you would destroy it as soon as read you will easily see the necessity for so doing and here you shall have the copy  castleskeffington nov  0  dear maunsell we left dublin on the  th as i informed you we should and arrived in due time but met with an adventure on the road which has roused a latent spark of jealousy in my bosom and given me so much uneasiness that i could not sufficiently compose my mind to write to you sooner though i never had more occasion for your counsel  a mr hamilton of the county of derry joined us on the last night of our journey he is i must acknowledge a most accomplished young man being lately returned from his travels the conversation turned on the manners and customs of the places he had visited which he described with so much understanding and elegance of expression that my aunt was delighted and eliza quite charmed which gave me pangs i never felt before and cast such a damp on my spirits that i was incapable of taking any part in the conversation every word she addressed to him was a dagger to my heart and the particular attention he paid her added to my uneasiness for his person is really faultless and his address perfectly pleasing attractions sufficient to gain any woman and alarm any man that loves as i do and is not very partial to his own merit  when he retired the ladies were lavish in his praise and eliza observed what an advantage travel was to young men of sense as it enlarged their ideas and gave them a knowledge of the world which they could never obtain from books alone as i took this observation to be entirely directed to me who wanted that advantage it confirmed my suspicions and increased my ill temper so that my gloominess was i am sure apparent for i caught eliza attentively looking at me several times and my aunt taking notice of my silence i was forced to pretend a headache on which she insisted i should go to bed and ever attentive to my health ordered whey and hartshorn to be given me but knowing that was not a cure for my real complaint you may guess i did not take it i went to bed in a state of mind little short of distraction and lay cursing the whole fickle sex and my own misfortune in being so strongly attached to one of them that i felt it impossible to tear her from my heart the agitation i endured at last fatigued my spirits and threw me into a sound sleep when i awoke i found myself refreshed and composed and on revolving impartially every circumstance that had passed the preceding night i was ashamed to acknowledge to myself that i had not any any one tolerable reason to assign for the suspicions that gave me so much disquiet convinced i had been in an error i recovered my temper and my spirits and met the ladies in my usual manner my aunt congratulated herself on the success of her medicine and eliza with a glow of pleasure on her check rejoiced i was so much better  mr hamilton breakfasted with us and gave me a very genteel invitation to his house where he will be before christmas he regretted much we were so soon to part and when we were ready handed eliza to the carriage and took leave with such expressions and such looks as to me appeared a proof that she had made a strong impression on his heart which again disconcerted me but as she remained quite cheerful after he had left us i cursed my rising dissatisfaction to prevent her suspecting the cause but determined to take some method of discovering her sentiments toward him i abhor myself for the meanness this distracting passion made me commit i questioned her maid and even offered her money to betray her mistresss secrets she steadfastly denied ever hearing her mention mr hamilton except to her mother or me  i soon saw the impropriety i had been guilty of in exposing my weakness to this girl and dismissed her saying i only wanted to try her integrity this happened early in the morning after our arrival and when eliza came down to breakfast i guessed from her serious air when she spoke to me that her maid had informed her what passed between us and i was soon after convinced of it for being disappointed of a letter she expected to receive from miss mortimer i threw out some sarcastical observations on female friendship and sincerity at which she immediately took fire and expressed herself with so much warmth that i who knew myself in fault was glad to make an apology and finding i could not bear her displeasure spent the whole day in reinstating myself in her favor which from her natural sweetness of temper was not difficult to accomplish and we are now on as good terms as ever but i can perceive she watches me closely when there is any young men here as if she wished to penetrate into my heart and see if jealousy still lurked there however none of our visitors raise any emotions of that kind in my bosom as i think they do not possess any superior degree of merit and she has beside been acquainted with them from her infancy but i cannot be so easy in regard to mr hamilton for i feel that his presence would quite destroy my peace yet i wished they would meet again that i might know my fate for i cannot bear suspense though i dread the certainty when she is present my suspicions vanish and i am happy but the instant i am alone all my doubts return do dear maunsell give me your advice and opinion you that have loved will i am sure pity my anxiety even though you may blame me  i have thoughts of pressing our marriage which is delayed till i am of age on account of settlements if she confents it will calm my fears for i think i could not suspect her virtue if she was my wife but i shall do nothing till i hear from you  yours c skeffington   i believe this letter needs no comment to convince you you were much deceived when you imagined he had conquered his foible for it is plain his good humor depended on mr hamiltons absence  perhaps harrys arguments may by this time have had some effect on him for he says he placed the improbability of your giving him any cause of suspicion in the strongest light he could and as it really appeared to him but advised him to make his promised visit to mr hamilton and bring him to the castle that he might be certain he was cured of all doubts before he urged you to marry him otherwise he would insure misery both to himself and you  in his answer to harry he seemed ashamed of his folly and promised to follow his advice so we must suspend our judgment for a while and i am more easy on that subject than i was now i have a method of knowing his real sentiments for i was very apprehensive you would be too willing to trust to appearances and deceive yourself into an opinion that he was just what you wished him to be he is in every other respect a most estimable character and wants only a little knowledge of the world to make him an accomplished young man  i would if i dare advise his traveling for a couple of years but i fear to give you pain by mentioning his absence for so long a time however if you cannot bring yourself to bear it i would have you marry and go abroad with him i mean when you are quite convinced he is cured of this foolish imagination that has possessed him is it not very unaccountable that he who is on other occasions rather too unsuspecting should so suddenly grow suspicious where he has least cause it must proceed from too humble an opinion of himself if you could inspire him with but half so high an idea of his own merit as most young men have he would never be jealous again and that i believe is the only advantage that can spring from selfconceit  adieu dear girl believe me ever yours louisa mortimer  letter x miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer nov     my dear louisas letters of the   th and   th are now before me and shall begin with the latter as it is wholly on a subject in which i am deeply interested  i was a good deal distressed when i read the copy you sent me for i could no longer doubt that i had been deceived in my hopes of his having laid aside his causeless jealousy which affected my spirits not a little and i should have been quite in the horrors only i was obliged to exert myself being engaged to spend the day at mr boyles to take leave as the whole family are going to pass the christmas with a sister of his near belfast and the young ladies will go from that to dublin with their aunt to stay the remainder of the winter they will be a material loss to me while i am here we passed the day so agreeably that my melancholy was insensibly dispelled and things appeared in a better light for i then recollected that mr maunsells advice and opinion had probably great weight with charles and would convince him of the folly of his suspicions and i had some reason to think it had for i have lately been in company at belle park with some very accomplished young men that i was not acquainted with from my infancy which charles seemed to lay a stress on and he did not appear the least disconcerted though one of them paid all his attention to me and i did not dscourage it purely to try how charles would bear it it did not alarm him one bit which i think a very good symptom however i shall soon be a better judge of the matter for he had this morning a letter from mr hamilton reminding him of his promise and appointing to meet him about twenty miles off where he will be in two days on his way home and insists on charles going with him he says he will go and sent an answer to that purpose by the servant so that he will certainly meet him but i find he intends if possible to prevail on mr hamilton to come and spend a few days here before he proceeds on his journey i wish he may come as that would put us all out of suspense though i dread the certainty for if the worst should happen i fear i should but ill support myself however i will not anticipate misfortunes as i think i have some reason to hope it will turn out well  it is now time to return mr maunsell thanks for permitting you to copy the letter for me i shall take care no bad consequence shall attend his kindness i knew charles and he corresponded but never thought of mentioning it to you  as to what you advise about mr skeffingtons going abroad i am sensible it would be a great advantage to him i know he wants it more than most young men because he has pursued his studies with such unremitting application that he really secluded himself from company and amusement a great deal more than was proper for his rank in life but to you i will acknowledge i cannot bring myself to think of it with any degree of fortitude i cannot even reconcile myself to his going to england though i know he must go in spring and if the idea of his being absent two or three months is so painful what would two or three yeas be my imagination is so fertile in creating trouble that i should be miserable from the apprehension of dangers which perhaps he should never experience i am really ashamed of my weakness but cannot conquer it if we should be ever united i would have no objection to going with him for i do not fear dangers to myself half so much as to those i love  i shall be very happy to find emily in dublin when i return which i hope will be soon after christmas for indeed the country is very dreary this time of year and the air much too sharp for my mother who begins to complain of the rheumatism as well as for her daughter whose constitution you know is but delicate  i am glad mr oneil is to be in lodgings that emily may remain with you which must be more agreeable to her though i have no doubt of her affection to her parents yet one would not wish to be confined to their particularities when it would oblige us to give up all the rest of our friends  it would give me great pleasure if your conjecture respecting cousin jamess attachment to her should prove true they are worthy of each other and i do not know where either of them could have a better prospect of happiness i shall not hint it to charles though i am certain he would not repeat it if i desired him not but i think there is a delicacy in these matters where our female friends are concerned that makes it improper to talk of them to men  you deny that you are possessed of any degree of philosophy and yet wish yourself to be rivalled now in my opinion that is as great a stretch of philosophy as diogenes himself could boast though so renowned for selfdenial but there is something in the affair between you and mr maunsel that has ever been a mystery to me yet as you always seemed desirous to avoid the subject i was unwilling to ask any questions that he loves you cannot be doubted indeed he does not endeavor to conceal it and those little attentions which you yourself allow to be a proof are very observable in him for i think the smallest minutiae that can be pleasing to you does not escape his notice you cannot have had any quarrel because the most cordial friendship subsists between you what then can prevent your union i am at a loss to guess since there is no one to control either of you  your wishing for a rival has drawn me in to ask questions that are impertinent however i beg you will not think yourself obliged to answer them if it is in the least disagreeable to you you have only to pass over this part of my letter in silence and assure yourself i will never mention it again  if charles and i should ever be married which probably a few days will determine i flatter myself our affection will never be exhausted though i am not romantic enough to expect it will continue just what it is now but i hope it will subside into a tender and lasting friendship that will end only with our lives and i think i have great reason to hope it will be so as neither of us have the smallest degree of fickleness in our disposition else it must have appeared by this time which accounts too for our liking having subsisted so long a circumstance that seems to surprise you but i cannot so easily account for our not looking on each other as brother and sister which might very well have happened from the manner we were brought up together had that been the case it would have occasioned no small chagrin to our friends and if i should find it necessary to break with him i dread the effect it would have on my mother who loves him as if he was her child and has no joy equal to the prospect of seeing me his wife for which reason i have never given her a hint of what has passed in regard to mr hamilton till i see how it ends i wish you were with me for my spirits begin to sink at the apprehension of what may happen when he comes but i will call up all my resolution as it is necessary to my peace to know for a certainty if charles be likely to conquer his folly for indeed i can give it no other name  let me hear from you very soon you shall know how matters go on here as soon as possible  i long for christmas to be over that i may once more enjoy your company not forgetting emily and gertrude  dear louisa ever yours eliza fitzgerald  letter xi miss mortimir to miss fitzgerald nov  0  i rejoice to find my dear eliza has cause to hope matters will turn out to her satisfaction and i am of opinion from what you tell me that charles is giving his reason fair play what a deal of uneasiness he would have avoided had he done so before  i shall be very impatient to hear the event of mr hamiltons visit if he should come to the castle which i really wish he may because if there is the least spark of jealousy lurking in charless bosom he will not then be able to conceal it so well but the traces of discontent will be visible on his countenance and you will know to what it is to be attributed  i should be well pleased to be with you for the time as i should be more at leisure to make observations than you will be and less partial but i hope you will consider your happiness is at stake and not be blinded by your tenderness it will be a folly to conceal the truth from me as you know harry will hear it and then i shall  i have a high esteem for charles but love you still better and cannot consent to your being his wife till we are quite sure he has recovered his rationality  i am sorry you are losing the boyles an agreeable neighbor in the country is a very material loss but i hope it will determine your mother to come to town as soon as she possibly can now you have no companion i always think of the good any evil may produce which lessens the ill greatly at least makes it more supportable  mr and mrs oneil arrived last night and have brought their little granddaughter it is a beautiful infant and as they tell me the very temper of it is mother she had left it at home under the care of a relation that lives with her a genteel discreet woman but mr oneil had it at his house some part of every day and when he was coming to town could not bear to be so long without seeing it so brought the nurse and little one off emily who did not expect it was agreeably surprised for she had often regretted leaving it but she meant to return so soon and besides that was afraid of offending her father who adores it we had it here today for a while emily had it on her knee when mr fitzgerald came in after paying his compliments the child attracted his notice the resemblance is so striking he knew it was emilys and took it in his arms to kiss it when the baby who is but just attempting to speak called him papa it seems she calls all men so but her mothers confusion is not to be described and it was no way lessened by his saying he should be happy indeed if he had a title to that appellation at the same time giving emily a look infinitely more expressive than his words she was struck entirely dumb gertrude had a smile full of meaning and you cannot imagine any scene more ridiculous than it was till i in compassion set them all laughing by wishing the child was mine that i might have such pretty things said to me this set us talking nonsense and gave her time to recover from the palpitation which his speech had given her but i have a strong notion this trifling circumstance has opened the way for a more serious declaration from him the first convenient opportunity at present i am sure she will not accept him for the reasons mentioned already though i think he need not despair of succeeding in time and indeed i join with you in opinion that she could not have a fairer prospect of happiness with any man i know  gertrude has a smile in one eye and a tear in the other she had a letter from her swain this day informing her he had just got his fathers permission to take leave of him and was in consequence setting off for paris where his stay would be very short as they were in daily expectation of embarking but says he will certainly inform his father of the true state of his heart before he leaves home and will let her know the result this is the most material part of his letter the rest contains only lovelike expressions of fear for what may happen during his absence and soldierlike hopes of a speedy return crowned with laurels  you may guess the account of his father sending for him is very pleasing to her but the thoughts of his going to america casts a damp on her spirits she is the picture of an april day alternate clouds and sunshine as each reflection happens to predominate she begged i would tell you the news as you were so kind to express a desire to be informed of any circumstance that occured  i have not forgot your question about harry maunsell nor do i intend to pass it over in silence though i confess it is a jubject i have hitherto avoided but i hope my dear eliza does not look on my reserve in that particular as any breach of the perfect confidence that subsists between us for it is the only occurrence of my life in which i have not been quite open and you must consider the most material circumstance relating to it passed while you were too young to be my confidant and since that i thought the less was said of it the better for it has the appearance of vanity to talk of having refused a man and looks too as if one wished to prevent his marrying another for certainly it could not recommend him much to any lady he might address to know he would not think of her if he could have had me and till very lately i had no notion he would be so foolishly romantic as to determine on living single because i cannot marry him but you must know in that letter which i believe i had from his sister before she knew he was coming to town she mentioned she had great reason to think her sisterinlaw miss herbert liked harry and she had some hopes that she was pleasing to him as he paid more attention to her than ever she had seen him pay to any woman except one and since his passion for that one was hopeless nothing would be more agreeable to her than a union between him and miss herbert who was both as to person and fortune a desirable match for him  i had another letter from mrs herbert by harry requesting i would endeavor to discover his real sentiments for her sister as a circumstance had happened since her last that made her fear he thought not of her in that way she had hoped and at the same time left no doubt of her attachment to him which was so very visible she was sure he must have perceived it though he would not seem to do so which looked as if he did not mean to make any advantage of it however she begged i would use my influence which she says is allpowerful to prevail on him to think seriously of it and even desired me to inform him of the ladys partiality toward him which she thought might induce him to make her a return at all events she said i must insist on his being quite explicit for if he will not comply with our wishes it will be absolutely necessary to inform miss herbert of the state of harrys heart that she may recall her own before it is too late  i executed my commission with very bad success for my influence joined to every argument i could employ were insufficient to persuade him to return the ladys passion which he said he had with concern discovered just before he left home and only drew from him a declaration that as there was an insuperable bar between him and i he was determined never to marry i endeavored to show him the folly of such a resolution but to no purpose and when i sound him so determined i told him he should then be cautious how he gave any girl room to think she was agreeable to him and he assured me it was miss herberts resemblance to me both in person and manner that attracted his notice but he hoped i would acquit him of any design to gain her affections when he knew he could make her no return he should abhor himself if he could be guilty of such a dishonorable action indeed i do not suspect him for it vanity is not amongst his faults i wish for his own sake he had less constancy for i think an old bachelor the most forlorn being in the universe though an old maid may be quite the reverse the domestic life being natural to women they can manage their house and see company as well without a husband as with one if not better and if they dislike living alone they cannot fail of a semale companion unless their temper is very bad and in that case they could not be happy in marriage  but all this while you will say you are not a bit the wiser respecting this same said mystery between harry and me true my dear nor are you likely till next post for i am called down to company and can only add that i am  affectionately yours louisa mortimer  letter xii from the same to the same dec  st  as i imagine my dear elizas curiosity is on full stretch for the delightful history of henry and louisa i take the first leisure hour to give it you for i suppose i should be quite out of favor if i passed one post and perhaps i might not have time tomorrow  i believe you may remember that in old mr maunsells time the family spent every winter in dublin and as they were our next door neighbors there was a great intimacy between him and my father their example was followed by their children and patty maunsell and i who were much of an age were scarce ever asunder harry was but a year older than his sister and as we were all children when our first acquaintance commenced he was usually with us till he was sent to a public school and i recollect when he came to take leave of our family he could not be forced from me without the greatest difficulty as for me after shedding a few tears i was consoled for his loss since patty was still with me i did not see him for three years after our first separation as the ill health of his mother and mine took both the families to spa where and in france we remained about two years and a half when we returned and had the misfortune to lose two of the best women in the world in a few months after my mother died first and i received all the comfort and attention from poor mrs maunsell that was in her power to give for though she was declining fast herself she let patty stay entirely with me till the first shock was over and i began to be reconciled to my loss she did not long survive and when she found she could not live many days she desired to see her son who was accordingly sent for when he arrived i was returning the melancholy compliment to patty assisting in her attendance on her mother and endeavoring to comfort her for the loss she was going to sustain my father being out of town on business i could dedicate all my time to this friendly office and indeed i never left her for a day till his return which was not for a month after mrs maunsells death during that time the childish affection which harry expressed for me before he went to school seemed to be ripened into a more serious attachment he did not in plain terms tell me so but some body has said actions have a language and his were so eloquent as not to be mistaken i did not however seem to perceive it though i acknowledge i was far from being indifferent about him you who know him will not be susprised at that especially when i tell you that joined to a mind as faultless as human nature could admit he then notwithstanding his youth possessed all those manly graces of person for which you have so often admired him add to that we had parted children and now met when both our persons and manners were strikingly improved and we at an age when the heart is but too open to soft impressions and being in the same house for a month we made a greater progress in each others esteem than if we had met on temporary visits for a twelvemonth  soon after i went home harry entered the college and while he was in it his attendance on his duties in which he was very assiduous kept the family longer in town every summer than was usual by which means he had such constant opportunities of seeing me that his passion never had time to cool which probably it would have done had we been separated just when it was beginning unfortunately for him that did not happen till he was going to travel in three years after and by that time his love was proof against absence yet he had so much prudence as never to make any declaration or attempt to draw me into any engagement that might have involved us in difficulties but before he set out patty took an opportunity of lamenting to me that her brother was never likely to be settled to his mind during their fathers life for though the allowance he gave him was ample for a single man it would not support a wife as the woman he would wish to marry ought to be supported not could he think of offering himself to any one while he was unable to make such a settlement as she had a right to expect and his father had given him to understand he had done all he could afford to do without stinting himself which he would not do nor would harry permit him if he was inclined for you know louisa continued she my father was always used to profusion and is not at a time of life to be debarred of what he has been accustomed to it is much fitter harry should suffer for a time though i am sure it is no small mortification to him  i was very sensible this discourse was intended as an apology to me for his silence on a subject which his behavior gave me all the reason in the world to expect he would come to an explanation about before he went abroad i took no other notice of it however than to join in opinion with her that their father ought not to be put to any inconvenience though i dare say my looks betrayed a consciousness of the intention of her speech or at least my not asking who the lady was might convince her i guessed her meaning and did not choose to have it farther explained which was the real truth  harry left us soon after and as we were always on the most friendly footing i did not hesitate to express a moderate concern at losing him for so long a time he endeavored in vain to restrain his passion within the bounds he had hitherto prescribed to it the idea of parting was too strong for his prudence and he took such a tender farewell as convinced me of the sentiments he entertained for me more than a thousand vows and protestations would have done  he wrote regularly to his sister who always showed me his letters while she was in town and when she left it used to send them to me by his desire no doubt as he knew i would be entertained with his account of of the countries through which he passed and beside that i was always mentioned in a manner that would have been pleasing even though my heart was quite unconcerned  he had been about a year away when i made a considerable conquest one evening at a drum a gentleman that shall be nameless because i dont think it genteel to speak of those we have refused stood at the back of my chair while i lost two or three rubbers and perceiving it did not ruffle my temper wisely concluded i would make a most desirable wife and paid a visit to my father with whom he had a slight acquaintance and without farther doubting my acceptance of an offer so advantageous added to the powerful inducement of a title and a very ancient family the latter joined to settlements that were far above my expectations had great wright with my father who being descendded from the oldest families in england hold a long pedigree in great veneration but though i too have all due respect for those things i thought something more was needful and could not marry any man for the merit of his ancestors and i could see no one agreeable quality in himself beside that from what i had heard of his disposition i though it probable he might put his wifes temper to trials more severe than that of losing at cards and though my patience held out against bad fortune i could not answer for its being so complaisant to a bad husband then his applying to my father without first endeavoring to gain my approbation disgusted me exceedingly as it showed he must either think my good opinion of very little consequence or else he must have a large share of selfsufficiency that made him take it for granted i could not refuse him take it any way there was so little delicacy in it and so much the appearance of thinking he conferred a favor that it was a pleasure to me to mortify his pride by rejecting him which i did when he came in full confidence of being joyfully accepted as i could see from the astonishment visible in his countenance and which indeed was so great that he had not power to speak so when i finished my speech which was very laconic i made my curtsy and withdrew leaving my father to reconcile him to his disappointment  what passed between them after i was gone i cannot say but my father informed me that evening his lordship had begged his permission to continue his visits in hopes a little attention on his side might remove my objections as he feared he had been too hasty for it was usual for young ladies to expect to be solicited some time before they were required to give an answer and i hope sir said i with quickness you did not encourage him and why not child was his answer such offers are not to be met with every day and deserve at least to be considered before they are refused  if that be all sir said i he has nothing to hope from giving me time to consider for i dislike the man and never can bring myself to marry him rather say louisa said my father you like another man and are meanly waiting till he thinks proper to ask you this unexpected attack confounded me a good deal but as it really was not the cause of my present refusal i soon recovered myself and asked him who he suspected of having such influence over me  he instantly replied i believe your own heart will tell you it is harry maunsell i mean he is a young man i have a high esteem for and if he has any thoughts of you and had made a proper declaration of it before he went abroad i should have no objection but as it is if he was a prince and you can be so abject as to wait his pleasure  you are no daughter of mine  this unusual severity of speech from a father who had been always so indulgent threw me into tears which instantly softened him and taking my hand my dear said he i did not mean to distress you but i cannot bear with patience that any man should think he may have you at any time he finds himself at leisure to ask  convince me harry is not the cause of your refusing his lordships offer and tho i greatly approve it i will immediately free you from his addresses i assured him i could with great truth aver he was not the cause for my dislike proceeded from circumstances i had heard and observations i had made of his lordships disposition which was really true as i had often met him at the same house before that unlucky night when he took a fancy to me but to put the matter out of all doubt i gave a solemn promise never to marry harrry maunsell  my father seemed much pleased with me resumed his wonted good humor and i heard no more of my noble admirer except that the lady of the house where i saw him told me it was with great difficulty he could be persuaded to resign his hopes of gaining me  what a long winded tale is here  i am so tired of it that i must defer the remainder to another opportunity you have brought me into such a way of telling long stories to amuse you that i shall begin to think myself an old maid the symptom is so strong and though it is a character i have a great respect for and mean to shine in one time or other i would not choose to be one before my time  i am now going to revive my spirits by a little party at cards so farewell till tomorrow  louisa mortimer  letter xiii the same to the same dec    i greatly long to hear from my dear eliza as i expect your next will contain a full and true account of the effect mr hamiltons visit that is supposing he came to the castle had on charles and i dare say before this reaches you you will be quite as impatient for the continuation of my romance i cannot deny but i felt some regret when first i reflected on the restrictions i had laid myself under but it proceeded chiefly from the pain i thought it would give harry when he should be informed of it however the pleasure i enjoyed in being freed from the solicitations of a man i disliked soon reconciled me to it but i wished much for an opportunity of telling patty what had happened that she might hint it to her brother yet i could not think of writing it to her as she had never spoke to me in plain terms on the subject so i determined to let it lie till she came to town when i thought it likely i might find means of introducing it but in that i was disappointed for before their usual time of leaving the country she was married to mr herbert which detained them some time and just when they intended coming up her father was seized with that illness which occasioned his death after confining him to his room the whole winter during which time patty never quitted his house and when he was gone her husband took her home the season being then so far advanced it was not worth the trouble of coming to town for the short time they could have staid  mr maunsells death hastened harrys return who arrived at cork in may which was about three months after but his father having left his affairs in rather an unsettled state owing to indolence in attending to his agents accounts that business detained him in the country till winter by which means i had time enough to be prepared for an interview which i believe would have affected me a good deal had it happened a few months sooner but by this time i was perfectly satisfied with what i had done i was however a little fluttered when i saw his carriage stop at his own house where he did not remain ten minutes before he paid me a visit and though my fathers presence a little restrained his tongue his eyes plainly told me what he wished to say company coming in he staid only till tea was over as he saw it would be impossible to speak to me that evening but next morning he came in at an hour he knew my father would be out and after many tender professions of joy at seeing me offered himself and fortune to my acceptance and begged my permission to make such proposals to my father as he hoped would meet his approbation  i hardly knew how to go about telling him a circumstance that would at once dash all the hopes of happiness with which he had been so long flattering himself but it must be done and i accomplished it in the best manner i was able it is utterly impossible for me to give you an indea of the agitation that appeared in his countenance while i spoke i felt for his disappointment and used every argument in my power to soften the severity of it but he was for a time absolutely incapable of listening to reason he execrated the man whose offers had been the occasion of my making such a promise and cursed the family pride that had instigated my father to require it in short he said a thousand extravagant things and railed himself out of breath before i could bring him to any degree of composure at last i convinced him that as his behavior to me had been always so particular that every one observed it my father had great reason to think i i was ill treated when he went abroad without explaining his sentiments and of course it was natural for him to resent it as it must hurt him much to have it supposed i was waiting any mans pleasure  all his anger was then turned on himself for not declaring both his passion and his situation in pecuniary matters before he left ireland but he determined to clear it up to my father that he might be reinstated in his good opinion though it could answer no other purpose as the promise i made was solemn and unconditional therefore could not be revoked  i said all i could to persuade him to look out for some other woman capable of making him happy which would be the best method of blotting me from his mind except as a friend in which light i should ever esteem him but my arguments had no effect and though i thought a little time would change his romantic notions i find he is now as determined as ever when my father was acquainted with the nature of his silence he expressed much concern at the obstacle that was between us and said if it would satisfy my scruples he would willingly free me as far as in him lay but as i had showed no reluctance in making the promise he believed i could not easily be brought to think he could release me from it but that harry did not tell me till i had given a final answer which was i did not think any power on earth could dispense with a solemn vow unless it was taken by compulsion and that was not the case with me i therefore entreated harry never to mention the affair again and by that means he might bring himself to forget it as to the first part he said he should certainly obey me but the latter he knew was impossible it was too deeply engraven on his heart i have often since at his sisters request pressed him to think of marrying but though deprived of all glimmering of hope his attachment seems stronger every time we meet and you know we are very much asunder but he really may sing his passions constant as the sun  for me i acknowledge i have the most perfect friendship for him and find it very flattering to be the sole object of attention to a most amiable young man whose love i am sure must be of the purest kind since he can have no interest to gratify nor the least expectation of gratifying his passion i do not however at all regret being debarred from marrying him had i thought it a state capable of making me happier than i am i should not have carried the romance so far as to refuse some other young men that you know addressed me and who certainly had merit sufficient both to gain my heart and keep it i never had a high idea of matrimonial felicity and i am sorry to say the observations i have made amongst my married acquaintance has not altered my opinion my notions of happiness may perhaps be singular and i do not wish to make converts to it if many thought as i do it would be of the worst consequence there would be an end of all the tender relationships that bind mankind to each other and the world would be one continued scene of discord and confusion the instituion is certainly good and capable of making us happy but human nature is so perverse that we have ingeniously contrived to frustrate the beneficent intentions of heaven in that as well as other things and turned to our misery what was meant to promote our happiness it is not however necessary that every one should marry and i really believe providence designed me for a single life as it always appeared to me the most elegible and i am convinced is most suited to my disposition if every one considered their own temper there would probably be fewer unhappy matches than we now see but that is what we shall never persuade the generality of people to think necessary so we must even let them go on kissing one moment and quarrelling the next to the end of the chapter and i have seen violent advocates for wedlock pass their whole life that way but i suppose they thought it happiness or they would not have so strongly recommended the state to others  that my dear eliza may enjoy more felicity in it than has yet been the portion of any one i have met with is the sincere wish of her  affectionate louisa mortimer  letter xiv miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer dec    i delayed writing to my louisa these many days for two reasons first till i had the whole of your interesting narative second till mr hamilton was gone and i should be able to tell you how we went on here  charles met him at the place appointed and easily prevailed on him to pass a sew days here before he set out for home he did not leave us till this morning when charles accompanied him according to promise and is not to return this fortnight you cannot imagine how solitary i seem without him but to the material point which i am sure will give you great pleasure  he never showed the least sympton of jealousy or uneasiness the whole time mr hamilton was here though i could perceive he scrutinously observed every look and word that passed between him and me and i was well pleased he did as it must tend to cure him of his suspicions as far as they related to me and mr hamilton i saw avoided addressing himself so particularly to me when charles was present as he would do at other times no doubt for fear of giving him pain for he had heard since first we met how matters were circumstanced between us and i dare say guessed at charless foible from his behavior at the inn else why that caution for his address to me at all times was only what might be expected from a man of politeness though he had told me he had heard of the intention of our family with regard to mr skeffington and me just in time to recall his heart i believe i looked rather simple but i chose to take that opportunity of acknowleging my attachment and answered it was true our parents had always intended us for each other and happily for me mr skeffingtons amiable qualities made my duty and inclination go hand in hand he paid me some genteel compliments on what he called my ingenuousness and said mr skeffington was indeed a happy man in meeting with a lady so far above the little punctilios of the sex as not to be ashamed to acknowledge the impression his merit had made on her heart it was a compliment however that i did not deserve for i felt very much ashamed at making the acknowledgment and certainly would not have done it but that i had reason to think he had some little liking for me and if i was silent he might take it for encouragement for though i never saw any thing like vanity in him and there is few men ignorant of their own perfections and i dare say he is sensible that both as to person and accomplishments he is such as might gain any womans favor who had no preengagement  i told you i dreaded his coming here though i wished it but i had a thousand fears lest charles should be unable to command his temper and therefore expose himself and throw me into a very disagreeable situation but as it happened my fears were needless he behaved very well and we were all easy and cheerful part of the time we had some other company yet i wanted the boyles very much they went to belfast a day or two before i wrote last and i cannot repair my loss while i am here but my mother will go to town as soon as possible after christmas  i am now to thank you for giving up so much of your time to my amusement and indeed your little story affords both entertainment and instruction in the manner you tell it but how few could follow your example in so entirely subjecting their passion to their reason as not even to repine at obeying your father though we may easily guess it must have affected you much at the time your good sense enabled you to bear a disappointment that most girls at the age you then were would have thought insupportable the object considered for certainly harry maunsells merit would be a powerful excuse for refusing to abjure all hopes of being united to him when one knew it was a generous motive prevented him from explaining his sentiments i cannot help thinking you have an uncommon share of philosophy though you will not allow me to say so but as it is possible harry has not so much i pity him exceedingly his resolution to remain single is a convincing proof of the strength of his affection i must at the same time acknowledge it savours more of the romantic than i should have suspected him or any other young man of this age for  whenever i hear the platonic system disputed i hope you will give me leave to produce you and your swain as a proof in favor of the doctrine  your opinion has such weight with me that i am heartily sorry it is so unfavourable to matrimony for i know you consider a subject most deliberately before you form a judgment and i am satisfied you would not determine against the state if you did not think there was a small chance of happiness in it i never could form the least idea how mr maunsell and you were circumstanced nor could i guess why you did not marry him i plainly saw he was passionately fond of you and to tell truth i thought you had no dislike to him therefore could by no means guess at the cause of delay when you had both been so long at your own disposal will you give me leave to blame your father however indulgent in other respects he was surely too severe in exacting such a promise from you as the only terms on which he would free you from the addresses of a man you assured him you could not like if you had never seen harry i think he might have depended on you for not doing any thing beneath the family you sprung from for though you are not haughty you have that proper degree of pride which would prevent your bearing an indignity therefore he might be sure you would not accept of harry or any other man whose behavior when explained would not meet the approbation of your friends  do not you think patty was too close when she told you her brother could not marry while his father lived and the reason of it had she said plainly you were the person who possessed his heart it would have prevented the disagreeable consequence that ensued because you could then have told your father but in the manner she spoke it would really have looked very vain to take it to yourself  i am so sorry for mr maunsell that i am disposed to find fault with every one who was any way the cause of his disappointment  i made a thousand reflections as i read but will not at present trouble you with any more of them except that i cannot imagine how you kept it such a secret for though i have heard many express their surprise that you did not marry him i never yet heard a reason why you did not and in general those sort of affairs are very soon whispered about  i am much pleased with what you mention of cousin james and emily he could not bring any one into the family that would be more agreeable to all his relations i answer for them all because i have heard it wished for amongst the old folks who knew her  i sympathise with gertrude both in her joy and sorrow i judge what she must fed at the idea of the count going abroad from what i should feel myself but i hope she has more fortitude than i should have on such an occasion else she must be very unhappy  i am quite obliged to her for desiring you to tell me what occurred and beg you will never forget to inform me when she hears from him as i am really interested in the event on her account sure his father cannot have any objection to the choice he has made  if charles should write to mr maunsell no doubt you will see the letter and i believe i need not request you will let me know the contents or procure me a sight of it for i dare say you would not wish to conceal any thing that is material to know  adieu dear louisa believe me affectionately yours eliza fitzgerald  letter xv miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald dec     a continual round of company at home and visiting abroad this week past prevented me from acknowledging my dear elizas last favor which i was sorry for as i suppose you are rather in the dismals on account of charles being away but i hope you have too much sense to let such a trifle depress your spirits very much  i am heartily glad mr hamiltons visit passed off so well especially as he really does admire you you see how quicksighted jealousy is for charles perceived the impression you had made on him immediately as he mentions in his letter to harry if he writes on this occasion i shall certainly inform you but by what you say of his behavior i have great hopes he has recovered his reason for i think he could hardly have dissembled his uneasiness during so many days  i am happy in having amused you with my little story as to the instruction i cannot say much about it for was it public probably more would condemn than approve my conduct at least i am sure i should be held in abhorrence by all those who think love an excuse for every act of imprudence or disobedience they can be guilty of but i do not take such merit to myself as you are willing to allow me for not repining at what is past i have no claim to your praises on that head because the single state is really most suitable to my inclinations yet notwithstanding it is more than probable if i had not made that promise mr maunsell might have prevailed on me to marry against the conviction of my reason but as that is now impossible no other man is likely to have sufficient influence over my heart to make me do any thing contrary to my judgment so that instead of repining i rather think i have cause to rejoice that i have a certainty of passing my life in the state most pleasing to me but you may perhaps think it requires all the philosophy you talk of to enable me to support the reproachful appellation of an old maid it might be so formerly but do not you remember my dear that mr twiss has kindly rescued us in this kingdom from undeserved contempt by allowing the old maids of ireland to be perfectly pleasing and agreeable and since he acknowledges it i think i have nothing to dread for you know he allowed no perfection either in the country or the people that he could possibly detract from i doubt the platonic system would not gain much by producing harry as proof of it is existence for i fear his passion is not so perfectly refined as that requires though i grant you it is more romantic than what we usually meet with indeed more so than is for his peace because he certainly did not wish to live single and has determined to do so merely in consequence of his disappointment it is a resolation i by no means approve as i think he will be apt to repent it or at least have cause to do so when youthful passion has subsided and he finds himself a solitary being in his own house without any companion and depending on the care of servants if ill health should be the attendant on old age as usually is my arguments will then have all their weight in his mind and he will be sorry he would not suffer himself to be convinced by them before it was too late  you are so absorbed in compassion for him that you do not take the least notice of poor miss herbert whose hapless love i expected would have a large share of your pity  i wrote patty an account of my unsuccessful pleading in behalf of her sisterinlaw and as i was convinced it would be in vain to hope for any alteration in harrys sentiments i advised her to take the first opportunity of letting the lady know the whole of the affair between him and me and his determination to remain unmarried that she may withdraw her affections before they are so strongly fixed as to make the effort painful  i have had an answer wherein she tells me she bad let miss herbert into the secret of harrys attachment to me the day after she received my letter some discourse happening between them which introduced it very apropos she says she listened very attentively while she spoke her color frequently changing and now and then interrupted her with tender expressions of pity for his disappointment at the conclusion she sighed heavily and said she wondered how any woman could dislike mr maunsell to whom he endeavored to render himself agreeable but when she heard it was quite otherwise patty says her astonishment is not to be described she could not conceive it possible that any consideration even of duty should have force to prevail on a woman that loved mr maunsell to give him up for ever  oh madam said she had miss mortimer qualified the promise so as to leave it in her fathers power to release her they might have been happy but now they must surely be wretched patty said indeed she knew no body happier for my passions were so entirely under the government of reason that i never suffered them to interrupt my peace the tears stood in the poor girls eyes and she only said such fortitude seldom fell to the share of our sex  she was very ill the remainder of that day and the next but when patty wrote was much better and tried to be cheerful though it was plain it did not come from her heart however as she has very good sense no doubt she will see the necessity of overcoming an attachment that promises her nothing but uneasiness  i am exceedingly sorry harry could not or would not return this young ladys regard as from the character i hear of her temper and disposition i am sure they would have been happy he himself says she is deserving any mans affection who had a heart to give  if you must praise my heroism let it be in wishing and endeavoring to persuade him to marry for that i confess is a great degree of selfdenial since it would of necessity put an end to that agreeable intercourse which at present contributes to my happiness for the friendship i entertain for him is the softest most pleasing sentiment that can possibly be imagined and the reserve that must take place if he was married of the delightful confidence that now subsists between us would leave a vacuum in my heart that would ever remain yet as his welfare is of infinitely more weight with me than any gratification of my own i have sincerely wished to see him cured of his unfortunate attachment but here he is and i must lay down my pen   writing to miss fitzgerald said he yes then i have something for your perusal which perhaps you would choose to mention to her and put into my hand a short letter from charles which he permits me to enclose and which i shall leave you to read so farewell dear eliza says  your affectionate friend louisa mortimer  letter xvi dear maunsell hamiltonhall dec     you will see by the date of this what good effect your advice had on me since i am now in the house of a man whom i could scarce bear the sight of when i wrote to you last but the force of your arguments opened my eyes and restored me in some degree to myself at least so far as to enable me to consider the matter more dispassionately than i had yet done and the result was that i would pursue your plan and if possible get mr hamilton to the castle and observe both his and elizas behavior when together by which means i could judge what foundation i had for my doubts and also know if they were likely to be removed  he reminded me by a polite letter of my promise to spend some time at his house before christmas and appointed me to meet him at a place he mentioned to accompany him home i went and easily prevailed on him to pass a few days with me before we set out for derry accordingly we came directly to the castle where he continued till the  th when i accompanied him to this place which is perhaps one of the most beautifully improved spots in the universe and during his absence has been kept by his mother in the same elegant order it was left by her husband  but to return to my subject by all the observations i could make while mr hamilton was with me i am still of opinion he admires eliza but as he heard after our first meeting how we were circumstanced i am sure i have nothing to fear from him unless he received encouragement from her behavior which i could not see the least reason to apprehend so that i find myself at present very easy  however keeping your advice still in mind i do not not intend to mention hastening our marriage till after my return from england where business will call me in five or six weeks at farthest but i do not know exactly how long i shall stay there i suppose a few months will do to put matters on a proper footing which are very indifferently managed by the present agent and i think if i find eliza entertains the same sentiments for me when i return that she has always seemed to do i shall be cured of those jealousies that have of late interrupted my peace and will then press her to complete my happiness which will be very imperfect till i am certain i possess both her heart and hand  i could not answer your last sooner because i was quite undetermined how to act though in mine i had promised to do as you advised till the opportunity of getting mr hamilton to the castle so much sooner than i expected determined me to follow your opinion which i inclined to all a long but i feared it would be a length of time before i could see them together and i could not bear the suspense i was in long for it was a state i am convinced infinitely worse than popish purgatory jealousy is the worst of fiends why is it an attendant on so sweet a passion as love but you maunsell are free from it and yet i know you are a lover it must then be a weakness in the mind and if i cannot conquer it i shall be wretched but i hope your assisting council joined to my own efforts will effect a cure  mr hamilton calls on me to go with him a few miles on a visit  adieu dear maunsell yours c skeffington  letter xvii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer dec     my dear louisa i had the pleasure of yours with the enclosures and am much obliged both to you and mr maunsell for giving me the perusal of it i shall return it with this i cannot but say i had better hopes of charles before i saw it than i have now for you may observe he seems doubtful himself that he shall be able to conquer his weakness as he calls it from which i infer he still finds it more powerful than he acknowleges but as he wishes to be cured i have hopes he will accomplish it and if it depends on his finding me in the same sentiments on his return from england i think i may answer for it  i now see the folly of parents endeavoring to attach children to each other before they know what their dispositions will be for when the affections are strongly engaged it is not easy to withdraw them though our reason may tell us we were not formed to make each other happy at least i find it so and fear i have a great deal of uneasiness before me you i know would find no difficulty in doing what your reason dictated but as miss herbert observes such fortitude is not common in women and i think i have even less of it than others  that letter has quite depressed my spirits which were not very good since charles left us and to make them worse my mother has been ill these two days if she continues so i shall be frighted to death i wish we were safe in dublin there i should have the comfort of your society which would enable me to bear any affliction better than i can do when unsupported by your friendly council  though my regard for you and harry took up all my thoughts when i wrote last yet i assure you miss herbert was not without my pity but as her liking was but of a short standing i should suppose the disappointment cannot very greatly affect her for any time though at first she may feel it severely as she imagined him disengaged and had no reason from his behavior to expect any obstacle however a beginning inclination may soon be conquered  i do indeed louisa allow you great praise for your whole conduct particularly your endeavors to persuade him to marry since that is what your heart is most repugnant to and i own i cannot help being pleased at his determination though i assent to your opinion in regard to old batchelors but i think he must be happier even in that state than married to one woman while he passionately loves another and as that is the case it would be a pity to take from your happiness without adding to his for certainly in your present situation you enjoy more real satisfaction than any one i ever met with and i begin to think you have chosen the right road to content for that must be the surest way that does not depend on the caprice of another  why have not i resolution enough to make the same choice and put an end at once to all the anxieties i have suffered since i came to the knowledge of mr sskeffingtons temper but your good sense enables you to correct that too great sensibility which is the thing will ever prevent me from that happy repose if i may use the expression that you continually enjoy that you my dear girl may long continue to enjoy it is the fervent wish of  your affectionate eliza fitzgerald i have just got a letter from charles wherein he says he will be home the  0th at farthest he writes in the most tender manner and expresses great impatience to see me    letter xviii miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald dec     i am sorry to find my dear elizas spirits are so very low and request you will not give way to that encroaching disorder which if not struggled against in time creeps on imperceptibly and gains such an ascendant over us that we will not endeavor to conquer it i often cautioned you against encouraging that sensibility which you allow interrupts your happiness because i foresaw it would do so and i know if you could make the trial you might correct it as well as me it is not the want of sense but resolution prevents you you had always a propensity to indulge melancholy ideas for my part i own i do not wish for such exquisite sensibility as should make me wretched for as some of our female poets i do not remember who expresses it  nor ease nor peace the heart can know that like the needle true turns at the touch of joy or woe but turning trembles too yet do not imagine i wish to stand unmoved at the joys or griefs of myself or fellow creatures far from it  but then i would choose to feel them as a christian out i would not be beyond measure elated with one nor distressed by the other i would moderate my own afflictions by patient submission and firm reliance on providence and i would endeavor to mitigate those of others by affording either assistance or consolation as the case required or my abilities extended though tenderness of heart is certainly very amiable in a woman it requires a proper degree of resolution to prevent its degenerating into weakness which it is but too apt to do fortitude is as becoming in a woman as a man and quite as necessary for how very unfit must that woman be to offer consolation to her husband her family or friends in affliction that suffers herself to sink under the most trifling disappointment besides it betrays such a distrust in providence to depend on every untoward accident of life as renders us very unworthy of any assistance from him whom we are taught to hope will extricate us from our difficulties provided we put a proper confidence in him and endeavor to deserve his protection excuse me my dear girl for preaching to you but i feel myself so interested in your happiness that i cannot be silent when i see you likely to lose it merely for want of a little exertion of that understanding with which heaven has liberally endowed you  your mother is not i dare say in any alarming way and for what relates to charles i do not think his letter need effect your spirits so much for though i grant he is not yet perfectly cured we may well hope he will since he seems determined to use his own efforts for the purpose but i have a great notion his absence more than any thing else occasions your melancholy at least i hope so for then his return will set all matters to rights do pray get out of your lachry mals before you write again for i fear a few such letters as your last would infect me  true harry is certainly better as he is if he cannot conquer his passion but what i contend for is he might conquer it if he would try for i believe passion of any kind may be subdued if we choose to do it  i will tell you why you cannot make the same resolution i have done which you seem unable to account for in the first place you are too much in love and in the second the single state is not your choice nor indeed is it fit for you you are much too timid to go through life alone and therefore want some one on whom you can depend for protection in all the vicissitudes of human affairs if any thing happened to separate charles and you it would be absolutely necessary for you to make another choice now you need not make any protestations against it because i do not think it likely the thing will come to pass but if it should i would have you take a few months to consider before you make any declaration of that sort  i was interrupted by gertrude who walked in with a packet of letters in her hand and pleasure sparkling in her eyes they were from france she said and if i had time would be glad i would read them before i finished my letter that i might acquaint miss fitzgerald with the contents i accordingly run them over there is three of them one from the count one from his son and another from his daughter all on the same subject the substance is the count has been informed of his sons inclination and quite approves it is only displeased he was so long kept ignorant of it  he has wrote in very genteel terms to gertrude hoping that as she is still unmarried she will remain so a while longer if louis has been so happy as to gain her esteem as nothing would give him greater pleasure than a union between them he says his son cannot avoid going out with his regiment and serving one campaign for his honor is concerned which he is sure she will think of sufficient importance to to plead his excuse for not throwing himself at her feet immediately but promises to obtain leave for him to return as soon as the campaign is over when he flatters himself his behavior in the field will render him still more worthy her favor  the young mans letter is truly a love letter expressing hopes and fears griess and joys every other word to the end of a large sheet of paper and concludes with a request that she will now indulge him with an answer a thing she has never yet done except in her letters to his sister  adelaides joy i think is greater than her brothers because less intermixed with fears she mentions this happy change in her father was brought about by his being at last convinced by the lady herself that she really had refused his son and she assured him she would have done so had he been a king and of a different religion from her own this brought the count to hear reason and he consented to see louis who immediately declared his attachment to gertrude and obtained his fathers approbation who said if he had known it before he proposed the other match for him it would have saved them all some uneasiness as there could be no objection either to miss st george or her family who he knew were people of rank  this has quite satisfied our pride which i assure you was up in arms and we were determined to keep up a proper dignity in case the old gentleman did not consent with a good grace you may guess i encouraged her in that as affront of that nature was not to be put up with so this love affair is likely to come to the same end which most love affairs do i mean matrimony that is if a cannon ball does not occasion a more melancholy catastrophe which i hope will not be the case for gertrude is a deserving girl and i should be be sorry to see her afflicted i shall have an unspeakable loss when this young frenchman takes her from me  i have forborne to mention political transactions this some time as i know you have the most material occurrences from mr fitzgerald and the public prinis by them you are informed our commons have demanded a free trade i do not however give them the credit of it except those few who have uniformly been actuated by love of their country as for the rest they were impelled to it by the spirit that at present pervades all degrees of people and which they dare not set themselves against the same reason will oblige england to comply because she is not in a situation to refuse but i am clear of opinion that if we do not watch her with unremitting attention she will by some artifice the first convenient opportunity contrive to render every thing she grants of no effect for they are selfish illiberal people and look with a jealous eye on every advantage enjoyed by their fellow subjects either envying their prosperity or looking on it as so much taken from them like some individuals who are as anxious to detract from other peoples merit as if they thought it would add any thing to their own to repine at anothers prosperity is a most odious disposition even in private persons but it is still worse when it is the temper of a whole nation because it then affects millions of people who are connected with or dependant on them and who in consequence are sure to be oppressed  the uniform conduct of the english toward this kingdom as well as to america justifies my opinion of them and i dare say a little time will show what dependence we can have on their affection that is provided we give them an opportunity for no doubt they will dissemble till they are sure of carrying their point  how some of the wise heads would laugh at a girl pretending to give an opinion in politics it is not i believe a very usual subject for young ladies to correspond on but i know you have been taught to think the welfare of our country is of as much consequence to women as men and when public affairs are the general topic to write on them is an agreeable variety and at least as improving as intrigue or scandal which the men generously allow us to talk of as much as we please and indeed make no bad figure in such conversation themselves  we go on here just as usual cousin james as attentive as ever to our fair widow and harry maunsell a constant attendant on your humble servant if gertrude had her young count here three such swains would make us the envy of every semale circle we frequented  i observe when we meet mr fitzgerald at a drum which often happens all eyes are cast on him and emily for the town has already made a match between them and his behavior confirms the idea as it is really very particular  these men eliza with all their sense have mighty little discretion in those sort of matters we women have it all to nothing now emily behaves with the greatest composure and indifference while your cousin is unable to conceal his chagrin if he cannot play at the same table she does and yet i am sure she likes him  what an an unmerciful letter here is i am half dead with writing  adieu louisa mortimer  letter xix miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald dec     my dear louisas very agreeable epistle of the   th had all the effect you could wish in restoring my spirits for you point out the folly and i may say impiety of sinking under every trivial distress in such forcible language that i grew ashamed of my own weakness while i read and have ever since manifested such resignation and composure though my mother is confined with the rheumatism and charles did not arrive till the   nd that i am sure you would be astonished at my improvement in your philosophic doctrines joking apart i wish you were always near to teach me to support disagreeable accidents with some degree of resolution i fear i shall very soon stand in need of all your arguments on that head as the time for charles going to england advances fast and there is little probability that my mother will be able to go to town before then as she intended but i will not anticipate uneasiness if i can help it  yesterday according to ancient custom charless tenants were entertained in the great hall with roast beef and plumbpudding mine were treated in the same manner the day before the steward and housekeeper doing the honors of the table my mother was not able to come amongst them which was a great mortification to her but i went disponsed my usual present of a guinea to each of the young girls who was clothed in her own housewifery and that you may be sure was every one that was present but if on enquiry i found any of them so industrious as to help to cloth the younger children of the family i added a second guinea by way of encouragement to her and to inspire the rest with emulation a cap and ribbon to each of the little ones makes them attend both to their book and their needle and my approbation makes them all completely happy for i often call in at each of their houses when i take an airing and then the mothers inform me how they go on at school and i praise or chide them according to the account i hear  i pay for the schooling of those whose parents cannot well afford it because i think reading and writing may be useful to them if they should happen to be hereafter in any sort of business besides they can be better instructed in religion if they are able to read the bible  charles accompanied me into the hall and chatted with the old folks while i was distributing my favors amongst the young ones a large bowl of punch was brought in for them to drink my health and one of the old men made me look very sidy by adding a wish that their next meeting might be to rejoice on my ladyships marriage with his honor you may think i could not answer such a speech but charles relieved me by thanking him for his wish and hoping he should see them very shortly on that happy occasion the girls simpered and their mothers finiled i recovered from my confusion enough to say something kind to them all and then left them to enjoy their mirth the rest of the evening and diverted my mother with what had passed who was rather inclined to be lowspirited at being unable to go down to them for she used to take great delight in seeing them all so happy and has made it a request that i will never drop the custom which i could easily promise as it is quite agreeable to my inclination  charless behavior since he returned from hamiltonhall is just what it used to be before he discovered any symptoms of that unhappy failing which has this while past interrupted our peace but i dare not flatter myself his present disposition will hold as his letter to mr maunsell shows how doubtful he is about it  i rejoice to hear gertrudes little novel is likely to conclude to her satisfaction though to be sure his absence will give her much uneasiness but something may happen to occasion his return sooner than she expects there may be a peace or cessation not that there is now any appearance of it but she must hope the best she will indeed be a great loss to you you should think of some one to supply her place for it will not be pleasing for you to be alone nor you need not as you have several young relations who i dare say would like well to be with you  your bit of poetry was happily chosen to illustrate your own sentiments i am convinced you are perfectly right not to let your sensibility run away with your happiness and sincerely wish i could follow your example but fear i have not strength of mind sufficient for the purpose  i am of your opinion both as to our own parliament and the english nation and i find cousin james thinks as you do for in one of his letters he says there is no doubt but our demands will be granted as it would be too dangerous to refuse them but i am sure england will seize the first opportunity to render her concessions abortive i hope we may all find ourselves mistaken yet i am afraid we shall prove too good politicians in that respect  i know most men disapprove of women pretending to any opinion on these subjects but the men of your family and mine were above that vulgar prejudice and took pains to make us capable of judging with some degree of precision and i think we are obliged to them for it since it enables us to converse sometimes on matters of importance and not be always confined to triflles a little of each is agreeable  i wonder the men are not more discreet in their behavior before strangers for i should think it not pleasing to themselves to have their attachments public before they know how they will be received most men look on it as very mortifying to be refused and would think themselves very ill treated if the lady should publish it though they scarce ever fail of making it known to every body they make very little use of their understanding on those occasions james is a striking proof of it for by what you say a giddy lad could not be more foolish and yet in every other circumstance of life he is quite a pattern of propriety of manners and it certainly is far from that to draw peoples eyes on emily and set them telling of her second marriage before she is out of her weeds why do not you speak to him about it but indeed as it is a fault or a folly call it which you please most of them are guilty of i suppose they cannot help it  charles has just got a letter from england which he says will hasten his departure he talks of going in two or three days and all your lessons are insufficient to make me hear it with any composure all i could do was to restrain my tears till he had quitted the room i can only add that i am yours  with much affection eliza fitzgerald  letter xx miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer dec     write to me my dear louisa and comfort me if you can for when you receive this i shall be a wretched creature as you will easily believe when i tell you it will be delivered by mr skeffington on his way to england  i wish you could inspire me with a little of your fortitude to enable me to part him with any degree of composure for i fear to expose my weakness to my mother who is very ill and is you know greatly affected by every thing that afflicts me so kind is this tender parent however as he does not set out till tomorrow i will endeavor to conquer my folly before then or at least to conceal it  i once thought of persuading him to go through scotland to avoid the danger of the sea between dublin and the head but on recollection i did not mention it for it occurred to me he would hazard his life as much in a long journey this inclement season in a very severe climate yet if the air does but move a blade of grass my heart dies within me at the idea of the ships being dashed against the rocks or what would be still worse it is foundering at sea for then he would have no chance of escaping in short i have a thousand fears and from the terror i feel at parting am half persuaded we shall never meet again  i wish he would not go but i am ashamed to hint my wishes as i know he has material business it is very unfortunate for me that i have been from my infancy used to his company as it makes me unable to bear a separation with any degree of fortitude though i know the necessity of it and fear that necessity will often recur but what one has been long accustomed to grows habitual and is not easily conquered  my fathers death which i can but just remember occasioned my mother breaking up house and going to live with her brother whose wife being dead they thought it would be more pleasing to both as each had but one child and they too young to be their companions and the society of those to whom we are attached by any tender ties whether of blood or affection is very desirable  my mother and uncle found it so agreeable that they continued together till death as you know deprived us of him about two years since  the education of charles and me took up the greatest part of their attention and as they were both too fond of us to bear us for any length of time out of their sight they determined to employ proper teachers for us in the house and have us instructed under their own eye by which means we were continually together and indeed never wished to part which i believe was the very thing our parents had in view however though i think a home education where proper instructors can be afforded is by far the most preferable for a woman it has great inconveniences with regard to men as it sends them into the world totally unacquainted with all its ways and of course liable to be imposed on by the first that shall find it worth their while to make a dupe of them which is another of my fears on charless account for i know good sense without a knowledge of mankind is not sufficient to guard and unsuspecting mind against the wiles that are practiced by both sexes to seduce the young and inexperienced into their nets  but why do i teize you with my foolish fears yet write to me if it be but to chide my weakness for i have no one here either to console or advise me and you know what a timid creature i am and how very easily my spirits are depressed  adieu my dear louisa believe me ever yours eliza fitzgerald  letter xxi miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald dec     oh what pain it is to part  what a tragedy has my dear eliza wrote on the departure of mr skeffington no hereine of romance ever lamented the absence of her swain in more pathetic terms how could the barbarous man think any business of sufficient moment to be preferred to love and you i hope however he has the excuse of not knowing how deeply you were affected at his going which i am apt to think was the case as i never saw him more lively than he was the few hours he passed with me in his way through dublin  i beseech you keep him in ignoranc if you wish to maintain any degree of consequence in his opinion for men are as subject to vanity as women and quite as ready to make a bad use of their power over the heart they are sure of  now for my part such a thought would never have occurred to me as not seeing him again any more than the perils and dangers of a voyage from this to holyhead which you have painted in such dismal colors as would make ones heart ach in anticipating the distresses of a shipwreck if we did not luckily recollect that the thing scarce ever happens i thank heaven my nerves are not of such a delicate texture or my heart is not so tender as yours else i should be wretched something more than threefourths of the year for about so long am i without seeing harry yet i bear it with great philosophy and even think the pleasure of meeting which we could not know without parting far outbalances any uneasiness that may give it is quite an epicurism in love of which you can have no idea because you have not yet experienced it indeed i do not see how it is possible to keep an attachment alive for any length of time without frequent separations it would be quite as dull as being married to the man to have him like a fixture in your house never to be moved but when he has been a while away he has a thousand things to tell you ten thousand soft professions of constancy to make and in short one feels such agreeable sensations that when you come to enjoy that refined pleasure you will agree with me that being perpetually together is the most insipid thing in the world  i hope this reflection will make you submit with a better grace to the necessity of sometimes parting from this idol of your heart as you probably must do it often since his estate in england will no doubt require his presence at least once a year to see that justice is done both to his tenants and himself now he is nearly at age you must expect he will attend to his own business i should hope your good sense would prevent your wishing him to act otherwise as the largest fortune cannot hold out against the neglect of its owner but will by degrees waste away and most probably fall into the hands of those to whose care it was committed so that your own interest which will shortly be connected with his should keep you from encouraging him to indolence a fault which men of rank are too apt to fall into with regard to their own affairs  i shall conclude like all other preachers by desiring you to consider what has been said and i hope your next letter will convince me it has had a proper effect give your reason fair play and i am sure it must farewell my sweet friend says  your louisa mortimer it being late i was in such haste to conclude that i forgot to take notice of one of your fears though i think it the least groundless of any you mention that is the danger your cousin may fall into from his ignorance of the world i confess i think it more than probable his purse will smart for it if he makes any stay in london where all kinds of sharping is brought to a degree of perfection if i may use the expression that is yet unparallelled and where a dangerous gloss is put on every vice however as he has good sense and good principles i hope he will come off with the loss only of a little money and he will know more of mankind by the time he goes there again  i am much concerned for your good mothers indisposition and wish she was able to come to town which would be a more eligible place for you both than where you are it is a lucky thing that women have the privilege of writing long postscripts else the most material part of the letter would be often left out    letter xxii from the same to the same jan    i hope my dear eliza has by this time suffered her reason to get the better of her foolish fears and that she is enough composed to be ashamed of them foolish i must call them because they were groundless and conjured up by your own imagination merely for an excuse to make yourself wretched i could not help smiling at your giving me such a long account of the manner you were brought up together as if i had been quite ignorant of it but as you were making it an excuse for your being so unreasonably affected at parting i suppose you chose to refresh my memory on every particular circumstance that it might the better plead your apology which was natural enough in you when you must be sensible you stood in need of every excuse that could be made however i take it for granted you have ever now recovered your senses which were certainly suspended for a while and are capable of reflecting on the bad consequence of letting any passion get so powerful a dominion over you as quite to overwhelm your understanding  a man of sense though it may flatter his vanity to be so extravagantly beloved would not be much delighted to have his wife so miserable when he was out of her sight as it would be a continual drawback on his enjoyments if he had any regard for her and a man that had either sense or affection would have it always in his power to make you unhappy  harry could not conceal his astonishment when i read your letter to him  sure says he mr skeffington does not know how tenderly he is beloved or he could not harbor such jealousies but added he perhaps he may fear she is too susceptible for that is sometimes the case   i leave you to consider whether it be prudent to give room to such an idea  you will i doubt not hear from charles in a few days for he has as fair a wind as can blow and to be sure he will write as soon as he lands at the head he begged i would advise you to get your mother to town whenever she was able to bear the journey for he cannot be easy till he hears you have left the castle as he knows how lonely you must be since you lost the boyles and every one else will be coming to dublin when the holy days are over  i promised to mention it to you but told him i was sure your own inclination would bring you the instant your mother could venture to move  harry and he walked out together and had i find a deal of conversation on the old subject he seemed convinced that reason did not warrant his suspicions but said love or jealousy had little to do with reason and when he considered mr hamiltons accomplishments and knew that he liked eliza he could not help fearing she might think too favorably of him but said he if i find no alteration in her sentiments when i return i think i shall be quite easy so there it rests and as it depends on that circumstance i fancy you have nothing to dread  adieu dear eliza let me hear how your mother is and if there is any hopes of our meeting soon i expect to find by your next you are again a rational creature  yours sincerely louisa mortimer  letter xxiii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer jan    my dear louisas very agreeable letter showed me to myself in such a ridiculous light that i could not forbear laughing as i read it i question however if it would have all the effect you wished had not the same post brought a letter from charles informing me of his safe arrival at the head which as it made my mind easy rendered me more capable of attending to your arguments and they are i confess unanswerable but though my reason is convinced i cannot conquer my folly and fear i shall have frequent returns of what you call the horrors during mr skeffingtons absence all i can promise is i will endeavor to get the better of it and may perhaps succeed in time with a little of your assistance if left to myself i am sure i never shall  you tell me with what philosophy you bear mr maunsells absence greatest part of the year you might too have reminded me of the patience with which you resigned him at your fathers desire when your affection for him was at the highest and i could only have answered that to follow your example required more fortitude than i am mistress of but when i go to town you shall read lectures to me on the subject and i will be all attention till i become what you wish me i am sure it would be much for my own ease to be so as it would relieve me from a multitude of disquiets which i suffer from being incapable of correcting my too great sensibility yet that it may be done you are a convincing proof and it will be a shame for me if i do not improve under the instruction of one whose precepts are enforced by practice  you describe the pleasure of meeting a beloved object after a long absence so feelingly that it is easy to know you speak from experience i wish i may find it so agreeable but mr skeffingtons present disposition makes it impossible to guess what our next meeting may produce perhaps an eternal separation may ensue if that should ever be the case you tell me it will be necessary for me to transfer my affection to another as i am unfit to go through life alone i grant i am but can you louisa expect i should ever love another after being so cruelly disappointed in him that has possessed my heart since i was a child it is not possible but you forbid me to make declarations i hope i shall have no occasion  january  th i was yesterday obliged to quit my letter to entertain a neighboring lady who came to pass a day with my mother and as she lives but six miles from us she staid till it was too late for the post so i deferred concluding till today  i have just got yours of the  nd and am really ashamed of my own weakness and of all the trouble i have given you in trying to preach me out of it but sure you cannot be serious in saying you read my letter to mr maunsell i blush at the remark you say he made and am ready to die at the thoughts of having given cause for it but i will not believe you could be so unfriendly as to expose me even to him you who were so delicate in regard to emily and cousin james that you would not allow me to mention your observations to charles though they related only to jamess growing inclination and can you be less anxious where my delicacy is concerned i once thought i had the first place in your friendship and am more hurt than you can conceive at the bare idea of finding myself mistaken though as yet i am willing to flatter myself you only wrote in that manner to alarm me if so you cannot be too speedy in telling me so as i shall suffer much uneasiness till then  i have the pleasure to inform you my mother is a good deal better but as to her going to town i know not when she can attempt to travel i shall be impatient for your next  yours eliza fitzgerald  letter xxiv miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald jan    no indeed i did not expose my dear elizas weakness my regard for her is too sincere and if it was not my partiality to my own sex would prevent my letting any of the fellows not excepting harry maunsell know that an attachment to one of them could make a good sensible girl behave like a fool on the trifling occasion of parting with him for a month or two i only took that method to convince you you were wrong by the distress i knew you would feel on the supposition of its being known to any one but me do not however think that what i said was merely my own words for i assure you i have heard harry as well as other men make the observation that people who are very susceptible were usually very fickle also being subject to tender impressions for every pleasing object they meet with though i know you are an exception to this rule yet if mr skeffington happens to be of those sentiments his jealousy is easily accounted for not having an high opinion of himself it is natural enough for him to fear a more accomplished person may supplant him  if you think this likely to be the case no doubt it will be a stronger motive with you to correct the too great tenderness of your heart than any i could offer and i hope we shall have no occasion to renew the subject  mr fitzgerald is become a violent favorite with mr oneil they met here for the old gentleman frequently visits me and james artfully enough accommodated himself to his opinions which are rather singular and so pleased him that he received an invitation to call in and play backgammon whenever he had an hour to spare i believe he goes there two or three times a week and loses every game he plays for he has no skill at it and pretends a great desire to be instructed by mr oneil who prides himself on being an adept in whatever was fashionable in his younger days and thinks the present age degenerated in every thing even their amusements a common notion amongst old people who mistake their own incapacity to enjoy amusement for some defect in the entertainment itself  it was however no bad policy in your cousin to ingratiate himself there for if he can gain her fathers approbation it will go a great way in recommending him to emily who is a perfect pattern of obedience but i fancy it will take time to bring that matter about  gertrude answered all the letters from the family of rousillon in really a very pretty manner i am sure i could not have wrote half so well on the subject but you young ladies who are so conversant in love matters are never at a loss on your favorite theme  i doubt not if louis will get her letter as she had one from him yesterday dated on board the fleet which was only waiting for sailing orders so she has had a most rueful countenance ever since and we are all employed in diverting or rather laughing her out of her dismals to do her justice though she bears it very well for she does not torment herself with farfetched terrors but as he is going into very imminent dangers one cannot be surprised that she is affected by it  i rejoice that mrs fitzgerald is on the recovery and hope soon to see her and her fair daughter in dublin  emily and gertrude present their best affections  ever yours louisa mortimer  letter xxv the same to the same jan    only think eliza how unexpectedly things come about and learn to despend on the wise disposer of events what gertrude could not have hoped for in less than a year is now come to pass in a moment as one may call it and that by the very means which she thought such a formidable bar to her wishes i mean the young count being ordered abroad but to be a little methodical a thing i am not much addicted to as i sat reading this morning in my dressing room where we usually breakfast waiting for the two ladies who had not yet appeared jenny announced the arrival of a strange gentleman who she said seemed to be a foreigner and enquired for me she had shown him into the parlour and i chose to go to him rather than ask him up it was such an early hour his back was to me as i went in but when he turned his strong resemblance to the picture i saw with gertrude at once informed me who he was before he had time to speak and i asked him had i not the pleasure of addressing the count de rousillon he answered he was the person but could not guess by what means i came to know him which i soon explained and he proceeded to inform me that the fleet had been but three days from france when a violent storm arose which separated them and the vessel he was in having suffered greatly during the gale was endeavoring to make the port they had so lately quitted when they were attacked by an english frigate to which they were obliged to strike not being in a condition to fight and were brought into cork from whence he had come on parole to pay his devoirs to my lovely kinswoman but not wishing to surprise her had taken the liberty of first introducing himself to me he concluded with saying though he was disappointed of the glory he promised himself in the campaign his love would not suffer him to call the accident a misfortune since it would be the means of procuring him the happiness he had long sighed for  as i know the happiness he meant was gertrudes presence i was not so unfeeling to deprive him of that pleasure long and thinking it necessary to prepare her a little as his delicate caution had hinted i went up and met her just quitting her chamber we came to my dressing room together and by degrees i let her know who was in the house her agitation was so great i thought she would have fainted and calling for help in ran her maid in as bad a state as her mistress having got a glimpse of the count and supposing it was his ghost the foolish girl ran about the room like one frantic crying out o madam the count the count her exclamations helped to rouse gertrude and brought emily into the room who stood staring at us all totally unable to account for such a scene of confusion till the count himself hearing the hurry no longer able to check his impatience and following the sound of our voices flew into the room and clasping gertrude in his arms said a thousand tender things which explained the mystery to emily and relieved sally from her terrors who had on his first appearance covered her face with her apron to avoid seeing what she firmly believed to be a spirit  when the first transports of such an unexpected interview had subsided the count gracefully apologized for the freedom he he had taken and gertrude who was blushing to death at having so quietly permitted it would i believe have remained silent till now if i had not relieved her by saying i would venture to engage for his pardon as i saw in her eyes she was not mortally offended therefore i hoped he would be able to partake of our breakfast and i seated myself at the table they all followed my example and sally being restored to her senses paid her tribute of joy on the happy occasion for she knew the whole affair and withdrew leaving us to enjoy a little rational conversation and compose ourselves after the hurry of spirits some of us had undergone  i can easily excuse gertrude for any little imprudence she committed in attaching herself to this young man without knowing how either of their friends would relish it for he is so perfectly amiable in his person and his sentiments so uncommonly refined as i could observe from the little conversation i have had with him that it would require a large share of stoicism to listen to his soft tale with indifference provided one was free from any other prepossession  he is of the finest style of manly beauty both as to face and person much superior to his picture which is very handsome too but he was quite a stripling when that was drawn and gertrude says he is amazingly improved in his form  he has all the agreeable vivacity of his country tempered by an excellent understanding in short i am a little in love with him myself and quite entertained with his chat for he speaks broken english divinely and gives it such a softness as makes it wonderfully pleasing it is what the language much wants its native accent is so very tart it always gives me an idea of scolding so that in my mind a soft munster brogue is an improvement to it provided it be not a vulgar one  as he did not like continuing at a hotel i sent jenny to take a lodging for him near this and she got a handsome apartment in the next street with which he is greatly pleased harry maunsell to whose care i have recommended him attended him home just now for he was easily prevailed on to stay all day with his adorable  harry will introduce him to all the men of genteel rank and takes him to all the places worth seeing it was lucky enough that he happened to be in town  i dare say the count will not think of leaving this till he takes gertrude with him so if you wish to be at the wedding you must not make much delay in the country for i expect we shall be put all into a hurry when he gets letters from home as he has wrote from cork it is not to be doubted but he has asked permission to conclude an affair so interesting to him while he is here  gertrude has been so prettily fluttered all day that if it was not for a little of my assistance she would not have been able to stammer out a single sentence of common sense but when i saw her likely to make a very silly figure i stopped her short with some very ridiculous observation that drew the laugh upon me and gave her some time to recollect herself by which means i saved her from a good deal of raillery which i saw harry and your cousin james was much inclined to as they presently discovered how matters stood between her and the count indeed her own confusion would have betrayed the secret if his particular attention to her had not done it  surely this letter will dispel your melancholy ideas and teach you to think every thing will turn out for the best if our own perverseness does not prevent it  mr skeffingtons sudden departure and your consequent low spirits having given me a subject for my two last epistles i forgot to tell you i was quite pleased with your account of the method by which you encourage your tenants children to industry as well as to the learning that is necessary for them and i agree with you in regard to the advantage of their knowing how to read though i have heard people argue against it but i never heard them say any thing convincing on the subject  i am not surprised that your mother should be mortified at not being able to go amongst them as was her custom during so many years and to a mind like hers it must give singular satisfaction to see so many people cheerful and happy whom she knows she contributes to make so it is well for them and i am sure a great pleasure to her that you are disposed to follow her example  good night dear eliza it is now past twelve and i grow drowsy  yours affectionally louisa mortimer  letter xxvi miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer jan     how kind is my dear louisa to take so much pains to amuse me as well as to reason me out of my melancholy it would be ungrateful if i would not let her endeavors succeed by seconding them with my own efforts especially when i must assent to the force of your arguments they had such an effect that i was growing quite cheerful when i am almost ashamed to tell you an unlucky dream made such an impression on my mind as rendered me totally unfit to write to you for two days which was the cause of my not answering yours of the  th sooner do not however be very angry with me since i acknowledge my own folly and have got the better of it at least for the present besides you know my mother who is in other respects a sensible woman has great faith in dreams which is some little apology for me  i never heard charles say any thing that gave me room to think he was of the same opinion which you say mr maunsell and many other men are but if we ever meet again i will try to discover his sentiments and be that as it will i will certainly try to correct what is amiss in my own disposition  i did not think james had so much art and though it is a talent i do not much approve in the present case i cannot help wishing him success for since emily does not dislike him it is no harm to use a little artifice to obtain her fathers good graces  yours of the  th is just brought me i mean i have just read it and heartily congratulate gertrude on the agreeable accident that has put an end to all her fears it is indeed a proof that we should never despond let our prospect be ever so dark since the scene may be changed in a moment when we least expect it though striking the instance it is probable i should have passed it over unnoticed if your judicious observations had not pointed it out to me with intention i know that i should profit by it which i hope i shall  i read part of your letter to my mother who was highly pleased both with your serious reflections and your sprightly description of the confusion the counts arrival occasioned in your family sallys terror diverted us much i cannot but say it was natural enough in the girl who thought he was on his way to america to be frightened at his sudden appearance and concluded it was something supernatural for i dare say she is quite convinced that ghosts are continually stalking about the world  your picture of the count is very captivating and does great credit to gertrudes choice i shall be horridly disappointed if he leaves dublin before i get there at present i cannot judge when that will be my mothers health is so uncertain sometimes better sometimes worse though on the whole she is not near so bad as she was because she is not so bad for a constancy therefore i am in hopes she will recover time enough for me to be at the wedding as there must be letters from france and several preliminaries settled before it comes to that  i am not surprised that gertrude was so much fluttered had i been in her place it would have half killed me but she is not such a weak creature as i am though her form is very delicate  i like as well as you to hear foreigners speak english they give something i cannot describe to the language which improves it prodigiously i suppose you are partial to the munster brogue because harry maunsell is of that province not that i think he has more of the accent than just what is agreeable no doubt you think so too and therefore give it the preference  my mothers good wishes with mine wait on you and your friends at your house  yours as usual eliza fitzgerald  letter xxvii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer jan     you never i believe had a more punctual correspondent than i am and sure i deserve credit for it now if i never did before since i withdraw myself from most agreeable conversation to enjoy the pleasure of writing to my dear eliza and if possible keep her from dwelling on unpleasing ideas which i am sorry to find possesses your sleeping as well as your waking imagination you bid me not be very angry with you yet how can i be otherwise when you give way to such a debility of mind as to let your peace be disturbed by a dream at a time too when you might naturally suppose it proceeded from that lowness of spirits which i fear you but too much encourage  i am aware you will tell me there are examples in scripture for putting faith in the fleeting forms of the night and i grant there are several but you must also grant that when heaven thought proper to give mankind notice of its intentions by dreams it gave them skilful interpreters at present such notices would be useless since we have no prophets and must depend on old nurses who always explain them according to their own fears or fancies not having the spirit of divination to direct them you must give me leave to say it is being rather unthankful for the blessings you enjoy to torment yourself with imaginary ills if you must weep eliza seek out the sons and daughters of affliction with which every neighborhood abounds and weep over their sorrows it will make you ashamed to brood over imaginary evils when you see so many suffering real calamities it will beside have this good effect you will relieve them as far as you are able let me entreat you to let your understanding operate as it ought and it is impossible you can fall into such superstitious follies  i am really ashamed of appearing so conceited as i am sure i must do in taking upon me to be your instructor but you force me to it by laying aside the use of your own reason for it is not that i think myself by any means qualified for the office of which i am the more convinced since all i have said has so little effect upon you whose partiality would allow my arguments perhaps more weight than they deserved yet it seems they do not carry conviction so all i can do is to wish for mr skeffingtons speedy return who i hope will at least convince you of the truth of my assertion that the pleasures of meeting those we love far outballances the pain of parting which i acknowledge i know from experience and i have no apprehension that your meeting will be productive of any thing but satisfaction to you both though you are so industrious in seeking occasion to fear the contrary  i hope both for your mothers sake and yours that she will be able to come to town before our affairs here are brought to a conclusion and you have a good chance as all the necessaries cannot be done without time  young rousillon is a pleasing addition to our society and i assure you gertrude is much improved in cheerfulness since his arrival he puts our less lively swains quite out of their way for he gallants us all and i sometimes make harry maunsell look grave by giving my hand to the count and leaving him to attend gertrude who i tell him is much fitter for him because she is so sedate he takes the first convenient opportunity of expostulating on what he calls my cruelty in denying him the only pleasure he has to hope for that of enjoying as much of my company as circumstances will admit  i do but laugh at his rueful face and tell him situated as we are it is absolutely ridiculous to see him always at my elbow besides it is not in nature to resist the temptation of flirting with a french man they do it so agreeably he sighs and looks sad and is so very sorry he has not talents to make himself as pleasing as the count that if i did not revive his spirits by a sweet smile which he interprets to his own liking i should be a little afraid he would be found hanging in his garters it is mighty silly however in him to indulge himself in such a hopeless passion these sort of early entanglements sometimes prevent the happiness of our future lives we should be therefore very cautious of a first attachment but the mischief is we are ensnared before we think of the consequence  perhaps i may be a little partial to the munster accent nothing extraordinary that since it has been made pleasing to my ear by my first hearing the soft language of love in that tone to which i think it is exceedingly well adapted no doubt the northern accent is music to you  i expect to hear in your next charles is safe arrived in london for you may have had a letter from him by this time  this unmerciful frenchman thinks we should never be weary of public amusements and is continually hurrying us from one to another till i am half dead with fatigue for you know i am not fond of a life of dissipation but as it is not to last long i submit and he is now calling me to the play i must therefore subscribe myself  my dear elizas affectionate louisa mortimer  letter xxviii miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer jan     i acknowledge my dear louisa is not only the most punctual but the most agreeable correspondent i could possibly have and i might add the most instructive without being accused of flattery for any one who saw your letters must allow more persuasive arguments cannot be advanced than what you set forth to engage me to conquer the little weaknesses of my disposition i am thankful for your kind intentions and determined to follow your advice and example and become a rational creature as fast as i can or i find i am likely to be very unhappy since one should in this life meet perpetual cause for uneasiness if as i have done they always look at the worst side of every event and give themselves up to fruitless repinings i will therefore try to fortify my mind against disagreeable circumstances as i think it very probable i shall have some such to encounter from that unfortunate defect in charles temper which he seems himself to have such doubts of conquering  i have had a letter from him since i wrote to you he was in london but meant to leave it next day and set out for sussex to settle the business he went on he took over young mcneil and will settle him there as his agent since he is of tried integrity and the person that hitherto managed his english estate has certainly not been honest  when charles has concluded his business he will return to london and see every thing that is worth seeing there before his return but a month he says will be more than sufficient for that and he hopes to find me in dublin as he will not go to the castle till summer unless my mothers illness should detain me there longer than we expected he says the english women are handsome and in general fairer than the irish yet he gives the prefernce to his countrywomen for the modest sweetness of their looks  i cannot but join with mr maunsell in thinking it rather cruel of you to give another the pleasure of attending you when you know it would make him happy especially since as he observes it is the only happiness he is likely to enjoy with you and besides he seldom has opportunity for that being the greatest part of his time separated from you that i think he deserves some little consideration but i believe my dear louisa has now and then a small propensity toward flirting  but pray how does gertrude approve of your engaging the count i should suppose she would not be much obliged to you for the exchange as it is likely mr maunsell is not at such times a very cheerful companion though he is usually extremely pleasing i allow his constancy to you who have crused all his hopes is no great proof of his wisdom but i would be glad to know who that loved was ever wise except yourself and we cannot expect to meet with prodigies often you advise me to what most people would think a bad remedy for low spirits to visit the afflicted i always thought so myself and therefore avoided it though my purse was always open to those who applied to me however i have such an opinion of your judgment that i am resolved to try what effect it will have on consideration i believe you are quite right for they must have very little humanity that would not forget their own afflictions when they saw others suffering much greater and very little religion that would not be thankful to heaven for exempting them from such calamities  the obvious consequence is one will be ashamed to complain of trifling ills  why could not i think of that before but you see by it how much i need your instructions and that they do carry conviction though they did not take effect all at once so i hope you will not give up an office you are so capable of for without your advice i feel that i shoul often act very foolishly  your arguments against believing in dreams is so conclusive i could not help reading it to my mother who used to be a great advocate for them she seemed struck with what you said and after a short silence indeed eliza says she i never considered the matter in that light and do not know that it can be confuted but this i know i never met with any young lady who has so just a way of thinking on every subject as miss mortimer i am sure my dear you will not be jealous that i do not except you which with all my partiality i cannot but your friend is four years at least older than you and has made so good use of her time that many women old enough to be her mother might be improved by her conversatio  i will not tell you all she said of you because i know it distresses you to hear your own praises but you may believe it gratified me very much  my mother intends going into the drawing room today for the first time i wish she may not take cold she joins me in sincere affection to you  yours in tenderest friendship eliza fitzgerald  letter xxix miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald jan     are not you surprised at my long silence to be sure you are as it is very unsual with me to neglect writing to my dear eliza for so many days but your wonder will cease when i tell you i am absolutely out of breath with the hurry this wicked count has put us all into you have not the least chance of being at the wedding for the preparations are going on with unreasonable speed and the settlements are actually very near finished he has so effectually quickened the clerks  he got letters from france soon after i wrote to you last i believe the day or two after he says himself it was as soon as an answer could possibly arrive and immediately he communicated them to gertrude and me requesting if we disapproved of any part i might say so and it should be altered there was however no objection to be made every thing was done so genteely by his father when i signified my approbation for you must know i am her guardian on this occasion he told me he should immediately give proper orders to an attorney and hoped i would use my influence with miss st george to prevail on her not to make unnecessary delays but fix an early day for his happiness  i undertook the embassy and gave it as my opinion that she should not take an unreasonable time as he is appointed to a place at court and will return home as soon as he conveniently can for i believe he will be permitted to go on parole she mentioned four or five weeks and then said six or seven upon which i left her left she should increase it to so many months and telling him what she had said he began to exclaim most vehemently in french against her determination and begged me to remember what a tedious time that would be to him who had already suffered such a long probation by losing her just at the time he had hoped to be united to her for ever  i then told him if he would leave it to me i would endeavor to get her consent for the  0th of next month which will be her birthday and sooner than that he could not expect he said he would abide by my decision and after much persuasion she agreed to it but insisted it looked like being in too great a hurry  this weighty point being settled there is a thousand little matters to be done as we do not know how soon after the marriage they will set out for france the sight of those preparations recalls to poor harrys memory the time when he returned to ireland in full hope of being in that situation and the idea that all his prospects of happiness in that way are now shut in makes him sigh and at times raises a momentary sadness in my heart not that i cannot marry him believe me i have no regrets on that account but because i see the disappointment continues to sit too heavily on him the count whom i find he has let into the secret said to me today ah miss mortimer my happiness reminds poor mr maunsell of his disappointment can you give him no hope i laid my hand upon his mouth that is a prohibited subject count the thing is impossible mr maunsell knows it is he shook his head and with the softest expression of compassion in his eyes you know how expressive french eyes are said it is pity it is great pity i am sure he makes harry much worse than he would be by pitying him and indulging him in talking over the affair for he was cheerful and easy before  you say it is cruel in me to let any one else attend me you do not however consider that though there may be no impropriety in his making a public show of his attachment to me it would not be quite so proper for me to do so which i should in effect if i refused the little offices of politeness from any other man and notwithstanding you say i have a propensity to flirting you know me too well to think i could find any pleasure in giving pain to a heart that doats on me but you must confess we are in a very peculiar situation and it requires some degree of circumspection to avoid the tongue of slander  gertrude was not a bit displeased with me for leaving harry to be her gentleman usher for besides that he is a great favorite with her she was well pleased not to be the object of the counts attention in public so you see the exchange served two good purposes it kept people from making particular observations either on her or me  i rejoice to hear your mother can leave her room and am not a little proud of her good opinion  adieu dear girl yours ever louisa mortimer  letter xxx miss fitzgerald to miss mortimer jan     i think this last jaunt of mine to the country has produced nothing but disagreeable events in the first place it separated me from my louisa then it deprived me of meeting emily of seeing the volunteers gave occasion for charless jealousy to break out and to sum up all the coldness of the place brought on my mothers illness which will now detain me from gertrudes wedding and that i acknowledge is a very great mortification to me and what is still worse i have no one pleasing reflection to make me amends for all my disappointments appointments except that my mother continues tolerably and i have hopes we shall get to town in less than a month  i never liked the country in winter and from this time i believe i shall hate the sight of it  my acquaintance with the miss boyles is the only agreeable circumstance that has occurred since i left dublin i fancy they will be in town before me as the servants they left in the house tell ours they expect their master soon and i know he was to come home when his daughters set out for town when i come i will introduce them to you  i have been trying the experiment you recommended to me louisa and it has succeeded to the utmost of your wishes i am ashamed of having ever been so unthankful for the many blessings i enjoy as to overlook them all and make myself unhappy with the apprehension of evils that perhaps may never come to pass and if they did would not be equal to half the miseries which i have seen one family patiently suffering but people bred up in ease and affluence have no idea of what real misfortune is and therefore lament as such trifles that ought not to give a reasonable creature a moments pain  the day after i wrote to you last i took kitty with me in the chaise and went about three miles off where she told me there were several poor cottagers on the estate of a young gentleman now on his travels for thank heaven the lower class of tenants on charless estate or mine are none of them in want we had turned into a byeroad that led to a few scattered cabbins and were driving toward the nearest when i say a pretty girl about nine years old run out and clapping her hands together in an agony of grief cried out oh my mammy my mammy and without seeming to hear the carriage in a manner flew across the road to a cottage at the other side into which she went the childs exclamation raised both my pity and curiosity as i guessed it must be occasioned by some distress she had left her mother in and calling john to stop i stepped out followed by kitty and went directly into the house but what a scene of woe presented itself at one side of the room lay the corpse of a man on a bed at the other near the dying embers of a turf fire lay the woman on a bed of straw in a fainting fit an infant about three days old sleeping at her side with kittys assistance i raised her and applied my eau de luce to her nose which soon revived her and she looked wildly round when casting her eyes on her dead husband she clapped her hands over them as if unable to bear the sight and cried out who was so cruel as to bring me back to a life of misery i bid her be comforted as i hoped she and her children would yet be happy the strange voice struck her ear for i believe she never observed my appearance and she took down her hand to view me just as the little girl came in followed by an old woman  they all looked astonished and seemed at a loss to account for what they saw when i who was supporting the poor woman and apprehensive she would faint again asked if they had any thing fit to give her the old woman with tears in her eyes answered she feared there was nothing but a little buttermilk and a few potatoes which the poor neighbors brought in i then called for some water and gave her a little with eau de luce in it which recovered her from the faintishness and tears flowing plentifully she was much relieved and we laid her down again  i sent john to an inn about half a mile off for a bottle of wine and some other refreshments and while he was away enquired of the old woman how the people came into such distress she told me the man had been a linenweaver near armagh and lived very comfortably till he fell into a lingering illness which disabled him from working and having nothing to support him but what his wife earned by spinning they were forced to sell most of their furniture to pay their rent and brought the small remainder to the place they were now in where they had been but a few months they made a shift to maintain themselves by the womans industry and what little the child could do till the man grew so bad his wife could do nothing but attend him and they were reduced to the greatest distress when to add to it she was brought to bed a few days ago that she staid with them as much as she could and had not left them half an hour when the child ran to tell her her father was dead and her mother dying she concluded with saying she hope heaven had sent me that way for their relief  john returned sooner than i could have expected and i gave the woman some warm wine and water and gave directions for a chicken he had brought to be made into broth for her and the old woman undertook to stay and do every thing that was proper to whom i gave some money to provide siring and whatever was necessary for that night promising to send a supply from our house next day  you may be sure i rewarded her for her trouble in a manner that will secure her attendance while it is wanted and as soon as the woman is well enough i intend to bring her to a neat little house that is now unoccupied on my lands where she shall be rentfree till she can by her industry for i do not wish to encourage idleness get a few guineas to lay by and then i will let her have it at a very easy rent the garden is now well cropped so that she will have nothing to do but attend her spinning for some time  i am now convinced that the wise mans saying it is better to go to the house of mourning provided one makes a proper use of the lesson it teaches for those poor peoples distress has engrossed all my thoughts and relieving them given me more pleasing reflections than ever i enjoyed before on doing a charitable action because till now i never saw the wretchedness from which i relieved the objects of my compassion  while i stay in the country i shall often step into the little huts and see what way the poor inhabitants are in and in dublin the newspapers frequently furnish us with notice where to find the distressed for the future i shall always visit them myself it will teach me to set a proper value on the blessings that are extended to me and to bear light evils without repining  i will not again pretend to blame you in regard to mr maunsell for i acknowledge you are uncommonly circumstanced nor do i know a woman except yourself that would act with such propriety in the same situation but i cannot help pitying him no doubt the count who has so much sensibility is quite affected with his melancholy tale  i hope soon to hear from charles in london for then his stay in england will not be very much longer perhaps we may reach dublin nearly at the same time do you think james has made any declaration to emily yet i find all our family look on it as a match very likely to take place i hope it may  tell gertrude how mortified i am that i cannot fill the office of bridemaid at her nuptials which i had promised myself i should who is she to have beside you believe me dear louisa  your affectionate eliza fitzgerald  letter xxxi miss mortimer to miss fitzgerald feb    i have got such a habit of answering my dear elizas letters immediately that it is a distress to me to miss a post but in the present posture of affairs here i am obliged to do it and until the hurry is a little over i think you will not hear from me again  what a bustle a wedding makes in a family even the servants are anxious to have their finery ready on the occasion and i assure you our maidens will make no small figure as gertrude insisted on bedizening them all at her own expense not excepting emilys damsel who by the way is quite a belle amongst her own class and i believe is much delighted at being permitted to throw off her mourning for that night when i dare say she will appear in all her airs for i see she lays herself out for admiration  there are to be three bridemaids besides your humble servant all gertrudes near relations and she could not ask one without offending the rest so she might as well let them all have the name of it there is miss ponsonby and the two miss fortescues you know they are very young ladies and i find they had set their hearts on the matter for they all came together to pay her a visit and when she asked them to be her bridemaids their eyes sparkled with joy and it was impossible not to smile at the eagerness with which they accepted the invitation and the hurry they were in to be gone that they might buy new gowns and a million of other things which they repeated with amazing volubility all talking at once and i dare say have talked and thought of little else since though we do not mean to make any great parade of it there must be a good many people as it is a compliment she cannot avoid paying some uncles aunts and cousins that are now in town i think it best so for i always observe the more company there is the less notice is taken of the bride their attention being engaged by each other  i wish the affair was over for gertrudes sake who begins to look serious as the day draws near i am not surprised she should as it will make such a material in every circumstance of her life it is not only the change from a single state in which she is entirely mistress of her own actions to one wherein she must accommodate herself to the temper and disposition of another but it will also remove her from her country and all her connexions and place her amongst people who can have no other attachment to her than what her own merit may entitle her to no wonder her reflections should be rather melancholy i must confess i think she stands in need of all her affection for the count and a large share of philosophy besides to enable her to support her spirits one thing is much in her favor that is she is so little alone that she has scarce any time for thinking was i in her place it is my opinion i should have declared off when i came to consider the consequence  harry expects to hear from charles when he has seen a little of london i am not sure that i did not tell you that before  i was a good deal affected for your poor family and should have been quite distressed but that i knew now you had met with them they would be effectually relieved i must beg of you to give them five guineas to make some little addition to their furniture and clothes and set it down to my account it would be too much for you to take it all upon yourself when you will meet with so many others that want your assistance  i knew your visiting the afflicted would have the desired effect because you are alive to the distresses of your fellow creatures you are not one of those who fancy they are possessed of superfine feelings yet never feel for any one but themselves and are so apprehensive of hurting their spirits that their dearest friends if in sickness or affliction must find some one of less feeling and more humanity to perform the tender offices of friendship for in this age of delicate nerves the terms are by no means synonimous i am sure we know one or two ladies who are always talking of their fine feelings and were never yet known to do a goodnatured or charitable action  i am obliged to you for your approbation though at the expense of the rest of the sex it is no reflection on them however for i believe a peculiarity of sentiment is necessary to enable one to conduct themselves in such a particular situation as mine and that cannot be expected from many nor do such circumstances often occur indeed there is very few to whom my example should be recommended for it would be a most dangerous state to those who have great sensibility and very little command of their passions to keep up an intimate friendship with a young man they like and are effectually restrained from marrying the trial would be too great for female fortitude to support if not assisted by such a singularity of disposition as i happen to possess if harrys was similar there would be no more debating on platonic love as we should be proof positive of its existence as it is i think the point must remain undecided  yes the count deplores harrys misfortune in the most pathetic terms and harry in consequence is mighty sad and mighty silly i should be obliged to alter my conduct toward him if i did not conclude that his friends departure which is is not far off will restore him to his understanding  what a detail you have given of the disagreeable events produced by your going to the country they were not very pleasing to be sure however i look upon the accident which occasioned charless jealously to break out as rather fortunate than otherwise had it been smothered till after you were married the consequence would have been much worse since you would have no remedy but parting which will be much better done before marriage if you should find him incurable but i hope you will not  no i do not believe mr fitzgerald and emily have come to any explanation but his behavior cannot be mistaken she is forced to acknowledge it cannot and is grown more reserved to him upon it probably that deters him from speaking he fears to give her offense by entering on such a subject so early in her widowhood as he must see she studiously avoids giving him any opportunity i am however of opinion it will come to something in due time for she does not dislike him and can have no other objection to him unless her father forbid the banns on account of his fortune not being equal to here is but i am in hopes he will allow his birth to make up for the deficiency as i know he sets some value on ancient gentility a new title would not have half the weight with him  i should not have thought of the objection only mr oneil is so fond of money otherwise i would suppose he might think his fortune and here is together quite sufficient for happiness as his is not inconsiderable and here is very large exclusive of what is settled on the child james is exceeding fond of the little thing and i can tell you that is no bad way of paying his court to its grandfather who is mighty foolish about the baby it is a pretty creature too and one cannot help taking notice of it  my next will give you an account of the wedding gertrude wishes you could be with her tea waits while i tell you i am most affectionately  yours louisa mortimer  end of the first volume
