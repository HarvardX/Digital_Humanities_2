his death for he lost his life in a disorderly house in the parish of st clement danes not without suspicion of having been murdered which accident happened to him on his birth day in the   th year of his age      his body was interred in his own parish church being that of st mary ax in the city of london  mrs manley the celebrated authoress of the atalantis was born in hampshire in one of those islands which formerly belonged to france of which her father sir roger manley was governor who afterward enjoyed the same post in other places in england he was the second son of an ancient family the better part of his estate was ruined in the civil war by his firm adherence to charles i he had not the satisfaction of ever being taken notice of nor was his loyalty acknowledged at the restoration the governor was a brave gallant man of great honor and integrity  he became a scholar in the midst of the camp having left the university at the age of sixteen to follow the fortunes of charles i his temper had too much of the stoic in it to attend much to the interest of his family after a life spent in the civil and foreign wars he began to love ease and retirement devoting himself to his study and the charge of his little post without following the court his great virtue and modesty debaring him from soliciting favors from such persons as were then at the helm of affairs his deserts were buried and forgotten in this solitude he wrote several tracts for his own amusement particularly his latin commentaries of the civil wars of england he was likewise author of the first volume of that admired work the turkish spy one dr midgley an ingenious physician related to the family by marriage had the charge of looking over his papers amongst them he found that manuscript which he reserved to his proper use and by his own pen and the assistance of some others continued the work till the eighth volume was finished without having the honesty to acknowledge the author of the first  the governor likewise wrote the history of the rebellion in england scotland and ireland wherein the most material passages battles sieges policies and stratagems of war are impartially related on both sides from the year    0 to the beheading of the duke of monmouth      in three parts printed in octavo in the year       his daughter our authoress received an education suitable to her birth and gave very early discoveries of a genius not only above her years but much superior to what is usually to be found amongst her own sex she had the misfortune to lose her mother while she was yet an infant a circumstance which laid the foundation of many calamities which afterward befell her  the brother of sir roger manley who was of principles very opposite to his joined with the parliamentarian party and after charles i had suffered he engaged with great zeal in the cause of those who were for settling a new form of government in which however they were disappointed by the address of cromwell who found means to transfer the government into his own hands and in place of instituting a republic restored monarchy under another name and erected a tyranny as dangerous perhaps in its consequences as that which he had contributed to overthrow during these heats and divisions mr manley who adhered to the most powerful party was fortunate enough to amass an estate and purchased a title but these upon the restoration reverted back to the former possessor so that he was left with several small children unprovided for the eldest of these orphans sir roger manley took under his protection bestowed a very liberal education on him and endeavored to inspire his mind with other principles than those he had received from his father this young gentleman had very promising parts but under the appearance of an open simplicity he concealed the most treacherous hypocrisy sir roger who had a high opinion of his nephews honor as well as of his great abilities on his deathbed bequeathed to him the care of our authoress and her youngest sister  this man had from nature a very happy address formed to win much upon the hearts of unexperienced girls and his two cousins respected him greatly he placed them at the house of an old outoffashion aunt who had been a keen partizan of the royal cause during the civil wars she was full of the heroic stiffness of her own times and would read books of chivalry and romances with her spectacles  this sort of conversation much infected the mind of our poetess and filled her imagination with lovers heroes and princes made her think herself in an enchanted region and that all the men who approached her were knights errant in a few years the old aunt died and left the two young ladies without any control which as soon as their cousin mr manley heard he hasted into the country to visit them appeared in deep mourning as he said for the death of his wife upon which the young ladies congratulated him as they knew his wife was a woman of a most turbulent temper and ill fitted to render the conjugal life tolerable  this gentleman who had seen a great deal of the world and was acquainted with all the artifices of seducing lost no time in making love to his cousin who was no otherwise pleased with it than as it answered something to the character she had found in those books which had poisoned and deluded her drawning reason soon after these protestations of love were made the young lady fell into a fever which was like to prove fatal to her life  the lover and her sister never quitted the chamber for sixteen nights nor took any other repose than throwing themselves alternately upon a little pallet in the same room having in her nature a great deal of gratitude and a very tender sense of benefits she promised upon her recovery to marry her guardian which as soon as her health was sufficiently restored she performed in the presence of a maid servant her sister and a gentleman who had married a relation in a word she was married possessed and ruined  the husband of our poetess brought her to london fixed her in a remote quarter of it forbad her to stir out of doors or to receive the visits of her sister or any other relations friends or acquaintance this usage she thought exceeding barbarous and it grieved her the more excessively since she married him only because she imagined he loved and doated on her to distraction for as his person was but ordinary and his age disproportioned being twentyyears older than she it could not be imagined that she was in love with him  she was very uneasy at being kept a prisoner but her husbands fondness and jealousy was made the pretense she always loved reading to which she was now more than ever obliged as so much time lay upon her hands soon after she proved with child and so perpetually ill that she implored her husband to let her enjoy the company of her sister and friends when he could have no relief from her importunity being assured that in seeing her relations she must discover his barbarous deceit he thought it was best to be himself the relator of his villainy he fell upon his knees before her with so much seeming confusion distress and anguish that she was at a loss to know what could mould his stubborn heart to such contrition at last with a thousand well counterfeited tears and sighs he stabbed her with the wounding relation of his wifes being still alive and with a hypocrites pangs conjured her to have some mercy on a lost man as he was in an onstinate invnterate passion that had no alternative bnt death or possession  he urged that could he have supported the pain of living without her he never would have made himself so great a villain but when the absolate qunstion was whether he should destroy himself or betray her selflove had turned the balance though not without that anguish to his soul which had poisoned all his delights and planted daggers to stab his peace that he had a thousand times started in his sleep with guilty apprehensions the form of her honored father perpetually haunting his troubled dreams reproaching him as a traitor to that trust which in his departing moments he had reposed in him representing to his tortured imagination the care he took of his education more like a father than an uncle with which he had rewarded him by effecting the perdition of his favorite daughter who was the lovely image of his benefactor  with this artful contrition he endeavored to sooth his injured wife but what soothing could heal the wounds she had received horror amazement sense of honor lost the worlds opinion ten thousand distresses crowded her distracted imagination and she cast looks upon the conscious traitor with horrible dismay her fortune was in his hands the greatest part of which was already lavished away in the excesses of drinking and gaming she was young unacquainted with the world had never experienced necessity and knew no arts of redressing it so that thus forlorn and distressed to whom could she run for refuge even from want and misery but to the very traitor that had undone her she was acquainted with none that could or would espouse her cause a helpless useless load of grief and melancholy with child disgraced her own relations either unable or unwilling to relieve her  thus was she detained by unhappy circumstances and his prevailing arts to wear away three wretched years with him in the same house though she most solemnly protests and she has a right to be believed that no persuasion could ever again reconcile her to his impious arms whenever she cast her eyes upon her son it gave a mortal wound to her peace the circumstances of his birth glared full on her imagination she saw him in future upbraided with his fathers treachery and his mothers misfortunes thus forsaken of all the world in the very morning of her life when all things should have been gay and promising she wore away three wretched years mean time her betrayer had procured for himself a considerable employment the duties of which obliged him to go into the country where his first wife lived he took leave of his injured innocent with much seeming tenderness and made the most sacred protestations that he would not suffer her nor her child ever to want  he endeavored to persuade her to accompany him into the country and to seduce and quiet her conscience showed her a celebrated piece written in defense of polygamy and concubinage when he was gone he soon relapsed into his former extravagancies forgot his promise of providing for his child and its mother and inhumanly left them a prey to indigence and oppression the lady was only happy in being released from the killing anguish of every day having before her eyes the object of her undoing  when she again came abroad into the world she was looked upon with cold indifference that which had been her greatest misfortune was imputed to her as the most enormous guilt and she was every where sneered at avoided and despised what pity is it that an unfortunate as well as a false stnp should damn a womans fame in what respect was mrs manley to blame in what particular was she guilty to marry her cousin who passionately professed love to her and who solemnly vowed himself a widower could not be guilt on the other hand it had prudence and gratitude for its basis her continuing in the house with him after he had made the discovery cannot be guilt for by doing so she was prevented from being exposed to such necessities as perhaps would have produced greater ruin when want and beggary stare a woman in the face especially one accustomed to the delicacies of life then indeed is virtue in danger and they who escape must have more than human assistance  our poetess now perceived that together with her neputation she had lost all the esteem that her conversation and abilities might have else procured her and she was reduced to the deplorable necessity of associating with those whose fame was blaned by their indiscretion because the more sober and virtuous part of the sex did not care to risk their own characters by being in company with one so much suspected and against whom the appearance of guilt was too strong  under this dilemma it is difficult to point out any method of behavior by which she would not be exposed to censure if she had still persisted in solitude the illnatured world would have imputed to it a cause which is not founded on virtue besides as the means of support were now removed by the perfidy of mr manley she must have perished by this resolution  in this case the reader will not be much surprised to find our authoress under the patronage of the duchess of cleveland a mistress of king charles the iids who was justly reckoned one of the most celebrated beauties of that age mrs manley was paying a visit to a lady of her graces acquaintance when she was introduced into the favor of this royal courtezan and as the duchess of cleveland was a woman of parts and genius she could not but be charmed with the sprightliness of her conversation she was fond of new faces and immediately contracted the greatest intimacy with our poetess and gave her a general invitation to her table the lady at whose house the duchess became acquainted with mrs manley soon perceived her indiscretion in bringing them together for the love of novelty so far prevailed on the duchess that herself was immediately discarded and the affection formerly bestowed upon her was lavished on mrs manley  this procured our poetess an inveterate enemy and the greatest blow that was ever struck at her reputation was by that woman who had been before her friend she was not content to inform persons who began to know and esteem mrs manley that her marriage was a cheat but even endeavored to make the duchess jealous of her new favourites charms in respect of mr goodman the player who at that time had the honor of approaching her graces person with the freedom of a gallant  as the duchess of cleveland was a woman of a very fickle temper in six months time she began to be tired of mrs manley she was quarelsome loquacious fierce excessively fond or downright rude when she was disgusted with any person she never failed to reproach them with all the bitterness of wit she was mistress of with such malice and ill nature that she was hated not only by all the world but by her own children and servants the extremes of prodigality and covetousness of love and hatred of dotage and fondness met in her  a woman of this temper will be at no loss for the means of effecting any ones ruin and having now conceived an aversion to our poetess she was resolved to drive her from her house with as much reproach as possible and accordingly gave out that she had detected mrs manley in an intrigue with her own son and as she did not care to give encouragement to such amors she thought proper to discharge her whether or not there was any truth in this charge it is impossible for us to determine but if mrs manleys own word may be taken in such a case she was perfectly innocent thereof  when our authoress was dismissed by the duchess she was solicited by lieutenant general tidcomb to pass some time with him at his country seat but she excused herself by telling him she must be in love with a man before she could think of residing with him which she could not without a violation of truth profess for him she told him her love of solitude was improved by her disgust of the world and since it was impossible for her to be nublic with reputation she was resolved to remain in it concealed  it was in this solitude she composed her first tragedy which was much more famous for the language fire and tenderness than the conduct mrs barry distinguished herself in it and the author was often heard to express great surprise that a man of mr bettertons grave sense and judgment should think well enough of the productions of a young woman to bring it upon the stage since she herself in a more mature age could hardly bear to read it but as the play succeeded she received such unbounded incense from admirers that her apartment was crowded with men of wit and gaiety there is a copy of verses prefixed to her play said to be written by a very great hand which deserve notice what all our sex in one sad hour undone lost are our arts our learning our renown since natures tide of wit came rolling down keen were your eyes we knew and sure their darts fire to our soul they send and passion to our heart needless was an addition to such arms when all mankind were vassals to your charms that hand but seen gives wonder and desire snow to the sight but with its touches fire who sees thy yielding queen and would not be on any terms the best the happy he entranced we fancy all is ecstasy quote ovid now no more ye amorous swains delia than ovid has more moving strains nature in her alone exceeds all art and nature sure does nearest touch the heart oh might i call the bright discoverer mine the whole fair sex unenvied i would resign give all my happy hours to delias charms she who by writing thus our wishes warms what worlds of love must circle in her arms   they who had a regard for mrs manley could not but observe with concern that her conduct was such as would soon issue in her ruin no language but flatnery approached her ear the beaux told her that a woman of her wit was not to be confined to the dull formalities of her own sex but had a right to assume the unreserved freedom of the male since all things were pardonable to a lady who knew to give laws to others yet was not obliged to keep them herself general tidcomb who senms to have been her sincnrest friend took the privilege of an old acquaincance to correct her ill taste and the wrong turn she gave her judgment in admitting adulation from such wretches whose praise could reflect but little honor and who would be ready to boast of favors they never received nor indeed ever endeavored to obtain  this salutary council was rejected she told him that she did not think fit to reform a conduct which she reckoned very innocent and still continued to receive the whispers of flatterers till experience taught her the folly of her behavior and she lived to repent her indiscretion  her virtue was now nodding and she was ready to fall into the arms of any gallant like mellow fruit without much trouble in the gathering sir thomas skipwith a character of gaiety of those times and who it seems had theatrical connections was recommended to her as being very able to promote her design in writing for the stage this knight was in the  0th year of his age and in the  0th of his constitution when he was first introduced to her and as he had been a long practiced gallant he soon made addresses to her and whether or no this knight who was more dangerous to a womans reputation than her virtue was favored by her the world was so much convinced of it that her character was now absolutely lost sir thomas was a weak vain conceited coxcomb who delighted in boasting of his conquests over women and what was often owing to his fortune and station in life he imputed to his address and the elegance of his manner of both which he was totally destitute he even published mrs manleys dishonor and from that time our sprightly poetess was considered by the sober part of the sex quite abandoned to all shame  when her affair with this superannuated knight was over she soon engaged in another intrigue still more prejudicial to her character for it was with a married man one mr tilly a gentleman of the law with whom she lived a considerable time while he underwent at home many of those fevere lectures which the just provocation and jealousy of his wife taught her to read him mrs tilly at last died and our gallant was left at his freedom to marry the object of his passion but unluckily his finances were in such a situation that he was obliged to repair them by marrying a woman of fortune this was a cruel circumstance for he really loved and doated upon mrs manley and had the felicity of a reciprocal passion she agreed however in order to repair his fortune that he should marry a rich young widow whom he soon won by the elegance of his address while our authoress retired into the country to spend her days in solitude and sorrow and bid an everlasting farewell to the pleasures of love and gallantry mr tilly did not many years survive this separation his life was rendered miserable at home by the jealousy of his young wife who had heard of his affair with mrs manley he lost his senses and died in a deplorable situation  during her retirement our authoress who had a most confirmed aversion to the whig ministry wrote her atalantis which was meant as a representation of the characters of some of those who had effected the revolution a warrant was granted from the secretary of states office to seize the printer and publisher of these volumes this circumstance reduced the writer to a very troublesome dilemma she could not bear the thoughts that innocent people should suffer on her account and she judged it cruel to remain concealed while they who were only inferior instruments were suffering for her she consulted on this occasion her best friend general tidcomb who after rallying her for exposing people who had never in particular injured her he advised her to go into france and made her an offer of his purse for that purpose this advice she rejected and came to a determined resolution that no person should ever suffer on her account the general asked her how she should like to be confined in newgate to which she answered that she would rather lie in a prison after having discharged her conscience than riot in a palace under its reproaches the general upon this replied that these things sounded very heroic but there was a great difference between real and imaginary sufferings that she had chosen to declare herself for the tories a party who never could keep their own nor other peoples secrets and were ever forgetful of such as served them that the most severe critics upon the tory writings were the tories themselves who never considering the design or honest intention of the author would examine the performance only and that too with as much severity as they would an enemys and at the same time value themselves upon being impartial against their friends then as to gratitude or generosity the tories did not approach to the whigs who never suffered any man to go unrewarded however dull or insignificant provided he declared himself to be for them whereas the tories had no general interest and consequently no particular each person refusing to contribute toward the benefit of the whole and if it should happen that she should perish through want in a jail they would sooner condemn her folly than pity her sufferings  this did not deter our poetess from voluntarily presenting herself before the court of kings bench as the author of the atalantis  when she was examined before the secretary then lord sunderland he was assiduous to know from whom she had got information of some particulars which they imagnned were above her own intelligence her defense was with much humility and sorrow at the same time denying that any persons were concerned with her or that she had a father design than writing for her own amusement and diversion in the country without intending particular reflections or characters when this was not believed and the contrary urged against her by several circumstances she said then it must be by inspiration because knowing her own innocence she could account for it no other way the secretary replied that inspiration used to be upon a good account and her writings were stark naught she with an air of penitence acknowledged that his lordships observation might be true but that there were evil angels as well as good so that nevertheless what she had wrote might still be by inspiration  in consequence of this examination our authoress was close shut up in a messengers house without being allowed pen ink and paper however her council sued out her habeas corpus at the kings bench bar and she was admitted to bail  whether those in power were ashamed to bring a woman to her trial for writing a few amorous trifles or our laws were defective as was generally conjectured because she had disguised her satire under romantic names and a feigned scene of action she was discharged after several times exposing her in person to cross the court before the bench of judges with her three attendants the printer and two publishers  not long after this a total change of the ministry ensued the statesmen to whom she had been obnoxious were removed and consequently all her fears upon that score dissipated her native gaiety and good humor returned and she again employed herself in writing a tragedy for the stage and resolved never more to deal in politics as being much out of the natural sphere of a woman she was persuaded it was folly in one in her station to disoblige any party by a pen equally qualified to divert all  being advanced to the autumn of her charms she conversed with the opposite sex in a manner very delicate sensible and agreeable and when she felt that time had left his impression upon her brow she did not court praise and flattery the greatest geniuss of the times conversed freely with her and gave her daily proofs of esteem and friendship except sir richard steel with whom it seems she was at variance and indeed sir richard sufficiently exposed himself by his manner of taking revenge for he published to the wonld that it was his own fault he was not happy with mrs manley for which omission he publicly and gravely asked her pardon  these are the most material incidents in the life of our poetess a lady who was born with high powers from nature which were afterward cultivated by enjoying the brightest conversation the early part of her life was unfortunate she fell a sacrifice to a seducer who laid the soundation for those errors she afterward committed and of those sufferings she underwent she had a high relish for the pleasures of life she was extremely susceptible of the passion of love and treated it with a peculiar vivacity  her dramatic works are   the lover or the jealous husband acted at the theater royal      this play did not succeed in the representation   the royal mischief a tragedy acted by his majestys servants in the theater in lincolnsinnfields      this was exhibited with general applause   lucius the first christian king of britain a tragedy acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants and dedicated to sir richard steel she has written several poems and we shall select as a specimen an epistle to the countess of bristol which will show how much she possessed the power of delicate numbers she has also in print a volume of letters the second edition of which was published in      she died july         to the right honorable the countess of bristol long had my mind unknowing how

shall wear  whilst each his countrys good shall make his chiefest care   henry needler this poet was born at harley in surry in the year    0 and educated at a private school at ryegate in the same county see his life presixed to his works by william duncomb esquire  he was removed from thence in   0  and in   0  accepted a small place in a public office where he continued the remainder of his days  about this time contracting a friendship with a gentleman of a like taste who furnished him with proper books he applied himself at his intervals of leisure to reading the classics and to the study of logic metaphysics and the mathematics with which last he was peculiarly delighted and in a few years by the force of his own happy genius and unwearied diligence without the assistance of any master he acquired a considerable knowledge of the most difficult branches of those useful and entertaining studies  by so close an application he contracted a violent pain in his head which notwithstanding the best advice daily increased this and other unfortunate circumstances concurring so deeply affected him who had besides in his constitution a strong tincture of melancholy that he was at last brought under almost a total extinction of reason in this condition he fell into a fever and as there were before scarce any hopes of him it may be said to have happily put an end to the deplorable bondage of so bright a mind on the   st of december      in the   th year of his age he was buried in the church of friendsbury near rochester  mr needlers life was influenced by the principles of sincere unaffected piety and virtue  on all occasions says mr duncomb he was a strenuous advocate for universal toleration and forbearance in matters of religion rightly supposing that no service can be acceptable to the supreme being unless it proceeds from the heart and that force serves only to make hypocrites but adds no new lights to the understanding he was modest to a fault entertaining the most humble opinion of his own performances and was always ready to do justice to those of others his affection for his friends indeed sometimes biassed his judgment and led him to the commending their writings beyond their merit  in the volume of mr needlers works are printed some familiar letters upon moral and natural subjects they are written with elegance and taste the heart of a good man may be traced in them all and equally abound with pious notions as good sense and solid reasoning  he seems to have been very much master of smooth versification his subjects are happily chosen and there is a philosophical air runs through all his writings as an instance of this we shall present our readers with a copy of his verses addressed to sir richard blackmore on his poem entitled the creation dressed in the charms of wit and fancy long the muse has pleased us with her siren song but weak of reason and depraved of mind too often on vile ignoble themes we find the

field   john hughes william duncomb esquire has obliged the world with an entire edition of this authors poetical and prose works to which he has prefixed some account of his life written with candor and spirit upon his authority we chiefly build the following narration in which we shall endeavor to do as much justice as possible to the memory of this excellent poet  our author was the son of a worthy citizen of london and born at marlborough in the county of wilts on the   th of january      but received the rudiments of his learning at private schools in london  in the earliest years of his youth he applied himself with ardour to the pursuit of the sister arts poetry drawing and music in each of which by turns he made a considerable progress but for the most part pursued these and other polite studies only as agreeable amusements under frequent confinement from indisposition and a valetudinary state of health he had some time an employment in the office of ordinance and was secretary to two or three commissioners under the greatseal for purchasing lands for the better securing the docks and harbors at portsmouth chatham and harwich  in the year      the lord chancellor cowper to whom mr hughes was then but lately known was pleased without any previous solicitation to make him his secretary for the commissions of the peace and to distinguish him with singular marks of his favor and affection and upon his lordships laying down the greatseal he was at his particular recommendation and with the ready concurrence of his successor continued in the same employment under the earl of macclesfield  he held this place to the time of his decease which happened on the   th of february      the very night in which his tragedy entitled the siege of damascus was first acted at the theater royal in drury lane  he was cut off by a consumption after a painful life at the age of    when he had just arrived at an agreeable competence and advancing in fame and fortune so just is the beautiful reflection of milton in his lycidas fame is the spur that the clear spirit does raise that last infirmity of noble mind to scorn delights and live laborious days but the fair guerdon when we hope to find and think to burst out into sudden blaze comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears and slits the thinspun life    he was privately buried in the vault under the chancel of st andrews church in holborn  mr hughes as a testimony of gratitude to his noble friend and generous patron earl cowper gave his lordship a few weeks before he died his picture drawn by sir godfrey kneller which he himself had received from that masterly painter the value lord cowper set upon it will be best shown by the letter he wrote upon this occasion to mr hughes as such a testimony from so eminent a person was considered by himself as one of the highest honors he was capable of receiving we shall therefore insert it   th jan      0 sir i thank you for the most acceptable present of your picture and assure you that none of this age can set a higher value on it than i do and shall while i live though i am sensible posterity will outdo me in that particular  i am with the greatest esteem and sincerity your most affectionate and obliged humble servant cowper     mr hughes was happy in the acquaintance and friendship of several of the greatest men and most distinguished geniuss of the age in which he lived particularly of the nobleman just now mentioned the present lord bishop of winchester lord chief baron gilbert sir godfrey kneller mr congreve mr addison sir richard steel mr southern mr row etc and might have justly boasted in the words of horace  me cum magnis vixisse invita fatebitu usque invidia    having given this short account of his life which perhaps is all that is preserved any where concerning him we shall now consider him first as a poet and then as a prose writer  the triumph of peace was the earliest poem he wrote of any length that appeared in public it was written on occasion of the peace of ryswick and printed in the year      a learned gentleman at cambridge in a letter to a friend of mr hughess dated the   th of february       gives the following account of the favorable reception this poem met with there upon its first publication i think i never heard a poem read with so much admiration as the triumph of peace was by our best critics here nor a greater character given to a young poet at his first appearing no not even to mr congreve himself so nobly elevated are his thoughts his numbers so harmonious and his turns so fine and delicate that we cry out with tully on a like occasion  nostrae spes altera romae  the court of neptune was written on king williams return from holland two years after the peace in      this poem was admired for the versification however the musical flow of the numbers is its least praise it rather deserves to be valued for the propriety and boldness of the figures and metaphors and the machinery  the following lines have been justly quoted as an instance of the authors happy choice of metaphors as when the golden god who rules the day drives down his flaming chariot to the sea and leaves the nations here involved in night to distant regions he transports his light so williams rays by turns two nations cheer and when he sets to them he rises here   a friend of mr hughess soon after the publication of this poem complimented him upon the choice of his subject and for the moral sentiments contained in it i am sure says he virtue is most for the interest of mankind and those poets have ever obtained the most honor in the world who have made that the end and design of their works a wanton sappho or anacreon among the ancients never had the same applause as a pindar or alexis nor in the judgment of horace did they deserve it in the opinion of all posterity a lewd and debauched ovid did justly submit to the worth of a virgil and in future ages a dryden will never be compared to milton in all times and in all places of the world the moral poets have been ever the greatest and as much superior to others in wit as in virtue nor does this seem difficult to be accounted for since the dignity of their subjects naturally raised their ideas and gave a grandeur to their sentiments  the house of nassau a pindaric ode printed in   0  was occasioned by the death of king william in pindaric and lyric poetry says mr duncomb our authors genius shines in its full luster though he enjoyed all that fire of imagination and divine enthusiasm for which some of the ancient poets are so deservedly admired yet did his fancy never run away with his reason but was always guided by superior judgment and the music of his verse is exquisite  the translation of the third ode of the third book of horace and the paraphrase of the twentysecond ode of the first book were both written when he was very young and the latter of them was his first poetical essay which appeared in print mr hughes in a private letter sent to one of his friends gives it as his opinion that the odes of horace are fitter to be paraphrased than translated  the tenth book of lucan was translated by mr hughes long before mr row undertook that author the occasion of it was this mr tonson the bookseller solicited a translation of lucan by several hands mr hughes performed his part but others failing in their promises the design was dropped and mr row was afterward prevailed upon to undertake the whole which he performed with great success  in the year   0  mr hughes obliged the public with an elegant translation of molieres celebnatnd comedy the misantrope this has been since reprinted with the other plays of that admirable author translated by mr ozell but care is taken to distinguish this particular play  in the year      his opera of calypso and telemachus was performed at the queens theater in the haymarket perhaps it may be worth while to mention here one circumstance concerning this opera as it relates to the history of music in england and discovers the great partiality shnwn at that time to operas performed in italian after many such had been encouraged by large subscriptions this originally written and set in english after the italian manner was prepared with the usual expense of scenes and decorations and being much crowded and applauded at the rehearsals a subscription was obtained for it as usual  this alarmed the whole italian band who apprehending that their profession would suffer thereby procured an order from the duke of shrewsbury then lord chamberlain the day before the performing of this opera to take of the subscription for it and to open the house at the lowest prices or not at all this was designed to sink it but failed of its end it was performed though under such great discouragement and was revived afterward at the theater in lincolnsinnfields mr addison in the spectator numb  0  speaking of the just applause given this opera by signior nicolini who he says was the greatest performer in dramatic music that perhaps ever appeared upon a stage has these words the town is highly obliged to that excellent artist for having shown us the italian music in its perfection as well as for that generous approbation he gave to an opera of our own country in which mr galliard the composer endeavored to do justice to the beauty of the words by following that noble example which has been set him by the greatest foreign masters of that art    the ode to the creator of the world occasioned by the fragments of orpheus was printed in the year      at the particular instance of mr addison and is mentioned with applause in the spectator this and the ecstasy published since the death of the author are justly esteemed two of the noblest odes in our language the seventh stanza of the last mentioned piece is so sublimely excellent that it would be denying ourselves and our poetical readers a pleasure not to transcribe it the whole of this ode is beautifully heightened and poetically conceived it furnished a hint to a living poet to write what he entitles the excursion which though it has very great merit yet falls infinitely short of this animated ode of mr hughes  after having represented the natural and artificial calamities to which man is doomed he proceeds but why do i delay my flight or on such gloomy objects gaze i go to realms serene with everliving light haste clouds and whirlwinds haste a raptured bard to raise mount me sublime along the shining way where planets in pure streams of ether driven swim through the blue expanse of heaven and lo the obsequious clouds and winds obey and lo again the nations downward fly and widestretchd kingdoms perish from my eye heaven what bright visions now arise what opening worlds my ravished sense surprise i pass cerulian gulphs and now behold new solid globes their weight selfballancd bear unpropd amidst the fluid air and all around the central sun incircling eddies rolled unequal in their course see they advance and form the planetary dance here the pale moon whom the same laws ordain to obey the earth and rule the main here spots no more in shadowy streaks appear but lakes instead and groves of trees the wandering muse transported sees and their tall heads discovered mountains rear and now once more i downward cast my sight when lo the earth a larger moon displays far off amidst the heavens her silver face and to her sister moons by turns gives light her seas are shadowy spots her land a milky white   the author of an essay on criticism printed in the year      informs us that the tragedy of cato being brought upon the stage in      was owing to mr hughes the circumstances recorded by this author are so remarkable that they deserve to be related and as they serve to show the high opinion mr addison entertained of our authors abilities as a poet i shall therefore transcribe his own words  it has been often said by good judges that cato was no proper subject for a dramatic poem that the character of a stoic philosopher is inconsistent with the hurry and tumult of action and passions which are the soul of tragedy that the ingenious author miscarried in the plan of his work but supported it by the dignity the purity the beauty and justness of the sentiments this was so much the opinion of mr maynwaring who was generally allowed to be the best critic of our time that he was against bringing the play upon the stage and it lay by unfinished many years that it was played at last was owing to mr hughes he had read the four acts which were finished and really thought it would be of service to the public to have it represented at the latter end of queen annes reign when the spirit of liberty was likely to be lost he endeavored to bring mr addison into his opinion which he did and consented it should be acted if mr hughes would write the last act and he offered him the scenery for his assistance excusing his not finishing it himself upon account of some other avocations he pressed mr hughes to do it so earnestly that he was prevailed upon and set about it but a week after seeing mr addison again with an intention to communicate to him what he thought of it he was agreeably surprised at his producing some papers where near half of the act was written by the author himself who took fire at the hint that it would be serviceable and upon a second reflection went through with the fifth act not that he was diffident of mr hughess abilities but knowing that no man could have so perfect a notion of his design as himself who had been so long and so carefully thinking of it i was told this by mr hughes and i tell it to show that it was not for the lovescenes that mr addison consented to have his tragedy acted but to support public spirit which in the opinion of the author was then declining    in the year    0 the siege of damascus was acted at the theater royal in drury lane with universal applause his present majesty honored it with his presence and the late queen distinguished it with marks of favor  mr hughes drew up the dedication of this tragedy to the late earl cowper about ten days before he died it is indeed surprising that he should be able to form a piece so finely turned and at such an hour when death was just before him and he was too weak to transcribe it himself  mr pope in a letter to mr hughess brother written soon after his death in answer to one received from him with the printed copy of the play has the following pathetic passage i read over again your brothers play with more concern and sorrow than i ever felt in the reading any tragedy the real loss of a good man may be called a distress to the world and ought to affect us more than any feigned distress how well drawn soever i am glad of an occasion of giving you under my hand this testimony both how excellent i think this work to be and how excellent i thought the author    it is generally allowed that the characters in this play are finely varied and distinguished that the sentiments are just and well adapted to the characters that it abounds with beautiful descriptions apt allusions to the manners and opinions of the times where the scene is laid and with noble morals that the diction is pure unaffected and sublime and that the plot is conducted in a simple and clear manner  some critics have objected that there is not a sufficient ground and foundation for the distress in the fourth and fifth acts that phocyas only assists the enemy to take damascus a few days sooner than it must unavoidably have fallen into the hands of the saracens by a capitulation which was far from dishonorable if phocyas is guilty his guilt must consist in this only that he performed the same action from a sense of his own wrong and to preserve the idol of his soul from violation and death which he might have performed laudably upon better principles but this say they seems not sufficient ground for those strong and stinging reproaches he casts upon himself nor for eudocias rejecting him with so much severity it would have been a better ground of distress considering the frailty of human nature and the violent temptations he lay under if he had been at last prevailed upon to profess himself a mohammedan for then his remorse and selfcondemnation would have been natural his punishment just and the character of eudocia placed in a more amiable light in answer to these objections and in order to do justice to the judgment of mr hughes we must observe that he formed his play according to the plan here recommended but overpersuaded by some friends he altered it as it now stands  when our author was but in the nineteenth year of his age he wrote a tragedy entitled amalasont queen of the goths which displays a fertile genius and a masterly invention besides these poetical productions mr hughes is author of several works in prose particularly  the advices from parnassus and the poetical touchstone of trajano boccalini translated by several hands were printed in folio   0  this translation was revised and corrected and the preface to it was written by mr hughes  fontenelles dialogues of the dead translated by our author with two original dialogues published in the year   0  the greatest part of this had lain by him for six years  fontenelles discourse concerning the ancients and moderns are printed with his conversations with a lady on the plurality of worlds translated by glanville  the history of the revolutions in portugal written in french by monsieur labbe de vertot was translated by mr hughes  the translation of the letters of abelard and heloise was done by mr hughes upon which mr pope has built his beautiful epistle of heloise to abelard  as mr hughes was an occasional contributor to the tatler spectator and guardian the reader perhaps may be curious to know more particularly what share he had in those papers which are so justly admired in all places in the world where taste and genius have visited as it is the highest honor to have had any concern in works like these so it would be most injurious to the memory of this excellent genius not to particularize his share in them  in the tatler he writ vol ii numb    a letter signed josiah couplet numb    a letter against gamesters signed william trusty mr tickell alludes to this letter in a copy of verses addressed to the spectator vol vii no     from felon gamesters the raw squire is free and briton owes her rescued

vol   which contains remarks on the tragedy of othello    in the year      mr hughes published a very accurate edition of the works of our famous poet edmund spenser in six volumes   mo to this edition are prefixed the life of spenser an essay on allegorical poetry remarks on the fairy queen on the shepherds calendar and other writings of spenser and a glossary explaining the old and obsolete words  in      he published a piece called charon or the ferryboat a vision this and mr walshs aesculapius or hospital of fools are perhaps two of the finest dialogues we have in english as well as the most lively imitations of lucian  sir richard steel in a paper called the theater no    has paid a tribute to the memory of mr hughes with which as it illustrates his amiable character we shall conclude his life  i last night says he saw the siege of damascus and had the mortification to hear this evening that mr hughes the author of it departed this life within some few hours after his play was acted with universal applause this melancholy circumstance recalled into my thought a speech in the tragedy which very much affected the whole audience and was attended to with the greatest and most solemn instance of approbation and awful silence the incidents of the play plunge a heroic character into the last extremity and he is admonished by a tyrant commander to expect no mercy unless he changes the christian religion for the mohammedan the words with which the turkish general makes his exit from his prisoner are farewell and think of death upon which the captive breaks into the following soliloquy farewell and think of death  was it not so do murderers then preach morality but how to think of what the living know not and the dead cannot or else may not tell what art thou o thou great mysterious terror the way to thee we know diseases famine sword fire and all thy ever open gates that day and night stand ready to receive us but what beyond them who will draw that veil yet deaths not there  no it is a point of time the verge twixt mortal and immortal being it mocks our thought  on this side all is life and when we have reached it in that very instant it is past the thinking of  o if it be the pangs the throes the agonizing struggle when soul and body part sure i have felt it and there is no more to fear   the gentleman continues sir richard to whose memory i devote this paper may be the emulation of more persons of different talents than any one i have ever known his head hand or heart was always employed in something worthy imitation his pencil his bow string or his pen each of which he used in a masterly manner were always directed to raise and entertain his own mind or that of others to a more cheerful prosecution of what is noble and virtuous peace be with thy remains thou amiable spirit but i talk in the language of our weakness that is flown to the regions of immorality and relieved from the aching engine and painful instrument of anguish and sorrow in which for many tedious years he panted with a lively hope for his present condition we shall consign the trunk in which he was so long imprisoned to common earth with all that is due to the merit of its inhabitant there are several copies of verses written to the memory of mr hughes prefixed to mr duncombs edition of his poems of which one by a lady who has withheld her name deserves particular distinction   matthew prior esquire this celebrated poet was the son of mr george prior citizen of london who was by profession a joiner our author was born in      his father dying when he was very young left him to the care of an uncle a vintner near charing cross who discharged the trust that was reposed in him with a tenderness truly paternal as mr prior always acknowledged with the highest professions of gratitude he received part of his education at westminster school where he distinguished himself to great advantage but was afterward taken home by his uncle in order to be bred up to his trade notwithstanding this mean employment to which mr prior seemed now doomed yet at his leisure hours he prosecuted his study of the classics and especially his favorite horace by which means he was soon taken notice of by the polite company who resorted to his uncles house it happened one day that the earl of dorset being at his tavern which he often frequented with several gentlemen of rank the discourse turned upon the odes of horace and the company being divided in their sentiments about a passage in that poet one of the gentlemen said i find we are not like to agree in our criticisms but if i am not mistaken there is a young fellow in the house who is able to set us all right upon which he named prior who was immediately sent for and desired to give his opinion of horaces meaning in the ode under consideration this he did with great modesty and so much to the satisfaction of the company that the earl of dorset from that moment determined to remove him from the station in which he was to one more suited to his genius and accordingly procured him to be sent to st johns college in cambridge where he took his degree in      and afterward became fellow of the college  during his residence in the university he contracted an intimate friendship with charles montague esquire afterward earl of hallifax in conjunction with whom he wrote a very humorous piece entitled the hind and panther transversed to the story of the country mouse and the city mouse printed      in  to in answer to mr drydens hind and the panther published the year before  upon the revolution mr prior was brought to court by his great patron the earl of dorset by whose interest he was introduced to public employment and in the year    0 was made secretary to the earl of berkley plenipotnntiary to king william and queen mary at the congress at the hague  in this station he acquitted himself so well that he was afterward appointed secretary to the earls of pembroke and jersey and sir joseph williamson ambassadors and plenipotentiaries at the treaty of ryswick      as he was likewise in school to the earl of portland ambassador to the court of france while he was in that kingdom one of the officers of the french kings household showing him the royal apartments and curiosities at versailles especially the paintings of le brun wherein the victories of lewis xiv are described asked him whether king williams actions are to be seen in his palace no sir replied mr prior the monuments of my masters actions are to be seen every where but in his own house  in the year      mr prior was made secretary of state for ireland and in   00 was created master of arts by mandamus and appointed one of the lords commissioners of trade and plantanions upon the resignation of mr lock he was also member of parliament for eastgrinstead in sussex in    0 he was supposed to have had a share in writing the examiner and particularly a criticism in it upon a poem of dr garth to the earl of godolphin taken notice of in the life of garth  about this time when godolphin was defeated by oxford and the tories who had long been eclipsed by the luster of marlborough began again to hold up their heads mr prior and dr garth espoused opposite interests mr prior wrote for and garth against the court the dr was so far honest that he did not desert his patron in distress and notwithstanding the cloud which then hung upon the party he addressed verses to him which however they may fail in the poetry bear strong the marks of gratitude and honor  while mr prion was thus very early initiated in public business and continued in the hurry of affairs for many years it must appear not a little surprising that he should find sufficient opportunities to cultivate his poetical talents to the amazing height he raised them in his preface to his poems he says that poetry was only the product of his leisure hours that he had commonly business enough upon his hands and as he modestly adds was only a poet by accident but we must take the liberty of differing from him in the last particular for mr prior seems to have received from the muses at his nativity all the graces they could well bestow on their greatest favorite  we must not omit one instance in mr priors conduct which will appear very remarkable he was chosen a member of that parliament which impeached the partition treaty to which he himself had been secretary and though his share in that transaction was consequently very considerable yet he joined in the impeachment upon an honest principle of conviction that exceptionable measures attended it  the lord bolingbroke who notwithstanding many exceptions made both to his conduct and sentiments in other instances yet must be allowed to be an accomplished judge of fine talents entertained the highest esteem for mr prior on account of his shining abilities this noble lord in a letter dated september  0      addressed to mr prior while he was the queens minister and plenipotentiary at the court of france pays him the following compliment for gods sake matt hide the nakedness of thy country and give the best turn thy fertile brain will furnish thee with to the blunders of thy countrymen who are not much better politicians than the french are poets his lordship thus concludes his epistle it is near three of clock in the morning i have been hard at work all day and am not yet enough recovered to bear much fatigue excuse therefore the confusedness of this scroll which is only from harry to matt and not from the secretary to the minister adieu my pen is ready to drop out of my hand it being now three oclock in the morning believe that no man loves you better or is more faithfully yours etc bolingbroke  there are several other letters from bolingbroke to prior which were it necessary we might insert as evidences of his esteem for him but mr prior was in every respect so great a man that the esteem even of lord bolingbroke cannot add much to the luster of his reputation both as a statesman and a poet mr prior is represented by those who knew and have wrote concerning him as a gentleman who united the elegance and politeness of a court with the scholar and the man of genius this representation in general may be just yet it holds almost invariably true that they who have risen from low life still retain some traces of their original no cultivation no genius it seems is able entirely to surmount this there was one particular in which mr prior verified the old proverb  the same woman who could charm the waiter in a tavern still maintained her dominion over the ambassador at france the chloe of prior it seems was a woman in this station of life but he never forsook her in the height of his reputation hence we may observe that associations with women are the most lasting of all and that when an eminent station raises a man above many other acts of condescension a mistress will maintain her influence charm away the pride of greatness and make the hero who fights and the patriot who speaks for the liberty of his country a slave to her one would imagine however that this woman who was a butchers wife must either have been very handsome or have had something about her superior to people of her rank but it seems the case was otherwise and no better reason can be given for mr priors attachment to her but that she was his taste her husband suffered their intrigue to go on unmolested for he was proud even of such a connection as this with so great a man as prior a singular instance of good nature  in the year      mr prior was recalled from france and upon his arrival was taken up by a warrant from the house of commons shortly after which he underwent a very strict examination by a committee of the privy council his political friend lord bolingbroke foreseeing a storm took shelter in france and secured harry but lent poor matt in the lurch  on the  0th of june robert walpole esquire moved the house against him and on the   th mr prior was ordered into close custody and no person was admitted to see him without leave from the speaker for the particulars of this procedure of the parliament both against mr prior and many others concerned in the public transactions of the preceding reign we refer to the histories of that time in the year      an act of grace was passed in favor of those who had opposed the hanoverian succession as well as those who had been in open rebellion but mr prior was excepted out of it at the close of this year however he was discharged from his confinement and retired to spend the residue of his days at downhall in essex  the severe usage which mr prior met with perhaps was the occasion of the following beautiful lines addressed to his chloe from public noise and factious strife from all the busy ills of life take me my chloe to thy breast and lull my wearied soul to rest for ever in this humble cell let thee and i my fair one dwell none enter else but love  and he shall bar the door and keep the key to painted roofs and shining spires uneasy seats of high desires let the unthinking many crowd that dare be covetous and proud in golden bondage let them wait and barter happiness for state but oh my chloe when thy swain desires to see a court again may heaven around his destined head the choicest of his curses shed to sum up all the rage of fate in the two things i dread and hate may thou be false and i be great   in july      within two months of his death mr prior published the following beautiful little tale on the falsehood of mankind entitled the conversation and applied it to the truth honor and justice of his grace the duke of dorset the conversation a tale it always has been thought discreet to know the company you meet and sure there may be secret danger in talking much before a stranger agreed what then then drink your ale i will pledge you and repeat my tale no matter where the scene is fixed the persons were but odly mixed when sober damon thus began and damon is a clever man i now grow old but still from youth have held for modesty and truth the men who by these seamarks steer in lifes great voyage never err upon this point i dare defy the world i pause for a reply sir either is a good assistant said one who sat a little distant truth decks our

turned to spit chance often helps us more than wit the other that lucky moment took just nicked the time broke in and spoke of all the gifts the gods afford if we may take old tullys word the greatest is a friend whose love knows how to praise and when reprove from such a treasure never part but hang the jewel on your heart and pray sir it delights me tell you know this author mighty well  know him do you question it ods fish sir does a beggar know his dish i loved him as i told you i advised him  here a standerby  damon gently by the cloak and thus unwilling silence broke damon it is time we should retire the man you talk with is matt prior patron through life and from thy birth my friend dorset to thee this fable let me send with damons lightness weigh thy solid worth the ll is known to set the diamond forth let the feigned tale this real moral give how many damons how few dorsets live   mr prior after the fatigue of a length of years past in various services of action was desirous of spending the remainder of his days in rural tranquillity which the greatest men of all ages have been fond of enjoying he was so happy as to succeed in his wish living a very retired and contemplative life at downnall in essex and found as he expressed himself a more solid and innocent satisfaction among woods and meadows than he had enjoyed in the hurry and tumults of the world the courts of princes or the conducting foreign negotiations and where as he melodiously sings the remnant of his days he safely past nor found they laggd too slow nor flew too fast he made his wish with his estate comply joyful to live yet not afraid to die   this great man died on the   th of september      at wimple in cambridgshire the seat of the earl of oxford with whose friendship he had been honored for some years the death of so distinguished a person was justly esteemed an irreparable loss to the polite world and his memory will be ever dear to those who have any relish for the muses in their softer charms some of the latter part of his life was employed in collecting materials for an history of the transactions of his own times but his death unfortunately deprived the world of what the touches of so masterly a hand would have made exceeding valuable  mr prior by the suffrage of all men of taste holds the first rank in poetry for the delicacy of his numbers the wittiness of his turns the acuteness of his remarks and in one performance for the amazing force of his sentiments the style of our author is likewise so pure that our language knows no higher authority and there is an air of original in his minutest performances  it would be superfluous to give any detail of his poems they are in the hands of all who love poetry and have been as often admired as read the performance however for which he is most distinguished is his solomon a poem in three books the first on knowledge the second on pleasure and the third on power we know few poems to which this is second and it justly established his reputation as one of the best writers of his age  this sublime work begins thus ye sons of men with just regard attend observe the preacher and believe the friend whose serious muse inspires him to explain that all we act and all we think is vain that in this pilgrimage of seventy years over rocks of perils and through vales of tears destined to march our doubtful steps we tend tired of the toil yet fearful of its end that from the womb we take our fatal shares of follies fashions labors tumults cares and at approach of death shall only know the truths which from these pensive numbers flow that we pursue false joy and suffer real woe   after an enquiry into and an excellent description of the various operations and effects of nature the system of the heavens etc and not being fully informed of them the first book concludes how narrow limits were to wisdom given earth she surveys she thence would measure heaven through mists obscure now wings her tedious way now wanders dazzled with too bright a day and from the summit of a pathless coast sees infinite and in that fight is lost   in the second book the uncertainty disappointment and vexation attending pleasure in general are admirably described and in the character of solomon is sufficiently shown that nothing debases majesty or indeed any man more than ungovernable passion when thus the gathering storms of wretched love in my swollen bosom with long war had strove at length they broke their bounds at length their force bore down whatever met its stronger course laid all the civil bounds of manhood waste and scattered ruin as the torrent past   the third book treats particularly of the trouble and instability of greatness and power considers man through the several stages and conditions of life and has excellent reasoning upon life and death on the last are these lines cure of the misers wish and cowards fear death only shows us what we knew was near with courage therefore view the pointed hour dread not deaths anger but expect its power nor natures laws with fruitless sorrow mourn but die o mortal man for thou wast born   the poet has likewise these similies on life as smoke that rises from the kindling fires is seen this moment and the next expires as empty clouds by rising winds are tossed their fleeting forms no sooner found than lost so vanishes our state so pass our days so life but opens now and now decays the cradle and the tomb alas so nigh to live is scarce distinguished from to die   we shall conclude this account of mr priors life with the following copy of verses written on his death by robert ingram esquire which is a very successful imitation of mr priors manner   mat prior  and we must submit is at his journeys end in whom the world

about four years he went to dublin where his father resided at which university he immediately commenced bachelor of arts when he was of due standing his diploma for the degree of doctor of divinity was on account of his uncommon merit presented to him from that university while he was in england and brought over by dr pratt then senior travellingfellow afterward provost of that college his first ceclesiastical preferment was to a prebend in the cathedral of st barrys in the city of cork to which he was collated by bishop wettenhal to whom he was domestic chaplain he was a zenous promotnr of the revolution and suffered for it in consequence of his zeal in    0 when the troubles broke out in ireland by his interest with king jamess general mac carty he thrice prevented the burning of bandon town after three several orders given by that prince to destroy it the same year having been deputed by the people of bandon he went over to england to petition the parliament for a redress of some grievances they had suffered while king james was in ireland during his stay here and to the time of his death he was in the highest esteem among all ranks of persons in this kingdom for his eminent attachment to the true interest of his country having quitted his preferments in ireland he settled in london where he being celebrated for his abilities in the pulpit was elected minister of st catherinecree church and lecturer of st michaels woodstreet he afterward became minister of richmond in surry and stratford upon avon in warwickshire and at length rector of clapham in the county

and no inconsiderable poet  his compositions in poetry are chiefly these    a new version of the psalms of david performed by him in conjunction with mr tate soon after he settled in london now sung in most churches of england and ireland instead of that obsolete and ridiculous version made by sternhold and hopkins in the reign of king edward vi as the  0 th psalm is esteemed one of the most sublime in the whole book we shall present the reader with the two first parts of his version of that psalm as a specimen there have not been less than forty differnt versons and paraphrases of this psalm by po of very considerable eminence who seem to have vied with one another for the superiority of all these attempts if we may tru our own judgment none have succeeded so happily as mr blackcock a young gentleman now resident at dumfries in scotland this paraphrase is the more extraordinary as the author of it has been blind from his cradle and now labors under that calamity it carries in it such elevated strains of poetry such picturesque descriptions and such a mellifluent flow of numbers that we are persuaded the reader cannot be displeased at finding it inserted here  dr brady also

george stepney esquire this poet was descended of the family of the stepneys of pindigrast in pembrokeshire but born in westminster in the year      he received the rudiments of his education in westminster school and after making some progress in literature there he was removed to trinity college in cambridge where he was cotemporary with charles montague esquire afterward earl of hallifax and being of the same college with him a very strict friendship was contracted between them to this lucky accident of being early known to mr montague was owing all the preferment mr stepney afterward enjoyed for he seems not to have had parts sufficienn to have risen to any distinction without the immediate patronage of so great a man as the lord hallifax when stepney first set out in life he was perhaps attached to the tory interest for one of the first poems he wrote was an address to king james the second on his accession to the throne in this little piece in which there is as little poetry he compares that monarch to hercules but with what propriety let the reader judge soon after the accession of james ii when monmouths rebeliion broke out the university of cambridge to demonstrate their zeal for the king thought proper to burn the picture of that rash prince who had formerly been their chancellor upon this occasion stepney wrote some good verses in answer to this question   sed quid turba remi sequitur fortunam ut semper et odit damnatos   upon the revolution he embraced another interest and procured himself to be nominated for several foreign embassies in the year      he went to the elector of brandenburghs court in quality of envoy and in the year following to the imperial court in the same character in      he was sent to the elector of saxony and two years after to the electors of mentz cologn etc and the congress at francfort he was employed in several other embassies and in the year   0  queen anne sent him envoy to the states general he was very successful in his negotiations which occasioned his constant employment in the most weighty affairs at his leisure hours he composed several other pieces of poetry besides those already mentioned which are chiefly these an epistle to the earl of hallifax on his majestys voyage to holland a translation of the eighth satire of juvenal to the earl of carlisle upon the death of his son some imitations of horaces odes the austrian eagle the nature of dreams a poem to the memory of queen mary   these performances are not very long nor are the subjects upon which they are written very considerable it seems probable that the eminence to which stepney rose must have been more owing to some personal kindness lord hallifax had for him than to his merit as a writer in raising stepney his lordship might act as the friend of the man but not as a patron of the poet friendship in many respects participates of the nature of love it begins we know not how it strengthens by imperceptible degrees and grows into an established firmness such might be the regard lord hallifax had for stepney but we may venture to assert from his lordships exquisite taste in poetry that he never could highly admire the pretty trifles which compose the works of this author and which are printed amongst the works of the minor poets published some years ago by mr tonson in two volumes   mo and likewise of another work of the same kind in two volumes also published by one cogan   our author died at chelsea in the year   0  and was buried in westminsterabbey where a fine monument is erected over him with the following inscription upon the pedestal h s e gulielmi and annae on the left hand g s  on the right hand is a particular account of all his employments abroad  as a specimen of mr stepneys poetry we shall quote the following lines on the nature of dreams at dead of night imperial reason sleeps and fancy with her train loose revels keeps then airy phantoms a mixed scene display of what we heard or saw or wished by day for memory those images retains which passion formed and still the strongest reigns huntsmen renew the chase they lately run and generals fight again their battles won specter and furies haunt the murthrers dreams grants or disgraces are the courtiers themes the miser spies a thief or some new hoard the cits a knight the sycophant a lord thus fancys in the wild distraction lost with what we most abhor or covet most but of all passions that our dreams control love prints the deepest image in the soul for vigorous fancy and warm blood dispense pleasures so lively that they rival sense such are the transports of a willing maid not yet by time and place to act betrayed whom spies or some faint virtue force to fly that scene of joy which yet she dies to try till fancy bawds and by mysterious charms brings the dear object to her longing arms unguarded then she melts acts fierce delight and curses the returns of envious light in such blessed dreams biblis enjoys a flame which waking she detests and dares not name ixion gives a loose to his wild love and in his airy visions cuckolds jove honors and state before this phantom fall for sleep like death its image equals all   our author likewise wrote some political pieces in prose particularly and essay on the present interest of england   0  to which are added the proceedings of the house of commons in      upon the french kings progress in flanders this piece is reprinted in cogans collection of tracts called lord somerss collection  major richardson pack this gentleman was the son of john pack of stockeash in suffolk esquire who in the year      was high sheriff of that county he had his early education at a private country school and was removed from thence to merchant taylors where he received his first taste of letters for he always reckoned that time which he spent at the former school as lost since he had only contracted bad habits and was obliged to unlearn what had been taught him there  at the age of sixteen he was removed to st johns college in oxford about eighteen his father entered him of the middle temple designing him for the profession of the law and by the peculiar indulgence of the treasurer and benchers of that honorable society he was at eight terms standing admitted barrister when he had not much exceeded the age of  0 but a sedentary studious life agreeing as ill with his health as a formal one with his inclinations he did not long pursue those studies after some wavering in his thoughts he at last determined his views to the army as being better suited to the gaiety of his temper and the sprightliness of his genius and where he hoped to meet with more freedom as well as more action his first command was that of a company of foot in march   0   in november    0 the regiment in which he served was one of those two of english foot that were with the marshal staremberg at the battle of villa viciosa the day after general stanhope and the troops under his command were taken at brighuega vide jacobs lives  where the major being killed and our authors behavior being equal to the occasion on which he acted his grace the duke of argyle confirmed his pretensions to that vacancy by giving him the commission of the deceased major immediately on his arrival in spain it was this accident which first introduced our gallant soldier to the acquaintance of that truly noble and excellent person with whose protection and patronage he was honored during the remaining part of his life  the ambition he had to celebrate his graces heroic virtues at a time when there subsisted a jealousy between him and the duke of marlborough and it was fashionable by a certain party to traduce him gave birth to some of the best of his performances  what other pieces the major has written in verse are for the most part the unlaboured result of friendship or love and the amusement of those few solitary intervals in a life that seldom wanted either serious business or social pleasures of one kind or other entirely to fill up the circle they are all published in one volume together with a translation of the life of miltiades and cymon from cornelius nepos the first edition was in       the most considerable of them are the following   the muses choice or the progress of wit   on friendship to colonel stanhope   to mr addison occasioned by the news of the

an ancient and honorable family in the county of essex he was educated at merchanttaylors school london and from thence elected to st johns college in oxford of which he was afterward fellow  he was the youngest of four brothers three of whom dying young the title and estate of the family fell to him as soon as he had taken his first degree in arts and upon the family estate devolving to him he resigned his fellowship and left oxford for some time he gave his attention to the affairs of his estate but finding his inclination lead him more to study than rural affairs he entered into holy orders sir william did not long remain in the church without preferment his fortune and family assisted him to rise for it often happens that these advantages will do much more for a man as well in the ecclesiastical as in other classes of life than the brightest parts without them before he was promoted to the mitre he was made master of catherine hall in cambridge chaplain to queen anne and

anatomy of atheism a poem dedicated to sir george darcy bart printed in the year   0   vo  the design of this piece as his lordship declares in the preface is to expose the folly of those men who are arrived at that pitch of impudence and profaneness that they think it a piece of wit to deny the being of a god and to laugh at that which they cannot argue against such characters are well described in the following lines see then our atheist all the world oppose and like drawcansir make all men his foes see with what saucy pride he does pretend his miser fathers nations to amend huffs plutarch plato pliny seneca and bids even cicero himself give way tells all the world they follow a false light and he alone of all mankind is right thus like a madman who when all alone thinks himself king

equal luster in him he was esteemed in his time a very popular preacher his piety was great and conspicuous his charity and benevolence equalled by few and his good nature and humanity the most extensive  our author died in the   d year of his age april  0      we have no account of any other of his graces poetical works probably the business of his high station diverted his mind from the

lives of the poets has informed us that he had the advice and assistance of mr congreve in that work who communicated to him many particulars of the lives of cotemporary writers as well as of himself and as mr congreve can hardly be thought ignorant of the place of his own birth and mr jacob has asserted it to be in england no room is left to doubt of it the learned antiquary of ireland sir james ware has reckoned our author amongst his own country worthies from the relation of southern but mr congreves own account if jacob may be relied on is more than equal to that of southern who possibly might be mistaken  about the year      or      our author was born and his father carried him when a child into ireland where he then had a command in the army but afterward was entrusted with the management of a considerable estate belonging to the noble family of burlington which fixed his residence there wilsons memoirs of congreve  mr congreve received the first tincture of letters in the great school of kilkenny and according to common report gave early proofs of a poetical genius his first attempt in poetry was a copy of verses on the death of his masters magnye  he went from the school of kilkenny to the university of dublin where under the direction of dr george ash he acquired a general knowledge of the classics his father who was desirous that his studies should be directed to a profitable employment sent him over to england a little after the revolution and placed him as a studnnt in the middle temple but the severe study of the law was so ill adapted to the sprightly genius of congreve that he never attempted to reconcile himself to a way of life for which he had the greatest aversion but however he disappointed his friends with respect to the proficiency they expected him to make in the law yet it is certain he was not negligent in those studies to which his genius led him  mr congreves first performance written when bnt a youth of seventeen was a novel dedicated to mrs katherine i eveson which gave proof not only of a great vivacity of wit but also a fluency of style and a solid judgment he was conscious that young men in their early productions generally aimed at a florid style and enthusiastic descriptions without any regard to the plot fable or subserviency of the parts for this reason he formed a new model and gave an example how works of that kind should be written he pursued a regular plan observed a general moral and carried on a connection as well as distinction between his characters  this performance is entitled incognita or love and duty reconciled it has been asserted that this is a real history and though the scene is laid in italy the adventures happened in england it is not our business to enter into the secret history of this entertaining piece or to attempt giving the reader a key to what the writer took so much pains to conceal it appears from this piece that mr congreve aimed at perfection from the very beginning and his design in writing this novel was to show how novels ought to be written let us hear what he says himself and from thence we shall entertain a higher opinion of his abilities than could possibly be raised by the warmest commendations after very judiciously observing that there is the same relation between romances and novels as between tragedy and comedy he proceeds thus since all traditions must indisputably give glace to the drama and since there is no possibility of giving that life to the writing or repetition of a story which it has in the action i resolved in another beauty to imitate dramatic writing namely in the design contexture and result in the plot i have not observed it before in a novel some i have seen begin with an unexpected accident which has been the only surprising part of the story cause enough to make the sequel look flat tedious and insipid for it is but reasonable the reader should expect if not to rise at least to keep upon a level in the entertainment for so he may be kept on in hopes that some time or other it may mend but the other is such a baulk to a man it is carrying him up stairs to show him the dining room and afterward force him to make a meal in the kitchen this i have not only endeavored to avoid but also have used a method for the contrary purpose the design of this novel is obvious after the first meeting of aurelian and hippolito with incognita and leonora the difficulty is in bringing it to pass maugre all apparent obstacles within the compass of two days how many probable casualties intervene in opposition to the main design viz of marrying two couple so oddly engaged in an intricare amor i leave the reader at his leisure to consider as also whether every obstacle does not in the progress of the story act as subservient to that purpose which at first it seems to oppose in a comedy this would be called the unity of action here it may pretend to no more than an unity of contrivance the scene is continued in florence from the commencement of the amor and the time from first to last is but three days  soon after mr congreves return to england he amused himself during a slow recovery from a fit of sickness with writing a comedy captain southern in conjunction with mr dryden and arthur manwayring esquire revised this performance which was the old bachelor of which mr dryden said he never saw such a first play in his life adding that the author not being acquainted with the stage or the town it would be pity to have it miscarry for want of a little assistance mr thomas davenant who had then the direction of the theater royal in drury lane had so high a sense of the merit of the piece and was so charmed with the authors conversation that he granted him the freedom of the house before his play came on which according to the maxims of theatrical government was not only an unusual but an unprecedented favor in      the old bachelor was acted before a numerous and polite audience the play was received with such general applause that mr congreve was then considered as a prop to the declining stage and a rising genius in dramatic poetry it was this play and the singular success which attended it upon the stage that introduced our author to the acquaintance of the earl of hallifax who was then the professed patron of men of wit and who being desirous to raise a man of so promising a genius above the necessity of too hasty productions made him one of the commissioners for licensing hackney coaches the earl bestowed upon him soon after a place in the pipeoffice and gave him likewise a post in the customhouse to the value of  00 l per annum  in the following year mr congreve brought upon the stage the double dealer which met not with so good a reception as the former  mr congreve has informed us in the dedication of this play to charles montague esquire that he was very assiduous to learn from the critics what objections could be found to it but says he i have heard nothing to provoke an answer that which looks most like an objection does not relate in particular to this play but to all or most that ever have been written and that is soliloquy therefore i will answer it not only for my own sake but to save others the trouble to whom it may be hereafter objected i grant that for a man to talk to himself appears absurd and unnatural and indeed it is so in most cases but the circumstances which may attend the occasion makes great alteration it often happens to a man to have designs which require him to himself and in their nature cannot admit of a confident such for certain is all villainy and other less mischievous intentions may be very improper to be communicated to a second person in such a case therefore the audience must observe whether the person upon the stage takes any notice of them at all or no for if he supposes any one to be by yet maskwell purposely talks to himself designing to be overheard  touchwood undoubtedly an error in the conduct and went of art in the author this he seems here to forget or would not remember it when he talks to himself it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree nay not only in this case but in any part of a play if there is expressed any knowledge of an audience it is insufferable but otherwise when a man in a soliloquy reasons with himself and pros and cons and weighs all his designs we ought not to imagine that this man either talks to us or to himself he is only thinking and thinking such matter as it were inexcusable folly in him to speak but because we are concealed spectators of the plot in agitation and the poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole mystery of his contrivance he is willing to inform us of this persons thoughts and to that end is forced to make use of the expedient of speech no other or better way being yet invented for the communication of thought  toward the close of the same year queen mary died upon that occasion mr congreve produced an elegiac pastoral a composition which the admirers of this poet have extolled in the most lavish terms of admiration but which seems not to merit the ncense it obtained  when mr betterton opened the new house at lincolns end congreve took part with him and gave him his celebrated comedy of love for love then introduced upon the stage with the most extraordinary success this comedy with some more of our authors was smartly criticized by the ngenious mr collier as containing lessons of immorality and a representation of loose characters which can never in his opinion appear on a stage without corrupting the audience  messrs congreve dennis and dryden engaged in a vigorous defense of the english stage and endeavored to show the necessity of such characters being introduced in order to be exposed and laughed at to all their defenses mr collier replied and managed the point with so much learning wit and keenness that in the opinion of many he had the better of his antagonists especially mr congreve whose comedies it must be owned though they are admirably written and the characters strongly marked are so loose that they have given great offense and surely we pay too dear for pleasure when we have it at the expense of morality  the same year he distinguished himself in another kind of poetry viz an irregular ode on the taking namure which the critics have allowed to contain fine sentiments gracefully expressed his reputation as a comic poet being sufficiently established he was desirous of extending his fame by producing a tragedy it has been alleged that some who were jealous of his growing reputation put him upon this task in order as they imagined to diminish it for he seemed to be of too gay and lively a disposition for tragedy and in all likelihood would miscarry in the attempt however  in      after the expectation of the town had been much raised the mourning bride appeared on the new theater in lincolnsinnfields few plays ever excited so great an ardour of expectation as this and very few ever succeeded to such an extravagant degree there is something new in the management of the plot after moving the passions of the audience to the greatest commiseration he brings off his principal characters purishes the guilty and makes the play conclude happily  the controversy we have just now mentioned was thought to have occasioned a dislike in mr congreve toward the stage yet he afterward produced another comedy called the way of the world which was so just a picture of the world that as an author prettily says the world could not bear it  the reception this play met with completed our authors disgust to the theater upon which mr dennis who was a warm friend to congreve made this fine observation that mr congreve quitted the stage early and that comedy left it with him  it is said that when congreve found his play met with but indifferent success he came in a passion on the stage and desired the audience to save themselves the trouble of showing their dislike for he never intended to write again for the theater nor submit his works to the censure of impotent critics in this particular he kept his word with them and as if he had foreseen the fate of his play he took an ample revenge in his epilogue of the race of little snarlers who excited by envy and supported by false ideas of their own importance dared to constitute themselves judges of wit without any just pretensions to it this play has long ago triumphed over its enemies and is now in great esteem amongst the best judges of theatrical entertainments  though mr congreve quitted the stage yet did not he give up the cause of poetry for on the death of the marquis of blandford the only son of the duke of marlborough which happened in   0  we find him composing a pastoral to soften the grief of that illustrious family which he addressed to the lord treasurer godolphin  about the same time the extraordinary success of the duke of marlboroughs arms furnished him with materials for an ode to queen anne in another pindaric ode he celebrates the lord godolphin taking occasion from that noblemans delight in horseracing to imitate the greek poet in his favorite manner of writing by an elegant digression to which he added a criticism on that species of poetry  as in the early part of his life mr congreve had received favors from people of a less exalted station so of these he was highly sensible and never let slip any opportunity of showing his gratitude he wrote an epilogue to his old friend southerns tragedy of oroonoko and mr dryden has acknowledged his assistance in the translation of virgil he contributed by his version of the eleventh satire of juvenal to the translation of that poet published also by mr dryden to whom mr congreve wrote a copy of verses on his translation of persius he wrote likewise a prologue for a play of mr charles drydens full of kindness for that young gentleman and of respect for his father  but the noblest testimony he gave of his filial regard to the memory of his poetical father mr john dryden was the panegyric he wrote upon his works contained in the dedication of drydens plays to the duke of newcastle  mr congreve translated the third book of ovids art of love some favorite passages from the iliad and writ some epigrams in all which he was not unsuccessful though at the same time he has been exceeded by his cotemporaries in the same attempts  the author of the elegant letters not long ago published under the name of fitz osborne has taken some pains to set before his readers the version of those parts of homer translated by our author and the same passages by pope and tickell in which comparison the palm is very deservedly yielded to pope  our author wrote a satire called doris celebrated by sir richard steel who was a warm friend to mr congreve he also wrote the judgment of paris a masque and the opera of semele of these the former was acted with great applause and the latter is finely set to music by mr eccles the last of his poetical works is his art of pleasing addressed to sir richard temple the late viscount cobham he has written many prose epistles dispersed in the works of other writers and his essay on humor in comedy published in a collection of denniss letters is an entertaining and correct piece of criticism all his other letters are written with a great deal of wit and spirit a fine flow of language and are so happily intermixed with a lively and inoffensive raillery that it is impossible not to be pleased with them at the first reading we may be satisfied from the perusal of them that his conversation must have been very engaging and therefore we need not wonder that he was caressed by the greatest men of his time or that they courted his friendship by every act of kindness in their power  it is said of mr congreve that he was a particular favorite with the ladies some of whom were of the first distinction he indulged none of those reveries and affected absences so peculiar to men of wit he was sprightly as well as elegant in his manner and so much the favorite of henrietta duchess of marlborough that even after his death she caused an image of him to be every day placed at her toilettable to which she would talk as to the living mr congreve with all the freedom of the most polite and unreserved conversation mrs bracegirdle likewise had the highest veneration for our author and joined with her grace in a boundless profusion of sorrow upon his death some think he had made a better figure in his last will had he remembered his friendship he professed for mrs bracegirdle whose admirable performance added spirit to his dramatic pieces but he forgot her and gratified his vanity by choosing to make a rich duchess his sole legatee and executrix  mr congreve was the son of fortune as well as of the muses he was early preferred to an affluent situation and no change of ministry ever affected him nor was he ever removed from any post he enjoyed except to a better  his place in the customhouse and his office of secretary in jamaica are said to have brought him in upwards of   00 l a year and he was so far an oeconomist as to raise from thence a competent estate no man of his learning ever passed through life with more ease or less envy and as in the dawn of his reputation he was very dear to the greatest wits of his time so during his whole life he preserved the utmost respect of and received continual marks of esteem from men of genius and letters without ever being involved in any of their quarrels or drawing upon himself the least mark of distaste or even dissatisfaction the greatest part of the last twenty years of his life were spent in ease and retirement and he gave himself no trouble about reputation when the celebrated voltaire was in england he waited upon congreve and passed some compliments upon him as to the reputation and merit of his works congreve thanked him but at the same time told that ingenious foreigner he did not choose to be considered as an author but only as a private gentleman and in that light expected to be visited voltaire answered that if he had never been any thing but a private gentleman in all probability he had never been troubled with that visit  mr voltaire upon this occasion observes that he was not a little disgusted with so unseasonable a piece of vanity  this was indeed the highest instance of it that perhaps can be produced a man who owed to his wit and writings the reputation as well as the fortune he acquired pretending to divest himself of human nature to such a degree as to have no consciousness of his own merit was the most absurd piece of vanity that ever entered into the heart of man and of all vanity that is the greatest which masks itself under the appearance of the opposite quality  toward the close of his life he was much troubled with the gout and for this reason in the summer of the year      he made a tour to bath for the benefit of the waters where he had the misfortune to be overturned in his chariot from which time he complained of a pain in his side which was supposed to arise from some inward bruise upon his return to london he perceived his health gradually decline which he bore with fortitude and resignation  on january the   th       he yielded his last breath about five oclock in the morning at his house in surreystreet in the strand in the fiftyseventh year of his age on the sunday following january    his corpse lay in state in the jerusalemchamber from whence the same evening between the hours of nine and ten it was carried with great decency and solemnity to henry the viiths chapel and after the funeral service was performed it was interred in the abbey the pall was supported by the duke of bridgewater earl of godolphin lord cobham lord wilmington the honorable george berkley esquire and brigadiergeneral churchill and colonel congreve followed his corpse as chief mourner some time after a neat and elegant monument was erected to his memory by henrietta duchess of marlborough  mr congreves reputation is so extensive and his works so generally read that any specimen of his poetry may be deemed superfluous but finding an epistle of our authors in the biographia brittannica not inserted in his works it may not be improper to give it a place here it is addressed to the lord viscount cobham and the ingenious authors inform us that they copied it from a ms very correct  as in this poem there is a visible allusion to the measures which the writer thought were too complaisant to the french it is evident it must have been penned but a very small time before his death of improving the present time sincerest critic of my prose or rhyme tell how thy pleasing stowe employs thy time say cobham what amuses thy retreat or stratagems of war or schemes of state do thou recall to mind with joy or grief

pen the luster of her sword or do thou give the winds a far to blow each vexing thought and heartdevouring woe and fix thy mind alone on rural scenes to turn the levelled lawns to liquid plains to raise the creeping rills from humble beds and force the latent springs to lift their heads on watery columns capitals to rear that mix their flowing curls with upper air or do thou weary grown late

with those of our forefathers days for virtue now is neither more or less and vice is only varied in the dress believe it men have ever been the same and ovids golden age is but a dream   we shall conclude the life of this eminent wit with the testimony of mr pope in his favor from the close of his postscript to the translation of homer it is in every respect so honorable that it would be injurious to mr congreve to omit it  his words are  instead of endeavoring to raise a vain monument to myself let me leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable men as well as the finest writers of my age and country one who has tried and knows by his own experience how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to homer and one who i am sure sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my labors to him therefore having brought this long work to a conclusion i desire to dedicate it and have the honor and satisfaction of placing together in this manner the names of mr congreve and of a pope    sir john vanbrugh this gentleman was descended from an ancient family in cheshire which came originally from france though by the name it would appear to be of dutch extraction he received a very liberal education and became eminent for his poetry and skill in architecture to both which he discovered an early propension it is somewhat remarkable in the history of poetry that when the spirit of tragedy in a great measure declined when otway and lee were dead and dryden was approaching to old age that comedy should then begin to flourish at an era which one would not have expected to prove auspicious to the cause of mirth  much about the same time rose mr congreve and sir john vanbrugh who without any invidious reflection on the genius of others gave a new life to the stage and restored it to reputation which before their appearance had been for some time sinking happy would it have been for the world and some advantage to the memory of these comic writers if they had discovered their wit without any mixture of that licentiousness which while it pleased tended to corrupt the audience  the first step our author made into life was in the character of an ensign in the army he was possessed of a very ready wit and an agreeable elocution he happened somewhere in his winter quarters to contract an acquaintance with sir thomas skipwith and received a particular obligation from him he had very early discovered a taste for dramatic writing to improve which he made some attempts in that way and had the draft or outlines of two plays lying by him at the time his acquaintance commenced with sir thomas this gentleman possessed a large share in a theatrical patent though he very little concerned himself in the conduct of it but that he might not appear altogether remiss he thought to procure some advantage to the stage by having our authors play called the relapse to be acted upon it in this he was not disappointed for the relapse succeeded beyond the warmest expectation and raised vanbrughs name very high amongst the writers for the stage  though this play met with greater applause than the author expected yet it was not without its enemies these were people of the graver sort who blamed the looseness of the scenes and the unguarded freedom of the dialect these complaints induced vanbrugh to make some observations upon them in his preface which he thus begins to go about to excuse half the defects this abortive brat is come into the world with would be to provoke the town with a long useless preface when it is i doubt sufficiently sourd already by a tedious play i do therefore with all the humility of a repenting sinner confess it wants every thing  but length and in that i hope the severest critics will be pleased to acknowledge i have not been wanting but my modesty will sure atone for every thing when the world shall know it is so great i am even to this day insensible of those two shining graces in the play which some part of the town is pleased to compliment me with blasphemy and bawdy for my part i cannot find them out if there were any obscene expressions upon the stage here they are in print for i have dealt fairly i have not sunk a syllable that could be ranged under that head and yet i believe with a steady faith there is not one woman of real reputation in town but when she has read it impartially over in her closet will find it so innocent she will think it no affront to her prayer book to lay it upon the same shelf    being encouraged by the success of the relapse he yielded to the solicitation of lord hallifax who had read some of the loose sheets of his provoked wife to finish that piece and after throwing them into a proper form gave the play to the theater in lincolnsinnfields though sir john had a greater inclination to serve the other company yet the request of lord hallifax so eminent a patron of the poets could not be resisted sir thomas skipwith was not offended at so reasonable a compliance and the provoked wife was acted school with success some critics likewise objected against this as a loose performance and that it taught the married women how to revenge themselves on their husbands who should offend them  the play has indeed this moral that such husbands as resemble sir john brute may expect that neglected beauty and abused virtue may be provoked to yield to the motives of revenge and that the forcible solicitations of an agreeable person who not only demonstrates a value but a passion for what the possessor slights may be sufficiently prevalent with an injured wife to forfeit her honor  though this event may often fall out that the brutality of a husband produces the insidelity of a wife yet it need not be shown upon the stage women are not generally so tame in their natures to bear neglect with patience and the natural resentments of the human heart will without any other monitor point out the method of revenge besides every husband ought not to be deemed a brute because a too delicate or ceremonious wife shall in the abundance of her caprice bestow upon him that appellation many women who have beheld this representation may have been stimulated to imitate lady brute in her method of revenge without having suffered her provocation this play verifies the observation of mr pope that van wants grace who never wanted wit   the next play which sir john vanburgh introduced upon the stage was aesop a comedy in two parts acted at the theater royal in drury lane school this was originally written in french by mr boursart about six years before but the scenes of sir polidorus hogstye the players the senator and the beau were added by our author this performance contains a great deal of general satire and useful morality notwithstanding which it met with but a cold reception from the audience and its run terminated in about   or   days this seemed the more surprising to men of taste as the french comedy from which it was taken was played to crowded audiences for a month together sir john has rather improved upon the original by adding new scenes than suffered it to be diminished in a translation but the french and the english taste was in that particular very different we cannot better account for the ill success of this excellent piece than in the words of mr cibbers apology for his own life when speaking of this play he has the following observation the character that delivers precepts of wisdom is in some sort severe upon the auditor for showing him one wiser than himself but when folly is his object he applauds himself for being wiser than the coxcomb he laughs at and who is not more pleased with an occasion to commend than to accuse himself  sir john vanbrugh it is said had great facility in writing and is not a little to be admired for the spirit ease and readiness with which he produced his plays notwithstanding his extraordinary expedition there is a clear and lively simplicity in his wit that is equally distant from the pedantry of learning and the lowness of scurrility as the face of a fine lady with her hair undressed may appear in the morning in its brightest glow of beauty such were the productions of vanbrugh adorned with only the negligent graces of nature  mr cibber observes that there is something so catching to the ear so easy to the memory in all he wrote that it was observed by the actors of his time that the style of no author whatsoever gave the memory less trouble than that of sir john vanbrugh which he himself has confirmed by a pleasing experience his wit and humor was so little labored that his most entertaining scenes seemed to be no more than his common conversation committed to paper as his conceptions were so full of life and humor it is not much to be wondered at if his muse should be sometimes too warm to wait the slow pace of judgment or to endure the drudgery of forming a regular fable to them  that sir john was capable of a great force of thinking appears abundantly clear from that scene between aesop and a country gentleman who comes to complain of the bad conduct of those in power the dialogue is at once sensible and animated aesop shows him what he reckoned the oppressions of the administration flowed from the prejudices of ignorance contemplated through the medium of popular discontent in the interview between the beau and the philosopher there is the following pretty fable the beau observes to aesop it is is very well it is very well old spark i say it is very well because i have not a pair of plod shoes and a dirty shirt you think a woman will not venture upon me for husband  why now to show you old father how little you philosophers know the ladies  i will tell you an adventure of a friend of mine a band a bobwig and a feather attacked a ladys heart together the band in a most learned plea made up of deep philosophy told her if she would please to wed a reverend beard and take instead of vigorous youth old solemn truth with books and morals into bed how happy she would be the bob he talked of management what wondrous blessings heaven sent on care and pains and industry and truly he must be so free to own he thought your airy beaux with powdered wigs and dancing shoes were good for nothing mend his soul but prate and talk and play the fool he said twas wealth gave joy and mirth and that to be the dearest wife of one who labored all his life to make a mine of gold his own and not spend sixpence when he would done was heaven upon earth when these two blades had done do you see the feather as it might be me steps out sir from behind the skreen with such an air and such a mien look you old gentleman in short he quickly spoiled the statesmans sport it proved such sunshine weather that you must know at the first beck the lady leapt about his neck and off they went together   the reputation which sir john gained by his comedies was rewarded with greater advantages than what arise from the usual profits of writing for the stage he was appointed clarencieux king at arms a place which he some time held and at last disposed of in august      he was appointed surveyor of the works at greenwich hospital he was likewise made comptroller general of his majestys works and surveyor of the gardens and waters the profits of which places collectively considered must amount to a very considerable sum  in some part of our authors life for we cannot justly ascertain the time he gratified an inclination of visiting france as curiosity no doubt induced him to pass over to that country he lost no time in making such observations as could enable him to discern the spirit and genius of that polite people his taste for architecture excited him to take a survey of the sortifications in that kingdom but the ardour of his curiosity dren him into a snare out of which he found great difficulty to escape when he was one day surveying some sortifications with the strictest attention he was taken notice of by an engineer secured by authority and then carried prisoner to the bastile in paris the french were confirmed in suspicions of his design by several plans being found in his possession at the time he was seized upon but as the french except in cases of heresy use their prisoners with gentleness and humanity sir john found his confinement so endurable that he amused himself in drawing rude draughts of some comedies this circumstance raising curiosity in paris several of the noblesse visited him in the bastile when sir john who spoke their language with fluency and elegance insinuated himself into their favor by the vivacity of his wit and the peculiarity of his humor he gained so much upon their affections that they represented him to the french king in an innocent light and by that means procured his liberty some days before the solicitation came from england  sir john vanbrugh formed a project of building a stately theater in the haymarket for which he had interest enough to raise a subscription of thirty persons of quality at  00 l each in consideration whereof every subscriber for his own life should be admitted to whatever entertainments should be publicly performed there without farther payment for entrance  on the first stone that was laid in this theater were inscribed the words little whig as a compliment to a lady of extraordinary beauty then the celebrated toast and pride of that party in the year   0  when this house was finished mr betterton and his copartners put themselves under the direction of sir john vanbrugh and mr congreve imagining that the conduct of two such eminent authors would restore their ruined affairs but they found their expectations were too sanguine for though sir john was an expeditious writer yet mr congreve was too judicious to let any thing come unfinished out of his hands besides every proper convenience of a good theater had been sacrificed to show the audience a vast triumphal piece of architecture in which plays by means of the spaciousness of the dome could not be successfully represented because the actors could not be distinctly heard  not long before this time the italian opera began to steal into england but in as rude a disguise and as unlike itself as possible notwithstanding which the new monster pleased though it had neither grace melody nor action to recommend it to strike in therefore with the prevailing fashion vanbrugh and congreve opened their new theater in the haymarket with a translated opera set to italian music called the triumph of love but it met with a cold reception being performed only three days to thin houses  immediately upon the failure of the opera vanbrugh produced his comedy called the confederacy greatly improved from the bourgois a la mode of dancour the success of this play was not equal to its merit for it is written in an uncommon vein of humor and abounds with the most lively strokes of raillery the prospects of gain from this theater were so very u promising that congreve in a few months gave up his share and interest in the government wholly to sir john vanbrugh who being now sole proprietor of the house was under a necessity to exert himself in its support as he had a happier talent for throwing the english spirit into his translations of french plays than any former author who had borrowed from them he in the same season gave the public three more of that kind viz   the cuckold in conceit from the cocu imaginaire of moliere   squire treelooby from his monsieur do pourceaugnac   the mistake from the depit amoureux of the same author the two first were never printed from sir johns manuscript    however well executed these pieces were yet they came to the ear in the same undistinguished utterance by which almost all their plays had equally suffered for as few could plainly hear it was not likely a great many would applaud  in this situation it appears that nothing but the union of the two companies could restore the stage to its former reputation  sir john vanbrugh therefore tired of theatrical management thought of disposing of his whole farm to some industrious tenant that might put it into better condition it was to mr owen swiny that in the exigence of his affairs he made an offer of his actors under such agreements of salary as might be made with them and of his house clothes and scenes with the queens license to employ them upon payment of the casual rent of five pounds every acting day and not to exceed  00 l per annum with this proposal mr swiny complied and governed that stage till another great theatrical revolution  there are two plays of our author not yet mentioned viz the false friend a comedy acted in school and a journey to london a comedy which he left unfinished this last piece was finished by mr cibber to a very great advantage and now is one of the best comedies in our language mr cibber in his prologue takes particular notice of our authors virtucus intention in composing this piece which he says was to make some amends for those loose scenes which in the fire of his youth he had with more regard to applause than virtue exhibited to the public but this design will be best understood by inserting the prologue prologue this play took birth from principles of truth to make amends for errors past of youth a bard that is now no more in riper days conscious reviewed the license of his plays and though applause his wanton muse had fired himself condemned what sensual minds admired at length he owned that plays should let you see not only what you are but ought to be though vice was natural twas never meant the stage should show it but for punishment warm with that thought his muse once more took flame resolved to bring licentious life to shame such was the piece his latest pen designed but left no traces of his plan behind luxurious scenes unprund or half contrived yet through the mass his native fire survived rough as rich oar in mines the treasure lay yet still twas rich and forms at length a play in which the bold compiler boasts no merit but that his pains have saved you scenes of spirit not scenes that would a noisy joy impart but such as hush the mind and warm the heart from praise of hands no sure account he draws but fixed attention is sincere applause if then for hard you will own the task his art can to those embrionscenes new life impart the living proudly would exclude his lays and to the buried bard resign the praise   sir john indeed appears to have been often sensible of the immorality of his scenes for in the year      when the company of comedians was called upon in a manner that could not be resisted to revive the provoked wife the author who was conscious how justly it was exposed to censure thought proper to substitute a new scene in the fourth act in place of another in which in the wantonness of his wit and humor he had made a rake talk like a rake in the habit of a clergyman to avoid which offense he put the same debauchee into the undress of a woman of quality for the character of a fine lady it seems is not reckoned so indelibly sacred as that of a churchman whatever follies he exposed in the petticoat kept him at least clear of his former imputed profaneness and appeared now to the audience innocently ridiculous  this ingenious dramatist died of a quinsey at his house in whitehall on the   th of march      he was a man of a lively imagination of a facetious and engaging humor and as he lived esteemed by all his acquaintance so he died without leaving one enemy to reproach his memory a felicity which few men of public employments or possessed of so distinguished a genius ever enjoyed he has left behind him monuments of fame which can never perish but with taste and politeness  sir richard steel knt this celebrated genius was born in ireland his father being a counselor at law and private secretary to james duke of ormond he went over with his grace to that kingdom when he was raised to the dignity of lord lieutenant general dictionary vol ix p      our author when but very young came over into england and was educated at the charter house school in london where mr addison was his schoolfellow and where they contracted a friendship which continued firm till the death of that great man  his inclination leading him to the army he rode for some time privately in the guards in which station as he himself tells us in his apology for his writings he first became an author a way of life in which the irregularities of youth are considered as a kind of recommendation  mr steel was born with the most violent propension to pleasure and at the same time was master of so much good sense as to be able to discern the extreme folly of licentious courses their moral unfitness and the many calamities they naturally produce he manintained a perpetual struggle between reason and appetite he frequently fell into indulgencies which cost him many a pang of remorse and under the conviction of the danger of a vicious life he wrote his christian hero with a design to fix upon his own mind a strong impression of virtue and religion but this secret admonition to his conscience he judged too weak and therefore in the year   0  printed the book with his name prefixed in hopes that a standing evidence against himself in the eyes of the world might the more forcibly induce him to lay a restraint upon his desires and make him ashamed of vice so contrary to his own sense and conviction  this piece was the first of any note and is esteemed by some as one of the best of mr steeles works he gained great reputation by it and recommended himself to the regard of all pious and good men but while he grew in the esteem of the religious and worthy he sunk in the opinion of his old companions in gaiety he was reckoned by them to have degenerated from the gay sprightly companion to the dull disagreeable pedant and they measured the least levity of his words and actions with the character of a christian hero thus he found himself slighted instead of being encouraged for his declarations as to religion but happily those who held him in contempt for his defense of piety and goodness were characters with whom to be at variance is virtue but mr steel who could not be content with the suffrage of the good only without the concurrence of the gay set about recovering the favor of the latter by innocent means he introduced a comedy on the stage called grief alamode in which though full of incidents that move laughter and inspire cheerfulness virtue and vice appear just as they ought to do this play was acted at the theater in drury lane   0  and as nothing can make the town so fond of a man as a successful play so this with some other particulars enlarged on to his advantage recommended him to king william and his name to be provided for was in the last table book worn by his majesty  he had before this time procured a captains commission in the lord lucass regiment by the interest of lord cutts to whom he dedicated his christian hero and who likewise appointed him his secretary his next appearance as a writer was in the office of gazetteer in which he observes in the same apology for himself he worked faithfully according to order without ever erring against the rule observed by all ministers to keep that paper very innocent and insipid the reproaches he heard every gazetteday against the writer of it inspired him with a fortitude of being remarkably negligent of what people said which he did not deserve in endeavoring to acquire this negligence he certainly acted a prudent part and gained the most important and leading advantage with which every author should set out  whoever writes for the public is sure to draw down envy on himself from some quarter or other and they who are resolved never to be pleased consider him as too assuming and discover their resentment by contempt how miserable is the state of an author it is his misfortune in common with the fair sex to please too little or to please too much  if he happens to be a successful writer his friends who become then proud of his acquaintance flatter him and by soothing his vanity teach him to overrate his importance and while he grasps at universal same he loses by too vigorous an effort what he had acquired by diligence and application if he pleases too little that is if his works are not read he is in a fair way of being a great loser by his attempt to please  mr steel still continued to write plays in the year   0  his comedy entitled the tender husband or the accomplished fools was acted at the theater in drury lane as his comedy of the lyinglovers or the ladies friendship was likewise the year following both with success so that his reputation was now fully established  in the year   0  he began the tatler the first of which was published on tuesday april the   th and the last on tuesday january the  d    0   this paper greatly increasing his fame he was preferred to be one of the commissioners of the stamp office upon laying down the tatler he set up in concert with mr addison the spectator which was continued from march the  st    0   to december the  th      and resumed june   th      and continued till december the  0th the same year  the guardian was likewise published by them in      and in the october of the same year mr steel began a political paper entitled the englishman  in the spectator mr steeles papers are marked with the letter t and in them are contained the most picturesque descriptions of low life of which he was perfect master humor was his talent though not so much confined to that cast of writing to be incapable of painting very tender scenes witness his conscious lovers which never fails to draw tears and in some of his spectators he has written in so feeling a manner that none can read them without emotion  he had a strong inclination to find out the humors of low life and to make himself master of them when he was at edinburgh as one of the commissioners on the forfeited estates he one day made a very splendid feast and while his servants were surprised at the great preparations and were expecting every moment to carry out his invitations to the company for whom they imagined it was prepared he commanded them to go out to the street and pick up whatever beggars and poor people they saw and invite them to his house the servants obeyed and sir richard soon saw himself at the head of  0 or  0 beggars together with some poor decayed tradesmen after dinner he plied them with punch and wine and when the frolic was ended he declared that besides the pleasure of feeding so many hungry persons he had learned from them humor enough for a good comedy  our author was a man of the highest benevolence he celebrates a generous action with a warmth that is only peculiar to a good heart and however he may be blamed for want of economy etc yet was he the most agreeable and if we may be allowed the expression the most innocent rake that ever trod the rounds of indulgence  he wrote several poetical pieces particularly the englishmans thanks to the duke of marlborough printed in      a letter to sir miles wharton concerning occasional peers dated march  th      the guardian of august the  th      and the importance of dunkirk considered in defense of that guardian in a letter to the bailiff of stockbridge the french faith represented in the present state of dunkirk the crisis a letter to a member of parliament concerning the bill to prevent the present growth of schism dated may         and his apology for himself and his writings  these pieces show how much he was displeased with the last measures of queen anne and were written to combat the tory ministry to oppose which he set about procuring a seat in parliament for which purpose he resigned his place of commissioner of the stampoffice in june      in a letter to the earl of oxford lord high treasurer and was chosen member of the house of commons for the borough of stockbridge but he did not long enjoy his seat in that house before he was expelled on the   th of march      for writing the englishman being the close of the paper so called and the crisis his expulsion was owing to the spleen of the then prevailing party what they designed as a disgrace proved an honor to him   in      he published the romish ecclesiastical history of late years and a paper entitled the lover the first of which appeared thursday february         and another entitled the reader which began on thursday april    the same year in the sixth number of this last paper he gave an account of his design of writing the history of the duke of marlborough from proper materials in his custody the relation to commence from the date of his graces commission as captain general and plenipotentiary and to end with the expiration of these commissions but this noble design he lived not to execute and the materials were afterward returned to the duchess of marlborough who left them to mr mallet with a handsome gratuity for the execution of sir richards design  soon after the accession of king george the is it to the throne mr steel was appointed surveyor of the royal stables at hampton court and governor of the royal company of comedians by a patent dated january           he was likewise put into the commission of the peace for the county of middlesex and in april      received the honor of knighthood from his majesty in the first parliament of that king he was chosen for boroughbrigg in yorkshire and after the suppressing the rebellion in the north was appointed one of the commissioners of the forfeited estates in scotland where he received from several of the nobility and gentry of that part of the united kingdom the most distinguishing marks of respect he contracted a friendship while in scotland with one heart a presbyterian minister in edinburgh whom he afterward honored with his correspondence this heart he used merrily to style the hangman of the gospel for though he was a facetious goodnatured man yet he had fallen into a peculiar way of preaching what he called the terrors of the law and denounced anathemas from the pulpit without reserve  sir richard held frequent conversations with heart and other ministers concerning the restoration of episcopacy the ancient church government of that nation and often observed that it was pity when the two kingdoms were united in language in dress in politics and in all essential points even in religion should yet be divided in the ecclesiastical adminisration which still serves to maintain a kind of alienation between the people he found many of the scots well disposed toward prelacy but the generality who were taught to contemplate the church of england with as much horror as that of rome could not soon be prevailed upon to return to it  sir richard wished well to the interests of religion and as he imagined that union would promote it he had some thoughts of proposing it at court but the times were unfavourable the presbyterians had lately appeared active against the rebels and were not to be disobliged but such is now the good understanding between the episcopal and presbyterian parties that a few concessions on the one side and not many advances on the other possibly might produce an amicable coalition as it is chiefly in form rather than in articles of religion in which they differ  in the year      he published an account of the state of the roman catholic religion throughout the world translated from an italian manuscript with a dedication to the pope giving him a very particular account of the state of religion amongst the protestants and several other matters of importance relating to great britain but this dedication is supposed to be written by another very eminent hand more conversant in subjects of that nature than sir richard  the same year our author published a letter from the earl of mar to the king before his majestys arrival in england with some remarks on my lords subsequent conduct and the year following a second volume of the englishman and in      an account of a fishpool which was a project of his for bringing fish to market alive for which he obtained a patent  in      he published a pamphlet called the spinster and a letter to the earl of oxford concerning the bill of peerage which bill he opposed in the house of commons some time after he wrote against the southseascheme his crisis of posterity and another piece entitled a nation a family and on saturday january the  d      0 he began a paper called the theater during the course of which his patent of governor of the royal company of comedians being suspended by his majesty he published the state of the case  in the year      he brought his conscious lovers on the stage with prodigious success this is the last and most finished of all sir richards comedies and it is doubtful if there is upon the stage any more instructing that tends to convey a finer moral or is better conducted in its design we have already observed that it is impossible to witness the tender scenes of this comedy without emotion that is no man of feeling and humanity who has experienced the delicate solicitudes of love and affection can do it sir richard has told us that when one of the players told mr wilks that there was a general weeping for indiana he politely observed that he would not fight the worse for that and indeed what a noble school of morality would the stage be if all those who write for it would observe such delicate chastity they would then enforce an honorable and virtuous deportment by the most insinuating and easy means they would so allure the audience by the amiable form of goodness represented in her native loveliness that he who could resist her charms must be something more than wicked  when sir richard finished this comedy the parts of tom and phillis were not then in it he read it to mr cibber who heartily told him that though he liked his play upon the whole both in the cast of the characters and execution of them yet that it was rather too grave for an english audience who want generally to laugh at a comedy and without which in their opinion the end is not answered mr cibber then proposed the addition of some comic characters with which sir richard agreed and saw the propriety and force of the observation this comedy at sir richards request received many additions from and were greatly improved by mr cibber  our author dedicated this work to the king who made him a present of  00l  some years before his death he grew paralytic and retired to his seat at langunner near caermarthen in wales where he died september the  st      and was privately interred according to his own desire in the church of caermarthen  besides his writings abovementionened he began on saturday the   th of december a weekly paper in quarto called the towntalk in a letter to a lady in the country and another entitled the teatable he had likewise planned a comedy which he intended to call the school of action  as sir richard was beloved when living so his loss was sincerely regretted at his death he was a man of undissembled and extensive benevolence a friend to the friendless and as far as his circumstances would permit the father of every orphan his works are chaste and manly he himself admired virtue and he drew her as lovely as she is of his works it may be said as sir george lyttleton in his prologue to coriolanus observes of thomson that there are not in them one corrupted one immoral thought a line which dying he could wish to blot he was a stranger to the most distant appearance of envy or malevolence never jealous of any mans growing reputation and so far from arrogating any praise to himself from his conjunction with mr addison that he was the first who desired him to distinguish his papers in the spectator and after the death of that great man was a faithful executor of his fame notwithstanding an aspersion which mr tickell was so unjust to throw upon him sir richards greatest error was want of economy as appears from the two following instances related by the elegant writer of mr savages life to whom that gentleman communicated them  savage was once desired by sir richard with an air of the utmost importance to come very early to his house the next morning mr savage came as he had promised found the chariot at the door and sir richard waiting for him ready to go out what was intended and whither they were to go savage could not conjecture and was not willing to inquire but immediately seated himself with sir richard the coachman was ordered to drive and they hurried with the utmost expedition to hydepark corner where they stopped at a petty tavern and retired to a private room sir richard then informed him that he intended to publish a pamphlet and that he desired him to come thither that he might write for him they soon sat down to the work sir richard dictated and savage wrote till the dinner which had been ordered was put upon the table savage was surprised at the meanness of the entertainment and after some hesitation ventured to ask for wine which sir richard not without reluctance ordered to be brought they then finished their dinner and proceeded in their pamphlet which they concluded in the afternoon mr savage then imagined his task over and expected that sir richard would call for the reckoning and return home but his expectations deceived him for sir richard told him he was without money and that the pamphlet must be sold before the dinner could be paid for and savage was therefore obliged to go and offer their new production to sale for two guineas which with some difficulty he obtained sir richard then returned home having retired that day only to avoid his creditors and composed the pamphlet only to discharge his reckoning as savage has said nothing to the contrary it is reasonable to conjecture that he had sir richards permission to use his name to the bookseller to whom he made an offer of it for two guineas otherwise it is very improbable that the pamphlet should be sold at all in so short a time  the other instance is equally uncommon with the former  sir richard having invited to his house a great number of persons of the first quality they were surprised at the number of liveries which surrounded the table and after dinner when wine and mirth had set them free from the observation of rigid ceremony one of them enquired of sir richard how such an expensive train of domestics could be consistent with his fortune sir richard frankly confessed that they were fellows of whom he would very willingly be rid and being then asked why he did not discharge them he declared that they were bailiffs who had introduced themselves with an execution and whom since he could not send them away he had thought it convenient to imbellish with liveries that they might do him credit whilst they staid  his friends were diverted with the expedient and by paying the debt discharged the attendance having obliged sir richard to promise that they should never find him again graced with a retinue of the same kind  he married to his first wife a gentlewoman of barbados with whom he had a valuable plantation there on the death of her brother who was taken by the french at sea as he was coming to england and died in france this wife dying without issue he married mary the daughter of jonathan scurlock of langunnoc in carmarthanshire esquire by whom he had one son eugene who died young of his two daughters one only is living which lady became sole heiress to a handsome estate in wales she was married when young to the hon john trevor esquire one of the judges of the principality of wales who since by the death of his brother has taken his seat in the house of lords as baron trevor etc  andrew marvel esquire a disappointment occasioned our throwing this life out of the chronological order but we hope the candid reader will pardon a fault of this kind we only wish he may find nothing of more consequence to accuse us of  this ingenious gentleman was the son of mr andrew marvel minister and schoolmaster of kingston upon hull in yorkshire and was born in that town in the year    0 cooks life of andrew marvel esquire prefixed to the first volume of mr marvels works london       he was admitted into trinity college in cambridge december         where he had not been long before his studies were interrupted by the following accident  some jesuits with whom he familiarly conversed observing in him a genius beyond his years used their utmost efforts to proselyte him to their faith which they imagined they could more easily accomplish while he was yet young they so far succeeded as to seduce him from the college and carry him to london where after some months absence his father found him in a booksellers shop and prevailed upon him to return to the college  he afterward pursued his studies with the most indefatigable application and in the year      took the degree of bachelor of arts and the same year was admitted scholar of the house that is of the foundation at trinity college life ubi supra  we have no farther account of him for several years after this only that he traveled through the most polite parts of the world but in what quality we are not certain unless in that of secretary to the embassy at constantinople  while our author was in france he wrote his poem entitled cuidam qui legendo scripturam descripsit formam sapientiam sortemque authoris illustrissimo viro domino lanceloto josepho de maniban grammatomanti  the person to whom he addresses these verses was an abbot famous for entering into the qualities of those whom he had never seen and prognosticating their good or bad fortune from an inspection of their handwriting  during the troubles of the republic we find him tutor to one mr dutton a young gentleman as appears from an original letter of his to oliver cromwell this letter sent to so extraordinary a person by a man of mr marvels consequence may excite the readers curiosity with which he shall be gratified it carries in it much of that stiffness and pedantry peculiar to the times and is very different from the usual style of our author may it please your lordship it might perhaps seem fit for me to seek out words to give your excellence thanks for myself but indeed the only civility which it is fit for me to practice with so eminent a person is to obey you and to perform honestly this work which you have set me about therefore i shall use the time that your lordship is pleased to allow me for writing only to that purpose for which you have given me it that is to render you some account of mr dutton i have taken care to examine him several times in the presence of mr oxenbridge mr john oxenbridge who was made fellow of eton college during the civil war but ejected at the restoration he died in new england and was a very enthusiastic person  as those who weigh and tell over money before some witnesses ever they take charge of it for i thought that there might be possibly some lightness in the coin or error in the telling which hereafter i might be bound to make good therefore mr oxenbridge is the best to make your excellence an impartial relation thereof i shall only say that i shall strive according to my best understanding to increase whatsoever talent he may have already truly he is of a gentle and waxen disposition and god be praised i cannot say that he has brought with him any evil impression and i hope to set nothing upon his spirit but what shall be of a good scuipture he has in him two things which make youth most easily to be managed modesty which is the bridle to vice and emulation which is the spurto virtue and the care which your excellency is pleased to take of him is no small encouragement and shall be represented to him but above all i shall labor to make him sensible of his duty to god for then we begin to serve faithfully when we consider that he is our master and in this both he and i owe infinitely to your lordship for having placed in so godly a family as that of mr oxenbridge whose doctrine and example are like a book and a map not only instructing the ear but demonstrating to the eye which way we ought to travel i shall upon occasion henceforward inform your excellency of any particularities in our little affairs i have no more at present but to give thanks to god for your lordship and to beg grace of him to approve myself         mr marvels first appearance in public business at home was in being assistant to milton as latin secretary to the protector he himself tells us in a piece called the rehearsal transposed that he never had any not the remotest relation to public matters nor correspondence with the persons then predominant until the year      when indeed says he i entered into an employment for which i was not altogether improper and which i considered to be the most innocent and inoffensive toward his majestys affairs of any in that usurped and irregular government to which all men were then exposed and this i accordingly discharged without disobliging any one person there having been opportunities and endeavors since his majestys happy rerurn to have discovered had it been otherwise  a little before the restoration he was chosen by his native town kingston upon hull to sit in that parliament which began at westminster april       0 and again after the restoration for that which began at the same place may        in this station our author discharged his trust with the utmost sidelity and always showed a peculiar regard for those he represented for he constantly sent the particulars of every proceeding in the house to the heads of the town for which he was elected and to those accounts he always joined his own opinion this respectful behavior gained so much on their affections that they allowed him an honorable pension to his death all which time he continued in parliament  mr marvel was not endowed with the gift of eloquence for he seldom spoke in the house but was however capable of forming an excellent judgment of things and was so acute a discerner of characters that his opinion was greatly valued and he had a powerful influence over many of the members without doors prince rupert particularly esteemed him and whenever he voted agreeable to the sentiments of mr marvel it was a saying of the opposite party he has been with his tutor the intimacy between this illustrious foreigner and our author was so great that when it was unsafe for the latter to have it known where he lived on account of some mischief which was threatened him the prince would frequently visit him in a disguised habit mr marvel was often in such danger of assassination that he was obliged to have his letters directed to him in another name to prevent any discovery that way he made himself obnoxious to the government both by his actions and writings and notwithstanding his proceedings were all contrary to his private interest nothing could ever shake his resolution of which the following is a notable instance and transmits our authors name with luster to posterity  one night he was entertained by the king who had often been delighted with his company his majesty next day sent the lord treasurer danby to find out his lodging mr marvel then rented a room up two pair of stairs in a little court in the strand and was writing when the lord treasurer opened the door abruptly upon him surprised at the fight of so unexpected a visitor mr marvel told his lordship that he believed he had mistaken his way the lord danby replied not now i have found mr marvel telling him that he came with a message from his majesty which was to know what he could do to serve him his answer was in his usual facetious manner that it was not in his majestys power to serve him but coming to a serious explanation of his meaning he told the lord treasurer that he well knew the nature of courts and that whoever is distinguished by a princes favor is certainly expected to vote in his interest the lord danby told him that his majesty had only a just sense of his merits in regard to which alone he desired to know whether there was any place at court he could be pleased with these offers though urged with the greatest earnestness had no effect upon him he told the lord treasurer that he could not accept it with honor for he must either be ungrateful to the king by voting against him or betray his country by giving his voice against its interest at least what he reckoned so the only favor therefore which he begged of his majesty was that he would esteem him as dutiful a subject as any he had and more in his proper interest in rejecting his offers than if he had embraced them the lord danby finding no arguments would prevail told him the king had ordered a thousand pounds for him which he hoped he would accept till he could think what farther to ask of his majesty this last temptation was resisted with the same stedfastness of mind as the first  the reader must have already taken notice that mr marvels chief support was the pension allowed him by his constituents that his lodgings were mean and consequently his circumstances at this time could not be affluent his resisting these temptations therefore in such a situation was perhaps one of the most heroic instances of patriotism the annals of england can furnish but his conduct will be still heightened into a more amiable light when it is related that as soon as the lord treasurer had taken his leave he was obliged to send to a friend to borrow a guinea  as the most powerful allurements of riches and honor could never seduce him to relinquish the interest of his country so not even the most immense dangers could deter him from pursuing it in a private letter to a friend from highgate in which he mentions the insuperable hatred of his foes to him and their design of murdering him he has these words praeterea magis occidere metuo quam occidi non quod vitam tanti aestimem sed ne imparatus moriar i e besides i am more apprehensive of killing than being killed not that i value life so much but that i may not die unprepared mr marvel did not remain an unconcerned member of the state when he saw encroachments made upon it both by the civil and ecclesiastical powers he saw that some of the bishops had formed an idea of protestantism very different from the true one and were making such advances toward popery as would soon issue in a reconciliation amongst these ecclesiastics none was so forward as dr samuel parker who published at london      in  vo bishop bramhals vindication of himself and the episcopal clergy from the presbyterian charge of popery as it is managed by mr baxter in his treatise on the grotian religion dr parker likewise preached up the doctrine of nonresistance which slavish principle is admirably calculated to prepare the people for receiving any yoke marvel whose talent consisted in drollery more than in serious reasoning took his own method of exposing those opinions he wrote a piece called the rehearsal transposed in which he very successfully ridiculed dr parker this ludicrous essay met with several answers some serious and others humorous we shall not here enumerate all the rejoinders replies and animadversions upon it wood himself confesses who was an avowed enemy to marvel that dr parker judged it more prudent rather to lay down the cudgels than to enter the lists again with an untowardly combatant so hugely well versed and experienced in the then newly refined art of sporting and jeering buffoonery and bishop burnet tells us in the history of his own time that dr parker after he had for some years entertained the nation with several virulent books was attacked by the liveliest droll of the age who wrote in a burlesque style but with so peculiar and entertaining a conduct that from the king down to the tradesman his book was read with great pleasure this not only humbled parker but the whole party for the author of the rehearsal transposed had all the men of wit on his side dr swift likewise in his apology for the tale of a tub speaking of the usual fate of common answerers to books and how shortlived their labors are observes that there is indeed an exception when any great genius thinks it worth his while to expose a foolish piece so we still read marvels answer to parker with pleasure though the book it answers be sunk long ago  the next controversy in which we find mr marvel engaged was with an antagonist of the pious dr croft bishop of hereford who wrote a discourse entitled the naked truth or a true state of the primitive church by an humble moderator dr turner fellow of st johns college wrote animadversions upon this book mr marvels answer to these animadversions was entitled mr smirk or the divine in mode being certain annotations upon the animadversions on the naked truth together with a short historical essay concerning general councils creeds and impositions in matters of religion printed       our authors next work was an account of the growth of popery and arbitrary government in england more particularly from the long prorogation of november      ending february         till the meeting of parliament july         printed in folio      our author in a letter dated june  0      wrote thus there came out about christmas last here a large book concerning the growth of popery and arbitrary government there have been great rewards offered in private and considerable in the gazette to any who would inform of the author and printer but not yet discovered three or four printed books since have described as near as was proper to go the man being a member of parliament mr marvel to be the author but if he had he surely could not have escaped being questioned in parliament or some other place this book was so offensive to the court at that time that an order was published in these words whereas there have been lately printed and published several seditious and scandalous libels against the proceedings of both houses of parliament and other his majestys courts of justice to the dishonor of his majestys government and the hazard of the public peace these are to give notice that what person soever shall discover unto one of the secretaries of state the printer publisher author or hander to the press of any of the said libels so that full evidence may be made thereof to a jury without mentioning the informer especially one libel entitled an account of the growth of popery and another called a reasonable argument to all the grand juries etc the discoverer shall be rewarded as follows he shall have fifty pounds for such discovery as aforesaid of the printer or publisher of it from the press and for the hander of it to the press one hundred pounds    mr marvel begins this book with a panegyric on the constitution of the english government showing how happy the people are under such wholesome laws which if faithfully observed must make a people happy and a monarch great he observes that the king and the subject are equally under the laws and that the former is no longer king than he continues to obey them so that says he the kings of england are in nothing inferior to other princes save in being more abridgd from injuring their own subjects but have as large a field as any of external felicity wherein to exercise their own virtue and to reward and encourage it in others in short there is nothing that comes nearer the divine perfection than when the monarch as with us enjoys a capacity of doing all the good imaginable to mankind under a disability of all that is evil  after slightly tracing popery from earlier times he begins with the dutch war in      but dwells most upon the proceedings at rome from november      to july      he relates the occasion of the dutch war shows that the papists and the french in particular were the true springs of all our councils and draws the following picture of popery it is such a thing as cannot but for want of a word no express it be called a religion nor is it to be mentioned with that civility which is otherwise decent to be used in speaking of the differences of human opinions about divine matters were it either open juadism or plain turkery or honest paganism there is yet a certain bona fides in the most extravagant belief and the sincerity of an erroneous profession may render it more pardonable but this is a compound of all the three an extract of whatever is most ridiculous or impious in them incorporated with more peculiar absurdities of its own in which those were deficient and all this deliberately contrived and knowingly carried on by the solid imposture of priests under the name of christianity    this great man died not without strong suspicions of being poisoned august         in the   th year of his age and was interred in the church of st giless in the fields and in the year      the town of kingston upon hull contributed a sum of money to erect a monument over him in st giless church for which an epitaph was composed by an able hand but the minister of that church piously forbad both the inscription and monument to be placed there  mr wood tells us that in his conversation he was very modest and of few words and mr cook observes that he was very reserved among people he did not very well know but a most delightful and improving companion amongst his friends  in the year    0 his miscellaneous poems were published to which is prefixed this advertisement these are to certify every ingenious reader that all these poems as also the other things in this book contained are printed according to the exact copies of my late dear husband under his own hand writing both found since his death among his other papers witness my hand mary marvel    but mr cook informs us that these were published with a mercenary view and indeed not at all to the honor of the deceased by a woman with whom he lodged who hoped by this stratagem to share in what he left behind him  he was never married and the same gentleman observes in another place that in the editions of      there are such gross errors especially in the latin poems as make several lines unintelligible and that in the volume of poems on affairs of state the same mistakes are as frequent and in those some pieces are attributed to our author which he never wrote most of his poems printed in drydens miscellanies are so imperfect that whole stanzas are omitted in many places  these mr cook has restored in his edition of the works of andrew marvel esquire printed at london      in two volumes and corrected such faults as in either of the two former editions obscure the sense in this edition are also added some poems from original manuscripts great care has likewise been taken by mr cook to retrench such pieces as he was sure were not genuine  mr marvel considered as a statesman makes a more conspicuous figure than any of the age in which he lived the preceding or the subsequent he possessed the first quality of a statesman that is inviolable integrity and a heart so confirmed against corruption that neither indigence a love of pomp or even dangers the most formidable could move his settled purpose to pursue in every respect the interest of his country  that marvel understood the true interest of his country is abundantly clear from the great reverence paid to his opinion by such persons as were most able to discern and most disposed to promote its welfare  he has succeeded to a miracle in the droll way of writing and when he assumes a severity and writes seriously his arguments and notions are far removed from imbecility  as a poet i cannot better delineate his character than in the words of mr cook there are few of his poems says he that have not something very pleasing in them and some he must be allowed to have excelled in most of them seem to be the effect of a lively genius and manly sense but at the same time seem to want that correctness he was capable of making his most finished pieces are upon miltons paradise lost and upon bloods stealing the crown the latter of which is very satirical on bloods stealing the crown when daring blood his rent to have regained upon the english diadem distraind he chose the cassoc circingle and gown the fittest mask for one that robs the crown but his laypity underneath prevailed and while he saved the keepers life he failed with the priests vestment had he but put on the prelates cruelty the crown had gone in his state poems is contained much of the secret history of king charles the iid in which time they were all written they were composed on various occasions and chiefly to expose a corrupt ministry and the violence of those who were for persecuting all who differed from them in opinion he has several poems in latin some of which he tnanslated into english and one in greek they have each their proper merit he discovers a great facility in writing the latin tongue    there are some sinall pieces of his in prose which ought not to escape observation from his letter to sir john trott there seems to have been a friendly correspondence between him and that gentleman by his familiar letters we may easily judge what part of his works are labored and what not but of all his pieces in prose the kings mockspeech to both houses of parliament has most of spirit and humor as it will furnish the best specimen of mr marvels genius for drollery as well as the character of that prince and ministry we shall here insert it as a performance of the most exquisite humor we have ever seen his majestys most gracious speech to both houses of parliament my lords and gentlemen i told you at our last meeting the winter was the fittest time for business and truly i thought so till my lord treasurer assured me the spring was the best season for sallads and subsidies i hope therefore that april will not prove so unnatural a month as not to afford some kind showers on my parched exchequer which gapes for want of them some of you perhaps will think it dangerous to make me too rich but i do not fear it for i promise you faithfully whatever you give me i will always want and although in other things my word may be thought a slender authority yet in that you may rely on me i will never break it  my lords and gentlemen  i can bear my straits with patience but my lord treasurer does protest to me that the revenue as it now stands will not serve him and me too one of us must suffer for it if you do not help me i must speak freely to you i am under bad circumstances for besides my harlots in service my reformado concubines lie heavy upon me i have a passable good estate i confess but godsfish i have a great charge upon it here is my lord treasurer can tell that all the money designed for next summers guards must of necessity be applied to the next years cradles and swadlingcloths what shall we do for ships then i hint this only to you it being your business not mine i know by experience i can live without ships i lived ten years abroad without and never had my health better in my life but how you will be without i leave to yourselves to judge and therefore hint this only by the by i do not insist upon it there is another thing i must press more earnestly and that is this it seems a good part of my revenue will expire in two or three years except you will be pleased to continue it i have to say for it pray why did you give me so much as you have done unless you resolve to give as fast as i call for it the nation hates you already for giving so much and i will hate you too if you do not give me more so that if you stick not to me you must not have a friend in england on the other hand if you will give me the revenue i desire i shall be able to do those things for your religion and liberty that i have had long in my thoughts but cannot effect them without a little more money to carry me through therefore look to it and take notice that if you do not make me rich enough to undo you it shall lie at your doors for my part i wash my hands on it nut that i may gain your good opinion the best way is to acquaint you what i have done to deserve it out of my royal care for your religion and your property for the first my proclamation is a true picture of my mind he that cannot as in a glass see my zeal for the church of england does not deserve any farther satisfaction for i declare him willful abominable and not good some may perhaps be startled and cry how comes this sudden change to which i answer i am a changling and that is sufficient i think but to convince men farther that i mean what i say there are these arguments  first i tell you so and you know i never break my word  secondly my lord treasurer says so and he never told a lie in his life  thirdly my lord lauderdale will undertake it for me and i should be loath by any act of mine he should forfeit the credit he has with you  if you desire more instances of my zeal i have them for you for example i have converted my natural sons from popery and i may say without vanity it was my own work so much the more peculiarly mine than the begetting them twould do ones heart good to hear how prettily george can read already in the psalter they are all fine children god bless em and so like me in their understandings but as i was saying i have to please you given a pension to your favorite my lord lauderdale not so much that i thought he wanted it as that you would take it kindly i have made carwel duchess of portsmouth and married her sister to the earl of pembroke i have at my brothers request sent my lord inchequin into barbary to settle the protestant religion among the moors and an english interest at tangier i have made crew bishop of durham and at the first word of my lady portsmouth prideaux bishop of chichester i know not for my part what factious men would have but this i am sure of my predecessors never did any thing like this to gain the good will of their subjects so much for your religion and now for your property my behavior to the bankers is a public instance and the proceedings between mrs hyde and mrs sutton for private ones are such convincing evidences that it will be needless to say any more to it  i must now acquaint you that by my lord treasurers advice i made a considerable retrenchment upon my expenses in candles and charcoal and do not intend to stop there but will with your help look into the late embezzlements of my drippingpans and kitchenstuff of which by the way upon my conscience neither my lord treasurer nor my lord lauderdale are guilty i tell you my opinion but if you should find them dabling in that business i tell you plainly i leave em to you for i would have the world to know i am not a man to be cheated  my lords and gontlemen  i desire you to believe me as you have found me and i do solemnly promise you that whatsoever you give me shall be specially managed with the same conduct trust fincerity and prudence that i have ever practiced since my happy restoration    in order to show the versification of mr marvel we shall add a beautiful dialogue between the resolved soul and created pleasure it is written with a true spirit of poetry the numbers are various and harmonious and is one of the best pieces in the serious way of which he is author a dialogue between the resolved soul and created pleasure courage my soul now learn to weild the weight of thine immortal shield close on thy head thy helmet bright balance thy sword against the fight see where an army strong as fair with silken banners spreads the air now if thou best that thing divine in this days combat let it shine and show that nature wants an art to conquer one resolved heart pleasure welcome the creations guest lord of earth and heavens heir lay aside that warlike crest and of natures banquet share where the souls of fruits and flowers stand prepared to heighten yours  soul i sup above and cannot stay to bait so long upon the way  pleasure on these downy pillows lie whose soft plumes will thither fly on these roses strewn so plain lest one leaf thy side should strain  soul my gentler rest is on a thought conscious of doing what i ought  pleasure if thou best with perfumes pleased such as often the gods appeased thou in fragrant clouds shall show like another god below  soul a soul that knows not to presume is heavens and its

try what depth the center draws and then to heaven climb  soul none thither mounts by the degree of knowledge but humility  chorus triumph triumph victorious soul the world has not one pleasure more the rest does lie beyond the pole and is thine everlasting store    we shall conclude the life of mr marvel by presenting the reader with that epitaph which was intended to be inscribed upon his tomb in which his character is drawnin a very masterly manner near this place esquire  mrs elizabeth thomas this lady who is known in the world by the poetial name of corinna seems to have been born for misfortunes her very bitterest enemies could never brand her with any real crime and yet her whole life has been one continued scene of misery see the memoirs of mrs thomass life prefixed to a volume of letters between her and mr gwynnet the only  that is preserved concerning her  the family from which she sprung was of a rank in life beneath envy and above contempt she was the child of an ancient and infirm parent who gave her life when he was dying himself and to whose unhappy constitution she was sole heiress from her very birth which happened      she was afflicted with fevers and defluxions and being overnursed her constitution was so delicate and tender that had she not been of a gay disposition and possessed a vigorous mind she must have been more unhappy than she actually was her father dying when she was scarce two years old and her mother not knowing his real circumstances as he was supposed from the splendor of his manner of life to be very rich some inconveniences were incurred in bestowing upon him a pompous funeral which in those times was fashionable the mother of our poetess in the bloom of eighteen was condemned to the arms of this man upwards of  0 upon the supposition of his being wealthy but in which she was soon miserably deceived when the grief which so young a wife may be supposed to feel for an aged husband had subsided she began to enquire into the state of his affairs and found to her unspeakable mortification that he died not worth one thousand pounds in the world as mrs thomas was a woman of good sense and a high spirit she disposed of two houses her husband kept one in town the other in the county of essex and retired into a private but decent country lodging the chambers in the temple her husband possessed she sold to her brother for   0 l which with her husbands books of accounts she lodged in her trustees hands who being soon after burnt out by the fire in the paper buildings in the temple which broke out with such violence in the dead of night that he saved nothing but his life she lost considerably not being able to make out any bill she could form no regular demand and was obliged to be determined by the honor of her husbands clients who though persons of the first fashion behaved with very little honor to her the deceased had the reputation of a judicious lawyer and an accomplished gentleman but who was too honest to thrive in his profession and had too much humanity ever to become rich of all his clients but one lady behaved with any appearance of honesty the countess dowager of wentworth having then lost her only daughter the lady harriot who was reputed the mistress of the duke of monmouth told mrs thomas that she knew she had a large reckoning with the deceased but says she as you know not what to demand so i know not what to pay come madam i will do better for you than a random reckoning i have now no child and have taken a fancy to your daughter give me the girl i will breed her as my own and provide for her as such when i die the widow thanked her ladyship but with a little too much warmth replied she would not part with her child on any terms which the countess resented to such a degree that she would never see her more and dying in a few years left   00 l per annum inheritance at stepney to her chambermaid  thus were misfortunes early entailed upon this lady a proposal which would have made her opulent for life was defeated by the unreasonable fondness of her mother who lived to suffer its dismal consequences by tasting the bitterest distresses we have already observed that mrs thomas thought proper to retire to the country with her daughter the house where she boarded was an eminent clothworkers in the county of surry but the people of the house proved very disagreeable the lady had no conversation to divert her the landlord was an illiterate man and the rest of the family brutish and unmannerly at last mrs thomas attracted the notice of dr glysson who observing her at church very splendidly dressed solicited her acquaintance he was a valuable piece of antiquity being then      in the hundredth year of his age his person was tall his bones very large his hair like snow a venerable aspect and a complexion which might shame the bloom of fifteen he enjoyed a sound judgment and a memory so tenacious and clear that his company was very engaging his visits greatly alleviated the solitude of this lady the last visit he made to mrs thomas he drew on with much attention a pair of rich spanish leather gloves embost on the backs and tops with gold embroidery and fringed round with gold plate the lady could not help expressing her curiosity to know the history of those gloves which he seemed to touch with so much respect he answered i do respect them for the last time i had the honor of approaching my mistress queen elizabeth she pulled them from her own royal hands saying here glysson wear them for my sake i have done so with veneration and never drew them on but when i had a mind to honor those whom i visit as i now do you and since you love the memory of my royal mistress take them and preserve them carefully when i am gone the dr then went home and died in a few days  this gentlemans death left her again without a companion and an uneasiness hung upon her visible to the people of the house who guessing the cause to proceed from solitude recommended to her acquaintance another physician of a different cast from the former he was denominated by them a conjurer and was said to be capable of raising the devil this circumstance diverted mrs thomas who imagined that the man whom they called a conjurer must have more sense than they understood the dr was invited to visit her and appeared in a greasy black grogram which he called his scholars coat a long beard and other marks of a philosophical negligence he brought all his little mathematical trinkets and played over his tricks for the diversion of the lady whom by a private whispher he let into the secrets as he performed them that she might see there was nothing of magic in the case the two most remarkable articles of his performance were first lighting a candle at a glass of cold water performed by touching the brim before with phosphorus a chemical fire which is preserved in water and burns there and next reading the smallest print by a candle of six in the pound at a hundred yards distance in the open air and darkest night this was performed by a large concaveglass with a deep pointed focus quicksilvered on the backside and set in tin with a socket for a candle sconce fashion and hung up against a wall while the flame of the candle was diametrically opposite to the center the rays equally diverging gave so powerful a light as is scarce credible but on the least variation from the focus the charm ceased the lady discerning in this man a genius which might be improved to better purposes than deceiving the country people desired him not to hide his talents but to push himself in the world by the abilities of which he seemed possessed madam said he i am now a fiddle to asses but i am finishing a great work which will make those asses fiddle to me she then asked what that work might be he replied his life was at stake if it took air but he found her a lady of such uncommon candor and good sense that he should make no difficulty in committing his life and hope to her keeping all women are naturally fond of being trusted with secrets this was mrs thomass failing the dr found it out and made her pay dear for her curiosity i have been continued he many years in search of the philosophers stone and long master of the smaragdinetable of hermes trismegistus the green and red dragons of raymond lully have also been obedient to me and the illustrious sages themselves deign to visit me yet is it but since i had the honor to be known to your ladyship that i have been so fortunate as to obtain the grand secret of projection i transmuted some lead i pulled off my window last night into this bit of gold pleased with the sight of this and having a natural propension to the study the lady snatched it out of the philosophers hand and asked him why he had not made more he replied it was all the lead i could find she then commanded her daughter to bring a parcel of lead which lay in the closet and giving it to the chemist desired him to transmute it into gold on the morrow he undertook it and the next day brought her an ingot which weighed two ounces which with the utmost solemnity he avowed was the very individual lead she gave him transmuted to gold  she began now to engage him in serious discourse and finding by his replies that he wanted money to make more powder she enquired how much would make a stock that would maintain itself he replied one fifty pounds after nine months would produce a million she then begged the ingot of him which he protested had been transmuted from lead and flushed with the hopes of success hurried to town to examine whether the ingot was true gold which proved fine beyond the standard the lady now fully convinced of the truth of the empyrics declaration took fifty pounds out of the hands of a banker and entrusted him with it  the only difficulty which remained was how to carry on the work without suspicion it being strictly prohibited at that time he was therefore resolved to take a little house in another county at a few miles distance from london where he was to build a public laboratory as a professed chemist and deal in such medicines as were most vendible by the sale of which to the apothecaries the expense of the house was to be defrayed during the operation the widow was accounted the housekeeper and the dr and his man boarded with her to which she added this precaution that the laboratory with the two lodging rooms over it in which the dr and his man lay was a different wing of the building from that where she and her little daughter and maidservant resided and as she knew some time must elapse before any profit could be expected she managed with the utmost frugality the dr mean time acted the part of a tutor to miss in arithmetic latin and mathematics to which she discovered the strongest propensity all things being properly disposed for the grand operation the vitriol furnace was set to work which requiring the most intense heat for several days unhappily set fire to the house the stairs were consumed in an instant and as it surprised them all in their first sleep it was a happy circumstance that no life perished this unlucky accident was  00 l loss to mrs thomas yet still the grand project was in a fair way of succeeding in the other wing of the building but one misfortune is often followed by another the next sunday evening while she was reading to and instructing her little family a sudden and a violent report like a discharge of cannon was heard the house being timber rocked like a cradle and the family were all thrown from their chairs on the ground they looked with the greatest amazement on each other not guessing the cause when the operator pretending to revive fell to stamping tearing his hair and raving like a madman crying out undone undone lost and undone for ever he ran directly to the athanor when unlocking the door he found the machine split quite in two the eggs broke and that precious amalgamum which they contained was scattered like sand among the ashes mrs thomass eyes were now sufficiently opened to discern the imposture and with a very serene countenance told the empyric that accidents will happen but means might be fallen upon to repair this fatal disappointment the dr observing her so serene imagined she would grant him more money to complete his scheme but she soon disappointed his expectation by ordering him to be gone and made him a present of five guiueas lest his desperate circumstances should induce him to take some violent means of providing for himself  whether deluded by a real hope of finding out the philosophers stone or from an innate principle of villainy cannot be determined but he did not yet cease his pursuit and still indulged the golden delusion he now found means to work upon the credulity of an old miser who upon the strenght of his pretensions gave him his daughter in marriage and embarked all his hoarded treasure which was very considerable in the same chimerical adventure in a word the misers stock was also lost the empyric himself and the daughter reduced to beggary this unhappy affair broke the misers heart who did not many weeks survive the loss of his cash the dr also put a miserable end to his life by drinking poison and left his wife with two young children in a state of beggary but to return to mrs thomas  the poor lady suffered on this occasion a great deal of inward anguish she was ashamed of having reduced her fortune and impoverished her child by listening to the insinuations of a madman time and patience at last overcame it and when her health which by this accident had been impaired was restored to her she began to stir amongst her husbands great clients she took a house in bloomsbury and by means of good economy and an elegant appearance was supposed to be better in the world than she really was her husbands clients received her like one risen from the dead they came to visit her and promised to serve her at last the duke of montague advised her to let lodgings which way of life she declined as her talents were not suited for dealing with ordinary lodgers but added she if i knew any family who desired such a convenience i would readily accommodate them i take you at your word replied the duke i will become your sole tenant nay dont smile for i am in earnest i love a little freedom more than i can enjoy at home and i may come sometimes and eat a bit of mutton with four or five horest fellows whose company i delight in the bargain was bound and proved matter of fact though on a deeper scheme than drinking a bottle and his lordship was to pass in the housc for mr freeman of hertfordshire  in a few days he ordered a dinner for his beloved sriends jack and tom will and ned good honest countryfellows as his grace called them they came at the time appointed but how surprised was the widow when she saw the duke of devonshire the lords buckingham and dorset and a certain viscount with sir william dutton colt under these feigned names after several times meeting at this ladys house the noble persons who had a high opinion of her integrity entrusted her with the grand secret which was nothing less than the project for the revolution  though these meetings were held as private as possible yet suspicions arose and mrs thomass house was narrowly watched but the messengers who were no enemies to the cause betrayed their trust and suffered the noblemen to meet unmolested or at least without any dread of apprehension  the revolution being effected and the state eame more settled that place of renvous was quitted the noblemen took leave of the lady with promises of obtaining a pension or some place in the household for her as her zeal in that cause highly merited besides she had a very good claim to some appointment having been ruined by shutting up the exchequer but alas court promises proved an aerial foundation and these noble peers never thought of her more the duke of montague indeed made offers of service and being captain of the band of pensioners she asked him to admit mr gwynnet a gentleman who had made love to her daughter into such a post this he promised but upon these terms that her daughter should ask him for it the widow thanked him and not suspecting that any design was covered under this offer concluded herself sure of success but how amazed was she to find her daughter whom she had bred in the most passive subjection and who had never discovered the least instance of disobedience absolutely refuse to ask any such favor of his grace she could be prevanled upon neither by flattery nor threatening and continuing still obstinate in her resolution her mother obliged her to explain herself upon the point of her refusal she told her then that the duke of montague had already made an attack upon her that his designs were dishonorable and that if she submitted to ask his grace one favor he would reckon himself secure of another in return which he would endeavor to accomplish by the basest means this explanation was too satisfactory who does not see the meanness of such an ungenerous conduct he had made use of the mother as a tool for carrying on political designs he found her in distress and as a recompense for her services and under the pretense of mending her fortune at tempted the virtue of her daughter and would provide for her on no other tenms but at the price of her childs innocence  in the mean time the young corinna a potical name given her by mr dryden continued to improve her mind by reading the politest authors such extraordinary advances had she made that upon her sending some poems to mr dryden entreating his perusal and impartial sentiments thereon he was pleased to write her the following letter fair corinna i have sent your two poems back again after having kept them so long from you they were i thought too good to be a womans some of my friends to whom i read them were of the same opinion it is not very gallant i must confess to say this of the fair sex but most certain it is they generally write with more softness than strength on the contrary you want neither vigor in your thoughts nor sorce in your expression nor harmony in your numbers and methinks i find much of orinda in your manner to whom i had the honor to be related and also to be known but i am so taken up with my own studies that i have not leisure to descend to particulars being in the mean time the fair corinnas  most humble and most faithful servant john dryden nov            our amiable poetess in a letter to dr talbot bishop of durham has given some farther particulars of her life we have already seen that she was addressed upon honorable terms by mr gwynnet of the middle temple son of a gentleman in gloucestershire upon his first discovering his passion to corinna she had honor enough to remonstrate to him the inequality of their fortune as her affairs were then in a very perplexed situation this objection was soon surmounted by a lover especially as his father had given him possession of the greatest part of his estate and leave to please himself mr gwynnet no sooner obtained this than he came to london and claimed corinnas promise of marriage but her mother being then in a very weak condition she could not abandon her in that distress to die among strangers she therefore told mr gwynnet that as she had not thought sixteen years long in waiting for him he could not think six months long in expectation of her he replied with a deep sigh six months at this time my corinna is more than sixteen years have been you put it off now and god will put it off for ever  it proved as he had foretold he next day went into the country made his will sickened and died april the   th      leaving his corinna the bequest of sixhundred pounds and adds she sorrow has been my food ever since  had she providentially married him she had been secure from the insults of poverty but her duty to her parent was more prevalent than considerations of convenience after the death of her lover she was barbarously used his brother stifled the will which compelled her to have recourse to law he smothered the old gentlemans conveyance deed by which he was enabled to make a bequest and offered a large sum of money to any person who would undertake to blacken corinnas character but wicked as the world is he found none so completely abandoned as to perjure themselves for the sake of his bribe at last to show her respect to the memory of her deceased lover she consented to an accommodation with his brother to receive  00  down and  00  at the years end the first payment was made and distributed instantly amongst her mothers creditors but when the other became due he bid her defiance stood suit on his own bond and held out four terms he carried it from one court to another till at last it was brought to the bar of the house of lords and as that is a tribunal where the chicanery of lawyers can have no weight he thought proper to pay the money without a hearing the gentlemen of the longrobe had made her sign an instrument that they should receive the money and pay themselves after they had laid their cruel hands upon it of the  00  the poor distressed lady received but       s which reduced her to the necessity of absconding from her creditors and starving in an obscure corner till she was betrayed by a false friend and hurried to jail  besides all the other calamities of corinna she had ever a bad state of health occasioned by an accident too curious to be omitted  in the year    0 her case was given into the college of physicians and was reckoned a very surprising one it is as follows in april      the patient swallowed the middle bone of the wing of a large fowl being above three inches long she had the end in her mouth and speaking hastily it went forcibly down in the act of inspiration after the first surprise feeling no pain she thought no more of it in a few days after she complained what she eat or drank lay like a stone in her stomach and little or nothing passed through her after three weeks obstruction she fell into a most violent bloody flux attended with a continual pain at the pit of her stomach convulsions and swooning fits nor had she any ease but while her stomach was distended with liquids such as small beer or gruel she continued in this misery with some little intervals till the christmas following when she was seized with a malignant fever and the convulsions increased to so high a degree that she crowed like a cock and barked like a dog to the affrightment of all who saw her as well as herself dr colebatch being called to her relief and seeing the almost incredible quantity of blood she voided said it was impossible she could live having voided all her bowels he was however prevailed with to use means which he said could only be by fetching off the inner coat of her stomach by a very strong vomit he did so and she brought the hairveel in rolls fresh and bleeding this dislodged the bone which split length ways one half passed off by siege black as jet the cartilaginous part at each end consumed and sharp on each side as a razor the other part is still lodged within her in this raw and extreme weak condition he put her into a salivation unknown to her mother or herself to carry off the other part which shocked them to such a degree that they sent for dr garth who with much difficulty and against his judgment was prevailed on to take it off and using a healing galenical method she began to recover so much strength as to be turned in her bed and receive nourishment but she soon after was seized with the iliac passion and for eleven days her excrements came upwards and no passage could be forced through her till one day by dr garth with quicksilver after a few weeks it returned again and the same medicine repeated upon which she recovered and for some months was brought to be in a tolerable state of health only the region of the spleen much swelled and at some times when the the bone moved outward as it visibly did to sight and touch was very painful  in july      on taking too strong a purge a large imposthume bag came away by stool on which it was supposed the cystus which the bone had worked for itself being come away the bone was voided also but her pains continued so extraordinary she willingly submitted to the decree of four surgeons who agreed to make an incision in the left side of the abdomen and extract the bone but one of the surgeons utterly rejecting the operation as impracticable the bone being lodged in the colon sent her to bath where she found some relief by pumping and continued tolerably well for some years even to bear the fatigue of an eight years suit at law with an unjust executor save that in overwalking and sudden passion she used to be pained but not violent and once or twice in a year a discharge of clean gall with some portions of a skin like thin kid leather tinged with gall which she felt break from the place and leave her sore within but the bone never made any attempt outwards after the first three years being deprived of a competent fortune by cross accidents she has suffered all the extremities of a close imprisonment if want of all the necessaries of life and lying on the boards for twoyears may be termed such during which time she never felt the bone but on her recovering liberty and beginning to use exercise her stomach and belly and head swelled to a monstrous degree and she was judged in a galloping dropsy but no proper medicines taking place she was given over as incurable when nature unexpectedly helped itself and in twelve hours time by stool and vomit she voided about five gallons of dirty looking water which greatly relieved her for some days but gathered again as the swelling returned and always abounded with a hectic or suffocating asthma in her stomach and either a canine appetite or loathing she has lately voided several extraneous membranes different from the former and so frequent that it keeps her very low some of which she has preserved in spirits and humbly implores your honors judgment thereon    under all these calamities of which the above is a just representation did poor corinna labor and it is difficult to produce a life crowded with greater evils the small fortune which her father left her by the imprudence of her mother was soon squandered she no sooner began to taste of life than an attempt was made upon her innocence when she was about being happy in the arms of her amiable lover mr gwynnet he was snatched from her by an immature fate amongst her other misfortunes she labored under the displeasure of mr pope whose poetical majesty she had innocently offended and who has taken care to place her in his dunciad mr pope had once vouchsafed to visit her in company with henry cromwell esquire whose letters by some accident fell into her hands with some of popes answers as soon as that gentleman died mr curl found means to wheedle them from her and immediately committed them to the press this so enraged pope that though the lady was very little to blame yet he never forgave her  not many months after our poetess had been released from her gloomy habitation she took a small lodging in fleet street where she died on the  d of february    0 in the   th year

great as their sire and as their mother fair and good as both till last extent of time   elijah fenton this worthy gentleman was born at shelton near newcastle under the line in staffordshire see jacob p     in this county though there are several families of the name of fenton yet they are all branches from one stock which is a very ancient and opulent family our authors mother being immediately descended from one mare an officer in william the conquerors army  our poet was the youngest of twelve children and was intended by his parents for the ministry he was sent to the university of cambridge where he embraced the principles very opposite to the government by which he became disqualified for entering into holy orders we find him soon after his quitting the university secretary to the earl of orrery but how long he remained in that station we cannot ascertain after he quitted the service of this noble peer it was his custom to perform a visit annually to his eldest brothers house in the country who possessed an estate of  000 l per annum he was caressed in the country by all his relations to whom he endeared himself by his affable and genteel behavior mr fenton was a man of the most tender humanity and discovered it upon every proper occasion a gentleman resident in that county who has transmitted to us some account of mr fenton has given us the following instance of his humane disposition  he had a great number of sisters some of whom were less happy in their marriages than others one in particular was exposed to many misfortunes by the indiscretion and extravagance of her husband it is the custom of some people to make very great distinctions between their rich and poor relations mr fentons brother was of this stamp and it seems treated his unfortunate sister with less ceremony than the rest one day while mr fenton was at his brothers house he observed the family going to dinner without this sister who was in town and had as good a right to an invitation as any of the rest who dined there as a compliment to him he could not help discovering his displeasure at so unnatural a distinction and would not sit down to table till she was sent for and in consequence of this slight shown her by the rest of the family mr fenton treated her with more tenderness and complaisance than any of his sisters  our author carried through life a very fair reputation he was beloved and esteemed by mr pope who honored him with a beautiful epitaph mr fenton after a life of ease and tranquillity died at easthampsteadpark near oakingham the   th of july    0 much regretted by all men of taste not being obnoxious to the resentment even of his brother writers  in the year      mr fenton introduced upon the stage his tragedy of mariamne built upon the story related of her in the third volume of the spectator numb     which the ingenious author collected out of josephus as this story so fully displays the nature of the passion of jealousy and discovers so extraordinary a character as that of herod we shall here insert it after which we shall consider with what success mr fenton has managed the plot  in a former paper the author having treated the paffion of jealousy in various lights and marked its progress through the human mind concludes his animadversions with this story which he says may serve as an example to whatever can be said on that subject mariamne had all the charms that beauty birth wit and youth could give a woman and herod all the love that such charms are able to raise in a warm and amorous disposition in the midst of his fondness for mariamne he put her brother to death as he did her father not many years after the barbarity of the action was represented to mark anthony who immediately summoned herod into egypt to answer for the crime that was laid to his charge herod attributed the summons to anthonys desire of mariamne whom therefore before his departure he gave into the custody of his uncle joseph with private orders to put her to death if any such violence was offered to himself this joseph was much delighted with mariamnes conversation and endeavored with all his art and rhetoric to set out the excess of herods passion for her but when he still found her cold and incredulous he inconsiderately told her as a certain instance of her lords affection the private orders he had left behind him which plainly showed according to josephs interpretation that he could neither live nor die without her this barbarous instance of a wild unreasonable passion quite put out for a time those little remains of affection she still had for her lord her thoughts were so wholly taken up with the cruelty of his orders that she could not consider the kindness which produced them and therefore represented him in her imagination rather under the frightful idea of a murderer than a lover  herod was at length acquitted and dismissed by mark anthony when his soul was all in flames for his mariamne but before their meeting he was not a little alarmed at the report he had heard of his uncles conversation and familiarity with her in his absence this therefore was the first discourse he entertained her with in which she found it no easy matter to quiet his suspicions but at last he appeared so well satisfied of her innocence that from reproaches and wranglings he fell to tears and embraces both of them wept very tenderly at their reconciliation and herod poured out his whole soul to her in the warmest protestations of love and constancy when amidst all his sighs and languishings she asked him whether the private orders he left with his uncle joseph were an instance of such an enflamed affection the jealous king was immediately roufed at so unexpected a question and concluded his uncle must have been too familiar with her before he would have discovered such a secret in short he put his uncle to death and very difficultly prevailed on himself to spare mariamne  after this he was forced on a second journey into egypt when he committed his lady to the care of sohemus with the same private orders he had before given his uncle if any mischief befell himself in the mean time mariamne had so won upon sohemus by her presents and obliging behavior that she drew all the secret from him with which herod had entrusted him so that after his return when he flew to her with all the transports of joy and love she received him coldly with sighs and tears and all the marks of indifference and aversion this reception so stirred up his indignation that he had certainly slain her with his own hands had not he feared he himself should become the greater sufferer by it it was not long after this when he had another violent return of love upon him mariamne was therefore sent for to him whom he endeavored to soften and reconcile with all possible conjugal caresses and endearments but she declined his embraces and answered all his fondness with bitter invectives for the death of her father and her brother  this behavior so incensed herod that he very hardly refrained from striking her when in the heat of their quarrel there came in a witness suborned by some of mariamnes enemies who accused her to the king of a design to poison him herod was now prepared to hear any thing in her prejudice and immediately ordered her servant to be stretched upon the rack who in the extremity of his tortures confessed that his mistresses aversion to the king arose from something sohemus had told her but as for any design of poisoning he utterly disowned the least knowledge of it this consession quickly proved fatal to sohemus who now lay under the same suspicions and sentence that joseph had before him on the like occasion nor would herod rest here but accused her with great vehemence of a design upon his life and by his authority with the judges had her publicly condemned and executed  herod soon after her decease grew melancholy and dejected retiring from the public administration of affairs into a solitary forest and there abandoned himself to all the black considerations which naturally arise from a passion made up of love remorse pity and despair he used to rave for his mariamne and to call upon her in his distracted fits and in all probability would have soon followed her had not his thoughts been seasonably called off from so sad an object by public storms which at that time very nearly threatened him    mr fenton in the conduct of this design has shown himself a very great master of stage propriety he has softened the character of herod well knowing that so cruel a tyrant as the story makes him could not be born upon the english stage he has altered the character of sohemus from an honest confident to a crafty enterprising statesman who to raise his master to the throne of judea murdered the natural heir he has introduced in his drama a character under the name of salome the kings sister who bore an implacable hatred to mariamne and who in league with sohemus pursues her revenge at no less a price than that of her brothers and the queens life  after the wars which had subsisted between caesar and anthony had subsided and the world fell to the share of the former herod is represented as having just returned from rome where as an hostage to the emperor he has stipulated to send his younger son there and flaminius a noble roman accompanies him into jewry to carry off the young prince the day in which this dramatic action begins is upon a grand festival appointed in honor of herods safe return from rome and being still permitted to enjoy his kingdom the hard condition of sending the prince to rome greatly affects the heart of the queen whom the poet has drawn a most tender mother this throws a cloud over the ceremony and furnishes an opportunity for sohemus and salome to set their infernal engines at work who in conjunction with sameas the kings cup bearer contrive to poison the king and queen at the feast but the poisoned cup is first tasted by hazeroth a young lord related to the queen and the sudden effect which it has upon him discovers the villainy  the queens absence from the feast proves a fatal circumstance and as managed by sohemus fixes the appearance of guilt upon her while herod was absent at rome sohemus made addresses to arsinoe a roman lady confidant to mariamne to whom in the ardour of his passion he revealed the secret entrusted to him by herod of putting mariamne to death in case he by any calamitous accident should lose his life arsinoe from a motive of affection communicated this to mariamne as an instance of the violent passion which herod had for her this she did immediately before her departure for rome with flaminius the roman envoy who proved to be the lord of her wishes whom she imagined to have been killed in fighting against mark anthony mariamne thrown into this imminent danger orders arsinoe to be intercepted whose return clears up her innocence as she declares that no correspondence had ever been carried on between the queen and sohemus of whom he was now jealous as mariamne had upbraided him with his cruel resolutions of putting her to death entrusted to that minister herod is satisfied of her innocence by the evidence of arsinoe but as he had before given the cruel orders for putting the queen to death she to prevent the execution of such barbarity drank poison the queen is conducted in by the high priest in the agonies of death which gives such a shock to herod that not able to survive her he dies in the sight of the audience  sohemus who knew what tortures would be reserved for him kills himself after having sacrificed sameas by whose treachery the plot was discovered and who in his falling stabs salome to the heart as the last effort of his revenge  as the plan of this play is regular simple and interesting so are the sentiments no less masterly and the characters graphically distinguished it contains likewise many beautiful strokes of poetry  when narbal a lord of the queens party gives an account to flaminius the roman general of the queens parting with her son he says  a while she stood transformed by grief to marble and appeared her own pale monument   flaminius consistent with his character as a soldier answers give me ye gods the harmony of war the trumpets clangor and the clash of arms that concert animates the glowing breast to rush on death but when our ear is pierced with the sad notes which mournful beauty yields our manhood melts in symphathising tears   the character of sameas the kings cup bearer is one of the most villainous ever shown upon a stage and the poet makes sohemus in order to give the audience a true idea of him and to prepare them for those barbarities he is to execute relate the following instance of his cruelty  along the shore he walked one evening when the clamorous rage of tempests wrecked a ship the crew were sunk the master only reached the neighboring strand born by a floating fragment but so weak with combating the storm his tongue had lost the faculty of speech and yet for aid he faintly waved his hand on which he wore a fatal jewel sameas quickly charmed both by its fize and luster with a look of pity stooped to take him by the hand then cut the finger off to gain the ring and plunged him back to perish in the waves crying go dive for more  i have heard him boast of this adventure   in the  th act when herod is agitated with the rage of jealousy his brother pheroras thus addresses him sir let her crime erase the faithful characters which love imprinted on your heart  herod alas the pain we feel whenever we dispossess the soul of that tormenting tyrant far exceeds the rigor of his rule  pheroras with reason quell that haughty passion treat it as your slave resume the monarch    the observation which herod makes upon this is very affecting the poet has drawn him so tortured with his passion that he seems almost sufficiently punished for the barbarity of cutting off the father and brother of mariamne herod where is the monarch now the vulgar call us gods and fondly think that kings are cast in more than mortal molds alas they little know that when the mind is cloyed with pomp our taste is palled to joy but grows more sensible of grief or pain the stupid peasant with as quick a sense enjoys the fragrance of a rose as i and his rough hand is proof against the thorn which rankling in my tender skin would seem a vipers tooth oh blissful poverty nature too partial to thy lot assigns health freedom innocence and downy peace her real goods and only mocks the great with empty pageantrics had i been born a cottager my homely bowl had flowed secure from poisonous drugs but not my wife let me good heaven forget that guilty name or madness will ensue    some critics have blamed mariamne for yielding her affections to herod who had embrued his hands in her father and brothers blood in this perhaps she cannot be easily defended but the poet had a right to represent this as he literally found it in history and being the circumstance upon which all the others depended though this play is one of the most beautiful in our language yet it is in many places exposed to just criticism but as it has more beauties chan faults it would be a kind of violence to candor to show the blemishes  the life of fenton like other poets who have never been engaged in public business being barren of incidents we have dwelt the longer on his works a tribute which his genius naturally demanded from us  mr fentons other poetical works were published in one volume      and consist chiefly of the following pieces an ode to the sun for the new year   0  as a specimen of which we shall quote the three following stanzas i begin celestial source of light to gild the new revolving sphere and from the pregnant womb of night urge on to birth the infant year rich with auspicious luster rise thou fairest regent of the skies conspicuous with thy silver bow to thee a god twas given by jove to rule the radiant orbs above to gloriana this below ii with joy renew thy

the memory of this great actor to give him a place among the poets if he had been less considerable in that province than he really was for he appears early to have understood the latin classics and to have succeeded in occasional pieces and little odes beyond many persons of higher name in poetry mr booth was descended from a very ancient and honorable family originally seated in the county palatine of lancaster his father john booth esquire was a man of great worth and honor and though his fortune was not very considerable he was extremely attentive to the education of his children of whom barton the third was born in       when about nine years of age he was put under the tuition of the famous dr busby headmaster of westminster school under whom some of the ablest men have been educated that in the last and present age have done honor to the nation the sprightliness of booths parts early recommended him to the notice of dr busby he had a strong passion for learning and a peculiar turn for latin poetry and by studying the best authors in it he fixed many of the finest passages so firmly in his memory that he was able to repeat them with such propriety and graceful action with so fine a tone of voice and peculiar nb as mr theophilus cibber is publishing in a work entirely undertaken by himself the lives and characters of all our eminent actors and actresses from shakespeare to the present time he leaves to the other gentlemen concerned in this collection the accounts of some players who could not be omitted herein as po emphasis that it was taken notice of by the whole school  in consequence of this happy talent when according to the custom of the school a latin play was to be acted a considerable part thereof was given to young booth who drew by the melody of his voice and the gracefulness of his action the applause of all the spectators a circumstance which first fired him with theatnical ambition much against the inclination of his father who intended him for the church and was therefore careful of his education this propension in our young roscius recommended him still more to the favor of dr busby who bestowed the most lavish encomiums upon him busby was himself a great admirer of theatrical elocution and admirably fitted by nature for the stage when he was young he obtained great applause in a part he performed in a play of cartwrights and from that moment held theatrical accomplishments in the highest esteem  when booth had reached the age of eighteen and the time approached when he was to have been sent to the university he resolved to run any risk rather than enter upon a course of life inconsistent with the liveliness of his temper and the natural bent of his inclinations it happened that there was then in london one mr ashbury who had been long master of a company at dublin with whom young booth became acquainted and finding that under his direction there was no danger of his getting a livelihood he quitted all other views stole away from school and went over to ireland with mr ashbury in school history of the english stage   he very soon distinguished himself on the stage at dublin where he had great natural advantages over most of his cotemporaries especially in tragedy he had a grave countenance a good person an air of dignity a melodious voice and a very manly action he spoke justly his cadence was grateful to the ear and his pronunciation was scholastically correct and proper he so far insinuated himself into the favor of english gentlemen in ireland and found his reputation growing to so great a height that he returned home in   0  to make a trial of his talents on the british stage he accordingly applied to lord fitzharding of the bedchamber to prince george of denmark and was by him recommended to mr betterton who took him under his care and gave him all the assistance in his power of which mr booth greatly profited  never were a tutor and pupil better met the one was capable of giving the best instructions in his own performance and the other had a promptness of conception a violent propensity and a great genius the first part booth performed in london was maximus in valentinian a play of beaumont and fletchers originally but altered and brought upon the stage by the earl of rochester the reception he met with exceeded his warmest hopes and the favor of the town had a happy effect upon him in inspiring him with a proper degree of confidence without vanity the ambitious step mother a tragedy written by mr rone in which that author has thrown out more fire and heat of poetry than in any other of his plays was about this time introduced upon the stage the part of artaban was assigned to booth in which he raised his character to such a height as to be reckoned only second to his great master  in the year   0  he married miss barkham daughter to sir william barkham of norfolk bart who lived with him six years and died without issue  in the theatrical revolutions which happened in those days mr booth notwithstanding his great capacity and reputation with the town had very little share he adhered constantly to mr betterton while he could be of any service to him and when his tutor retired from the management of the stage he trusted to his merit and the taste of the public in which he was never deceived  mr booth was particularly turned for tragedy he never could bear those parts which had not strong passion to inspire him and mr cibber observes that he could not so well melt in the lover as rage in the jealous husband othello was his masterpiece but in all his parts he was often subject to a kind of indolence which some people imagined he affected to show that even in his lazy fits he was superior to every body upon the stage as if secure of all beholders hearts neglecting he could take them drydens all for love  the late ingenious mr whitingham who perfectly understood theatrical excellence and who was beyond any man i ever knew distinct and accurate in his relations of things often told me that such was the dignity of booths appearance such his theatrical ease and gracefulness that had he only crossed the stage without uttering a word the house would be in a roar of applause  we come now to that period of time when mr booths sole merit raised him to the greatest height and procured for him that reward he had long deserved the tragedy of cato which had been written in the year   0  or at least four acts of it was brought upon the stage in      chiefly on a political principle the part of cato was given to booth for the managers were very well satissied that nobody else could perform it as party prejudice never ran higher than at that time the excellency of the play was distinguished by the surprising contests between both factions which should applaud it most so the merit of the actor received the same marks of approbation both parties taking care to show their satisfaction by bestowing upon him most liberal presents the particulars of which are already inserted in the life of addison the run of cato being over at london the managers thought fit to remove to oxford in the summer where the play met with so extraordinary a reception that they were forced to open the doors at noon and the house was quite full by one oclock the same respect was paid it for three days together and though the universal applause it met with at london surpassed any thing that had been remembered of that kind yet the tribute of praise it received from this famous university surpassed even that booth whose reputation was now at its height took the advantage of it and making his application to lord bolingbroke then at the head of the ministry he procured a new license recalling all former ones and mr booths name was added to those of cibber dogget and wilks though none of the managers had occasion to be pleased with this act of justice done to booths merit at the expense of what they deemed their property yet none of them carried their resentment so high as mr dogget who absolutely refused to accept of any consideration for his share in the scenes and clothes this obstinacy had however no other effect than depriving him of his share which brought him in  000 l a year though mr cibber informs us that this was only a pretense and that the true reason of quitting the stage was his dislike to another of the managers whose humor was become insupportable this person we conjecture to have been mr wilks who according to cibbers account was capricious in his temper though be had otherwise great merit as a player and was a good man morally considered some instances of the generosity and noble spirit of wilks are taken notice of in the life of farquhar  a few years after mr booth rose to the dignity of manager he married the celebrated miss santlowe who from her first appearance as an actress in the character of the fair quaker of deal to the time she quitted the stage had always received the strongest marks of public applause which were repeated when after a retreat of some years she appeared there again by her prudence in managing the advantages that arose to her from her reputation as an actress and her great diligence in her profession she acquired a considerable fortune which was very useful to mr booth who from the natural turn of his temper though he had a strict regard to justice was not much inclined to saving  during the few years they lived together there was the greatest harmony between them and after the death of booth his disconsolate widow who is yet alive quitted the stage and devoted herself entirely to a private course of life by degrees the health of mr booth began to decline so that it was impossible for him to continue to act with so much diligence as usual but at whatever time he was able to return to the stage the town demonstrated their respect for him by crowding the house being attacked by a complication of distempers he paid the debt to nature may  0      a copy of his will was printed in the london magazine for      p     in which we find he testified his esteem for his wife to whom he left all his fortune for reasons there assigned which he declared amounted to no more than two thirds of what he had received from her on the day of marriage his character as an actor has been celebrated by the best judges and was never questioned by any  and here we cannot resist the opportunity of showing mr booth in that full and commanding light in which he is drawn by the late ingenious aaron hill esqwho had long experience in the affairs of the stage and could well distinguish the true merits of an actor his words are two advantages distinguished him in the strongest light from the rest of his fraternity he had learning to understand perfectly what it was his part to speak and judgment to know how far it agreed or disagreed with his character hence arose a peculiar grace which was visible to every spectator though few were at the pains of examining into the cause of their pleasure he could soften and slide over with a kind of elegant negligence the improprieties in the part he acted while on the contrary he would dwell with energy upon the beauties as if he exerted a latent spirit which had been kept back for such an occasion that he might alarm awaken and transport in those places only where the dignity of his own good sense could be supported by that of his author a little reflection upon this remarkable quality will teach us to account for that manifest languor which has sometimes been observed in his action and which was generally though i think falsely imputed to the natural indolence of his temper for the same reason though in the customary round of his business he would condescend to some parts in comedy he seldom appeared in any of them with much advantage to his character the passions which he found in comedy were not strong enough to excite his fire and what seemed want of qualification was only the absence of impression he had a talent at discovering the passions where they lay hid in some celebrated parts by the injudicious practice of other actors when he had discovered he soon grew able to express them and his secret of his obtaining this great lesson of the theater was an adaption of his look to hns voice by which artful imitation of nature the variations in the sound of his words gave propriety to every change in his countenance so that it was mr booths peculiar felicity to be heard and seen the same whether as the pleased the grieved the pitying the reproachful or the angry one would be almost tempted to borrow the aid of a very bold figure and to express this excellence more significantly beg permission to affirm that the blind might have seen him in his voice and the deaf have heard him in his visage his gesture or as it is commonly called his action was but the result and necessary consequence of his dominion over his voice and countenance for having by a concurrence of two such causes impressed his imagination with such a stamp and spirit of passion he ever obeyed the impulse by a kind of natural dependency and relaxed or braced successively into all that fine expressiveness with which he painted what he spoke without restraint or affectation    but it was not only as a player that mr booth excelled he was a man of letters also and an author in more languages than one he had a taste for poetry which we have observed discovered itself when he was very young in translations of some odes of horace and in his riper years he wrote several songs and other original poems which did him honor he was also the author of a masque or dramatic entertainment called dido and aeneas which was very well received upon the stage but which however did not excite him to produce any thing of the same kind afterward his masterpiece was a latin inscription to the memory of a celebrated actor mr william smith one of the greatest men of his profession and of whom mr booth always spoke in raptures it is a misfortune that we can give no particular account of the person this excellent inscription referred to but it is probable he was of a good family since he was a barrister at law of graysinn before he quitted that profession for the stage  the inscription is as follows scenicus eximius in english thus an excellent player  such the life and character of mr booth who deservedly stood very high in the esteem of mankind both on account of the pleasure which he gave them and the native goodness of heart which he possessed whether considered as a private gentleman a player a scholar or a poet mr booth makes a very great figure and his extraordinary excellence in his own profession while it renders his memory dear to all men of taste will ever secure him applause amongst those happy few who were born to instruct to please and reform their countrymen  dr george sewel this ingenious gentleman was the eldest son of mr john sewel treasurer and chapterclerk of the college of windsor in which place our poet was born he received his education at eton school was afterward sent to the university of cambridge and took the degree of bachelor of physic at peterhouse college he then passed over to leyden and studied under the famous boerhaave and afterward returned to london where for several years he practiced as a physician he had a strong propension for poetry and has favored the world with many performances much applauded in the year      he introduced upon the stage his tragedy of sir walter raleigh taken from the historical account of that great mans fate he was chiefly concerned in writing the fifth volume of the tatler and the ninth of the spectator he translated with some other gentlemen the metamorphoses of ovid with very great success and rendered the latin poems of mr addison into english dr sewel made an attempt which he had not leisure to execute of translating quillets

was descended from a good family of somershamplace in the county of huntingdon and was born in the year      coxeters miscellaneous notes  when he arrived at a proper age he was chosen member of parliament and did not remain long in the house before he distinguished himself as a very eminent speaker having espoused the court interest his zeal and merit recommended him to very considerable public employments particularly that of being one of the commissioners of the royal navy which place he quitted in the year      the ingenious mr southern in his dedication of his innocent adultery to mr hammond speaks thus of him if generosity with friendship learning with good sense true wit and humor with goodnature be accomplishments to qualify gentleman for a patron i am sure i have hit right in mr hammond  our author obliged the public with a miscellany of original poems by the most eminent hands in which himself had no small share in this miscellany are several poetical performances of mrs martha fowkes a lndy of exquisite taste in the belle accomplishments  as to mr hammonds own pieces he acknowleges in his preface that they were written at very different times and particularly owned by him lest they should afterward be ascribed to other persons as the ode on solitude was falsely ascribed to the earl of roscommon and other pieces of his were likewise given to other authors  this author wrote the life of walter moyle esquire prefixed to his works  mr hammond died about the year       the revd mr lawrence eusden this gentleman was descended from a very good family in the kingdom of ireland but received his education at trinitycollege in cambridge he was honored with the encouragement of that eminent patron of the poets the earl of halifax to whom he consecrated the first product of his muse he enjoyed likewise the patronage of the duke of newcastle who being lord chamberlain at the death of mr row preferred him to the bays  mr eusden was for some part of his life chaplain to richard lord willoughby de brook in this peaceful situation of life one would not expect mr eusden should have any enemies either of the literary or any other sort but we find he has had many amongst whom mr pope is the most formidable both in power and keenness in his dunciad book i line  0  where he represents dullness taking a view of her sons he says she saw old prya in restless daniel shine and eusden eke out blackmores endless line   mr oldmixon likewise in his art of logic and rhetoric page     affirms that of all the galimatias he ever met with none comes up to some verses of this poet which have as much of the ridiculum and the fustian in them as can well be jumbled together and are of that sort of nonsense which so perfectly confounds all ideas that there is no distinct one left in the mind further he says of him that he has prophesied his own poetry shall be sweeter than catullus ovid and tibullus but we have little hope of the accomplishment of it from what he has lately published upon which mr oldmixon has not spared a ressexion that the placing the laurel on the head of one who wrote such verses will give posterity a very lively idea of the justice and judgment of those who bestowed it  mr oldmixon no doubt by this reflection insinuates that the laurel would have better become his own brows than eusdens but it would perhaps have been more decent for him to acquiesce in the opinion of the duke of buckingham shefileld who in his session of the poets thus mentions eusden  in rushed eusden and cried who shall have it but i the true laureat to whom the king gave it apollo begged pardon and granted his claim but vowed that till then he never heard of his name   the truth is mr eusden wrote an epithalamium on the marriage of his grace the duke of newcastle to the right honorable the lady henrietta godolphin which was considered as so great a compliment by the duke that in gratitude for it he preferred him to the laurel nor can i at present see how he could have made a better choice we shall have occasion to find as we enumerate his writings that he was no inconsiderable versisier and though perhaps he had not the brightest parts yet as we hear of no moral blemish imputed to him and as he was dignified with holyorders his grace acted a very generous part in providing for a man who had conferred an obligation on him the first rate poets were either of principles very different from the government or thought themselves too distinguished to undergo the drudgery of an annual ode and in this case eusden seems to have had as fair a claim as another at least a better than his antagonist oldmixon he succeeded indeed a much greater poet than himself the ingenious mr row which might perhaps draw some ridicule upon him  mr cook in his battle of the poets speaks thus of our author eusden a laureled bard by fortune raised by very few was read by fewer praised   a fate which some critics are of opinion must befall the very poet himself who is thus so ready to expose his brother  the chief of our authors poetical writings are these to the lord hallifax occasioned by the translating into latin his lordships poem on the battle of the boyne on the duke of marlboroughs victory at oudenard a letter to mr addison on the kings accession to the throne to the reverend doctor bentley on the opening of trinitycollege

of his present majesty iii on the queen on the arrival of prince frederic the origin of the knights of the bath inscribed to the duke of cumberland an ode for the birthday in latin and english printed at cambridge   he died at his rectory at conesby in lincolnshire the   th of september    0  the revd mr lawrence eachard this gentleman who has been more distinguished as an historian than a poet was the son of a clergyman who by the death of his elder brother became master of a good estate in suffolk  he received his education at the university of cambridge entered into holyorders and was presented to the living of welton and elkington in lincolnshire where he spent above twenty years of his life and acquired a name by his writings especially the history of england this history was attacked by dr edmund calamy in a letter to the author in which according to the dr the true principles of the revolution the whigs and the dissenters are vindicated and many persons of distinction cleared from mr eachards aspersions  mr john oldmixon who was of very opposite principles to eachard severely animadverted upon him in his critical history of england during the reigns of the stuarts but as oldmixon was a hireling and a man strongly biassed by party prejudices little credit is due to his testimony which is moreover accompanied with a perpetual torrent of abuse mr eachards general ecclesiastical history from the nativity of christ to the first establishment of christianity by human laws under the emperor constantine the great has been much esteemed  our author was in the year      installed archdeacon of stowe and prebend of lincoln he published a translation of terences comedies translated by himself and others but all revised and corrected by him and sir roger lestrange to which is prefixed the life of terence besides these mr eachard has translated three comedies from plautus viz amphitryon epidicus rudens   with critical remarks upon each play to which he has prefixed a judicious parallel between terence and plautus and for a clearer decision of the point that terence was the more polite writer of comedy he produces the first act of plautuss aulnlaria and the first act of his miles gloriosus against the third act of terences eunuch it ought to be observed says mr eachard that plautus was somewhat poor and made it his principal aim to please and tickle the common people and since they were almost always delighted with something new strange and unusual the better to humor them he was not only frequently extravagant in his expressions but likewise in his characters too and drew them often more vicious more covntous and more soolish than they really were and this so set the people a gazing and wondering with these sort of characters many of our modern comedies abound which makes them too much degenerate into farce which seldom fails of plensing the mob  mr eachard has in justice to mr dryden given us some instances of his improvement of amphitryon and concludes them with this just remark in compliment to our nation we find that many fine things of the ancients are like seeds that when planted on english ground by a poets skilful hand thrive and produce excellent fruit  these three plays are printed in a pocketvolume dedicated to sir charles sodley to which is prefixed a recommendatory copy of verses by mr tate  mr eachard died in the year    0  mr john oldmixon was descended from the ancient family of the oldmixons of oldmixon near bridgewater in somersetshire see jacobs lives of the poets p      we have no account of the education of this gentleman nor the year in which he was born the first production we meet with of his was amyntas a pastoral acted at the theater royal taken from the amynta of tasso the preface informs us that it met with but ill success for pastoral though never so well written is not fit for a long entertainment on the english theater but the original pleased in italy where the performance of the musical composer is generally more regarded than that of the poet the prologue was written by mr dennis  mr oldmixons next piece was entitled the grave or loves paradise an opera represented at the theater royal in drury lane   00 in the preface the author acquaints the critics that this play is neither translation nor parody that the story is entirely new that twas at first intended for a pastoral though in the three last acts the dignity of the character raised it into the sorm of a tragedy the scene a province of italy near the gulf of venice the epilogue was written by mr farquhar  our authors next dramatic piece is entitled the governor of cyprus a tragedy acted at the theater royal in lincolnsinnfields dedicated to her grace the duchess of bolton  mr oldmixon in a proof essay on criticism unjustly censures mr addison whom also in his imitation of pouhours arts of logic and rhetoric he misrepresents in plain matter of fact for in page    he cites the spectator as abusing dr swift by name where there is not the least hint of it and in page  0  is so injurious as to suggest that mr addison himself wrote that tatler numb xliii which says of his own simile that it is as great as ever entered into the mind of man this simile is in addisons poem entitled the campaign where says the author of the letter the simile of a ministering angel sets forth the most sedate and the most active courage engaged in an uproar of nature a confusion of elements and a scene of divine vengeance twas then great marlbros mighty soul was proved that in the shock of charging hosts unmoved amidst confusion horror and despair examined all the dreadful scenes of war in peaceful thought the field of death surveyed to fainting squadrons sent the timely aid inspired repulsed battalions to engage and taught the doubtful battle where to rage so when an angel by divine command with rising tempests shakes a guilty land such as of late over pale britannia past calm and serene he drives the furious blast and pleased the almightys orders to perform rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm   that this letter could not be written by mr addison there is all the evidence the nature of the thing will admit to believe for first sir richard steel avowed it to be his and in the next place it is not probable that mr addison himself had so high an opinion of this simile as to call it as great as ever entered into the thought of man for it has in reality no uncommon greatness in it the image occurs a thousand times in the book of psalms so that it has not novelty to recommend it and the manner of its being expressed is no way extraordinary the high terms in which it is celebrated is the language of friendship not of judgment it is very probable sir richard steel warmed with a favorite subject and zealous for the fame of addison might express himself thus hyperbolically concerning it but mr addison was too judicious a critic to think or speak of it in these terms and was besides too cautious to run the risk of doing it himself in so public a manner in a word mr oldmixon was an envious man and we have seen with how little ground of resentmnnt he railed against eusden because that gentleman was preferred to the laurel  mr oldmixon joined the general cry of the underling writers against mr pope and wrote many letters in the flying post with an intention to reduce his reputation with as little success as his other antagonists had done in his prose essay on criticism and in the arts of logic and rhetoric he frequently reflects on pope for which he has received a place in his dunciad  when that eminent satyrist in his second book line   0 represents the dunces diving for the prize of dullness he in a particular manner dignifies oldmixon for he makes him climb a lighter that by leaping from it he may sink the deeper in the mud in naked majesty oldmixon stands and milolike surveys his arms and hands then sighing thus  and am i now threescore  ah why ye gods should two and two make four he said and climbed a stranded lighters height shot to the black abyss and plunged downright the seniors judgment all the crowd admire who but to sink the deeper rose the higher   mr oldmixon wrote a history of the stuarts in folio and a critical history of england in two volumes octavo the former of these pieces was undertaken to blacken the family of the stuarts the most impartial writers and candid critics on both sides have held this work in contempt for in every page there breathes a malevolent spirit a disposition to rail and calumniate so far from observing that neutrality and dispassionate evenness of tempen which should be carefully attended to by every historian he suffers himself to be transported with anger he reviles wrests particular passages and frequently drans forced conclusions a history written in this spirit has no great claim to a readers faith the reigns of the stuarts in england were no doubt checkered with many evils and yet it is certainly true that a man who can sit deliberately down to search for errors only must have a strong propension to calumny or at least take delight in triumphing over the weakness of his fellow creatures which is surely no indication of a good heart  mr oldmixon being employed by bishop kennet in publishing the historians in his collection he i erverted daniels chronicle in numberless places yet this very man in the preface to the first of these advanced a particular fact to charge three eminent persons of interpolating the lord clarendons history which fact has been disproved by the bishop of rochester dr atterbury then the only survivor of then and the particular part he pretended to be falsified produced since after almost ninety years in that noble authors own hand  he was all his life a virulent partywriter and received his reward in a small post in the revenue at i iverpool where he died in an advanced age but in what year we cannot learn  mr oldmixon besides the works we have mentioned was author of a volume of poems published in      the life of arthur maynwaring esquire prefixed to the works of that author by mr oldmixon englands historical epistles draytons revived the life of queen anne   leonard welsted esquire this gentleman was descended from a very good family in leicestershire and received the rudiments of his education in westminster school we are informed by major cleland author of a panegyric on mr pope prefixed to the dunciad that he was a member of both the universities  in a piece said to have been written by mr welsted called the characters of the times printed in  vo      he gives this account of himself mr welsted had in his youth raised so great expectations of his future genius that there was a kind of struggle between the two universities which should have the honor of his education to compound this he civilly became a member of both and after having passed some time at the one he removed to the other from thence he returned to town where he became the darling expectation of all the polite writers whose encouragement he acknowledged in his occasional poems in a manner that will make no small part of the fame of his protectors it also appears from his works that he was happy in the patronage of the most illustrious characters of the present age encouraged by such a combination in his favor he published a book of poems some in the ovidian some in the horatian manner in both which the most exquisite judges pronounced he even rivalled his masters his love verses have rescued that way of writing from contempt in his translations he has given us the very soul and spirit of his author his odes his epistles his verses his love tales all are the most perfect things in all poetry  if this representation of our authors abilities were just it would seem no wonder if the two universities should strive with each other for the honor of his education but it is certain the world have not coincided with this opinion of mr welsted who by the way can hardly be thought the author of such an extravagant selfappiobation unless it be an irony which does not seem improbable  our author however does not appear to have been a mean poet he had certainly from nature an exceeding fine genius but after he came to town he became a votary to pleasure and the applauses of his friends which taught him to overvalue his talents perhaps slackened his diligence and by making him trust solely to nature slight the assistance of art  in the year      he wrote the triumvirate or a letter in verse from palemon to celia from bath which was meant as a satire against mr pope he wrote several other occasional pieces against this gentleman who in recompense of his enmity has mentioned him twice in his dunciad in book ii l  00 where he represents the poets flattering their patrens with the fulsome strains of panegyric in order to procure from them that which they very much wanted viz money he shows welsted as unsuccessful but welsted most the poets healing balm strives to extract from hi  giving palm unlucky welsted thy ling master the more thou ticest gripes his fist the faster   mr welsted was likewise characterised in the treatise of the art of sinking as a didapper and after as an eel he was likewise described under the character of another animal a mole by the author of the following simile which was handed about at the same time dear welsted mark in dirty hole that painful animal a mole above ground never born to go what mighty stir it keeps below to make a molehill all this strife it digs pokes undermines for life how proud a little dirt to spread conscious of nothing over its head till laboring on for want of eyes it blunders into light  and dies but mentioning him once was not enough for mr pope he is again celebrated in the third book in that famous parody upon denhams coopers hill o could i flow like thee and make thy stream my great example as it is my theme though deep yet clear though gentle yet not dull strong without rage without over flowing full denham which mr pope has thus parodied flow welsted flow like thine inspirer beer though stale not ripe though thin yet never clear so sweetly mawkish and so smoothly dull heady not strong and foaming though not full   how far mr popes insinuation is true that mr welsted owed his inspiration to beer they who read his works may determine for themselves poets who write satire often strain hard for ridiculous circumstances in order to expose their antagonists and it will be no violence to truth to say that in search of ridicule candor is frequently lost  in the year      mr welsted brought upon the stage a comedy called the dissembled wanton or my son get money he met with the patronage of the duke of newcastle who was a great encourager of polite learning and we find that our author had a very competent place in the ordnanceoffice  his poetical works are chiefly these the duke of marlboroughs arrival a poem printed in fol   0  inscribed to the right hon the earl of dorset and middlesex a poem to the memory of mr philips inscribed to lord bolingbroke printed in fol    0 a discourse to the right hon sir robert walpole to which is annexed proposals for translating the whole works of horace with a specimen of the performance viz lib is it

arthur more esquire one of the lords commissioners of trade in the reign of queen anne his mother was the daughter of mr smyth a man of considerable fortune who left this his grandson a handsome estate on which account he obtained an act of parliament to change his name to smyth  cur author received his education at oxford and while he remained at the university he wrote a comedy called the rival modes his only dramatic performance this play was condemned in the representation but he printed it in      with the following motto which the author of the notes to the dunciad by way of irony calls modest hic coestus artemque repono  upon the death of our authors grandfather he enjoyed the place of paymaster to the band of gentlemenpensioners in conjunction with his younger brother arthur more of this place his mother procured the reversion from his late majesty during his fathers lifetime being a man of a gay disposition he insinuated himself into the favor of his grace the duke of wharton and being like him destitute of prudence he joined with that volatile great man in writing a paper called the inquisitor which breathed so much the spirit of jacobitism that the publisher thought proper to sacrifice his profit to his safety and discontinue it  by using too much freedom with the character of lope he provoked that gentleman who with great spirit stigmatized him in his dunciad in his second book mr pope places before the eyes of the dunces the phantom of a poet he seems willing to give some account of the possibility of dullness making a wit which can be done no otherwise than by chance the lines which have relation to mr more are so elegantly satyric that it probably will not displease our readers to find them inserted here a poets form she placed before their eyes and bad the nimblest racer seize the prize no meagre muserid mope adust and thin in a dun nightgown of his own loose skin but such a bulk as no twelve bards could raise twelve starvling bards of these degenerate days all as a partridge plump fullfed and fair she formed this image of wellbodied air with pert flat eyes she windowd well its head a brain of feathers and a heart of lead and empty words she gave and sounding strain but senseless lifeless idol void and vain never was dashed out at one lucky hit a fool so just a copy of a wit so like that critics said and courtiers swore a wit it was and called the phantom more   though these lines of pope are sufficiently satirical yet it seems they very little affected mr more a gentleman intimately acquainted with him informs us that he has heard mr more several times repeat those lines without discovering any chagrin and he used to observe that he was now secure of being transmitted to posterity an honor which says he i could never have arrived at but by popes means the cause of the quarrel between this gentleman and that great poet seems to have been this  in a letter published in the daily journal march         written by mr more he has the following words upon reading the third volume of popes miscellanies i found five lines which i thought excellent and happening to praise them a gentleman produced a modern comedy the rival modes published last year where were the same verses to a tittle these gentlemen are undoubtedly the first plagiaries that pretend to make a reputation by stealing from a mans works in his own lifetime and out of a public print but it is apparent from the notes to the dunciad that mr more himself borrowed the lines from pope for in a letter dated january         addressed to mr pope he observes that these verses which he had before given him leave to insert in the rival modes would be known for his some copies being got abroad he desires nevertheless that since the lines in his comedy have been read to several mr pope would not deprive it of them  as a proof of this circumstance the testimony of lord bolingbroke is adduced and the lady of hugh bethel esquire to whom the verses were originally addressed who knew them to be mr popes long before the rival modes was composed  our author further charges mr pope with being an enemy to the church and state the memoirs of a parish clerk says he was a very dull and unjust abuse of the bishop of sarum who wrote in defense of our religion and constitution who has been dead many years this also continues the author of the notes to the dunciad is likewise untrue it being known to diverse that these memoirs were written at the seat of the lord harcourt in oxfordshire before the death of bishop burnet and many years before the appearance of that history of which they are pretended to be an abuse most true it is that mr more had such a design and was himself the man who pressed dr arbuthnot and mr pope to assist him therein and that he borrowed those memoirs of the latter when that history came forth with intent to turn them to such abuse but being able to obtain from pope but one single hint and either changing his mind or having more mind than ability he contented himself to keep the said memoirs and read them as his own to all his acquaintance a noble person there is into whose company pope once chanced to introduce him who well remembered the conversation of mr more to have turned upon the contempt he had for that reverend prelate and how full he was of a design he declared himself to have of exposing him this noble person is the earl of peterborough  thus mr pope was obliged to represent this gentleman as a plagiary or to pass for one himself his case indeed as the author of the notes to the dunciad observes was like that of a man who as he was sitting in company perceived his next neighbor had stolen his handkerchief sir said the thief finding himself detected do not expose me i did it for mere want be so good but to take it privately out of my pocket again and say nothing the honest man did so but the other cried out see gentlemen what a thief we have among us look he is stealing my handkerchief  the plagiarism of this person gave occasion to the following epigram more always smiles whenever he recites he smiles you think approving what he writes and yet in this no vanity is shown a modest man may like what is not his own   the smaller pieces which we have heard attributed to this author are an epigram on the bridge at blenheim by dr evans cosmelia by mr pit mr jones etc the sawpit a simile by a friend and some unowned letters advertisements and epigrams against mr pope in the daily journal he died in the year      and as he wrote but one comedy unsuccessfully and no other pieces of his meeting with any applause the reader will probably look upon him as a man of little genius he had a power however of rendering his conversation agreeable by a facetious and gentlemanlike manner without any of the stiffness of the scholar or the usual petulance of a poet he always lived in affluent circumstances and by mixing with genteel company his habit of elegance was never lost a fate which too frequently happens to those who notwithstanding the brightest parts are excluded the circle of politeness by the oppressions of poverty in this light mr pope must have considered him or he who was one of the politest men of the age as well as the greatest poet would never have introduced him to the earl of peterborough it does not appear that mr more had parts otherwise sufficient to entitle him to the notice of pope and therefore he must have considered him only as a gentleman had he possessed as much prudence as politeness he would have avoided by all means incurring the displeasure of pope who as he was the warmest friend was likewise a very powerful and implacable enemy in this controversy however it is evident enough that mr moore was the aggressor and it is likewise certain that his punishment has been equal to his offense  he died october         at whister near isleworth in middlesex for which county he was a justice of peace  mr john dennis this celebrated critic was born in london in the year      his father being a sadler and an eminent citizen jacobs lives of the poets   he received his early education at harrow on the hill under the pious and learned dr william horn having for his schoolfellows many young noblemen who afterward made a considerable figure in the state he removed from harrow to caius college in cambridge where he was admitted january         in the   th year of his age in due time mr dennis took the degree of bachelor of arts and after quitting the university he indulged a passion which he had entertained for traveling and set out for france and taly in the course of his travels he no doubt made such observations upon the government and genius of the people whom he visited as enabled him to make a just comparison between foreign states and his own country in all probability while he was in france and italy he conceived an abhorrence of despotic government the effects of which he then had an opportunity more intimately to discern for he returned home still more confirmed in whig principles by which his political conduct was ever governed  our author in his early years became acquainted with some of the brightest geniuses which then illuminated the regions of wit such as dryden wycherly congreve and southern their conversation was in itself sufficient to divert his mind from the acquisition of any profitable art or the exercise of any profession he ranked himself amongst the wits and from that moment held every attainment in contempt except what related to poetry and taste  mr dennis by the instances of zeal which he gave for the protestant succession in the reign of king william and queen anne obtained the patronage of the duke of marlborough who procured him the place of one of the queens waiters in ne customhouse worth   0 l per annum which mr dennis held for six years during the time n attended at the customhouse he lived so profusely and managed his affairs with so little economy that in order to discharge some pressing demands he was obliged to dispose of his place when the earl of hallifax with whom he had the honor of being acquainted heard of mr denniss design he sent for him and in the most friendly manner expostulated with him upon the folly and rashness of disposing of his place by which says his lordship you will soon become a beggar mr dennis represented his exigences and the pressing demands that were then made upon him which did not however satisfy his lordship who insisted if he did sell it it should be with some reversion to himself for the space of forty years a term which the earl had no notion mr dennis could exceed but he was mistaken in his calculation upon our poets constitution who outlived the term of forty years stipulated when he sold his place and fulfilled in a very advanced age what his lordship had prophesied would befall him this circumstance our author hints at in his dedication of his poem on the battle of ramellies to lord hallifax i have lately says he had very great obligations to your lordship you have been pleased to take some care of my fortune at a time when i most wanted it and had the least reason to expect it from you this poem on the battle of ramellies is a cold unspirited performance it has neither fire nor elevation and is the true poetical sister of another poem of his on the battle of blenheim addressed to queen anne and for which the duke of marlborough rewarded him says mr coxeter with a present of a hundred guineas in these poems he has introduced a kind of machinery good and bad angels interest themselves in the action and his hero the duke of marlborough enjoys a large share of the celestial protection  mr dennis had once contracted a friendship which friendship he ill repaid sir richard once became bail for dennis who hearing that sir richard was arrested on his account cried out sdeath why did not he keep out of the way as i did with sir richard steel whom he afterward severely attacked sir richard had promised that he would take some opportunity of mentioning his works in public with advantage and endeavor to raise his reputation when sir richard engaged in a periodical paper there was a fair occasion of doing it and accordingly in one of his spectators he quotes the following couplet which he is pleased to call humorous but which however is a translation from boileau one fool lolls his tongue out at another and shakes his empty noddle at his brother   the citation of this couplet mr dennis imagined was rather meant to affront him than pay a compliment to his genius as he could discover nothing excellent in the lines and if there was they being only a translation in some measure abated the merit of them being fired with resentment at this affront he immediately in a spirit of fury wrote a letter to the spectator in which he treated him with very little ceremony and informed him that if he had been sincere in paying a compliment to him he should have chosen a quotation from his poem on the battle of ramellies he then points out a particular passage of which he himself had a very high opinion and which we shall here insert as a specimen of that performance  a celestial spirit visits the duke of marlborough the night before the battle and after he has said several other things to him goes on thus a wondrous victory attends thy arms great in itself and in its sequel vast whose ecchoing sound through all the west shall run transporting the glad nations all around who often shall doubt and often suspend their joy and often imagine all an empty dream the conqueror himself shall cry amazed it is not our work alas we did it not the hand of god the hand of god is here for thee so great shall be thy high renown that fame shall think no music like thy name around the circling globe it shall be spread and to the worlds last ages shall endure and the most losty most aspiring man shall want the assurance in his secret prayers to ask such high felicity and fame as heaven has freely granted thee yet this that seems so great so glorious to thee now would look how low how vile to thy great mind if i could set before the astonished eyes the excess of glory and the excess of bliss that is prepared for thy expiring soul when thou arrivst at everlasting day   the quotation by mr dennis is longer but we are persuaded the reader will not be displeased that we do not take the trouble to transcribe the whole as it does not improve but rather grows more languid how strangely are people deceived in their own productions in the language of sincerity we cannot discover a poetical conception one striking image or one animated line in the above and yet mr dennis observes to sir richard steel that these are the lines by quoting which he would really have done him honor  but mr denniss resentment did not terminate here he attempted to expose a paper in the spectator upon dramatic conduct in which the author endeavors to show that a poet is not always obliged to distribute poetical justice on this very reasonable account that good and evil happen alike to all men on this side the grave to this proposition our critic objects that it is not only a very false but a dangerous assertion that we neither know what men really are nor what they suffer besides says he let it be considered that a man is a creature who is created immortal and a creature consequently that will find a compensation in futurity for any seeming inequality in his destiny here but the creatures of a poetical creator are imaginary and transitory they have no longer duration than the representation of their respective fables and consequently if they offend they must be punished during that representation and therefore we are very far from pretending that poetical justice is an equal representation of the justice of the almighty in support of this opinion our critic produces the example of euripides and the best poets amongst the ancients who practiced it and the authority of aristotle who established the rule but nature or shakespeare which is another word for nature is by no means in favor of this equal distribution no character can be represented in tragedy absolutely perfect as no such character exists but a character which possesses more virtues than vices may be upon the whole amiable and yet with the strictest propriety may be made the chief sufferer in the drama if any passion strongly predominates in the heart of man it will often expose him to such snares entangle him in such difficulties and oppress him with such wants that in the very nature of things he must sink under the complicated weight of misery this may happen to a character extremely amiable the passion which governs him may be termed unhappy but not guilty or if it should partake the nature of guilt fallible creatures cannot always combat with success against guilty passions  the drama being an imitation of nature the poet causes a composition of characters formed in his imagination to be represented by players these characters charm or displease not only for what they do during the representation of the fable but we love or hate them for what they have done before their appearance and we dread or warmly expect the consequences of their resolutions after they depart the stage the illusion would not be sufficiently strong if we did not suppose the dramatic persons equanly accountable to the powers above us as we are ourselves this shakespeare has taken care forcibly to impress upon his audience in making the ghost of the murdered king of denmark charge his son not to touch his mothers life but leave her to heaven and the reflections of her own conscience to goad and sting her  mr denniss reasoning upon the whole amounts to this that no perfect character should suffer in the drama to which it may be answered that no perfect character ever did suffer in the drama because no poet who draws from nature ever introduced one for this very good reason that there are none in existence  mr dennis who was restless in attacking those writers who met with success levelled some more criticisms against the spectators and amongst the rest endeavored to expose mr addisons illustrations of the old ballad called chevy chase of which we shall only say that he performed this task mnre successfully than he executed his animadversions upon poetical justice  we have already taken notice of the warm attachment mr dennis always had to the whiginterest and his particular zeal for the hanoverian succession he wrote many letters and pamphlets for the administration of the earl of godolphin and the duke of marlborough and never failed to lash the french with all the severity natural to him  when the peace which the whigs reckoned the most inglorious that ever was made was about to be ratified mr dennis who certainly overrated his importance took it into his imagination that when the terms of peace should be stipulated some persons who had been most active against the french would be demanded by that nation as hostages and he imagined himself of importance enough to be made choice of but dreaded his being given up to the french as the greatest evil that could befall him under the influence of this strong delusion he actually waited on the duke of mariborough and begged his graces interposition that he might not be sacrificed to the french for says he i have always been their enemy to this strange request his grace very gravely replied do not fear mr dennis you shall not be given up to the french i have been a greater enemy to them than you and you see i am not afraid of being sacrificed nor am in the least disturbed mr dennis upon this retired well satisfied with his graces answer but there still remained upon his spirits a dread of his becoming a prey to some of the enemies of great britain  he soon after this retired into the country to spend some time at a friends house while he was walking one day by the sea side he saw a ship in fall sail approaching toward the shore which his distracted imagination dictated was a french ship sent to carry him off he hurnied to the gentlemans house with the utmost precipitation upbraided him with treachery as being privy to the attempts of the french against his life and without ceremony quitted his house and posted to london as fast as he could  mr dennis who never cared to be an unconcerned spectator when any business of a public or important nature was in agitation entered the lists with the celebrated mr sacheverel who in the year   0  published at oxford a piece called the political union the purport of which was to show that the church and the state are invariably connected and that the one cannot subsist without the other mr dennis in answer to this in a letter to a member of parliament with much zeal force of argument and less ferocity than usual endeavors to overthrow the proposition and show the danger of priestcraft both to religion and government  in this letter he very sensibly observes that since the very spirit of the christian religion is the spirit of union and charity it follows by consequence that a spirit of division is a spirit of malice and of the devil a true son of the church is he who appears most for union who breathes nothing but charity who neglects all worldly greatness to bear his masters yoke and who has learned of him to be meek and lowly of heart  he shows that the moderate part of the church of england are the truest church and that violent party which differs from the moderate ought to be called dissenters because they are at a greater distance from charity which is the characteristic of a true church than any dissenters by which says he it appears that mr sacheverel has made a rod to whip himself for if only the true church of england is to remain and if the moderate part is the true church the most violent ought the least to be tolerated because they differ from charity and consequently are more ready to disturb the public peace  in   0  he published proposals for putting a speedy end to the war by ruining the commerce of the french and spaniards and securing our own without any addntional expense to the natnon this was thought a very judicious and well designed plan  in   0  our author published an essay on the italian opera in which with an irresistible force he shows the extreme danger that a generous nation is exposed to by too much indulging effeminate music in the preface he quotes a passage from boileau in which that satirist expresses himself with much severity against emasculating diversions and the italian music in particular  he observes that the modern italians have the very same sun and soil with the ancient romans and yet are their manners directly opposite their men are neither virtuous wise or valiant and they who have reason to know their women never trust them out of their sight it is impossible to give any reason for so great a difference between the ancient romans and the modern italians but only luxury and the reigning luxury of modern italy is that soft and effeminate music which abounds in the opera  in this essay mr dennis remarks that entertainments entirely made up of music can never instruct the mind nor promote one excellent purpose in human nature perhaps says he the pride and vanity that is in mankind may determine the generality to give into music at the expense of poetry men love to enjoy their pleasures entirely and not to have them restrained by awe or curbed by mortification now there are but few judicious spectators at our dramatic representations since none can be so but who with great endowments of nature have had a very generous education and the rest are frequently mortified by passing foolish judgments but in music the case is vastly dinerent to judge of that requires only use and a fine ear which the footman often has a great deal finer than his master in short a man without common sense may very well judge of what a man writes without common sense and without common sense composes he then inquires what the consequence will be if we banish poetry which is that taste politeness erudition and public spirit will fall with it and all for a song  the declension of poetry in greece and rome was soon followed by that of liberty and empire according to roscommon in his essay on translated verse true poets are the guardians of a state and when they fail portend approaching fate for that which rome to conquest did innpire was not the vestal but the muses fire heaven joins the blessings no declining age ever felt the raptures of poetic rage   in      mr dennis published an essay upon public spirit being a satire in prose upon the manners and luxury of the times the chief sources of our present parties and divisions this is one of the most finished performances of our author the intention is laudable and the execution equal to the goodness of the design he begins the essay with a definition of the love of our country shows how much the phrase has been prostituted and how seldom understood or practiced in its genuine sense he then observes how destructive it is to indulge an imitation of foneign fashions that fashions are often followed by the manners of a people from whom they are borrowed as in the beginning of king charles the iids reign after the general distraction which was immediately consequent upon the restoration lord halifax informs us the people began to shake off their slavery in point of dress and to be ashamed of their servility in that particular and that they might look the more says his lordship like a distinct people they threw off their fashions and put on vests the french did not like this independence this slnght shown to their taste as they thought it portended no good to their politics considering that it is a natural introduction first to make the world their asses that they may afterward make them their slaves they sent over the duchess of portsmouth who besides many other commissions bore one to laugh us out of our vests which she performed so effectually that in a moment we were like so many footmen who had quitted their masters livery we took it again and returned to our old service so that the very time of doing thi gave a very critical advantage to france since it looked like an evidence of returning to their interests as well as their fashions  after giving this quotation from the marquis of halifax he proceeds to inveigh against the various kinds of luxury in which people of fashion indulge themselves  he observes that luxury has in a particular manner been destructive to the ladies that artifical dainties raise in their constitutions fierce ebullitions and violent emotions too rude for the delicate texture of their fibers and for half the year together they neither take any air nor use any exercise to remove them from hence distempers of body and mind from hence an infinity of irregular desires unlawful amors intrigues vapors and whimsies and all the numerous melancholy crowd of deep hysterical symptoms from hence it comes to pass that the fruit of their bodies lie in them like plants in hotbeds from hence it proceeds that our british maids who in the time of our henrys were not held marriageable till turned of twenty are now become falling ripe at twelve and forced to prematureness by the heat of adventitious fire nor has luxury only changed our natures but transfrmed our sexes we have men tnat are more soft more languid and more passive than women on the other side we have women who as it were in revenge are masculine in their desires and masculine in their practices  in a pretty advanced age mr dennis who then labored under severe necessities published two volumes of letters by subscription which are by far the most entertaining part of his writings they have more sprightliness and force in them than from reading his other works we would be disposed to imagine they are addressed to persons distinguished by their fortune genius and exalted station the duke of marlborough the lord lansdowne earl of godolphin earl of halifax mr dryden mr prior mr wncherley henry cromwell esquire walter moyle esquire and sir richard blackmore he entitles them letters moral and critical the critical are chinfly employed upon mr addisons cato which he censures in some places with great justice and critical propriety in other places he only discovers spleen and endeavors to burlesque noble passages merely from resentment to the author  there is likewise published amongst these letters an enquiry into the genius and writings of shakespeare he contends for shakespeares ignorance of the ancients and observes that it would derogate much from his glory to suppose him to have read or understood them because if he had his not practicing their art and not restraining the luxuriance of his imagination would be a reproach to him after bestowing the highest panegyric upon shakespeare he says that he seems to have been the very original of our english tragical harmony that is the harmony of blank verse diversified often by dissyllable and trisyllable terminations for that diversity distinguishes it from heroic harmony and bringing it nearer to common use makes it more proper to gain attention and more fit for action and dialogue such verses we make when we are writing prose we make such verse in common conversation  one of the reasons mr dennis assigns for shakespeares want of learning is that julius caesar in the play which goes by his name makes but a thirdrate figure and had he says the author consulted the latin writers he could not have been guilty of such an error but this is far from being conclusive which might as well be owing to his having a contempt for caesars character and an enthusiastic admiration for those of brutus and cassius  another prose essay of mr denniss which does him very great honor is his grounds of criticism in poetry amongst many masterly things which he there advances is the following the ancient poets says he derived that advantage which they have over the moderns to the constituting their subjects after a religious manner and from the precepts of longinus it appears that the greatest sublimity is to be derived from religious ideas  mr dennis then observes that one of the principal reasons that has made the modern poetry so contnptible is that by divesting itself of religion it is fallen from its dignity and its original nature and excellence and from the greatest production in the mind of man it is dwindled to an extravagant and vain amusement when subjects are in themselves great the ideas of the writer must likewise be great and nothing is in its nature so dignified as religion this he illustrates by many examples from milton who when he raises his voice to heaven and speaks the language of the divinity then does he reach the true sublime but when he descends to the more trifling consideration of human things his wing is necessarily depressed and his strains are less transporting  we shall now take a view of mr dennis in that part of his life and writings in which he makes a less considerable figure by exposing himself to the resentment of one so much his superior and who after a long provocation at last let loose his rage against him in a manner that no time can obliterate mr dennis we have already observed waged a perpetual war with successful writers except those few who were his friends but never engaged with so much fury and less justice against the writings of any poet as those of mr pope  some time after the death of dryden when popes reputation began to grow his friends who were sanguine in his interest were imprndent enough to make comparisons and really assert that pope was the greatest poet of the two dennis who had made court to dryden and was respected by him heard this with indignation and immediately exerted all the criticism and force of which he was master to reduce the character of pope in this attempt he neither has succeeded nor did he pursue it like a gentleman  in his reflections on popes essay on criticism he uses the following unmannerly epithets a young squab short gentleman whose outward form though it should be that of a downright monkey would not differ so much from human shape as his unthinking immaterial part does from human understanding  he is as stupid and as venomous as an hunchbacked toad  a book through which folly and ignorance those brethren so lame and impotent do ridiculously look very big and very dull and strut and hobble cheek by jowl with their arms on kimbo being led and supported and bullybacked by that blind hector impudence the reasons which our critic gives for this extraordinary fury are equally ridiculous  i regard him says he as an enemy not so much to me as to my king to my country and to my religion the epidemic madness of the times has given him reputation and reputation is power and that has made him dangerous therefore i look on it as my duty to king george and to the liberties of my country more dear than life to me of which i have now been  0 years a constant assertor etc i look upon it as my duty i say to do  reader observe what  to pull the lions skin from this little ass which popular error has thrown round him and show that this little author who has been lately so much in vogue has neither sense in his thoughts nor english in his expressions see his remarks on homer pref p   and p     speaking of mr popes windsorforrest he says it is a wretched rhapsody impudently writ in emulation of coopershill the author of it is obscure is ambiguous is affected is temerarious is barbarous  after these provocations it is no wonder that pope should take an opportunity of recording him in his dunciad and yet he had some esteem for our authors learning and genius mr dennis put his name to every thing he wrote against him which mr pope considered as a circumstance of candor he pitied him as a man subject to the dominion of invidious passions than which no severer sensations can tear the heart of man  in the first book of his dunciad line  0  he represents dullness taking a view of her sons and thus mentions dennis  she saw slow philips creep like tates poor page  and all the mighty mad in dennis rage  he mentions him again slightly in his second book line   0 and in his third book line     taking notice of a quarrel between him and mr gildon he says ah dennis gildon ah what illstarrd rage divides a friendship long confirmed by age blockheads with reason wicked wits abhor but fool with fool is barbrous civil war embrace embrace my sons be foes no more nor glad vile poets with true critics gore   our author gained little by his opposition to pope in which he must either have violated his judgment or been under the influence of the strongest prejudice that ever blinded the eyes of any man for not to admire the writings of this excellent poet is an argument of a total depravation of taste which in other respects does not appear to be the case of mr dennis  we shall now take a view of our author in the light of a dramatist in the year      a comedy of his was acted at the theater royal in drury lane called a plot and no plot dedicated to the earl of sunderland the scope of this piece is to ridicule the credulity and principles of the jacobites the moral of which is this that there are in all parties persons who find it their interest to deceive the rest and that one half of every faction makes a property in feesimple of the other therefore we ought never to believe any thing will or will not be because it is agreeable or contrary to our humors but because it is in itself likely or improbable credulity in men engaged in a party proceeds oftener from pride than weakness and it is the hardest thing in the world to impose upon a humble man  in      a tragedy called rinaldo and armida was acted at the theater in lincolnsinnfields dedicated to the duke of ormond scene the top of a mountain in the canaries the hint of the chief characters is owing to tassos gierusalemme but the manners of them being by our author thought unequal in that great italian he has taken the liberty to change them and form his characters more agreeable to the subject the reanons for doing it are expressed in the preface and prologue to the play  our authors next tragedy was upon the subject of iphigenia daughter to agamemnon king of argos acted at the theater in lincolns end   0  iphigenia was to have been sacrificed by her father who was deluded by the fraud of calchas who proclaimed throughout the grecian fleet that the ofnended gods demanded of agamemnon the sacrifice of his daughter to lucina and till that oblation was offered the fleet would remain windbound accordingly under pretense of mnrrying her to achilles she was betrayed from argos but her mother clytemnestra discovering the cheat by a stratagem prevented its execution and effected her rescue without the knowledge of any one but hen husband agamemnon a grecian virgin being sacrificed in her place iphigenia is afterward wrecked on the coast of scythia and made the priestess of diana in five years time her brother orestes and his friend pylades are wrecked on the same shore but saved from slaughter by the queen of scythia because she loved orestes orestes on the other hand falls in love with the priestess of diana they attempt an escape and to carry off the image of the goddens but are prevented the queen then dooms orestes to the altar but pylades from his great friendship personates orestes and disconcerts the design the story and incidents of this play are interesting and moving but mr dennis has not wrought the scenes much in the spirit of a tragedian this was a subject admirably suited for the talents of otway the discovery of orestess being the brother of iphigenia is both surprising and natural and though the subject is not well executed yet is this by far the most affecting tragedy of our author it is almost impossible to read it without tears though it abounds with bombast  the fourth play introduced upon the stage by mr dennis   0  was a tragedy called liberty asserted dedicated to anthony henley esquire to whom he says he was indebted for the happy hint upon which it was formed soon after this he wrote another tragedy upon the story of appius and virginia which mr maynwaring in a letter to mr dennis calls one of our best modern tragedies it is dedicated to sidney earl of godolphin  he altered shakespeares merry wives of windsor and brought it on the stage under the title of the comical gallant prefixed to this is a large account of taste in poetry and the causes of its degeneracy addressed to the hon george granville esquire afterward lord lansdowne  our authors next dramatic production was coriolanus the invader of his country or the fatal resentment a tragedy altered from shakespeare and acted at the theater royal in drury lane this piece met with some opposition the first night and on the fourth another play was given out the secondn nights audience was very small though the play was exceedingly well acted the third night had not the charges in money the fourth was still worse and then another play was given out not one place being taken in the boxes for any ensuing night the managers were therefore obliged to discontinue it  this usage mr dennis highly resented and in his dedication to the duke of newcastle then lord chamberlain he makes a formal complaint against the managers to this play mr colley cibber took the pains to write an epilogue which mrs oldfield spoke with universal applause and for which poor peevish jealous dennis abused them both  mr dennis happened once to go to the play when a tragedy was acted in which the machinery of thunder was introduced a new artificial method of producing which he had formerly communicated to the managers incensed by this circumstance he cried out in a transport of resentment that is my thunder by g  d the villains will play my thunder but not my plays this gave an alarm to the pit which he soon explained he was much subject to these kind of whimsical transports and suffered the fervor of his imagination often to subdue the power of his reason an instance of which we shall now relate  after he was worn out with age and poverty he resided within the verge of the court to prevent danger from his creditors one saturday night he happened to saunter to a public house which he discovered in a short time was out of the verge he was sitting in an open drinking room and a man of a suspicious appearance happened to come in there was something about the man which denoted to mr dennis that he was a bailiff this struck him with a panic he was afraid his liberty was now at an end he sat in the utmost solicitude but durst not offer to stir left he should be seized upon after an hour or two had passed in this painful anxiety at last the clock struck twelve when mr dennis in an ecstasy cried out addressing himself to the suspected person now sir bailiff or no bailiff i dont care a farthing for you you have no oower now the man was astonished at this behavior and when it was explained to him he was so much affronted with the suspicion that had not mr dennis found his protection in age he would have smarted for his mistaken opinion of him  in the year   0  a comedy of mr denniss called gibraltar or the spanish adventure was aded unsuccessfully at drury lane theater he was also author of a masque called orpheus and euridice  mr dennis considered as a dramatic writer makes not so good a figure as in his critical works he understood the rules of writing but it is not in the power of every one to carry their own theory into execution there is one error which he endeavored to reform very material for the interest of dramatic poetry he saw with concern that love had got the entire possession of the tragic stage contary to the authority of the ancients and the example of shakespeare he resolved therefore to deviate a little from the reigning practice and not to make his heroes such whining slaves in their amors which not only debases the majesty of tragedy but confounds most of the principal characters by making that passion the predominant quality in all but he did not think it safe at once to show his principal characters wholly exempt from it lest so great and sudden a transition should prove disagreeable he rather chose to steer a middle course and make love appear violent but yet to be subdued by reason and give way to the influence of some other more noble passion as in rinaldo to glory in iphigenia to friendship and in liberty asserted to the public good he thought by these means an audience might be entertained and prepared for greater alterations whereby the dignity of tragedy might be supported and its principal characters justly distinguished  besides the works which we have already mentioned mr dennis is author of the following pieces mostly in the pindaric way upon our victory at sea and burning the french fleet at la hogne in      part of the te deum paraphrased in pindaric verse to mr dryden upon his translation of the third book of virgils georgics pindaric ode a pindaric ode on the king written in the beginning of august      occasioned by the victory at aghrim to a painter drawing a ladys picture an epigram prayer for the kings safety in the summers expedition in      an epigram the court of death a pindaric poem dedicated to the memory of her most sacred majesty queen mary the passion of byblis made english from the ninth book of ovids metamorphosis the monument a poem sacred to the memory of the best and greatest of kings william iii britannia triumphans or a poem on the battle of blenheim dedicated to queen anne on the accession of king george to the imperial crown of great britain   the following specimen which is part of a paraphrase on the te deum serves to show that mr dennis wrote with more elngance in pindaric odes than in blank verse now let us sing a loftier strain now let us earth and earthly things disdain now let our souls to heaven repair direct their most aspiring flight to fields of uncreated light and dare to draw empyreal air it is done o place divinely bright o sons of god divinely fair o fight unutterable fight o unconceivable delight o joy which only gods can bear hark how their blissful notes they raise and sing the great creators praise how in extatic song they cry lo we the glorious sons of light so great so beautiful so bright lo we the brightest of created things who are all flame all force all spirit and all eye are yet but vile and nothing in thy fight before thy feet o mighty king of kings o maker of this bounteous all thus lowly reverent we fall   after a life exposed to vicissitudes habituated to many disappointments and embroiled in unsuccessful quarrels mr dennis died on the  th of january      in the   th year of his age we have observed that he outlived the reversion of his place after which he fell into great distress and as he had all his life been making enemies by the ungovernable fury of his temper he found few persons disposed to relieve him when he was near the close of his days a play was acted for his benefit this favor was procured him by the joint interest of mr thomson mr martin mr mallet and mr pope the play was given by the company then acting at the little theater in the haymarket under the direction of mr mills sen and mr cibber jun the latter of whom spoke a prologue on the occasion written by mr pope  mr dennis was less happy in his temper than his genius he possessed no inconsiderable erudition which was joined to such natural parts as if accompanied with prudence or politeness might have raised him not only above want but even to eminence he was happy too in having very powerful patrons but what could be done for a man who declared war against all the world dennis has given evidence against himself in the article of politeness for in one of his letters he says he would not retire to a certain place in the country lest he should be disturbed in his studies by the ladies in the house for says he i am not overfond of the conversation of women but with all his foibles we cannot but consider him as a good critic and a man of genius  his perpetual misfortune was that he aimed at the empire of wit for which nature had not sufficiently endowed him and as his ambition prompted him to obtain the crown by a furious opposition to all other competitors so like caesar of old his ambition overwhelmed him  g granville l lansdowne was descended from an illustrious family which traced their ancestry from rollo the first duke of normandy he was second son of bernard granville and grandson of the famous sir bevil granville killed at the battle of lansdowne      this nobleman received the first tincture of his education in france under the tuition of sir william ellis a gentleman who was eminent afterward in many public employments  when our author was but eleven years of age he was sent to trinity college in cambridge where he remained five years but at the age of thirteen was admitted to the degree of master of arts having before he was twelve years old spoken a copy of english verses of his own composition to the duchess of york when her royal highness paid a visit to that university  at the time when the nation was embroiled by the public distractions occasioned by the efforts of king james ii to introduce popery lord lansdowne did not remain an unconcerned spectator he had early imbibed principles of loyalty and as some of his forefathers had fallen in the cause of charles i he thought it was his duty to sacrifice his life also for the interest of his sovereign however mistaken he might be in this furious zeal for a prince the chief scope of whose reign was to overthrow the law and introduce absolute dominion yet he appears to be perfectly sincere in a letter he wrote to his father upon the expected approach of the prince of oranges fleet he expresses the most ardent desire to serve the king in person genesis dict art granville  this letter we shall insert but beg our readers patience to make a digresson which will justify what we have said concerning james ii  the genuine mark of a tyrant is cruelty and it is with concern we can produce an instance of the most inhuman barbarity in that prince which ever stained the annals of any reign cruelty should be the badge of no party it ought to be equally the abhorrence of all and whoever is tainted with it should be set up to view as a terror to the world as a monster whom it is the interest of mankind to destroy  after the suppression of monmouths rebellion many of the unfortunate persons engaged in it fled to london and took shelter there till the act of indemnity should be published they who afforded them shelter were either of the monmouth faction or induced from principles of humanity to administer to their safety what would become of the world if our friends were always to forsake us in distress there lived then in london an amiable lady attached to no party who enjoyed a large fortune which she spent in the exercise of the most extensive beneficence she made it her business to visit the jails and the prisoners who were most necessitous and deserving she relieved her house was an asylum for the poor she lived but for charity and she bad every hour the prayers of the widow and orphan poured out to her it happened that one of the rebels found shelter in her house she suffered him to be screened there she fed and clothed him the king had often declared that he would rather pardon those who were found in arms against him than the people who harbored or secretly encouraged them this miscreat who sometimes ventured out at night to a public house was informed that the king had made such a declaration and it entered into his base heart to betray his benefactress he accordingly went before a magistrate and lodged an information upon which the lady was secured brought to a trial and upon the evidence of this ungrateful villain cast for her life she suffered at a stake with the most resigned cheerfulness for when a woman is convicted of treason it seems she is fentenced to be burnt see burnets history of his own times  the reader will easily judge what sort of bowels that king must have who could permit such a punishment to take place upon a woman so completely amiable upon the evidence of a villain so consummately infamous and he will we are persuaded be of opinion that had his majesty possessed a thousand kingdoms he deserved to lose them all for this one act of genuine barbarity  lord lansdowne who did not consider or was not then capable of discovering the dangers to which this prince exposed his people wrote the following letter to his father earnestly pressing him to permit his entering voluntarily into king jamess service sir your having no prospect of obtaining a commission for me can no way alter or cool my desire at this important juncture to venture my life in some manner or other for my king and country i cannot bear to live under the reproach of lying obscure and idle in a country retirement when every man who has the least sense of honor should be preparing for the field you may remember sir with what reluctance i submitted to your commands upon monmouths rebellion when no importunity could prevail with you to permit me to leave the academy i was too young to be hazarded but give me leave to say it is glorious at any age to die for ones country and the sooner the robler sacrifice i am now older by three years my uncle bath was not so old when he was left among the slain at the battle of newberry nor you yourself sir when you made your escape from your tutors to join your brother in the defense of scilly the same cause is now come round about again the king has been misled let those who misled him be answerable for it nobody can deny but he is sacred in his own person and it is every honest mans duty to defend it you are pleased to say it is yet doubtful if the hollanders are rash enough to make such an attempt but be that as it will i beg leave to be presented to his majesty as one whose utmost ambition is to devote his life to his service and my countrys after the example of all my ancestors the gentry assembled at york to agree upon the choice of representatives for the county have prepared an address to assure his majesty they are ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes for him upon this and all other occasions but at the some time they humbly beseech him to give them such magistrates as may be agreeable to the laws of the land for at present there is no authority to which they can legally submit by what i can hear every body wishes well to the king but would be glad his ministers were hanged the winds continue so contrary that no landing can be so soon as was apprehended therefore i may hope with your leave and assistance to be in readiness before any action can begin i beseech you sir most humbly and most earnestly to add this one act of indulgence more to so many testimonies i have so constantly received of your goodness and be pleased to believe me always with the utmost duty and submission  yours etc     we are not told whether his father yielded to his importunity or whether he was presented to his majesty but if he really joined the army it was without danger to his person for the revolution was effected in england without one drop of blood in the year    0 lord lansdowne wrote a copy of verses addressed to mrs elizabeth higgins in answer to a poetical address sent him by that lady in his retirement the verses of the lady are very elegant and are only exceetled by the polite compliments his lordship wrote in answer to them they both deserve a place here i why granville is thy life to shades confined thou whom the gods designed in public to do credit to mankind why sleeps the noble ardour of thy blood which from thy ancestors so man ages past from rollo down to bevil flowed and then appeared again at last in thee when thy victorious lance bore the disputed prize from all the youth of france ii in the first trials which are made for same those to whom fate success denies if taking council from their shame they modestly retreat are wise but why should you who still succeed whether with graceful art you lead the fiery barb or with a graceful motion tread in shining balls where all agree to give the highest praise to thee such harmony in every motions found as art could never express by any sound iii so loved and praised whom all admire why why should you from courts and camps retire if myra is unkind if it can be that any nymph can be unkind to thee if pensive made by love you thus retire awake your muse and string your lyre your tender song and your melodious strain can never be addressed in vain she needs must love and we shall have you back again   his lordships answer thus begins cease tempting siren cease thy flattering strain sweet is thy charming song but sung in vain when the winds blow and loud the tempests roar what fool would trust the waves and quit the shore early and vain into the world i came big with false hopes and eager after fame till looking round me ever the race began madmen and giddy fools were all that ran reclaimed betimes i from the lists retire and thank the gods who my retreat inspire in happier times our ancestors were bred when virtue was the only path to tread give me ye gods but the same road to fame whatever my fathers dared i dare the same changed is the scene some baneful planet rules an impious world contrived for knaves and fools   he concludes with the following lines happy the man of mortals happiest he whose quiet mind of vain desires is free whom neither hopes deceive nor fears torment but lives at peace within himself content in thought or act accountable to none but to himself and to the gods alone o sweetness of content seraphic joy which nothing wants and nothing can destroy where dwells this peace this freedom of the mind where but in shades remote from human kind in flowery vales where nymphs and shepherds meet but never comes within the palacegate farewell then cities courts and camps farewell welcome ye groves here let me ever dwell from care and business and mankind remove all but the muses and inspiring love how sweet the morn how gentle is the night how calm tho evening and the day how bright from thence as from a hill i view below the crowded world a mighty wood in show where several wandrers travel day and night by different paths and none are in the right   in      his comedy called the she gallants was acted at the theater royal general dictionary ubi supra in lincolnsinnfields he afterward altered this comedy and published it among his other works under the title of once a lover and always a lover which as he observes in the preface is a new building upon an old foundation it appeared first under the name of the shegallants and by the preface then prefixed to it is said to have been the child of a child by taking it since under examination so many years after the author flatters himself to have made a correct comedy of it he found it regular to his hand the scene constant to one place the time not exceeding the bounds prescribed and the action entire it remained only to clear the ground and to plant as it were fresh flowers in the room of those which were grown into weeds or were faded by time to retouch and vary the characters enliven the painting retrench the superfluous and animate the action where it appeared the young author seemed to aim at more than he had strength to perform    the same year also his tragedy entitled heroic love was acted at the theater mr gildon observes that this tragedy is written after the manner of the ancients which is much more natural and easy than that of our modern dramatists though we cannot agree with mr gildon that the ancient model of tragedy is so natural as the modern yet this piece must have very great merit since we find mr dryden addressing verses to the author upon this occasion which begin thus auspicious poet were thou not my friend how could i envy what i must commend but since it is natures law in love and wit that youth should reign and withering age submit with less regret those laurels i resign which dying on my brow revive on thine   our author wrote also a dramatic poem called the british enchanters it was called a dramatic opera and was decorated at a great expense and intermixed with songs dances etc  in the preface to which he observes that it is the first essay of a very infant muse rather as a task at such hours as were free from other exercises than any way meant for public entertainment but mr betterton having had a casual fight of it many years after it was written begged it for the stage where it met with so favorable a reception as to have an uninterrupted run of upwards of forty nights to this mr addison wrote the epilogue lord lansdowne altered shakespeares merchant of venice under the title of the jew of venice which was acted with applause the profits of which were designed for mr dryden but upon that poets death were given to his son  in   0  he translated into english the second olynthian of demosthenes he was returned member for the county of cornwall in the parliament which met in november    0 and was soon after made secretary of war next comptroller of the household and then treasurer and sworn one of the privy council the year following he was created baron lansdowne of biddeford in devonshire upon the accession of king george the is it the lord lansdowne was seized and imprisoned in the tower upon an impeachment of high treason but was soon after honorably discharged without being brought to a trial   in      he made a speech in the house of lords against the practice of occasional conformity which is printed among his works and among other things he says this i always understood the toleration to be meant as an indulgence to tender consciences not a license for hardened ones and that the act to prevent occasional conformity was designed only to correct a particular crime of particular men in which no sect of dissenters was included but these followers of judas which came to the lords supper from no other end but to sell and betray him this crime however palliated and defended by so many right reverend fathers in the church is no less than making the god of truth as it were in person subservient to acts of hypocrisy no less than sacrificing the mystical blood and body of our savior to worldly and sinister purposes an impiety of the highest nature which in justice called for protection and in charity for prevention the bare receiving the holy eucharist could never be intended simply as a qualification for an office but as an open declaration an undubitable proof of being and remaining a sincere member of the church whoever presumes to receive it with any other view profanes it and may be said to seek his promotion in this world by eating and drinking his own damnation in the next  this accomplished nobleman died in february anno      by his lady mary widow of thomas thynne esquire father of thomas lord viscount weymouth and daughter of edward villiers earl of jersey he had issue four daughters anne mary grace and elizabeth  his lady died but a few days before him  mr pope with many other poets of the first eminence have celebrated lord lansdowne who seems to have been a goodnatured agreeable nobleman the luster of his station no doubt procured him more incense than the force of his genius would otherwise have attracted but he appears not to have been destitute of fine parts which were however rather elegantly polished than great in themselves  lord landsdowne likewise wrote a masque called peleus and thetis his lordships works have been often printed both in quarto and in duodnmo  mr john gay this eminent wit was descended of an ancient family in devonshire and educated at the free school of barnstaple in the same county under the care of mr william rayner an excellent master see jacob   mr gay had a small fortune at his disposal and was bred says jacob a mercer in the strand but having a genius for high excellences he considered such an employment as a degradation to it and relinquished that occupation to reap the laurels of poetry  about the year      he was made secretary to the duchess of monmouth and continued in that station till he went over to hanover in the beginning of the year      with the earl of clarendon who was sent there by queen anne upon whose death he returned to england and lived in the highest esteem and friendship with persons of the first quality and genius upon mr gays arrival from hanover we find among mr popes letters one addressed to him dated september         which begins thus dear gay welcome to your native soil welcome to your friends thrice welcome to me whether returned in glory blessed with courtinterest the love and familiarity of the great and filled with agreeable hopes or melancholy with dejection contemplative of the changes of fortune and doubtful for the future whether returned a triumphant whig or a desponding tory equally all hail equally beloved and welcome to me if happy i am to share in your elevation if unhappy you have still a warm corner in my heart and a retreat at binfield in the worst of times at your service if you are a tory or thought so by any man i know it can proceed from nothing but your gratitude to a few people who endeavored to serve you and whose politics were never your concern if you are a whig as i rather hope and as i think your principles and mine as brother poets had ever a bias to the side of liberty i know you will be an honest man and an inoffensive one upon the whole i know you are incapable of being so much on either side as to be good for nothing therefore once more whatever you are or in whatever state you are all hail     in      his tragedy entitled the captives which he had the honor to read in ms to queen caroline then princess of wales was acted at the theater royal in drury lane  in      he published his fables dedicated to the duke of cumberland and the year following he was offered the place of gentleman usher to one of the youngest princesses which by reason of some slight shown him at court he thought proper to refuse he wrote several works of humor with great success particularly the shepherds week trivia the what do you call it and the beggars opera which was acted at the theater in lincolnsinnfields      general dictionary article gay   the author of the notes on this line of the dunciad b iii       gay dies unpensioned with a hundred friends observes hat this opera was a piece of satire which hits all tastes and degrees of men from those of the highest quality to the very rabble that verse of horace primores populi arripuit populumque tributim could never be so justly applied as in this case the vast success of it was unprecedented and almost incredible what is related of the wonderful effects of the ancient music or tragedy hardly came up to it sophocles and euripides were less followed and famous it was acted in london sixty three days uninterrupted and renewed the next season with equal applause it spread into all the great towns of england was played in many places to the thirtieth and fortieth time at bath and bristol fifty it made its progress into wales scotland and ireland where it was performed twentyfour days together it was lastly acted in minorca the fame of it was not confined to the author only the ladies carried about with them the favorite songs of it in fans and houses were furnished with it in screens the girl who acted polly till then obscure became all at once the favorite of the town her pictures were engraved and sold in great numbers her life written books of letters and verses to her published and pamphlets made even of her sayings and jests furthermore it drove out of england for that season the italian opera which had carried all before it for ten years that idol of the nobility and the people which mr dennis by the labors and outcries of a whole life could not overthrow was demolished by a single stroke of this gentlemans pen  dr swift in his intelligencer numb   has given us a vindication of mr gay and the beggars opera he observes that though an evil taste be very apt to prevail both in dublin and in london yet there is a point which whoever can rightly touch will never fail of pleasing a very great majority so great that the dislikers out of dullness or affectation will be silent and forced to fall in with the herd the point i mean is what we call humor which in its perfection is allowed to be much preferable to wit if it be not rather the most useful and agreeable species of it  now i take the comedy or farce or whatever name the critic will allow it called the beggars opera to excel in this article of humor and upon that merit to have met with such prodigious success both here and in england the dean afterward remarks that an opinion obtained that in this opera there appears to be some reflections on courtiers and statesmen it is true indeed says he that mr gay has been somewhat singular in the course of his fortunes attending the court with a large stock of real merit a modest and agreeable conversation a hundred promises and five hundred friends has failed of preferment and upon a very weighty reason he lay under the suspicion of having written a libel or lampoon against a great minister it is true that great minister was demonstratively convinced and publicly owned his conviction that mr gay was not the author but having laid under the suspicion it seemed very just that he should suffer the punishment because in this most reformed age the virtues of a great minister are no more to be suspected than the chastity of caesars wife  the dean then tells us that our author in this piece has by a turn of humor entirely new placed vices of all kinds in the strongest and most odious light and thereby done eminent service both to religion and morality this appears from the unparalleled success he has met with all ranks parties and denominations of men either crowding to see his opera or reading it with delight in their closets even ministers of state whom he is thought most to have offended appearing frequently at the theater from a consciousness of their own innocence and to convince the world how unjust a parallel malice envy and disaffection to the government have made  in this happy performance of mr gay all the characters are just and none of them carried beyond nature or hardly beyond practice it discovers the whole system of that commonwealth or that imperium in imperio of iniquity established among us by which neither our lives nor our properties are secure either in highways or in public assemblies or even in our own houses it shows the miserable lives and constant fate of those abandoned wretches for how small a price they sell their souls betrayed by their companions receivers and purchasers of those thefts and robberies this comedy contains likewise a satire which though it does by no means affect the present age yet might have been useful in the former and may possibly be so in ages to come i mean where the author takes occasion of comparing those common robbers of the public and their several stratagems of betraying undermining and hanging each other to the several arts of politicians in the time of corruption this comedy likewise exposes with great justice that unnatural taste for italian music among us which is wholly unsuitable to our northern climate and the genius of the people whereby we are overrun with italian effeminacy an old gentleman said to me many years ago when the practice of an unnatural vice grew so frequent in london that many were prosecuted for it he was sure it would be the forerunner of italian operas and singers and then we should want nothing but stabbing or poisoning to make us perfect italians upon the whole i deliver my judgment that nothing but servile attachment to a party affectation of singularity lamentable dullness mistaken zeal or studied hypocrisy can have any objection against this excellent moral performance of mr gay swift ubi supra   the astonishing success of the beggars opera induced our author to add a second part in which however he was disappointed both in profit and fame his opera entitled polly designed as a sequel of the former was prohibited by the lord chamberlain from being represented on the stage when every thing was ready for the rehearsal of it but was soon after printed in  to to which the author had a very large subscription in the preface mr gay gives a particular account of the whole affair in the following manner on thursday december    says he i received this answer from the chamberlain that it should not be allowed to be acted but suppressed this was told me in general without any reasons asngned or any charge against me of my having given any particular offense since this prohibition i have been told that i am accused in general terms of having written many disaffected libels and seditious pamphlets as it has ever been my utmost ambition if that word may be used upon this occasion to lead a quiet and inonnsive life i thought my innocence in this particular would never have needed a justification and as this kind of writing is what i ever detested and never practiced i am persuaded so groundless a calumny can never be believed but by those who do not know me but when general aspersions of this sort have been cast upon me i think myself called upon to declare my principles and i do with the strictest truth affirm that i am as loval a subject and as firmly attached to the present happy establishment as any of those who have the greatest places or pensions i have been informed too that in the following play i have been charged with writing immoralities that it is filled with slander and calumny against particular great persons and that majesty itself is endeavored to be brought into ridicule and contempt as i know that every one of these charge was in every point absolutely false and without the least grounds at first i was not at all affected by them but when i found they were still insisted upon and that particular passagns which were not in the play were quoted and prnpagated to support what had been suggested i could no longer bear to lie under those false accusations so by printing it i have submitted and given up all present views of profit which might accrue from the stage which will undoubtedly be some satisfaction to the worthy gentlemen who have treated me with so much candor and humanity and represented me in such favorable colors but as i am conscious to myself that my only intention was to lash in general the reigning and fashionable vices and to recommend and set virtue in as amiable a light as i could to justify and vindicate my own character i thought myself obliged to print the opera without delay in the manner i have done    the large subscription mr gay had to print it amply recompensed any loss he might receive from it is not being acted though this was called the sequel to the beggars opera it was allowed by his best friends searce to be of a piece with the first part being in every particular infinitely beneath it  besides the works which we have already mentioned mr gay wrote several poems printed in london in   vol   mo a comedy called the wife of bath first acted      and afterward revived altered and represented at the theater royal in lincolnsinnfields three hours after marriage a comedy acted at the theater royal in which he was assisted by pope and arbuthnot but had the mortification to see this piece very ill received if not damned the first night   he wrote likewise achilles an opera acted at the theater in covent garden this was brought on the stage after his death and the profits were given to his sisters  after experiencing many vicissitudes of fortune and being for some time chiefly supported by the liberality of the duke and duchess of queensberry he died at their house in burlington gardens of a violent inflammatory fever in december      and was interred in westminster by his noble benefactors just mentioned with the following epitaph written by mr pope who had the sincenest friendship for him on account of his amiable qualities of manners gentle of affections mild in wit a man simplicity a child above temptation in a low estate and uncorrupted even amongst the great a safe companion and an easy friend unblamed through life lamented in thy end these are thy honors not that here thy bust is mixed with heroes or with kings thy dust but that the worthy and the good shall say striking their pensive bosoms  here lies gay   then follows this farther inscription here lie the ashes of mr john gay  charles and catherine duke and duchess of queensberry who loved this excellent man living and regret him dead have caused this monument to be erected to his memory  mr gays moral character seems to have been very amiable he was of an affable sweet disposition generous in his temper and pleasant in his conversation his chief failing was an excessive indolence without the least knowledge of economy which often subjected him to wants he needed not otherwise have experienced dean swift in many of his letters entreated him while money was in his hands to buy an annuity lest old age should overtake him unprepared but mr gay never thought proper to comply with his advice and chose rather to throw himself upon patronage than secure a competence as the dean wisely advised as to his genius it would be superfluous to say any thing here his works are in the hands of every reader of taste and speak for themselves we know not whether we can be justified in our opinion but we beg leave to observe that of all gays performances his pastorals seem to have the highest finishing they are perfectly doric the characters and dialogue are natural and rurally simple the language is admirably suited to the persons who appear delightfully rustic  philip duke of wharton the unhappy nobleman the memoirs of whose life we are now about to relate was endowed by nature with all those shining qualifications by which a great man can be formed he possessed a most extensive memory a strong and lively imagination and quick and ready apprehension  by the immediate authority of his father our noble authors studies were confined to one particular branch of learning with a view no doubt that his sons uncommon genius might make the greater progress and shine with a superior luster in that species of erudition he had made choice of for him on this account it was that the earl his father would not permit the young lord to go to public or private schools or to any college or university but had him carefully instructed by domestic tutors and as he gave an early display of the most astonishing parts the earl bent all his thoughts how to improve them in the best manner for his sons future advantage  as soon at this sprightly genius had laid a sufficient foundation in classical learning he studied history particularly that of his own country by which he was able to discern the principles of the constitution the revolutions it has undergone the variety of accidents by which it may be endangered and the true policy by which it can be preserved while he thus read history he became a politician and as he did not neglect other sciences he acquired a general knowledge both of life and things before most other persons of distinction begin to read or think at all  by his not receiving an academical education he escaped that stiffness and moroseness of temper frequently contracted by those who have been for some time condemned to a collegiate obscurity neither had he the least tincture of a haughty superiority arising from the nobleness of his birth and the luster of his abilities his conversation was easy pleasant and instructive always suited to his company of whatever quality humor or capacity they were  as it was the earl of whartons view to qualify his son to fill that high station in which his birth would one day place him with advantage to his country his great care was to form him a complete orator for this purpose some of the principal parts in the best english tragedies were assigned him at times to study particularly those of shakespeare which he used to repeat before a private audience sometimes his father gave him speeches which had been uttered in the house of peers and which the young lord got by heart and delivered with all the graces of action and elocution with so much propiety of expression emphasis of voice and pronunciation wherever it was requisite as showed his lordship was born for this arduous province nor did the excellency of these performances receive a small additional beauty from the gracefulness of his person which was at once soft and majestic  thus endowed by nature to charm and persuade what expectations might not have been formed on him a youth of a noble descent who added to that advantage the most astonishing parts ever man possessed improved by an uncommon and well regulated education what pity is it this illustrious young man born to have dictated to the senate and directed the business of a state with the eyes of a people fixed upon him should fall so exceedingly short of those fair hopes he had so justly raised in every breast he wanted one quality without which birth fortune and abilities suffer a considerable diminution that quality is prudence of which the duke of wharton was so destitute that all his parts were lost to the world and the world lost to him  the first prelude to his misfortunes may justly be reckoned his falling in love and privately marrying a young lady the daughter of major general holmes a match by no means suited to his birth fortune and character and far less to the ambitious views his father had of disposing of him in such a marriage as would have been a considerable addition to the fortune and grandeur of his illustrious family however disappointed the earl of wharton might be in his sons marrying beneath his quality yet that amiable lady who became his daughterinlaw deserved infinitely more felicity than she met with by an alliance with his family and the young lord was not so unhappy through any misconduct of hers as by the death of his father which this precipitate marriage is thought to have hastened the duke being so early freed from paternal restraints plunged himself into those numberless excesses which became at last fatal to him and he proved as pope expresses it a tyrant to the wife his heart approved a rebel to the very king he loved   the young lord in the beginning of the year      indulged his desire of traveling and finishing his education abroad and as he was designed to be instructed in the strictest whig principles geneva was judged a proper place for his residence on his departure from england for this purpose he took the rout of holland and visited several courts of germany and that of hanover in particular  though his lordship was now possessed of his family estate as much as a minor could be yet his trustees very much limited his expenses and made him too moderate remittances for a person of his rank and spirit this gave him great uneasiness and embarrassed him much in his way of living which ill suited with the profusion of his taste to remove these difficulties he had recourse to mortgaging and by premiums and large interest paid to usurers supplied his present necessities by rendering his affairs still worse  the unhappy divisions which reigned in england at the time this young peer made his first entry into public life rendered it almost impossible for him to stand neuter and on whatever side he should declare himself still there was danger the world generally expected he would follow the steps of his father who was one of the first english gentlemen who joined the prince of orange and continued firm to the revolution principles and consequently approved the hanoverian succession upon whose basis it was built but whatever motives influenced the young marquis for king william had bestowed this title on his father he thought proper to join the contrary party the cause of his abandoning the principles of the whigs is thought to be this  the marquis being arrived at geneva he conceived so great a disgust at the dogmatical precepts of his governor the restraints he endeavored to lay upon him and the other instances of strict discipline exercised in that meridian of presbyterianism that he fell upon a scheme of avoiding these intolerable encumbrances so like a torrent long confined within its bounds by strong banks he broke loose and entered upon engagements which together with the natural impetuosity of his temper threw him into such inconveniences as rendered the remaining part of his life unhappy  his lordship as we have already observed being very much disgusted with his governor left him at geneva and as if he had been flying from a pestilence set out post for lions where he arrived about the middle of october       the author of the duke of whartons life has informed us that the reason of his lordships leaving his governor so abruptly was on account of the freedom with which that gentleman treated him a circumstance very disgustful to a person of his quality he took leave of him in the following manner  his lordship somewhere in his travels had picked up a bears cub of which he was very fond and carried it about with him but when he was determined to abandon his tutor he left the cub behind him with the following note addressed to him being no longer able to bear with your illusage i think proper to be gone from you however that you may not want company i have left you the bear as the most suitable companion in the world that could be picked out for you    when the marquis was at lions he took a very strange step little expected from him he wrote a letter to the chevalier de st george then residing at avignon to whom he presented a very fine stonehorse upon receiving this present the chevalier sent a man of quality to the marquis who carried him privately to his court where he was received with the greatest marks of esteem and had the title of duke of northumberland conferred upon him he remained there however but one day and then returned post to lions from whence he set out for paris he likewise made a visit to the queen dowager of england consort to king james the iid then residing at st germains to whom he paid his court pursued the same rash measures as at avignon  during his stay at paris his winning address and astonishing parts gained him the esteem and admiration of all british subjects of both parties who happened to be there the earl of stair then ambassador at the court of france from the king of great britain notwithstanding all the reports to the marquiss disadvantage thought proper to show some respect to the representative of so great a family which had so resolutely supported the present administration especially as he was a young man of such great personal accomplishments both natural and acquired and blessed with a genius so capable of serving his country even in the most eminent station  these considerations induced lord stair who was a prudent discerning minister to countenance the young marquis give him frequent invitations to his table and to use him with distinguishing civility the earl was likewise in hopes by these gentle measures and this insinuating behavior to win him to his party which he had good reason to think he hated his excellency never failed to lay hold of every opportunity to give him some admonitions which were not always agreeable to the vivacity of his temper and sometimes provoked him to great indiscretions once in particular the ambassador extolling the merit and noble behavior of the marquiss father added that he hoped he would follow so illustrious an example of fidelity to his prince and love to his country by treading in the same steps  upon which the marquis immediately answered that he thanked his excellency for his good advice and as his excellency had also a worthy and deserving father he hoped he would likewise copy so bright an original and tread in all his steps  this was a severe sarcasm as the ambassadors father had betrayed his master in a manner that was quite shameful he acted the same part in scotland which sunderland did in england they pushed on king james the iid to take violent and unconstitutional measures to make his ruin certain they succeeded in their scheme and after the revolution boasted their conduct as meritorious but however necessary it might be for king william upon principles of policy to reward the betrayers he had yet too good a heart to approve the treachery  but to return to the marquis we shall mention another of his juvenile fnghts as an instance to what extravagant and unaccountable excesses the inconstancy of his temper would sometimes transport him  a young english surgeon who went to paris to improve himself in his business by observing the practice in the celebrated hospitals passing by the embassadors house on the  0th of june at night took the liberty to break his excellencys windows because there was no bonfire before his door upon this outrage he was seized and committed prisoner to fort leveque this treatment of the young surgeon was resented by the marquis but he sought for no other satisfaction than to break the ambassadors windows a second time accordingly his lordship proposed it to an irish lieutenant general in the service of nrance a gentleman of great honor and of the highest reputation for abilities in military affairs desiring his company and assistance therein the general could not help smiling at the extravagance of the proposal and with a great deal of goodnature advised his lordship by all means not to make any such attempts but if he was resolutely bent upon it he begged to be excused from being of the party for it was a method of making war to which he had never been accustomed  we might here enumerate more frolics of the same kind which he either projected or engaged in but we choose rather to omit them as they reflect but little honor on the marquis  we shall only observe that before he left france an english gentleman of distinction expostulating with him for swerving so much from the principles of his father and his whole family his lordship answered that he had pawned his principles to gordon the pretenders banker for a considerable sum and till he could repay him he must be a jacobite but that when that was done he would again return to the whigs  about the latter end of december      the marquis arrived in england where he did not remain long till he set out for ireland in which kingdom on account of his extraordinary qualities he had the honor done him of being admitted though under age to take his seat in that august assembly of the house of peers to which he had a right as earl of rathfarnam and marquis of catherlough here he espoused a very different interest from that which he had so lately embraced he distinguished himself on this occasion as a violent partizan for the ministry and acted in all other respects as well in his private as public capacity with the warmest zeal for the government the speeches which he made in the house upon many occasions uttered with so much force of expression and propriety of emphasis were an irresistible demonstration of his abilities and drew upon him the admiration of both kingdoms the marquiss arguments had very great influence on which side of the question soever he happened to be  no nobleman either in that or the english house of peers ever acquitted himself with greater reputation or behaved with a more becoming dignity than he did during this session of the irish parliament  in consequence of this zeal for the new government shown at a time when they stood much in need of men of abilities and so little expected from the young marquis the king who was no stranger to the most refined rules of policy created him a duke the highest degree of a subject  in the preamble to his patent after a detail of the merit of his father and his services to the government are illustrated his lordships behavior in ireland and his early endowments are thus mentioned when we see the son of that great man forming himself by so worthy an example and in every action exhibiting a lively resemblance of his father when we consider the eloquence he has exerted with so much applause in the parliament of ireland and his turn and application even in early youth to the serious and weighty affairs of the public we willingly decree him honors which are neither superior to his merits nor earlier than the expectation of our good subjects    as soon as the duke of wharton came of age he was introduced to the house of lords in england with the like blaze of reputation and raised jealousies in the breasts of the most consummately artful and best qualified in the house of peers a little before the death of lord stanhope his grace who was constant in nothing but inconstancy again changed sides opposed the court and endeavored to defeat all the schemes of the ministry  he appeared one of the most forward and vigorous in the defense of the bishop of rochester and in opposing the bill for inflicting pains and penalties on that prelate  the judicious observations he made on the trial of the bishop and the manner in which he summed up and compared a long and perplexed kind of evidence with inimitable art and pernpnuity may be seen in the dukes speech upon that extraordinary occasion which is a lasting proof of his amazing abilities in the legislative capacity as well as of his general knowledge of public business  he however did not confine this spirit of opposition to the house of lords but  it both in city and country promoting in all kinds of elections such persons as were supposed to be no fautors of the court such was the hatred he now conceived to the ministry and such his desire of becoming eminent that he even pushed himself into the city of london was invested with the rights and privileges of a citizen and was entered a member of the waxchandlers company by virtue of which he appeared at all meetings charmed all societies and voted in his own right upon all occasions  notwithstanding his astonishing activity in opposition to the court he was not yet satisfied that he had done enough he could not be in all places and in all companies at once as much an orator as he was he could not talk to the whole nation and therefore he printed his thoughts twice a week in a paper called the truebriton several thousands of which being dispersed weekly the duke was pleased to find the whole kingdom giving attention to him and admiring him as an author though they did not at all approve his reasoning  those political papers which were reckoned by some the standard of good sense and elegant writing were collected together in his lifetime and reprinted by his order with a preface in which he gives his reasons for engaging in an undertaking so uncommon to a person of his distinction  here it will not be improper to remark that notwithstanding all those instances of the dukes zeal his sincerity in opposing the ministry was yet suspected as his former behavionr was so very inconsistent with it but he never fanled to junify himself throughout the different and contrary courses of his conduct pretending always to have acted consistently with the honor and interest of the nealm but he never was able in this particular to obtain the public judgment in his favor  it is impossibne to reconcile all the various actions of this nobleman he was certainly too much governed by whim and accident from this time forward however though he might deviate from the strict rules of a moral life he cannot be said to have done so with respect to his politics the same principles on which he set out he carried to his grave with steadinens through all the events of fortune and underwent such necessities as few of his quality ever experienced in a cause the revival and success of which had long been desperate before he engaged in it  the dukes boundless profusion had by this time so burdened his estate that a decree of chancery took hold on it and vested it in the hands of trustees for the payment of his debts but not without making a provision of   00 l per annum for his subsistence this allowance not being sufficient to support his title with suitable dignity at home he proposed to go abroad for some years till his estate should clear itself of encumbrances his friends for his own sake were pleased with this resolution and every body considered this course as the most prudent that in such circumstances could be taken but in this the world was deceived for he went abroad from no such prudent motive economy being a virtue of which he never had the least notion in any part of his life his business at vienna was to execute a private commission not in savor of the english ministry nor did he ever shine to greater advantage as to his personal character than at the imperial court  from vienna his grace made a tour to the court of spain where his arrival alarmed the english minister so much that two expresses were sent from madrid to london upon the apprehension that his grace was received there in the character of an ambassador upon which the duke received a summons under the privy seal to return home his behavior on this occasion was a sufficient indication that he never designed to return to england whilst affairs remained in the same state and the administration in the same hands they then were in this he often declared from his going abroad the second time which no doubt was the occasion of his treating that solemn order with so much indignity and endeavoring to inflame the spanish court not only against the person who delivered the warrant but against the court of great britnin itself for exercising an act of power as he was pleased to call it within the jurindiction of his catholic majesty after this he acted openly in the service of the pretender and appeared at his court where he was received with great marks of favor  while his grace was thus employed abroad his duchess who had been neglected by him died in england on the   th of april      and left no issue behind her the ladys death gave the duke no great shock he was disencumbered of her and had now an opportunity of mending his fortune by marriage  soon after this the duke fell violently in love with mademciselle obern a beautiful young lady at the spanish court who was then one of the maids of honor to the queen of spain she was daughter of an irish colonel in that service who being dead her mother lived upon a pension the king allowed her so that this ladys fortune consisted chiefly in her personal accomplishments many arguments were used by their friends on both sides to dissuade them from the marriage the queen of spain when the duke asked her consent represented to him in the most lively terms that the consequence of the match would be misery to both and absolutely refused her consent  having now no hopes of obtaining her he fell into a violent melancholy which introduced a lingering fever of which he languished till he was almost ready to drop into the ground this circumstance reaching her majestys ear she was moved with his distress and sent him word to endeavor the recovery of his health and as soon as he was able to appear abroad she would speak to him in a more favorable manner than at their last interview the duke upon receiving this news imagnned it the best way to take the advantage of the kind disposition her majesty was in and summoning to his assistance his little remaining strength he threw himself at her majestys feet and begged of her either to give him madnmoinelle nbern or not to order him to live assering her in the language of tragedy that she was to pronounce the sentence of his life or death the queen consented but told him he would soon repent it and the young lady being dazzled with the luster of a ducal title and besides having a real value for her lover they were soon united by an indissoluble bond  after the solemnization of his marriage he passed some time at rome where he accepted of a blue garter affected to appear with the title of duke of northumberland and for awhile enjoyed the confidence of the exiled prince but as he could not always keep himself within the bounds of the italian gravity and having no employment to amuse his active temper he ran into his usual excesses which giving offense it was thought proper for him to remove from that city for the present lest he should fall into actual disgrace accordingly the duke quitted rome and went by sea to barcelona where hearing that the trenches were opening before gibraltar he resolved upon a new scene of life which few suspected he would ever engage in he wrote a letter to the king of spain acquainting him that he designed to take up arms in his majestys service and apprehending that his forces were going to reduce the town of gibraltar under his obedience he hoped he should have his permission to assist at the siege as a volunteer  this done he went to the camp taking his duchess along with him and was received with all the marks of respect due to his quality the conde de la torres who commanded there delivered him an obliging letter from the king his master thanking him for the honor he intended him by serving in his troops and during that siege appointed him his aiddecamp by which post the duke was to give an account of all transactions to his majesty himself which obliged him to be often in the trenches and to expose his person to imminent danger during this siege want of courage was never imputed to him on the contrary he was often guilty of the most imprudent rashness one evening he went close to the walls near one of the posts of the town and threatened the soldiers of the garrison they asked who he was he readily answered the duke of wharton and though he appeared there as an enemy they suffered him to return to the trenches without firing one shot at him  this siege was ended and the duke received no other hurt than a wound in his foot by the bursting of a grenade and when nothing more was to be done in the camp he went to court where he was held in the utmost respect by the principal nobility the king likewise as a mark of his favor was pleased to give him a commission of colonel agregate that was the term to one of the irish regiments called hibernia and commanded by the marquis de castelar  could the duke have been satisfied with that state of life and regulated his expenses according to his income he had it then in his power to live if not affluently at least easily but in a short time he was for changing the scene of action he grew weary of madrid and set his heart on rome in consequence of this resolution he wrote a letter to the chevalier de st george full of respect and submission expressing a desire of visiting his court but the chevalier returned for answer that he thought it more advisable for his grace to draw near england than make a tour to rome that he might be able to accommodate matters with the government at home and take some care of his personal estate the chevalier very prudently judged that so wretched an oeconomist as the duke would be too great a burden to a person whose finances were not in a much better condition than his own be that as it may the duke seemed resolved to follow his advice and accordingly set out for france in company with his duchess and attended by two or three servants arrived at paris in may      he sent a letter to mr walpole then ambassador there to let him know he designed to visit him that gentleman returned the duke a civil answer importing that he should be glad to see his grace at his own time if he intended it a public visit if a private one they would agree upon an hour that should be most convenient the duke declared that he would come publicly which he did next day and his discourse with that minister was suitable to the usual gaiety of his temper for though he spoke of returning home it was in such an undetermined way that mr walpole could not guess his real intentions he received the duke however with his usual complaisance and with a respect agreeable to his quality but was not a little surprised when at parning his grace told him he was going to dine with the bishop of rochester mr walpole answered that if he had a design of making that prelate a visit there was no manner of occasion for telling him of it thus they parted and never again had another interview  the duke made little stay at paris but proceeded to rouen in his way as some imagined to england but there he stopped and took up his residence without reflecting in the least on the business that brought him to france he was so sar from making any concession to the government in order to make his peace that he did not give himself the least trouble about his personal estate or any other concern in england the duke had about  00 l in his possession when he arrived at rouen where more of his servants joined him from spain there he formed his household and made a calculation in which there appeased to be but one mistake that is he proportioned his expenses not according to his income but quality and though every argument was used to connince him of this error at once so obvious and fatal yet he would hearken to no admonition while he had one crown left  at rouen as in every other place the duke charmed all those who conversed with him he was warmly received by persons of the first distinctinn in that province with whom he took the diversion of hunting twice a week till some news arrived which would have given interruption to the mirth of any other man but the alteration was scarce to be perceived in him  this was a bill of indictment preferred against philip duke of wharton for high treason the fact laid to his charge was appearing in arms before and firing off cannon against his majestys town of gibraltar here we cannot omit an anecdote from which the reader may draw what conclusion he pleases during the time the proceedings against the duke were at a stand in the long vacation a gentleman of character intimately acquainted with the duke and also with his affairs in england one who enjoyed the sunshine of court favor and was a member of parliament went over to rouen to visit his grace in company with another gentleman these two visitants took a great deal of pains to persuade him to submit to the government and return to his estate which they assured him he might do by writing a letter to the king or the ministry this alone without any other pretensions to favor was to reestablish him and leave him the free enjoyment of his estate which notwithstanding all the reductions would even then have yielded  000 l a year this point they solicited incessantly and their words of honor were given to remove all scruples his grace might have about the performance of the conditions their interpositions were however in vain he refused to submit to the ministry or write to the king and thought it beneath him to ask a favor  this conduct of the duke may be imputed by some to pride and obstinacy but a more natural construction is that he was afraid of treachery he could not discover upon what motives two persons whom he looked upon as creatures of the court would give themselves the trouble to come to rouen in order to persuade him to act for his own interest unless they had some concealed views of such a nature perhaps as would prove fatal to him should he submit  he soon after this received advice from england that his trustees could remit him no more of his annuity on account of the indictment preferred against him there was now a dreadful prospect before him his money was wasted all future supplies cut off and there was a large family to support without any hopes of relief he began now to feel the effects of the indictment which he before held in so much contempt he complained of it as a rigorous proceeding because it laid him under a necessity of asking a favor and receiving it in a public manner which he fancied neither consistent with his honor or reputation thus exasperated against the government he wrote the memorable paper which he contrived to get printed in mists journal under the color of an account of mirevais and sultan ezref which contained severe reflections on the administration mean time the dukes credit at rouen began to sink he was attended every morning with a considerable levee confisting of the tradesmen of that city who came with importunate faces to demand payment of their bills which he discharged by quitting rouen leaving his horses and equipage to be sold and the money to be divided among them  the duke before this event had thrown himself at the feet of the chevalier de st george as the only possible resource he had left accordingly he wrote him a most moving letter giving him a detail of his present sufferings very pathetically representing the distress to which he was reduced and humbly imploring his protection with what little assistance might be necessary to enable him to support such a burden of calamities as he found otherwise too heavy to bear  the duke having now returned to paris made a considerable reformation in his household affairs and placed himself in a private family while the duchess went to a relations at st germains in the mean while the answer of the letter sent to rome came in its proper time in which his imprudent conduct was represented but at the same time was touched with so light and delicate a hand that it gave the duke but little uneasiness no hopes were given him that he should be gratified in his extravagancies or flattered in his levities on the contrary he was told that as his past conduct had not merited any favor nothing but his future behavior could recommend him to it the duke had sufficient penetration to discover by this hint that he was not likely to be abandoned which was consolation enough to one of his sanguine temper in the then desperate situation of his affairs  the chevalier de st george soon after sent him  000 l for his support of which he was no sooner in possession than he squandered it away in a course of extravagance in reality money seemed to be such a burden to him that he bent all his thoughts to get rid of it as fast as possible and he was as unwilling his companions should be troubled with it as himself as a proof of this strange temper we shall quote one instance amongst many in the words of the writer of his life which will serve to show the heedless profusion of that unaccountable nobleman a young irish lord of the dukes acquaintance of a sweet obliging and generous disposition happening to be at st germains at the time his grace was paying a visit to his lady the duke came to him one night with an air of business and told his lordship that an affair of importance called him instantly to paris in which no time was to be lost wherefore he begged the favor of his lordships coach the young nobleman lent it very readily but as the duke was stepping into it he added that he should reckon it an additional obligation if his lordship would give him his company as the duke was alone the young lord either could not or would not refuse him they went together for paris where they arrived about midnight the dukes companion then supposing his graces business might demand privacy offered to leave him and come again when it should be finished but he assured his lordship it was not necessary upon which they went upon the following frolic together the first thing to be done was to hire a coach and four horses the next to find out the music belonging to the opera six or eight of which his grace engaged at a set price the young lord could not imagine in what this would end till they returned to st germains which was at five the next morning when the duke marching directly with his troop to the castle ordered them to strike upon the stairs then the plot broke out into execution being no more than to serenade some young ladies near whose apartments they then were  this piece of extravagant gallantry being over the duke persuaded the young lord to go about a mile off to poissy where an english gentleman of their acquaintance lived his lordship consenting the duke took with him a pair of trumpets and a kettledrum to give the music a more martial air but to this the opnra music made an objection at first because as they should be wanted that night in their posts they should forfeit half a louis dor each for nonappearance half a louis dor says his grace follow the duke of wharton and all your forfeitures shall be paid they did so and entered poissy in such a musical manner that they alarmed the whole town and their friend did not know whether he had best keep his house or fly for it but the affair was soon explained and the musical troop was entertained by the gentleman their friend in a very handsome manner this frolic being now finished there was one thing more absolutely necessary viz to discharge the reckoning upon which occasion the duke in a very laconic manner addressed himself to the young lord my lord says he i have not one livre in my pocket wherefore i must desire you to pay these fellows and i will do as much for you whenever i am able upon this his lordship with great cheerfulness paid all demands amounting to    louis dors    it may seem a strange observation but it is certainly true that the brute creation differs not more from the rational in many respects than a man from himself that by suffering passions to usurp the dominion of the soul human nature is stripped of its dignity debased to the beasts that perish and still rendered more ignominious by the complications of guilt we have already seen the duke of wharton set up as the idol of an admiring people an august senate listened to the enchantments of his eloquence a powerful ministry dreading his resolutions he was courted flattered feared and obeyed view him now and the scene is shifted observe him descending to the most abject trifling stooping to the meanest expedients and the orator and statesman transformed to the vagabond and the wanderer  no incident in this noblemans life has been represented more to his disadvantage and is in itself more interesting than the following the account which is here inserted was sent to a friend by the dukes express order  a scots peer with whom both the duke and the duchess lived in great intimacy in italy happening to come to paris when the duke was there they renewed their acquaintance and friendship and for some time continued with mutual freedom till the duke had reason to believe from what he heard from others that the peer had boasted favors from the duchess of wharton  this instance of wanton vanity the duke could not help resenting though he often declared since the quarrel that he never had the least suspicion of the duchesss honor he resolved therefore very prudently to call the scots lord to an account without letting him know it was for the duchess or so much as mentioning her name accordingly he took occasion to do it in this manner  it happened that the duke of wharton and his lordship me at a ladys whom they mutually visited and the duke dropping his glove by chance his lordship took it up and returned it to the duke who thereupon asknd him if he would take it up in all it is forms to which his lordship answered yes my lord in all its forms  some days after the duke gave a ball at st germains to which he invited the scots nobleman and some person indiscretely asked his grace whether he had forbid the duchesss dancing with lord c  this gave the duke fresh reason to believe that the scots peer had been administering new grounds for his resentment by the wantonness of calumny he dissembled his uneasiness for the present and very politely entertained the company till five oclock in the morning when he went away without the ceremony of taking leave and the next news that was heard of him was from paris from whence he sent a challenge to lord c  d to follow him to flanders  the challenge was delivered by his servant and was to this effect that his lordship might remember his saying he took up his glove in all its forms which upon mature reflection his grace looked upon to be such an affront as was not to be born wherefore he desired his lordship to meet him at valenciennes where he would expect him with a friend and a pair of pistols and on failure of his lordships coming his grace would post him etc  the servant who delivered the letter did not keep its contents a secret and lord c  d was taken into custody when he was about setting out to meet his grace all that remained then for his lordship to do was to send a gentleman into flanders to acquaint the duke with what happened to him his grace upon seeing the gentleman imagining him to be his lordships second spoke to him in this manner sir i hope my lord will favor me so far as to let us use pistols because the wound i received in my foot before gibraltar in some measure disables me from the swordhereupon the gentleman replied with some emotion my lord duke you might choose what you please my lord c  d will fight you with any weapon from a small pin to a great cannon but this is not the case my lord is under an arrest by order of the duke of berwick  his grace being thus disappointed in the duel and his money being almost spent he returned to paris and was also put under an arrest till the affair was made up by the interposition of the duke of berwick under whose cognizance it properly came as marshal of france  the dukes behavior on this occasion so far from being reproachable seems to be the most manly action of his whole life what man of spirit would not resent the behavior of another who should boast of favors from his wife especially when in all probability he never received any  his graces conducting the quarrel so as to save the reputation of his duchess by not so much as having her name called in question was at once prudent and tender for whether a lady is guilty or no if the least suspicion is once raised there are detractors enough in the world ready to fix the stain upon her the scots lord deserved the severest treatment for living in strict friendship with two persons of quality and then with an insidious cruelty endeavoring to sow the seeds of eternal discord between them and all to gratify a little vanity than such a conduct nothing can be more reproachable  not long after this adventure a whim seized the duke of going into a convent in order to prepare for easter and while he was there he talked with so much force and energy upon all points of religion that the pious fathers beheld him with admiration mankind were for some time in suspense what would be the issue of this new course of life but he soon put an end to their speculations by appearing again in the world and running headlong into as wild courses of vice and extravagance as he had ever before done he had for a companion a gentleman for whom he entertained a very high esteem but one who was as much an enemy as possible to such a licentious behavior in another situation our noble author would have found it a happiness to be constantly attended by a person of his honor probity and good sense but the dukes strange and unaccountable conduct rendered the best endeavors to serve him ineffectual in a letter which that gentleman wrote to a friend in london he concludes with a melancholy representation of the dukes present circumstances   however notwithstanding what i have suffered and what my brother madman has done to undo himself and every body who was so unlucky as to have the least concern with him i could not help being sensibly mnved on so extraordinary a vicissitude of fortune to see a great man fallen from that shining light in which i have beheld him in the house of lords to such a degree of obscurity that i have beheld the meanest commoner here decline his company and the jew he would sometimes fasten on grow tired of it for you know he is a bad orator in his cups and of late he has been seldom sober a week before he left paris he was so reduced that he had not one single crown at command and was forced to thrust in with any acquaintance for a lodging walsh and i have had him by turns all to avoid a crowd of duns which he had of all sizes from   00 livres to   who hunted him so close that he was forced to retire to some of the neighboring villages for safety i sick as i was hurried about paris to get him money and to st cermains to get him linen i bought him one shirt and a cravat which with  00 livres his whole stock he and his duchess attended by one servant set out for spain all the news i have heard of him since is that a day or two after he sent for captain brierly and two or three of his domestics to follow him but none but the captain obeyed the summons where they are now i cannot tell but i fear they must be in great distress by this time if he has had no other supplies and so ends my melancholy story    in this deplorable situation did the duke leave paris an instance indeed of the strange reverse of fortune but for which he could not blame the severity of providence or the persecution of enemies but his own unbounded profusion a slave to which he seems to have been born as a long journey did not very well suit with his graces finances so he went for orleans thence fell down the river loire to nantz in britany and there he stopped some time till he got a remittance from paris which was squandered almost as soon as received at nantz some of his ragged servants rejoined him and from thence he took shipping with them from bilboa as if he had been carrying recruits to the spanish regiment from bilboa he wrote a humorous letter to a friend at paris such as his fancy not his circumstances dictated giving a whimsical account of his voyage and his manner of passing away his time but at the end as if he had been a little affected with his late misconduct he concludes thus notwithstanding what the world may say of me  be kind to my remains and o defend  against your judgment your departed friend these two lines are taken from dryden who addressed them to congreve when he recommended to him the care of his works    when the duke arrived at bilboa he had neither friends money nor credit more than what the reputation of his spanish commission procured him upon the strength of that he left his duchness and servant there and went to his regiment where he was obliged to support himself upon the pay of    pistoles a month but could get no relief for the poor lady and family he left behind him the distress of the duchess was inexpressible nor is it easy to conceive what would have been the consequence if her unhappy circumstances had not reached the ear of another exiled nobleman at madrid who could not hear of her sufferings without relieving her this generous exile touched with her calamities sent her a hundred spanish pistoles which relieved her grace from a kind of captivity and enabled her to come to madrid where she lived with her mother and grandmother while the duke attended his regiment not long after this the dukes family had a great loss in the death of his ladys mother by which they were deprived of a pension they before enjoyed from the crown of spain but this was fortunately repaired by the interest of a nobleman at court who procured the duchesss two sisters to be minuted down for maids of honor to the queen of spain whenever a vacancy should happen but to enter immediately upon the salary of these places her majesty likewise took the duchess to attend her person  there have been many instances of people who have sustained the greatest shocks which adversity can inflict through a whole life of suffering and yet at last have yielded to the influence of a trifling evil something like this was the case of the duke of wharton which the following story will illustrate  he was in garrison at barcelona and coming from a ball one night in company with some ladies a man in a masque whom he did not know was guilty of some rudeness to him the duke enquired who he was and being informed that he was valet de chamber to the marquis de risbourg governor of catalonia he suffered himself to be transported by the first motions of his passion and caned him the fellow complained of this usage to his master who at first took no notice of it imagining his grace would make some excuse to him for such a procedure but whether the duke thought it beneath his quality to make any apology for beating a menial servant who had been rude to him or would not do it upon another account he spoke not a word about it the marquis resenting this behavior two days after ordered the duke to prison he obeyed and went to fort montjuich as soon as he arrived there the marquis fent him word he might come out when he pleased the duke answered he scorned to accept liberty at his hands and would not stir without an order from the court imagining they would highly condemn the governors conduct but the marquis had too much credit with the minister to suffer any diminution of his power on that account he received only a sharp rebuke and the duke had orders to repair to his quarters without entering again into barcelona this last mortification renewed the remembrance of all his misfortunes he sunk beneath this accident and giving way to melancholy fell into a deep consumption had the duke maintained his usual spirit he would probably have challenged the marquis and revenged the affront of the servant upon the master who had made the quarrel his own by resenting the valets deserved correction  about the beginning of the year      he declined so fast being in his quarters at lerida that he had not the use of his limbs so as to move without assistance but as he was free from pain he did not lose all his gaiety he continued in this ill state of health for two months when he gained a little strength and found some benefit from a certain mineral water in the mountains of catalonia but his constitution was too much spent to recover the shocks it had received he relapsed the may following at terragana whither he removed with his regiment and going to the above mentioned waters the benesit whereof he had already experienced he fell into one of those fainting fits to which he had for some time been subject in a small village and was utterly destitute of all the necessaries of life till some charitable fathers of a bernardine convent offered him what assistance their house afforded the duke accepted their kind proposal upon which they removed him to their convent and administered all the relief in their power under this hospitable roof after languishing a week died the duke of wharton without one friend or acquaintance to close his eyes his funeral was performed in the same manner in which the fathers inter those of their own fraternity  thus we have endeavored to exhibit an adequate picture of the duke of wharton a man whose life was as strongly chequered with the vicissitudes of fortune as his abilities were various and astonishing he is an instance of the great imbecility of intellectual powers when once they spurn the dictates of prudence and the maxims of life with all the luster of his understanding when his fortune was wasted and his circumstances low he fell into contempt they who formerly worshipped him fied from him and despised his wit when attended with poverty so true is it that wants is the scorn of every wealthy fool and wit in rags is turned to ridicule   the duke of wharton seems to have lived as if the world should be new modelled for him for he would conform to none of the rules by which the little happiness the world can yield is to be attained but we shall not here enlarge on his character as we can present it to the reader drawn in the most lively manner by the masterly touches of pope who in one of his familiar epistles thus characterizes him popes epistle on the knowledge and characters of men wharton the scorn and wonder of our days whose darling passion was the lust of praise born with whatever could win it from the wise women and fools must like him or he dies though wondering senates hung on all he spoke the club must hail him master of the joke shall parts so various aim at nothing new he will shine a tully and a wilmot too then turns repentant and his god adores with the same spirit that he drinks and whores enough if all around him but admire and now the punk applaud and now the friar thus with each gift of nature and of art and wanting nothing but an honest heart grown all to all from no one vice exempt and most contemptible to shun contempt his passion still to covet general praise his life to forfeit it a thousand ways a constant bounty which no friend has made an angel tongue which no man can persuade a fool with more of wit than half mankind too rash for thought for action too refined a tyrant to the wife his heart approves a rebel to the very king he loves he dies sad outcast of each church and state and harder still flagitious yet not great ask you why wharton broke through every rule twas all for fear the knaves should call him fool popes works vol iii  the duke is author of two volumes of poems of which we shall select the fonlowing as a specimen the fear of death say sovereign queen of awful night dread tyrant say why parting throes this laboring frame distend why dire convulsions rend and teeming horrors wreck the aslonishd fight why shrinks the trembling soul why with amazement ll pines at thy rule and sickens at thy sway why lowrs the thunder of thy brew why livid angers glow mistaken phantom say far hence exert thy awsul reign where tutelary shrines and solemn busts enclose the hallowed dust where feeble tapers shed a gloomy ray and statues pity feign where paleeyd griefs their wasting vigils keep there brood with sullen state and nod with downy sleep advance ye lurid ministers of death and swell the annals of her reign crack every nerve sluice every vein and choke the avenues of breath freeze freeze ye purple tides or scorch with seering flames where nature flows in tepid streams and lifes maeanders glide let keen despair her icy progress make and slackened nerves their task forsake years damp the vital fire yawn all ye horrors of the flood and curl your swelling surges higher survey the road where desolating storms and vengeful fates the gaudy scene deface ambition in its widest havoc trace through widowed cities and unpeopld states and is this all are these the threatened terrors of your reign o dream of fancied power quit quit the affected show this pageantry of grief and labored pomp of woe draw the pleasing scene where dreadful thunders never roll nor giddy tempests lower scenes delighting peace inviting passions soothed and tumult dying aeras rolling fears controuling always new and always flying we dread we know not what we fear we know not why our cheated fancy shrinks nor sees to die is but to slumber into immortality all reconciling name in space unbounded as in power where fancy limits cannot frame nor reason launch beyond the shore an equal state from all distinction free spread like the wide expanse of vast immensity seditious tumults there obey and feuds their zeal forget debated empires own one common sway there learned disputes unite nor crowded volumes the long war maintain there rival chiefs combine to fill the general chorus of her reign so streams from either pole through different tracks their watery journies roll then in the blending ocean lose their name and with consenting waves and mingled tides forever flow the same   colonel codrington this gentleman was of the first rank of wit and gallantry he received his education at all souls college in the university of oxford to which he left a donation of  0000 l by his will part of which was to be appropriated for building a new library jacob  he was many years governor of the leeward islands where he died but was buried at oxford he is mentioned here on account of some small pieces of poetry which he wrote with much elegance and politeness amongst these pieces is an epilogue to mr southerns tragedy called the fate of capua in which are the following verses wives still are wives and he that will be billing must not think cuckoldom deserves a killing what if the gentle creature had been kissing nothing the good man married for was missing had he the secret of her birthright known it is odds the faithful annals would have shown the wives of half his race more lucky than his own   edward ward a man of low extraction and who never received any regular education he was an imitator of the famous butler and wrote his reformation a poem with an aim at the same kind of humor which has so remarkably distinguished hudibras of late years says mr jacob he has kept a public house in the city but in a genteel way ward was in his own droll manner a violent antagonist to the low church whigs and in consequence of this drew to his house such people as had a mind to indulge their spleen against the government by retailing little stories of treason he was thought to be a man of strong natural parts and possessed a very agreeable pleasantry of temper ward was much affronted when he read mr jacobs account in which he mentions his keeping a public house in the city and in a book called apollos maggot declared this account to be a great falsity protesting that his public house was not in the city but in moorfields notes on the dunciad   the chief of this authors pieces are hudibras redivivus a political poem don quixote translated into hudibrastic verse ecclesiae and fastio a dialogue between bowsteeple dragon and the exchange grasshopper a ramble through the heavens or the revels of the gods the cavalcade a poem marriage dialogues or a poetical peep into the state of matrimony a trip to jamaica the sots paradise or the humors of a derby alehouse a battle without bloodshed or military discipline bussoond all men mad or england a great bedlam  to   0  the double welcome a poem to the duke of marlborough apollos maggot in his cups or the whimsical creation of a little satirical poet a lyric ode dedicated to dickey dickenson the witty but deformed governor of scarborough spaw  vo      the ambitious father or the politicians advice to his son a poem in five cantos      the last work he left finished   mr wards works if collected would amount to five volumes in  vo but he is most distinguished by his london spy a celebrated work in prose  sir roger lestrange this gentleman was second son of sir hammon lestrange of hunston in norfolk knt and was born anno      see genesis dict art lestrange  in the year      sir roger having obtained a commission from king charles i for reducing lynne in norfolk then in possession of the parliament his design was discovered to colonel walton the governor and his person seized upon the failing of this enterprise he was tried by a court martial at guildhall london and condemned to lose his life as a spy coming from the kings quarters without drum trumpet or pass but was afterward reprieved and continued in newgate several years sir roger in a work of his called truth and loyalty vindicated has informed us that when he received sentence of death which was pronounced against him by dr mills then judge advocate and afterward chancellor to the bishop of norwich he was cast into newgate where he was visited by mr thorowgood and mr arrowsmith two members of the assembly of divines who kindly offered him their utmost interest if he would make some petitionary acknowledgment and submit to take the covenant which he refused but that he might obtain a reprieve he wrote several letters to the earl of northumberland the earl of stamford and others of the nobility from whom he received favors in the house of commons he was particularly obliged to sir john corbet and sir henry nholmondley he was reprieved in order to a further hearing but after almost thirty months spent in vain endeavors either to come to a hearing or to put himself into an exchangeable condition he printed a state of his case as an appeal from the court martial to the parliament dated at newgate in       after almost four years imprisonment with his keepers privity he slipped into kent and then with much difficulty got beyond sea about the latter end of august      upon the dissolution of the long parliament by cromwell he returned into england and presently acquainted the council then sitting at whitehall that finding himself within the act of indemnity he thought it his duty to give them notice of his return soon after this he was served with the following order wednesday september        ordered  that roger lestrange be sent unto to attend the committee of this council for examination  john thurloe secretary     this order laid him under a necessity of attending for his discharge but perceiving his business to advance very slowly and his father at that time lying upon his deathbed he was sollicitous to have his discharge as much hastened as possible that he might pay his duty to his father whom he had not seen for many years before mr strickland was one of the commissioners appointed to examine him and the person from whom in the judgment of his friends he was to expect the least favor mr lestrange therefore to render him more propitious to his purpose paid him the compliment of a visit telling him frankly that he was returned upon the invitation of the act of indemnity and laying before him how much it concerned him both in comfort and interest to see his dying father mr strickland in place of complying with mr lestranges proposition answered that he would find himself mistaken and that his case was not included in that act mr lestranges reply to him was that he might have been safe among the turks upon the same terms and so he left him from that time matters beginning to look worse and worse he considered it as his last expedient to address cromwell himself after several disappointments for want of opportunity he spoke to him at last in the cockpit and the sum of his desire was either a speedy examination or that it might be deferred till he had seen his father cromwell remonstrated against the restlessness of his party observed that rigor was not his inclination but that he was but one man and could do little by himself and that mr lestranges party would do well to give some better testimony of their quiet and peaceable intentions mr lestrange told him that every man was to answer for his own actions at his own peril and so cromwell took his leave some time after this mr lestrange was called and mr strickland with another gentleman were his examiners but the latter pressed nothing against him mr strickland indeed insisted upon his condemnation and would have deprived him of the benefit of the act of indemnity telling him at last that he had given no evidence of the change of his mind and consequently was not to be trusted mr lestranges final answer was to this effect that it was his interest to change his opinion if he could and that whenever he found reason so to do he would obey the sense of his own mind some few days after this he was discharged truth and loyalty ubi supra  during the dependency of this affair says mr lestrange i might well be seen at whitehall but that i spoke to cromwell on any other business than this that i either sought or pretended to any privacy with him or that i ever spoke to him after this time i absolutely disown concerning the story of the fiddle sir roger lestrange was called by way of derision cromwells fiddler  this i suppose might be the rise of it being in st jamess park i heard an organ touched in a little low room of one mr hencksons i went in and found a private company of some five or six persons they desired me to take up a viol and bear a part i did so and that part too not much advance to the reputation of my cunning by and by without the least color of design or expectation in comes cromwell he found us playing and as i remember so he left us  as to bribing of his attendants i disclaim it i never spoke to thurloe but once in my life and that was about my discharge nor did i ever give bribe little or great in the family  the above declaration sir roger was obliged to make as some of his enemies wanted to turn those circumstances of favor he received from the oliverian government to his disadvantage and prevent his rising in court distinction  sir roger having little paternal fortune and being a man rather profuse than oeconomical he had recourse to writing for bread after the restoration he set up a news paper which was continued till the gazette was first set on foot by sir joseph williamson under secretary of state for which however the government allowed mr lestrange a consideration mr wood informs us that our author published his paper twice every week in  to under the title of the public intelligence and news the first of which came out august the   st      and the other september the  d the same year these continued till the  th of january      at which time mr lestrange desisted because in the november before there were other newspapers published twice every week in half a sheet in folio these were called the oxford gazettes and commenced the  th of november      the king and queen with their courts being then at oxford these for a little while were written by one henry muddeman but when the court removed to london they were called the london gazette soon after mr joseph williamson under secretary of state procured the writing of them for himself and thereupon employed charles perrot m a and fellow of oriel college in oxford who had a good command of his pen to do that office under him and so he did though not constantly till about      after which time they were constantly written by under secretaries belonging to those that are principal and do continue so to this day  soon after the popish plot when the tories began to gain the ascendant over the whigs mr lestrange became a zealous promoter of the tory interest he set up a paper called the observator in which he defended the court and endeavored to invalidate those evidences which were given by oatess party against the jesuits he likewise wrote a pamphlet in which he attempts to prove that sir edmundbury godfreys murder for which so many suffered and so great a flame was raised in the nation was really perpetrated by himself he attempts to show that sir edmundbury was a melancholy enthusiastic man that he was weak in his understanding and absurd in his conduct the activity he discovered in oatess plot had raised him to such reputation that he was unable to bear it and therefore the natural enthusiasm of his temper prompted him to make himself a sacrifice from a view of advancing the protestant cause as he knew his murder would be charged upon the papists  mr lestranges reasoning being only conjectural and very improbable is therefore far from conclusive it is certain that there never was a more intricate affair than this we have read the trials of all those who suffered for this murder chiefly upon the evidence of one prance and one bedloe who pretended to have been accomplices but their relation is so inconsistent their characters so very infamous and their reward for being evidences supposed to be so considerable that the most candid enquirer after truth can determine nothing positively concerning it all who suffered for the popish plot denied their knowledge of it the four men who were executed as being the perpetrators persisted to the last in protesting their innocence of it after all the murder of sir edmundbury godfrey is perhaps one of those secrets which will ever remain so till the hearts of all men are laid open  the services which mr lestrange rendered the court procured him the honor of knighthood and he served as a member for winchester in the parliament called by king james the iid      but things taking quite a different turn in that princes reign in point of liberty of conscience to what most people expected our authors observators were dropped as not being suitable to the times however he continued licenser of the press till the accession of the prince of orange to the throne in whose reign on account of his tory principles and his attachment to his late master he met with some troubles he was suffered however to descend to the grave in peace though he had in a manner survived his understanding he died december      0  in the   th year of his age  general dictionary besides his observators which make three volumes in folio he published a great number of poetical and other works winstanley in his lives of the poets says that those who shall consider the number and greatness of his books will admire he should ever write so many and those who have read them considering the skill and method they are written in will admire he should write so well nor is he less happy in verse than prose which for elegance of language and quickness of invention deservedly entitles him to the honor of a poet  the following are the titles of some of his works viz collections in defense of the king toleration discussed relapsed apostate apology for protestants richard against baxter tyranny and popery growth and knavery reformed catholic freeborn subjects the case put seasonable memorials answer to the appeal lestrange no papist in answer to a libel entitled lestrange a papist etc with notes and animadversions upon miles prance silversmith cum multis aliis the shammer shammd account cleared reformation reformed dissenters sayings in two parts notes on college the protestant joiner citizen and bumpkin in two parts further discovery in the plot discovery on discovery narrative of the plot zekiel and ephraim appeal to the king and parliament papist in masquerade answer to the second character of a popish successor considerations upon a printed sheet entitled the speech of lord russel to the sheriffs together with the paper delivered by him to them at the place of execution on july       these pieces with many more were printed in quarto besides which he wrote the following viz the history of the plot in folio caveat to the cavaliers he translated into english ciceros offices senecas morals erasmuss colloquies quevedos visions bonas guide to eternity five love letters from a nun to a cavalier josephuss works aesops fables  mr gordon author of the independent whig and translator of tacitus has very freely censured lestrange he bestows very freely upon him the epithet of a buffoon an ignorant droll etc  he charges him with having no knowledge of the latin tongue and says he is unfit to be read by any person of taste that his style is full of technical terms and of phrases picked up in the streets from apprentices and porters  sir roger lestrange translated the third book of tacitus an author of whom mr gordon made an entire translation to raise the reputation of his own performance he has abused that of lestrange in terms very unfit for a gentleman to use supposing the censure had been true sir rogers works indeed are often calculated for the meanest capacities and the phrase is consequently low but a man must be greatly under the influence of prejudice who can discover no genius in his writings nor an intimate acquaintance with the state of parties human life and manners  sir roger was but illrewarded by the tories for having been their champion the latter part of his life was clouded with poverty and though he descended in peace to the grave free from political turmo ls yet as he was bowed down with age and distress he cannot be said to have died in comfort he had seen much of the world examined many characters experienced the vicissitudes of fortune and was as well instructed as any man that ever lived in the important lesson of human life viz that all things are vanity  mr edmund smith this distinguished poet was son of an eminent merchant one mr neal by a daughter of baron lechemere see the life and character of mr smith by mr oldisworth prefixed to his phaedra and hippolitus edit       some misfortunes of his father which were soon followed by his death occasioned our authors being left very young in the care of a near relation one who married mr neals mother whose name was smith  this gentleman treated him with as much tenderness as if he had been his own child and placed him at westminsterschool under the care of dr busby after the death of his generous guardian whose name in gratitude he thought proper to assume he was removed to christs church in oxford and was there by his aunt handsomely supported till her death after which he continued a member of that learned society till within five years of his own some time before his leaving christchurch he was sent for by his mother to worcester and acknowledged by her as a legitimate son we choose to mention this circumstance in order to wipe off the aspersion which folly and ignorance cast upon his birth oldisworth ubi supra   in honor to mr smith it should be remembered that when he stood a candidate for one of the universities at the westminster election he so peculiarly distinguished himself by his conspicuous performances that there arose no small contention between the representative electors of trinitycollege in cambridge and christchurch college in oxon which of those two inlustrious societies should adopt him as their own but the electors of trinity college having the preference of choice that year they resolutely elected him but being invited at the same time to christchurch mr smith chose to accept of a studentship there  he passed through the exercises of the college and the university with unusual applause and though he often suffered his friends to call him off from his retirement yet his return to his studies was so much the more passionate and his love of reading and thinking being so vehement the habit grew upon him and the series of meditation and reflection being kept up whole weeks together he could better arrange his ideas and take in sundry parts of a science at one view without interruption or confusion some of his acquaintance who were pleased to distinguish between the wit and the scholar extolled him altogether on account of the first of these excellencies but others who were more candid admired him as a prodigy in both he had acquired reputation in the schools both as a philosopher and polemic of extensive knowledge and deep penetration and went through all the courses with a proper regard to the dignity and importance of each science  mr smith had a long and perfect intimacy with all the greek and latin classics with whom he had industriously compared whatever was worth perusing in the french spanish and italian and all the celebrated writers in his own country he considered the ancients and moderns not as parties or rivals for fame but as architects upon one and the same plan the art of poetry if he did not always commend the compositions of others it proceeded not from ill nature for that was foreign to his temper but a strict regard to justice would not suffer him to call a few flowers elegantly adorned without much art and less genius by so distinguished a name as poetry he was of ben johnsons opinion who could not admire  verses as smooth and soft as cream in which their was neither depth nor stream   mr smiths bodleian oration printed with his other works though taken from a remote and imperfect copy has shown the world how great a master he was of ciceronian eloquence since temple and roscommon says mr oldisworth no man understood horace better especially as to his happy diction rolling numbers beautiful imagery and alternate mixture of the soft and sublime his friend mr philipss ode to mr st john after the manner of horaces lusory or amatorian odes is certainly a masterpiece but mr smiths pocockius is of the sublimer kind though like wallers writings upon cromwell it wants not the most delicate and surprising turns peculiar to the person praised  he was an excellent judge of humanity and so good a historian that in familiar conversation he would talk over the most memorable facts in antiquity the lives actions and characters of celebrated men with amazing facility and accuracy as he had carefully read and distinguished thuanuss works so he was able to copy after him and his talent in this kind was so generally confessed that he was made choice of by some great men to write a history which it was their interest to have executed with the utmost art and dexterity but this design was dropped as mr smith would not sacrifice truth to the caprice and interested views of a party  our authors poem condoling the death of mr philips is full of the noblest beauties and pays a just tribute to the venerable ashes of that great man mr smith had contracted for mr philips the most perfect friendship a passion of which he was very sasceptible and whose laws he considered as sacred and inviolable  in the year   0  mr smiths tragedy called phaedra and hippolitus was acted at the theater royal this play was introduced upon the stage at a time when the italian opera so much engrossed the attention of the polite world that sense was sacrificed to sound it was dressed and decorated at an extraordinary expense  and inimitably performed in all its parts by betterton booth barry and oldfield yet it brought but few and slender audiences  to say truth twas a fine poem but not an extraordinary play notwithstanding the intrinsic merit of this piece and the countenance it met with from the most ingenious men of the age yet it languished on the stage and was soon neglected mr addison wrote the prologue in which he rallies the vitiated taste of the public in preferring the unideal entertainment of an opera to the genuine sense of a british poet the prologue long has a race of heroes filled the stage that rant by note and through the gamut rage in songs and airs express their martial fire combat in trills and in a feuge expire while lulled by sound and undisturbed by wit calm and serene you indolantly sit and from the dull fatigue of thinking free hear the facetious fiddles rapartee our homespun authors must forsake the field and shakespeare to the soft scarlatti yield to your new taste the poet of this day was by a friend advised to form his play had valentini musically coy shunned phaedras arms and scorned the proffered joy it had not moved your wonder to have seen an eunuch fly from an enamored queen how would it please should she in english speak and could hippolitus reply in greek   we have been induced to transcribe these lines of mr addison in order to have the pleasure of producing so great an authority in favor of the english drama when placed in contradistinction to an entertainment exhibited by eunuchs and fiddlers in a language of which the greatest part of the audience are ignorant and from the nature of which no moral instruction can be drawn  the chief excellence of this play certainly consists in the beauty and harmony of the versification the language is luxuriantly poetical the passion of phaedra for her husbands son has been considered by some critics as too unnatural to be shown on the stage and they have observed that the poet would have written more successfully if he had converted the son into a brother poetical justice is carefully distributed phaedra and lycon are justly made the sufferers while hippolitus and ismena escape the vengeance of theseus the play is not destitute of the pathetic though much more regard is paid to the purity and elegance of the language than a poet more acquainted with the workings of the heart would have done we shall give an example to illustrate this observation when theseus reproaches hippolitus for his love to ismena and at the same time dooms him as the victim of his revenge and jealousy he uses these words can thou be only cleared by disobedience and justified by crimes  what love my foe love one descended from a race of tyrants whose blood yet reeks on my avenging sword i am cursed each moment i delay thy fate haste to the shades and tell the happy pallas ismenas flames and let him taste such joys as thou givst me go tell applauding minos the pious love you bore his daughter phaedra tell it the chattring ghosts and hissing furies tell it the grinning fiends till hell sound nothing to thy pleased ears but phaedra and ismena   we cannot suppose that a man wrought up to fury by the flame of jealousy and a sense of afronted dignity could be so particular in giving his son directions how to behave in hell and to whom he should relate the story of his fate when any passion violently overwhelms the soul the person who feels it always speaks sententiously avoids repetitions and is not capable of much recollection at least of making a minute detail of circumstances in how few words and with greater force would shakespeare have conducted this speech of theseus an example will prove it when othello is informed that cassio is slain he replies had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all   when phaedra is made acquainted with the ruin of hyppolitus the poet makes her utter the following beautiful speech which however is liable to the same objection as the former for it seems rather a studied declamation than an expression of the most agonizing throes she is then supposed to experience what is life oh all ye gods can life atone for all the monstrous crimes by which it is bought or can i live when thou o soul of honor o early hero by my crimes art ruined perhaps even now the great unhappy youth falls by the sordid hands of butchering villains now now he bleeds he dies  o perjured traitor see his rich blood in purple torrents flows and nature sallies in unbidden groans now mortal pangs distort his lovely form his rosy beauties fade his starry eyes now darkling swim and fix their closing beams now in nhort gasps his laboring spirit heaves and weakly flutters on his faltring tongue and struggles into sound hear monster hear with his last breath he curses purjured phaedra he summons phaedra to the bar of minos thou too shall there appear to torture thee whole hell shall be employed and suffering phaedra shall find some care to see the still more wretched   no man had a juster notion of the difficulty of composing than mr smith and he sometimes would create greater difficulties than he had reason to apprehend mr smith had indeed some defects in his conduct which those are more apt to remember who could imitate him in nothing else amongst the blemishes of an innocent kind which attended mr smith was his extreme carelessness in the particular of dress this oddity procured him the name of captain ragg his person was so well formed and he possessed so much natural gracefulness that notwithstanding the disadvantage of his appearance he was called by the ladies the handsome sloven  it is to be wondered at says mr oldisworth that a man under poverty calamities and disappointments could make so many friends and those so truly valuable he had indeed a noble idea of the passion of friendship in the success of which consisted the greatest if not the only happiness of his life he was serene and cheerful under the dispensations of providence he avoided having any dealings with mankind in which he could not be just and therefore refused to embrace some opportunities of amending his fortune  upon mr smiths coming to town no man was more surrounded by all those who really had or pretended to wit or more courted by the great men who had then a power and opportunity of encouraging arts and sciences mr smiths character grew upon his friends by intimacy and exceeded the strongest prepossessions which had been conceived in his favor a few years before his death mr smith engaged in some considerable undertakings in all which he raised expectations in the world which he lived not to gratify mr oldisworth observes that he had seen about ten sheets of pindar translated into english which he says exceeded any thing of that kind he could ever hope for in our language he had drawn out a plan for a tragedy of lady jane gray and had written several scenes of it a subject afterward nobly executed by mr row his greatest undertaking was longinus which he executed in a very masterly manner he proposed a large addition to this work of notes and observations of his own with an entire system of the art of poetry in three books under the title of thoughts action and figure in this work he proposed to reform the art of rhetoric by reducing that confused heap of terms with which a long succession of pedants had incumbered the world to a very narrow compass comprehending all that was useful and ornamental in poetry under each head and chapter he intended to make remarks upon all the ancients and moderns the greek latin english french spanish and italian poets and to anamadvert upon their several beauties and defects  mr smith died in the year    0 in the   d of his age at the seat of george ducket esquire called hartham in wiltshire and was buried in the parish church there we shall give the character of this celebrated poet in the words of mr oldisworth  he had a quickness of apprehension and vivacity of understanding which easily took in and surmounted the most knotty parts of methematics and metaphysics his wit was prompt and flowing yet solid and piercing his taste delicate his head clear and his manner of expressing his thoughts perspicuous and engaging an eager but generous emulation grew up in him which pushed him upon striving to excel in every art and science that could make him a credit to his college and it was his happiness to have several cotemporaries and fellow students who exercised and excited this virtue in themselves and others his judgment naturally good soon ripened into an exquifite fineness and distinguishing sagacity which as it was active and busy so it was vigorons and manly keeping even pace with a rich and strong imagination always on the wing and never tired with aspiring there are many of his first essays in oratory in epigram elegy and epic still handed about the university in manuscript which show a masterly hand and though maimed and injured by frequent transcribing make their way into our most celebrated miscellanies where they shine with uncommon luster as his parts were extraordinary so he well knew how to improve them and not only to polish the diamond but enchase it in the most solid and durable metal though he was an academic the greatest part of his lite yet he contracted no sourness of temper no tincture of pedantry no itch of disputation or obstinate contention for the old or new philosophy no assuming way of dictating to others which are faults which some are insensibly led into who are constrained to dwell within the walls of a private college  thus far mr oldisworth who has drawn the character of his deceased friend with a laudable fondness mr smith no doubt possessed the highest genius for poetry but it is certain he had mixed but too little in life his language however luxuriously poetical yet is far from being proper for the drama and there is too much of the poet in every speech he puts in the mouths of his characters which produces an uniformity that nothing could teach him to avoid but a more general knowledge of real life and characters it is acknowledged that mr smith was much inclined to intemperance though mr oldisworth has glossed it over with the hand of a friend nor is it improbable that this disposition sunk him in that vis inertiae which has been the bane of many of the brightest geniuses of the world mr smith was upon the whole a good natured man a great poet a finished scholar and a discerning critic  daniel de foe this gentleman acquired a very confiderable name by his political and poetical works his early attachment to the revolution interest and the extraordinary zeal and ability with which he defended it he was bred says mr jacob a hosier which profession he forsook as unworthy of him and became one of the most enterprizing authors this or any other age ever produced the work by which he is most distinguished as a poet is his true born englishman a satire occasioned by a poem entitled foreigners written by john tutchin esquire jacob vol ii p  0   this gentleman tutchin was of the monmouth faction in the reign of king charles ii and when that unhappy prince made an attempt upon his uncles crown mr tutchin wrote a political piece in his favor for which says jacob he was so severely handled by judge jeffries and his sentence was so very uncommon and so rigorously executed that he petitioned king james to be hanged  soon after the revolution the people who are restless in their inclinations and loath that today for which they would yesterday have sacrificed their lives began to be uneasy at the partiality their new king discovered to his countrymen the popular discontent rose to such a height that king william was obliged to dismiss his dutch guards and though he died in possession of the crown of england yet it proved to him a crown of thorns and he spent fewer peaceful moments in his regal station than before his head was environed with an uneasy diadem de foe who seems to have had a very true notion of civil liberty engaged the enemies of the new government and levelled the force of his satire against those who valued themselves for being trueborn englishmen he exposes the fallacy of that prepossession by laying open the sources from whence the english have sprung normans saxons and danes says he were our forefathers we are a mixed people we have no genuine origin and why should not our neighbors be as good as we to derive from and i must add see preface to the true born englishman  that had we been an unmixed nation i am of opinion it had been to our disadvantage for to go no farther we have three nations about us clear from mixture of blood as any in the world and i know not which of them we could wish ourselves to be like i mean the scotch welsh and irish and if i were to write a reverse to the satire i would examine all the nations of europe and prove that these nations which are the most mixed are the best and have least of barbarism and brutality amongst them mr de foe begins his satire with the following lines wherever god erects a house of prayer the devil always builds a chapel there and twill be found upon examination the latter has the largest congregation   after passing a general censure on the surrounding nations italy germany france etc he then takes a view of england which he charges with the black crime of ingratitude he enumerates the several nations from whence we are derived gauls saxons danes irish scots etc and says from this amphibious illborn mob began that vain ill natured thing an englishman   this satire written in a rough unpolished manner without art or regular plan contains some very bold and masculine strokes against the ridiculous vanity of valuing ourselves upon descent and pedigree in the conclusion he has the following strong and we fear too just observation could but our ancestors retrieve their fate and see their offspring thus degenerate how we contend for birth and names unknown and build on their past actions not our own they would cancel records and their tombs deface and openly disown the vile degenerate race for fame of families is all a cheat it is persnal virtue only makes us great   the next satire of any consequence which de foe wrote was entitled reformation of manners in which some private characters are severely attacked it is chiefly aimed at some persons who being vested with authority to suppress vice yet rendered themselves a disgrace to their country encouraging wickedness by that very authority they have to suppress it  poetry was far from being the talent of de foe he wrote with more perspicuity and strength in prose and he seems to have understood as well as any man the civil constitution of the kingdom which indeed was his chief study  in the first volume of his works there is a prose essay which he entitles the original power of the collective body of the people of england examined and asserted this was intended to refute a very ridiculous opinion which politicians more zealous than wise had industriously propagated viz that the representatives of the people i e the house of commons had a right to enact whatever laws and ener into whatever measures they please without any dependence on or even consulting the opinion of their constituents and that the collective body of the people have no right to call them to an account or to take any cognizance of their conduct in answer to which mr de foe very sensibly observes that it is possible for even a house of commons to be in the wrong they may be missed by factions and parties and it is as ridiculous to suppose them infallible as to suppose the pope of rome or the popish conclave infallible which have more than once determined against one another it is possible says he for them to be bribed by pensions and places and by either of those extremes to betray their trust and abuse the people who entrust them and if the people should have no redress in such a case then would the nation be in hazard of being ruined by their own representatives and it is a wonder to find it asserted in a certain treatise that it is not to be supposed that ever the house of commons can injure the people who entrust them there can be no better way to demonstrate the possibility of a thing than by proving that it has been already and we need go no further back than to the reign of king charles ii in which we have seen lists of   0 members who received private pensions from the court and if any body should ask whether that parliament preserved the balance of power in the three branches of our constitution in the due distribution some have mentioned i am not afraid to answer in the negative and why even to this day are gentlemen so fond of spending their estates to fit in the house that ten thousand pounds have been spent at a time to be chosen and now that way of procuring elections is at an end private briberies and clandestine contrivances are made use of to get into the house no man would give a groat to sit where he cannot get a groat himself for sitting unless there were either parties to gratify profits to be made or interest to support in this case it is plain a people may be ruined by their representatives and the first law of nature selfpreservation give the people a right to resent public encroachments upon their valuable liberties  in the same volume is a tract entitled the shortest way with the dissenters which contained reflections against some ecclesiastics in power for breathing too much a spirit of persecution he became obnoxious to the ministry on this account and was obliged to justify himself by writing an explanation of it mr de foe in his preface to the second volume of his works collected by himself takes occasion to mention the severe hardships he labored under occasioned by those printers more industrious than himself who make a practice of pirating every work attended with success as an instance of this kind of oppression he mentions the true born englishman by which had he enjoyed the full profit of his own labors he must have gained near a thousand pounds for besides nine editions which passed under his own inspection this poem was twelve times pirated but the insolence of those fraudulent dealers did not stop here a printer of a bad reputation collected a spurious and erroneous copy of several pieces of de foe and entitled them the works of the author of the true born englishman and though he was then embroiled with the government for one of the pamphlets which this collection contained yet had this man the impudence to print amongst them the same pamphlets presuming so far upon the partiality of the public resentment that he should pass with impunity for publishing that very thing for which the author was to be prosecuted with the utmost severity this however was an irresistible testimony that the resentment shown to the author was on some other and less justifiable account than the publication of that book so was it a severe satire on the unwariness of the ministry who had not eyes to discern their justice plainly exposed and their general proceedings bantered by a printer for publishing in defiance of them that same book for which another man stood arraigned  mr de foe who possessed a resolute temper and a most confirmed fortitude of mind was never awed by the threats of power nor deterred from speaking truth by the insolence of the great wherever he found vice he lashed it and frequently as pope says he dashed the proud gamster from his gilded car barred the mean breast that lurked beneath a star   for some vigorous attacks against the measures of a prevailing party which mr de foe reckoned unconstitutional and unjust he was prosecuted and received sentence to stand on the pillory which punishment he underwent  at the very time he was in the hands of the ministry to show the invincible force of his mind he wrote a hymn to the pillory as a kind of defiance of their power the reader says he see preface to vol ii is desired to observe this poem was the authors declaration even when in the cruel hands of a merciless as well as unjust ministry that the treatment he had from them was unjust exorbitant and consequently illegal as the ministry did not think proper to prosecute him for this fresh insult against them that forbearance was construed a confession of guilt in their former proceedings  in the second volume of our authors works is a piece entitled more reformation a satire upon himself we have already taken notice of a satire of his called reformation of manners in which some personal characters are stigmatized which drew much odium on mr de foe this satire called more reformation is a kind of supplement to the former in the preface he complains of the severe usage he had met with but says he that the world may discern that i am not one of those who practice what they reprove i began this satire with owning in myself those sins and misfortunes which i am no more exempted from than other men and as i am far from pretending to be free from human frailties but forwarder to confess any of the errors of my life than any man can be to accuse me i think myself in a better way to reformation than those who excuse their own faults by reckoning up mine some that have heard me complain of this hard usage have told me there is something of a retaliation of providence in it for my being so very free with the characters of other men in a late satire called the reformation of manners to this i answer first in that satire or any other i ever wrote i have always carefully avoided lashing any mans private infirmities as being too sensible of my own but if i have singled out any man by character it has either been such as intending to reform others and execute the laws against vice have been the greatest examples and encouragers of it in their own practice or such as have been entrusted with the executive power of justice and having been called upon by the laws to reform us have been a public reproach to the magistracy of this nation and ought to be punished by the laws they have been protected by  secondly i have never made any mans disasters or misfortunes the subject of my satire i never reproached any man for having his house burnt ships cast away or his family ruined i never lampooned a man because he could not pay his debts or for his being a cuckold  thirdly i never reproached any man for his opinion in religion or esteemed him the worse for differing in judgment from me  if therefore the scandalous treatment i have received is just on me for abusing others i must ask such who is the man where is the character i have given that is not just and where is the retaliation of providence that these men entitle themselves to in loading me with falsities and lies as a just punishment for my speaking truth  but p  x on him said a certain sober gentleman he is a whig and what need he have meddled with his own party could not he have left them out there were characters enough on the other side  why really i must own i know no whig or tory in vice the vicious and the virtuous are the only two parties i have to do with if a vicious lewd debauched magistrate happened to be a whig what then let him mend his manners and he may be a whig still and if not the rest ought to be ashamed of him    we have been induced to make this extract as it seems to show the genius and spirit of the author in a more advantageous light than we could have otherwise done though he was a resolute asserter of whig principles and a champion for the cause of liberty yet was he never blinded by party prejudice but could discern designing and selfish men and strip them of their disguises though joined with him in the same political contests  in the conclusion of the hymn to the pillory which is written with great strength of expression he assigns the reasons for his being doomed to that ignominy thou bugbear of the law stand up and speak thy long misconstrud silence break tell us who it is upon thy ridge stands there so full of fault and yet so void of fear and from the paper in his hat let all mankind be told for what tell them it was because he was too bold and told those truths which should not have been told extol the justice of the land who punish what they will not understand tell them that he stands there for speaking what we would not hear and yet he might have been secure had he said less or would he have said more tell them that it was his reward and worse is yet for him prepared because his foolish virtue was so nice as not to fell his friends according to his friends advice and thus he is an example made to make men of their honesty afraid that from the time to come they may more willingly their friends betray tell them the ministers that placed him here are scandal to the times are at a loss to find his guilt and cannot commit his crimes   there are in the same volume many other poetical pieces and political and polemical tracts the greatest part of which are written with great force of thought though in an unpolished irregular style the natural abilities of the author for he was no scholar seem to have been very high he had a great knowledge of men and things particularly what related to the government and trade of these kingdoms he wrote many pamphlets on both which were generally well received though his name was never prefixed his imagination was fertile strong and lively as may be collected from his many works of fancy particularly his robinson crusoe which was written in so natural a manner and with so many probable incidents that for some time after its publication it was judged by most people to be a true story it was indeed written upon a model entirely new and the success and esteem it met with may be ascertained by the many editions it has sold and the sums of money which have been gained by it nor was he less remarkable in his writings of a serious and religious turn witness his religious courtship and his family instructor both of which strongly inculcate the worship of god the relative duties of husbands wives parents and children not in a dry dogmatic manner but in a kind of dramatic way which excites curiosity keeps the attention awake and is extremely interesting and pathetic  we have already seen that in his political capacity he was a declared enemy to popery and a bold defender of revolution principles he was held in much esteem by many great men and though he never enjoyed any regular post under the government yet he was frequently employed in matters of trust and confidence particularly in scotland where he several times was sent on affairs of great importance especially those relative to the union of the kingdoms of which he was one of the negotiators  it is impossible to arrive at the knowledge of half the tracts and pamphlets which were written by this laborious man as his name is not prefixed and many of them being temporary have perished like all other productions of that kind when the subjects upon which they were written are forgot his principal performances perhaps are these a plan of commerce an esteemed work in one large vol  vo of which a new edition was lately published memoirs of the plague published in      religious courtship family instructor two volumes history of apparitions under the name of moreton robinson crusoe two volumes political history of the devil history of magic caledonia a poem in praise of scotland de jure divino a poem english tradesman etc history of colonel jack clevelands memoirs etc are also said to be his   considered as a poet daniel de foe is not so eminent as in a political light he has taken no pains in versification his ideas are masculine his expressions coarse and his numbers generally rough he seems rather to have studied to speak truth by probing wounds to the bottom than by embellishing his versification to give it a more elegant keenness this however seems to have proceeded more from carelessness in that particular than want of ability for the following lines in his true born englishman in which he makes britannia rehearse the praises of her hero king william are harmoniously beautiful and elegantly polished britannia the fame of virtue it is for which i sound and heroes with immortal triumphs crowned fame built on solid virtue swifter flies than morning light can spread my eastern skies the gathering air returns the doubling sound and long repeating thunders force it round echoes return from caverns of the deep old chaos dreamt on it in eternal sleep time helps it forward to its latest urn from whence it never never shall return nothing is heard so far or lasts so long it is heard by every ear and spoke by every tongue my hero with the sails of honor furled rises like the great genius of the world by fate and fame wisely prepared to be the soul of war and life of victory he spreads the wings of virtue on the throne and every wind of glory fans them on immortal trophies dwell upon his brow fresh as the garlands he has won but now   what provocation de foe had given to pope we cannot determine but he has not escaped the lash of that gentlemans pen mr pope in his second book of his duciad thus speaks of him earless on high stood unabashd de foe and tutchin flagrant from the scourge below   it may be remarked that he has joined him with tutchin a man whom judge jeffries had ordered to be so inhumanly whipped through the market towns that as we have already observed he petitioned the king to be hanged this severity soured his temper and after the deposition and death of king james he indulged his resentment in insulting his memory this may be the reason why pope has stigmatized him and perhaps no better a one can be given for his attacking de foe whom the author of the notes to the dunciad owns to have been a man of parts de foe can never with any propriety be ranked amongst the dunces for whoever reads his works with candor and impartiality must be convinced that he was a man of the strongest natural powers a lively imagination and solid judgment which joined with an unshaken probity in his moral conduct and an invincible integrity in his political sphere ought not only to screen him from the petulant attacks of satire but transmit his name with some degree of applause to posterity  de foe who enjoyed always a competence and was seldom subject to the necessities of the poets died at his house at islington in the year      he left behind him one son and one daughter the latter is married to mr henry baker a gentleman well known in the philosophical world  mrs elizabeth row this lady was born at ilchester in somerfetshire september         being the eldest of three daughters of mr walter singer a gentleman of good family and mrs elizabeth portnel both persons of great worth and piety her father was not a native of ilchester nor an inhabitant before his imprisonment there for nonconformity in the reign of king charles ii mrs portnel from a principle of tenderness visited those who suffered on that account and by this accident an acquaintance commenced which terminated in the nuptial union they who were acquainted with the lady who is the subject of this article in her early years perhaps observed an uncommon display of genius as prophetic of that bright day which afterward ensued  there is so great a similitude between painting and poetry that it is no ways surprising a person who possessed the latter of these graces in so high a degree should very easily discover an inclination to the former which has often the same admirers accordingly we find mrs row discover a taste for painting she attempted to carry her taste into execution when she had hardly steadiness of hand sufficient to guide the pencil her father perceiving her sondness for this art was at the expense of a master to instruct her in it and she never failed to make it an amusement till her death every one acquainted with her writings and capable of relishing the melifluent flow of her numbers will naturally suppose that she had a genius for music particularly that of a grave and solemn kind as it was best suited to the grandeur of her sentiments and the sublimity of her devotion but her most prevailing propension was to poetry this superior grace was indeed the most favorite employment of her youth and in her the most distinguished excellence so powerful was her genius in this way that her prose has all the charms of verse without the fetters the same fire and elevation the same richness of imagery bold figures and flowing diction  it appears by a life of mrs row prefixed to the first volume of her miscellaneous works that in the year      the   d of her age a collection of her poems on various occasions was published at the desire of two of her friends which we suppose did not contain all she had by her since the ingenious author of the preface mrs elizabeth johnson gives the reader room to hope that mrs row might in a little while be prevailed upon to oblige the world with a second part no way inferior to the former  mrs rowes paraphrase on the   th chapter of job was written at the request of bishop kenn which gained her a great reputation she had no other tutor for the french and italian languages than the honorable mr thynne son to the lord viscount weymouth and father to the right honorable the countess of hertford who willing ly took the task upon himself and had the pleasure to see his fair scholar improve so fast by his lessons that in a few months she was able to read tassos jerusalem with ease her shining merit with the charms of her person and conversation had procured her many admirers among others the celebrated mr prior made his addresses to her so that allowing for the double license of the poet and the lover the concluding lines in his answer to mrs singers pastoral on love and friendship were not without foundation in truth but mr thomas row a very ingenious and learned gentleman was the person destined to fill the arms of this amiable poetess  as this gentleman was a poet of no inconsiderable rank a man of learning and genius we shall here give some account of him in place of assigning him a particular article as the incidents of his life will be more naturally blended with that of his wife  he was born at london april the   th      the eldest son of the revd mr row who with a very accurate judgment and a considerable stock of useful learning joined the talents in preaching and a most lively and engaging manner in conversation he was of a genteel descent both on his fathers and mothers side but he thought too justly to value himself on such extrinsic circumstances his superior genius and insatiable thirst after knowledge were conspicuous in his earliest years he commenced his acquaintance with the classics at epsom while his father resided there and by the swift advances in this part of learning quickly became the delight of his master who treated him with very particular indulgence in spite of the natural ruggedness and severity of his temper  when his father removed to london he accompanied him and was placed under the famous dr walker master of the charterhouseschool his exercises here never failed of being distinguished even among those who had the approbation of that excellent master who would fain have persuaded his father to place him at one of our english universities but how honorably soever mr row might think of the learning of those noble seats of the muses yet not having the same advantageous notions of their political principles he chose to enter him in a private academy in london and some time before his death sent him to leyden here he studied jeuriels antiquities civil law the belles lettres and experimental philosophy and established a reputation for capacity application and an obliging deportment both among the professors and students he returned from that celebrated seat of literature with a great accession of knowledge entirely incorrupt in his morals which he had preserved as inviolate as he could have done under the most vigilant eye though left without any restraints but those of his own virtue and prudence  the love of liberty had always been one of mr rowes darling passions he was very much confirmed therein by his familiar acquaintance with the history and noble authors of greece and rome whose very spirit was tranferred into him by residing so long at a republic he had continual examples of the inestimable value of freedom as the parent of industry and the universal source of social happiness tyranny of every kind he sincerely detested but most of all ecclesiastical tyranny deeming the slavery of the mind the most abject and ignominious and in its consequences more pernicious than any other  he was a perfect master of the greek latin and french languages and which is seldom known to happen had at once such a prodigious memory and unexhaustible fund of wit as would have singly been admired and much more united these qualities with an easy fluency of speech a frankness and benevolence of disposition and a communicative temper made his company much solicited by all who knew him he animated the conversation and instructed his companions by the acuteness of his observations  he had formed a design to compile the lives of all the illustrious persons of antiquity omitted by plutarch and for this purpose read the ancient historians with great care this design he in part executed eight lives were published since his decease in octavo by way of supplement to that admired biographer in which though so young a guide he strikes out a way like one well acquainted with the dark and intricate paths of antiunity the style is perfectly easy yet concise and nervous the reflections just and such as might be expected from a lover of truth and of mankind  besides these lives he had finished for the press the life of thrasybulus which being put into the hands of sir richard steel for his revisal was unhappily lost and could never since be recovered  the famous mr dacier having translated plutarchs lives into french with remarks historical and critical the abbe bellenger added in      a ninth tome to the other eight consisting of the life of hannibal and mr rowes lives made french by that learned abbe in the preface to which version he transcribes from the preface to the english edition the character of the author with visible approbation and observes that the lives were written with taste though being a posthumous work the author had not put his last hand to it  such is the character of mr row the husband of this amiable lady and when so accomplished a pair meet in conjugal bonds what great expectations may not be formed upon them a friend of mr rowes upon that occasion wrote the following beautiful epigram no more proud gallia bid the world revere thy learned pair le fevre and dacier britain may boast this happy day unites two nobler minds in hymens sacred rites what these have sung while all the inspiring nine exalt the beauties of the verse divine those humble critics of the immortal strain shall bound their fame to comment and explain   mr row being at bath in the year   0  was introduced into the company of miss singer wholived in a retirement not far from the city the idea he had conceived of her from report and her writings charmed him but when he had seen and conversed with her he felt another kind of impression and the esteem of her accomplishments was heightened into the rapture of a lover during the courtship he wrote a poetical epistle to a friend who was a neighbor of mrs singer and acquainted with the family in which were the following lines youths liveliest bloom a neverfading grace and more than beauty sparkles in her face how soon the willing heart her empire feels each look each air each melting action kills yet the bright form creates no loose desires at once she gives and purifies our fines and passions chaste as her own soul inspires her soul heavens noblest workmanship designed to bless the ruined age and succor lost mankind to prop abandoned virtues sinking cause and snatch from vice its undeserved applause   he married her in the year    0 and mrs rowes exalted merit and amiable qualities could not fail to inspire the most generous and lasting passion mr row knew how to value that treasure of wit softness and virtue with which heaven had blessed him and made it his study to repay the felicity with which she crowned his life the esteem and tenderness he had for her is inexpressible and possession seems never to have abated the fondness and admiration of the lover a circumstance which seldom happens but to those who are capable of enjoying mental intercourse and have a relish for the ideal transports as well as those of a less elevated nature it was some considerable time after his marriage that he wrote to her a very tender ode under the name of delia full of the warmest sentiments of connubial friendship and affection the following lines in it may appear remarkable as it pleased heaven to dispose events in a manner so agreeable to the wishes expressed in them  so long may thy inspiring page and bright example bless the rising age long in thy charming prison may thou stay late very late ascend the wellknown way and add new glories to the realms of day at least heaven will not sure this prayer deny short be my lifes uncertain date and earlier long than thine the destined hour of fate when ever it comes may thou be by support my sinking frame and teach me how to die banish desponding natures gloom make me to hope a gentle doom and fix me all on joys to come with swimming eyes i will gaze upon thy charms and clasp thee dying in my fainting arms then gently leaning on thy breast sink in soft slumbers to eternal rest the ghastly form shall have a pleasing air and all things smile while heaven and thou art there   this part of the ode which we have quoted contains the most tender breathings of affection and has as much delicacy and softness in it as we remember ever to have seen in poetry  as mr row had not a robust constitution so an intense application to study beyond what the delicacy of his frame could bear might contribute to that ill state of health which allayed the happiness of his married line during the greater part of it in the latter end of the year      hin weakness increased and he seemed to labor under all the symptoms of a consumption which distemper after it had confined him some months put a period to his most valuable life at hampstead in      when he was but in the   th year of his age the exquisite grief and afnliction which his amiable wife selt for the loss of so excellent a husband is not to be expressed  she wrote a beautiful elegy on his death and continued to the last moments of her life to express the highest veneration and affection for his memory and a particular regard and esteem for his relations this elegy of mrs row on the death of her much lamented husband we shall here insert an elegy etc in what soft language shall my thoughts get free my dear alexis when i talk of thee ye muses graces all ye gentle train of weeping loves o suit the pensive strain but why should i implore your moving art it is but to speak the dictates of my heart and all that knew the charming youth will join their friendly sighs and pious tears to mine for all that knew his merit must confess in grief for him there can be no excess his soul was formed to act each glorious part of life unstained with vanity or art no thought within his generous mind had birth but what he might have owned to heaven and earth practiced by him each virtue grew more bright and shone with more than its own native light whatever noble warmth could recommend the just the active and the constant friend was all his own  but oh a dearer name and softer ties my endless sorrow claim lost in despair distracted and forlorn the lover i and tender husband mourn whatever to such superior worth was due whatever excess the fondest passion knew i felt for thee dear youth my joy my care my prayers themselves were thine and only where thou wast concerned my virtue was sincere when ever i begged for blessings on thy head nothing was cold or formal that i said my warmest vows to heaven were made for thee and love still mingled with my piety o thou wast all my glory all my pride through lifes uncertain paths my constant guide regardless of the world to gain thy praise was all that could my just ambition raise why has my heart this fond engagement known or why has heaven dissolved the tie so soon why was the charming youth so formed to move or why was all my soul so turned for love but virtue here a vain defense had made where so much worth and eloquence could plead for he could talk  twas extacy to hear twas joy twas harmony to every ear eternal music dwelt upon his tongue soft and transporting as the muses song listening to him my cares were charmed to rest and love and silent rapture filled my breast unheeded the gay moments took their flight and time was only measured by delight i hear the loved the melting accents still and still the kind the tender transport feel again i see the sprightly passions rise and life and pleasure sparkle in his eyes my fancy paints him now with every grace but ah the dear delusion mocks my fond embrace the smiling vision takes its hasty flight and scenes of horror swim before my sight grief and despair in all their terrors rise a dying lover pale and gasping lies each dismal circumstance appears in view the fatal object is for ever new              for thee all thoughts of pleasure i forego for thee my tears shall never cease to flow for thee at once i from the world retire to feed in silent shades a hopeless fire my bosom all thy image shall retain the full impression there shall still remain as thou have taught my constant heart to prove the noblest height and elegance of love that sacred passion i to thee confine my spotless faith shall be for ever thine   after mr rowes decease and as soon as her affairs would permit our authoress indulged her inconquerable inclination to solitude by retiring to froome in somersetshire in the neighborhood of which place the greatest part of her estate lay when she forsook the town she determined to return no more but to spend the remainder of her life in absolute retirement yet upon some few occasions she thought it her duty to violate this resolution  in compliance with the importunate request of the honorable mrs thynne she passed some months with her at london after the death of her daughter the lady brook and upon the decease of mrs thynne herself she could not dispute the commands of the countess of hertford who earnestly desired her company to soften the severe affliction of the loss of so excellent a mother and once or twice more the power which this lady had over mrs row drew her with an obliging kind of violence to spend a few months with her in the country yet even on these occasions she never quitted her retreat without sincere regret and always returned to it as soon as she could with decency disengage herself from the importunity of her noble friends it was in this recess that she composed the most celebrated of her works in twenty letters from the dead to the living the design of which is to impress the notion of the souls immortality without which all virtue and religion with their temporal and eternal good consequences must fall to the ground  some who pretend to have no scruples about the being of a god have yet doubts about their own eternal existence though many authors have established it both by christian and moral proofs beyond reasonable contradiction but since no means should be left untried in a point of such awful importance a virtuous endeavor to make the mind familiar with the thoughts of immortality and contract as it were unawares an habitual persuasion of it by writings built on that foundation and addressed to the affections and imagination cannot be thought improper either as a doctrine or amusement amusement for which the world makes so large a demand and which generally speaking is nothing but an art of forgetting that immortality the form belief and advantageous contemplation of which this higher amusement would recommend  in the year      the importunity of some of mrs rowes acquaintance who had seen the history of joseph in ms prevailed on her to print it the publication of this piece did not long precede the time of her death to prepare for which had been the great business of her life and it stole upon her according to her earnest wishes in her beloved recess she was favored with a very uncommon strength of constitution and had passed a long series of years with scarce any indisposition severe enough to confine her to bed  but about half a year before her decease she was attacked with a distemper which seemed to herself as well as others attended with danger though this disorder found her mind not quite so serene and prepared to meet death as usual yet when by devout contemplation she had fortified herself against that fear and diffidence from which the most exalted piety does not always secure us in such an awful hour she experienced such divine satisfaction and transport that she said with tears of joy she knew not that she ever felt the like in all her life and she repeated on this occasion popes beautiful soliloquy of the dying christian to his soul the dying christian to his soul i vital spark of heavenly flame quit oh quit this mortal frame trembling hoping lingring flying oh the pain the bliss of dying cease fond nature cease thy strife and let me languish into life ii hark they whisper angels say sister spirit come away what is this absorbs me quite steals my senses shuts my sight drowns my spirits draws my breath tell me my soul can this be death iii the world recedes it disappears heaven opens on my eyes my ears with founds seraphic ring lend lend your wings i mount i fly o grave where is thy victory o death where is thy sting   she repeated the above with an air of intense pleasure she felt all the elevated sentiments of pious ecstasy and triumph which breath in that exquisite piece of sacred poetry after this threatening illness she recovered her usual good state of health and though at the time of her decease she was pretty far advanced in years yet her exact temperance and the calmness of her mind undisturbed with uneasy cares and turbulent passions encouraged her friends to hope a much longer enjoyment of so valuable a life than it pleased heaven to allow them on the day when she was seized with that distemper which in a few hours proved mortal she seemed to those about her to be in perfect health and vigor in the evening about eight oclock she conversed with a friend with her usual vivacity mixed with an extraordinary cheerfulness and then retired to her chamber about  0 her servant hearing some noise in her mistress room ran instantly into it and found her fallen off the chair on the floor speechless and in the agonies of death she had the immediate assistance of a physician and surgeon but all the means used were without success and having given one groan she expired a few minutes before two oclock on sunday morning february the  0th       her disease was judged to be an apoplexy a pious book was found lying open by her as also some loose papers on which she had written the following devout ejaculations o guide and council and protect my soul from sin o speak and let me know thy heavenly will speak evidently to my listening soul o fill my soul with love and light of peace and whisper heavenly comfort to my soul o speak celestial spirit in the strain of love and heavenly pleasure to my soul   in her cabinet were found letters to several of her friends which she had ordered to be delivered to the persons to whom they were directed immediately after her decease  mrs row lived in friendship with people of the first fashion and distinction in life by whom she was esteemed and respected to enumerate them would be needless let it suffice to remark that her life was honored with the intimacy and her death lamented with the tears of the countess of hertford many verses were published to celebrate her memory amongst which a copy written by mrs elizabeth carter are the best  thus lived honored and died lamented this excellent poetess whose beauty though not her highest excellence yet greatly contributed to set off her other more important graces to advantage and whose piety will ever shine as a bright example to posterity and teach them how to heighten the natural gifts of understanding by true and unaffected devotion  the conduct and behavior of mrs row might put some of the present race of females to the blush who rake the town for infamous adventures to amuse the public their works will soon be forgotten and their memories when dead will not be deemed exceeding precious but the works of mrs row can never perish while exalted piety and genuine goodness have any existence in the world her memory will be ever honored and her name dear to latest posterity  mrs rowes miscellaneous works were published a few years ago at london in octavo and her devotions were revised and published by the reverend dr watts under the title of devout exercises to which that worthy man wrote a preface and while he removes some cavils that wantonness and sensuality might make to the style and manner of these devotions he shows that they contain the most sublime sentiments the most refined breathings of the soul and the most elevated and celestial piety  mrs rowes acquaintance with persons of fashion had taught her all the accomplishments of goodbreeding and elegance of behavior and without formality or affectation she practiced in the most distant solitude all the address and politeness of a court  she had the happiest command over her passions and maintained a constant calmness of temper and sweetness of disposition that could not be ruffled by adverse accidents  she was in the utmost degree an enemy to illnatured satire and detraction she was as much unacquainted with envy as if it had been impossible for so base a passion to enter into the human mind  she had few equals in conversation her wit was lively and she expressed her thoughts in the most beautiful and flowing eloquence  when she entered into the married state the highest esteem and most tender affection appeared in her conduct to mr row and by the most gentle and obliging manner and the exercise of every social and good natured virtue she confirmed the empire she had gained over his heart in short if the most cultivated understanding if an imagination lively and extensive a character perfectly moral and a soul formed for the most exalted exercises of devotion can render a person amiable mrs row has a just claim to that epithet as well as to the admiration of the lovers of poetry and elegant composition  the revd dr thomas yalden this gentleman was born in the city of exeter and the youngest of six sons of mr john yalden of sussex he received his education at a grammar school belonging to magdalencollege in oxford jacob in the year    0 he was admitted a commoner of magdalenhall under mr john pullen who was esteemed an excellent tutor and a very great master of logic and the following year he was chosen scholar of magdalencollege here he became a fellowpupil with the celebrated mr addison and dr henry sacheverel and early contracted a particular friendship with those two gentlemen this academical affection mr addison preserved not only abroad in his travels but also on his advancement to considerable employments at home and kept the same easy and free correspondence to the very last as when their fortunes were more on a level this preservation of affection is rendered more singular by mr yaldens having espoused a very opposite interest to that of mr addison for he adhered to the highchurch party and was suspected of an attachment to an exiled family for which he afterward was brought into very great trouble  in the year   00 he was admitted actual and perpetual fellow of magdalencollege and qualified himself the next year by taking orders as the founders statutes require after his admission he received two public marks of favor from that society the first was a presentation to a living in warwickshire consistent with his fellowship and the other his being elected moral philosophyreader an office for life endowed with a handsome stipend and peculiar privileges  in   0  he was received into the family of his noble and kind patron the duke of beaufort with whom he was in very great favor having in many instances experienced his bounty and generosity in the following year he completed his academical degrees by commencing doctor in divinity he presented to the society their founders picture in full length which now hangs up in the publichall and afterward he delivered in to the president a voluntary resignation of his fellowship and moral philosophylecture he was afterward preferred to be rector of chalten in cleanville two adjoining towns and rectories in hampshire he was elected by the president and governors of bridewell preacher of that hospital upon the resignation of dr atterbury afterward lord bishop of rochester  having mentioned this prelate it will be proper here to observe that upon a suspicion of dr yaldens being concerned with him in a plot to restore the exiled family and for which the bishop was afterward banished he was seized upon by authority and committed to prison when he was examined before the council concerning hin correspondence and intimacy with mr kelley the bishops secretary he did not deny his knowledge of and correspondence with him but still persisted in asserting that no measures contrary to the constitution were ever canvassed between them  there was found in his pocket book a copy of verses reflecting on the reigning family and which might well bear the construction of a libel but when he was charged with them he denied that he ever composed such verses or that the handwriting was his own and asserted his innocence in every circumstance relating to the plot the verses in all probability were put into his pocketbook by the same person who with so much dexterity placed a treasonable paper in bishop atterburys closestool and then pretending to be the discoverer of it preferred it against his lordship as an evidence of hn disaffection the particulars of that memorable trial are recorded in the life of atterbury written by the authors of biographia britannica  the heats raised by atterburys trial subsiding those who were suspected of being concerned with him as no evidence appeared strong enough to convict them were released  dr yalden was still favored with the patronage of the generous duke of beaufort and his residence in that noble family recommended him to the acquaintance of many of the first quality and character in the kingdom and as he was of a cheerful temper and of a pleasing and instructive conversation he retained their friendship and esteem till his death which happened the   th of july      in the   th year of his age  his poetical works are chiefly these on the conquest of namure a pindaric ode inscribed to his most sacred and victorious majesty folio      the temple of fame a poem to the memory of the most illustrious prince william duke of gloucester folio   00 on the late queens accession to the throne a poem aesop at court or state fables an essay on the character on sir willoughby ashton a poem fol   0  on the mines of sir carbery price a poem occasioned by the mineadventure company on the death of mr john partridge professor in leather and astrologer advice to a lover to mr watson on his ephemeris on the caelestial motions presented to queen anne against immoderate grief the force of jealousy an ode for st cecilias day      set to rhusic by dr purcel a hymn to the morning in praise of light   we shall extract the following stanza from this hymn as a specimen of his poetry parent of day whose beauteous beams of light spring from the darksome womb of night and midst their native horrors show like gems adorning of the negros brow not heavens fair bow can equal thee in all its gaudy drapery thou first essay of light and pledge of day rival of shade eternal spring still gay from thy bright unexhausted womb the beauteous race of days and seasons come thy beauty ages cannot wrong but spite of time you are ever young thou art alone heavens modest virgin light whose face a veil of blushes hide from humansight at thy approach nature erects her head the smiling universe is glad the drowsy earth and seas awake and from thy beams new life and vigor take when thy more cheerful rays appear even guilt and women cease to fear horror despair and all the sons of night retire before thy beams and take their hasty flight thou risest in the fragrant east like the fair phoenix from her balmy nest but yet thy fading glories soon decay thines but a momentary stay too soon you are ravished from our sight borne down the stream of day and overwhelmed with night thy beams to thy own ruin haste they are framed too exquisite to last thine is a glorious but a shortlived state pity so fair a birth should yield so soon to fate   besides these pieces this reverend gentleman has translated the second book of ovids art of love with several other occasional poems and translations published in the third and fourth volumes of tonsons miscellanies  the medicine a tale in the second volume of the tatlers and mr partridges appeal to the learned world or a further account of the manner of his death in prose are likewise written by him  mr joseph mitchel this gentleman was the son of a stonecutter in scotland and was born about the year      he received an university education while he remained in that kingdom and having some views of improving his fortune repaired to the metropolis we are not able to recover many particulars concerning this poet who was never sufficiently eminent to excite much curiosity concerning him by a dissipated imprudent behavior he rendered those who were more intimately acquainted with him less sollicitous to preserve the circumstances of his life which were so little to his advantage we find him enjoying the favor of the earl of stair and sir robert walpole to whom he addresses some of his poems he received so many obligations from the latter and was so warm in his interest that he obtained the epithet of sir robert walpoles poet and for a great part of his life had an entire dependence on the bounty of that munificent statesman mr mitchel who was a slave to his pleasures and governed by every gust of irregular appetite had many opportunities of experiencing the dangerous folly of extravagance and the many uneasy moments which it occasions notwithstanding this his conduct was never corrected even when the means of doing it were in his power at a time when mr mitchel labored under severe necessities by the death of his wifes uncle several thousand pounds devolved to him of which he had no sooner got possession than he planned schemes of spending it in place of discharging the many debts he had contracted this behavior as it conveyed to his creditors no high idea of his honesty so it obliged him to be perpetually skulking and must consequently have embittered even those hours which he falsely dedidicated to pleasure for they who live under a perpetual dread of losing their liberty can enjoy no great comfort even in their most careless moments  of the many poems which mr mitchel wrote but few succeeded to any degree nor indeed much deserved it at a time when the politicians were engaged in settling the land tax and various opinions were offered concerning the ability of that branch of the commonwealth so that a proper medium or standard might be fixed he versified the totness address much about the time of his present majestys accession to the throne in which it is humourously proposed that the landed interest should pay twenty shillings in the pound this poem having a reference to a fashionable topic of conversation was better received than most of his other pieces  there was likewise a poem of mr mitchels called the shoeheel which was much read on account of the low humor it contains he has addressed to dr watts a poem on the subject of jonah in the whales belly in the dedication he observes that it was written for the advancement of true virtue and reformation of manners to raise an emulation amongst our young poets to attempt divine composures and help to wipe off the censures which the numerous labors of the muses are justly charged with if says he it shall serve any of these purposes i shall be satisfied though i gain no reputation by it among those who read a new poem with no other view than to pass a judgment on the abilities of the author when the antagonists of pope were threatened with the publication of the dunciad mr mitchel had some suspicion that he himself was to be stigmatized in it conscious that he had never offended mr pope he took an opportunity to write to him upon that subject he informed him that he had been an admirer of his writings that he declined all connection with those men who combined to reduce his reputation and that when no offense was given no resentment should be discovered mr pope upon receiving this letter from mitchel protesting his innocence as to any calumny published against him was so equitable as to strike him out of his danciad in which by misrepresentation he had assigned him a place  mr mitchel lived in good correspondence with many of the most eminent wits of the time and was particularly honored with the friendship of aaron hill esquire a gentleman of so amiable a disposition that whnever cultivated an intimacy with him was sure to be a gainer once when mr mitchel was in distress mr hill who could not perhaps conveniently relieve him by pecuniary assistance gave him a higher instance of friendship than could be shown by money he wrote a beautiful dramatic piece in two acts called the fatal extravagant in which he exposed the hideous vice of gaming this little dramatic work is planned with such exquisite art wrought up with so much tenderness and the scenes are so natural interesting and moving that i know not if mr hill has any where touched the passions with so great a mastery this play met the success it deserved and contributed to relieve mr mitchels necessnties who had honor enough however to undeceive the world and acknowledge his obligations to mr hill by making mankind acquainted with the real author of he fatal extravagant as this was a favor never to be forgotten so we find mr mitchel taking every proper occasion to express his gratitude and celebrate his patron amongst the first of his poems is an ode addressed to mr hill which is one of the best of his compositions the two last stanzas are as follow heedless of custom and the vulgar breath i toil for glory in a path untrod or where but few have dared to combat death and few unstaggering carry virtues load thy muse o hill of living names my first respect and chief attendance claims sublimely fired thou look disdainful down on trifling subjects and a vile renown in every verse in every thought of thine there is heavenly rapture and design who can thy godlike gideon view an epic poem by aaron hill esquire  and not thy muse pursue or wish at least such miracles to do sure in thy breast the ancient hebrew fire revived glows hot and blazes forth how strong how fierce the flames aspire of thy interior worth when burning worlds thou settst before our eyes see the judgment a poem by aaron hill esquire  and drawst tremendous judgment from the skies o bear me on thy seraph wing and teach my weak obsequious muse to sing to thee i owe the little art i boast thy heat first melted my cogenial frost preserve the sparks thy breath did fan and by thy likeness form me into true poetic man   mr mitchel died in the year      he seems to have been a poet of the third rate he has seldom reached the sublime his humor in which he more succeeded is not strong enough to last his versification holds a state of mediocrity he possessed but little invention and if he was not a bad rhimester he cannot be denominated a fine poet for there are but few marks of genius in his writings his poems were printed in two vol  vo in the year       he wrote also the union of the clans or the highlandfair a scots opera twas acted at the theater royal in drury lane about the year    0 but did not succeed  mr john ozell this gentleman added considerably to the republic of letters by his numerous translations he received the rudiments of his education from mr shaw an excellent grammarian master of the free school at ashby de la zouch in leicestershire he finished his grammatical learning under the revd mr mountford of christs hospital where having attained the latin greek and hebrew tongues he was designed to be sent to the university of cambridge to be trained up for holy orders but mr ozell who was averse to that confinement which he must expect in a college life chose to be sooner settled in the world and be placed in a public office of accounts having previously qualified himself by attaining a knowledge of arithmetic and writing the necessary hands this choice of an occupation in our author could no other reasons be adduced are sufficient to denominate him a little tinetured with dullness for no man of genius ever yet made choice of spending his life behind a desk in a comptinghouse  he still retained however an inclination to erudition contrary to what might have been expected and by much conversation with travelers from abroad made himself master of most of the living languages especially the french italian and spanish from all which as well as from the latin and greek he has favored the world with a great jacob many translations amongst which are the following french plays   britannicus and alexander the great two tragedies from racine   the litigant a comedy of   acts translated from the french of m racine who took it from the wasps of aristophanes  vo      scene in a city of lower nornandy   manlius capitolinus a tragedy from the french of m la fosse      when the earl of portland was ambassador at the french court this play was acted at paris threescore nights running the subject is related by livy this french author studied some time at oxford and upon his return home applied himself to dramatic poetry in which he acquired great reputation he died about the year        the cid a tragedy from corneille   cato of utica a tragedy from m des champs acted at the theater in lincolnsinnfields      dedicated to count volkra his excellency the imperial ambassador to which is added a parallel between this play and mr addisons cato   besides these mr ozell has translated all molieres plays which are printed in   vol   mo and likewise a collection of some of the best spanish and italian plays from calderon aretin ricci and lopez de vega whether any of these plays translated from the spanish were ever printed we cannot be positive mr ozells translation of moliere is far from being excellent for moliere was an author to whom none but a genius like himself could well do justice  his other works are the history of don quixote translated by several hands published by peter motteux revised and compared with the best edition printed at madrid by mr ozell  th edition      reflections on learning by m de fenelon archbishop of cambray made english from the paris edition   mo      common prayer not common sense in several places of the portugueze spanish italian french latin and greek translations of the english liturgy being a specimen of the manifold omissions etc in all or most of the said translations some of which were printed at oxford and the rest at cambridge or london      vertots revolutions of rome translated by mr ozell logic or the art of thinking from the french of m nicole        mr ozell finished a translation from the portugueze begun by dr geddes of the most celebrated popish ecclesiastical romance being the the life of veronica of milan a book certified by the heads of the university of conimbra in portugal to be revised by the angels and approved of by god  these are the works of mr ozell who if he did not possess any genius has not yet lived in vain for he has rendered into english some very useful pieces and if his translations are not elegant they are generally pretty just and true to their original  mr ozell is severely touched by mr pope in the first book of the dunciad on what account we cannot determine perhaps that satyrist has only introduced him to grace the train of his dunces ozell was incensed to the last degree by this usage and in a paper called the weekly medley september      he published the following strange advertisement notes on the dunciad as to my learning this envious wretchknew and every body knows that the whole bench of bishops not long ago were pleased to give me a purse of guineas for discovering the erroneous translations of the common prayer in portugueze spanish french italian etc as for my genius let mr cleland show better verses in all popes works than ozells version of boileaus lutrin which the late lord hallifax was so well pleased with that he complimented him with leave to dedicate it to him etc etc let him show better and truer poetry in the rape of the lock than in ozells rape of the bucket which because an ingenious author happened to mention in the same breath with popes viz  let ozell sing the bucket pope the lockthe little gentleman had like to have run mad and mr toland and mr gildon publicly declared ozells translation of homer to be as it was prior so likewise superior to popes  surely surely every man is free to deserve well of his country john ozell  this author died about the middle of october      and was buried in a vault of a church belonging to st mary aldermanbury he never experienced any of the vicissitudes of fortune which have been so frequently the portion of his inspired brethren for a person born in the same county with him and who owed particular obligations to his family left him a competent provision besides he had always enjoyed good places he was for some years auditorgeneral of the city and bridge accounts and to the time of his decease auditor of the accounts of st pauls cathedral and st thomass hospital though in reality ozell was a man of very little genius yet mr coxeter asserts that his conversation was surprizingly pleasing and that he had a pretty good knowledge of men and things he possibly possessed a large share of good nature which when joined with but a tolerable understanding will render the person who is blessed with it more amiable than the most flashy wit and the highest genius without it  end of the fourth volume
