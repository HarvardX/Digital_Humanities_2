with burning gold the balmy cowslip gilds the smiling plain the virgin snowdrop boasts her silver hue an hundred tints the gaudy daisy stain and the meek violet in amiss blue creeps low to earth and

see all around the gallless doves culvers bill mean while the nightingales becalming lays mix with the plaintive music of the rill the which in various circles or windings gyres the meadow bathes bays behold the welkin bursts into a blaze fast by the car of light the nimble hours in songs of triumph hail his genial rays and as they go wend to thetis cooling bowers they bound along the sky and strew the heavens with flowers and now the human bosom melts to love the raptured bard awakes his skilful lyre by running streams or in the laurel grove he tunes to amorous notes his sounding wire all all is harmony and all desire the happy numbers charm the blooming maid her blushing cheeks pronounce her heart on fire she now consents then shuns the embowering shade with faint reluctance yields desirous yet afraid now rustic cuddy with untutored throat though much admired i ween of nymph and swain by various songs would various ends promote seeks he to prove that womans vows are vain he batemans fortune tells a baleful strain and if to honor britain he be led he sings a prentice bold in londs profane who all unarmed did strike two lions dead tore forth their savage hearts and did a

heart is ill at ease summer beneath yon knotty snubby oaks extended shade safe let me hide me from the eye of day nor shall the dog star this retreat invade as through the heavens he speeds his burning way the sultry lion rages for his prey ah phoebus quench thy wild destroying fire each flower each shrub does sink beneath thy ray save the fresh laurel that shall never expire the leaves that crown a bard may brave celestial ire or shall i hie to mine own hermitage round which the wanton vine her arms does wind there may i lonely turn the sacred page improve my reason and amend my mind here against lifes ills a remedy i find an hundred flowers emboss the verdant ground a little brook does my sweet cottage bind its waters yield a melancholy sound and sooth to study deep or lull to sleep profound the playful insect hopping in the grass does tire the hearer with his sonnet shrill the poolsprung gnat on sounding wing does pass and on the starting flyingout ramping steed does suck his sill ah me can little creatures work such ill the patient cow does to eschew the heat her body steep within the neighboring rill and while the lambs in fainter voices bleat their mothers hang the head in doleful plight i weet careless rechless of seasons see the lusty swains along the meadow spread the tawny hay the maidens too undaunted seek the plains ne fear to show their faces to the ray

phoebus self could profit by his art though all the nine the sacred lay inspired even should the maid vouchsafe to hear thy song no tender feelings will its sorrows raise for verse has mourned imagined woes so long she will hear unmoved and without pitying praise nor yet proud maid should thou refuse thine ear nor are the manners of the poet rude nor pours he not the sympathetic tear his heart by anguish not his own subdued when fairest names in long oblivion rot for fairest names must yield to wasting time the poets mistress escapes the common lot and blooms uninjurd in his living

of my heart was known for fame my ardour and my love of ease say will thou pardon that awhile i thought the thought how vain my feelings to disguise too well thou knewst by myras lessons taught the souls soft language and the voice of eyes thou knewst  perhaps ere to myself twas known  the impatient struggling of the sigh suppressed and early saw instructed by thy own the infant passion kindling

of my heart nor shall the jealous god with hand severe afflict his vassal though a rebel long already has he breathed the humble prayer and poured already the repentant song but ah in vain his art the poet tries the power of numbers he exerts in vain the maid regards them with unconscious eyes and hears but will not understand the strain yet has she seen  for nothing could conceal  the wild emotions of his laboring breast the fond attention that devoured her tale the hand that trembled when her hand it pressed while his pleased ear upon her accents hung often has she marked the involuntary sigh loves broken murmurs forming on his tongue and loves warm rapture starting to his eye and she has seen him whelmed in bitterest woe when her frown spoke some error unforgiven and she has seen each kindling feature glow when her smile cheered him with a gleam of heaven but when in verse he breathes his amorous care as if she knew not what to all is known his arts she praises but neglects his prayer nor deem the poet or the verse her own say then o say for sure thou know full well each tender thought with happiest skill to dress his hearts strong feelings how his tongue shall tell how speak  what language never can express teach him those arts that did thy suit commend when love first prompted myra to be kind and that those arts may prosper let thy friend his loves soft advocate in myra find then while the happy means thy lesson shows to win the maid his passion to approve then myra shall recount  for myra knows  what blessings are in store for those that love myra shall tell her that from love alone flows the pure spring of happiness sincere and love with power to lovers only known doubles each joy and lessens every care and each warm transport of her conscious heart and each fair hope that does her state attend with generous ardor myra shall impart and point her own example to her friend and if her sense shall damons claim approve and if her candor deem his vow sincere her tongue shall speak the interest of his love her gentle eloquence enforce his prayer and all that tenderest pity can suggest and each soft argument her thought can find myra shall urge  o be her pleading blessed  to win her fair companion to be kind and when  for friendship must not pass them over  she gives the frailties of his youth to fight o may her pencil place  he asks no more  each little merit in the fairest light clara perchance may learn to love an heart proud though the boast it is an honest pride where nothing selfish ever claimed a part which owns no purpose it should wish to hide warm with the love of virtue and mankind at others bliss where social feelings glow and where when sorrow wrings the worthy mind the tear is ready for anothers woe this praise the youth is fond to call his own no higher worth he seeks his claim to grace his hope he builds upon his love alone and his love stands on reasons solid base no sudden blaze the meteor of a day its transient splendour over his heart does pour kindled at virtues fire the steady ray shall shine through life and gild its latest hour if such an heart can please if such a flame with kindred ardour can inspire her breast his first ambition has obtained its aim  to heaven and fortune he commits the rest but if regardless of the honest prayer the maid unpitying on his love should frown if fates worst shock the youth is doomed to bear each prospect darkened and each hope overthrown too humbly fearful of the allruling power to strike the blow that sets the spirit free imprisoned in life he will wait the appointed hour and patient bend him to the hard decree yet never however shifts the varying scene shall her dear image from his mind depart still fresh the loved idea shall remain warm in each pulse and woven with his heart unchanged through life still anxious for her peace for her to heaven his daily prayer shall rise and when kind fate shall grant the wished release his last weak breath shall bless her as it flies then when in earths cold womb his limbs are laid for sure her servants fall shall reach her ear clara perchance will sigh and grant his shade the kind compassion of a pious tear yes  she will weep  for gentle is her breast  though his love pleased not she will mourn his doom and happily when with flowers his grave is dressed her hand may plant a myrtle over his tomb this meed at least his service may demand this  and it is all he asks  his truth may claim no breathing marble over his dust shall stand no storied urn shall celebrate his name enough for him that where his ashes lie when kindred spirits shall at times repair the prosperous youth shall cast a pitying eye the slighted virgin pour her sorrows there enough for him that pointing to his stone the sad old man his story shall relate then smite his breast and wish with many a groan no child of his may meet so hard a fate the recantation an ode by love too long deprived of rest fell tyrant of the human breast

night dead night and over the plain darkness extends her ebon ray while wide along the gloomy scene deep silence holds her solemn sway throughout the earth no cheerful beam the melancholic eye surveys save where the worms fantastic gleam the nighted traveller betrays the savage race so heaven decrees no longer through the forest rove all nature rests and not a breeze disturbs the stillness of the grove all nature rests in sleeps soft arms the village swain forgets his care sleep that the sting of sorrow charms and heals all sadness but despair despair alone her power denies and when the sun withdraws his rays to the wild beach distracted flies or cheerless through the desert strays or to the churchyards horrors led while fearful echoes burst around on some cold stone he leans his head or throws his body on the ground to some such drear and solemn scene some friendly power direct my way where pale misfortunes haggard train sad luxury delight to stray wrapped in the solitary gloom retired from lifes fantastic crew resigned i will wait my final doom and bid the busy world adieu the world has now no joys for me nor can life now one pleasure boast since all my eyes desired to see my wish my hope my all is lost since she so formed to please and bless so wise so innocent so fair whose converse sweet made sorrow less and brightened all the gloom of care since she is lost  ye

fairer deeds adorn his name what nobler merit can he boast what higher worth in him was found my true hearts service to outweigh a senseless fop  a dull compound of scarcely animated clay he dressed indeed he danced with ease and charmed her by repeating over unmeaning raptures in her praise that twenty fools had said before but i alas who thought all art my passions force would meanly prove could only boast an honest heart and claimed no merit but my love have i not sat  ye conscious hours be witness  while my stella sung from morn to eve with all my powers rapt in the enchantment of her tongue ye conscious hours that saw me stand entranced in wonder and surprise in silent rapture press her hand with passion bursting from my eyes have i not loved  o earth and heaven where now is all my youthful boast the dear exchange i hoped was given for slighted fame and fortune lost where now the joys that once were mine where all my hopes of future bliss must i those joys these hopes resign is all her friendship come to this must then each woman faithless prove and each fond lover be undone are vows no more  almighty love the sad remembrance let me shun it will not be  my honest heart the dear sad image still retains and spite of reason spite of art the dreadful memory remains ye powers divine whose wondrous skill deep in the womb of time can see behold i bend me to your will nor dare arraign your high decree let her be blessed with health with ease with all your bounty has in store let sorrow cloud my future days be stella blessed  i ask no more but lo where high in yonder east the star of morning mounts apace hence  let me fly the unwelcome guest and bid the muses labor cease elegy ii when young lifes journey i began the glittering prospect charmed my eyes i saw along the extended plan joy after joy successive rise and fame her golden trumpet blew and power displayed her gorgeous charms and wealth engaged my wandering view and pleasure wooed me to her arms to each by turns my vows i paid as folly led me to admire while fancy magnified each shade and hope increased each fond desire but soon i found twas all a dream and learned the fond pursuit to shun where few can reach their purposed aim and thousands daily are undone and fame i found was empty air and wealth had terror for her guest and pleasures path was strewn with care and power was vanity at best tired of the chase i gave it over and in a far sequestered shade to contemplations sober power my youths next services i paid there health and peace adorned the scene and often indulgent to my prayer with mirthful eye and frolic mien the muse would deign to visit there there would she often delighted rove the flowerenamelld vale along or wander with me through the grove and listen to the woodlarks song or mid the forests awful gloom while wild amazement filled my eyes recall past ages from the tomb and bid ideal worlds arise thus in the muses favor blessed one wish alone my soul could frame and heaven bestowed to crown the rest a friend and thyrsis was his name for manly constancy and truth and worth unconscious of a stain he bloomed the flower of britains youth the boast and wonder of the plain still with our years our friendship grew no cares did then my peace destroy time brought fresh blessings as he flew and every hour was winged with joy but soon the blissful scene was lost soon did the sad reverse appear love came like an untimely frost to blast the promise of my year i saw young daphnes angelform fool that i was i blessed the smart and while i gazed nor thought of harm the
