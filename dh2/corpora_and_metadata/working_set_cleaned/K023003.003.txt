mr popes literary correspondence  volume the third  with letters to and from the duke of shrewsberry lord lansdowne bishop of st asaph sir berkeley lucy william walsh esquire lady chudleigh mrs manley mrs thomas etc   london printed for e curll at popes head in rosestreet covent garden mdccxxxv  to the subscribers gentlemen mr popes project to usher his letters into the world by my means was the foundation of this scheme of a literary correspondence which has been so well received that it shall be continued while people of taste approve of it and that will be as long as people of taste who have valuable performances in this kind in their power contribute their stores to the emolument of mankind not but that i am always ready and willing to purchase any genuine pieces from such possessors as expect a premium  the second volume of this work promised besides mr popes to contain letters to and from lord summers etc notwithstanding which mr pope in his spleen has employed his sifters to talk his sense of the matter to me particularly squire brocade whose objections intermixed with my answers make a very notable scene to the following effect viz  enter brocade sept         mr curll how comes it that you call this second volume mr popes correspondence when there is so much more of other peoples this is a mere imposition upon the town   c sir be pleased to read the title page i began this collection chiefly upon what remained of mr popes and besides finding most of my customers eager to see the minds of men especially in the case of epistolary writing and having considerable supplies of the kind i published a second volume as you see and have materials of equal value and sufficient in quantity to make a third and fourth   b d  n me i do not desire to read any mans writings but popes he is the only writer of the age his equal never lived in any time or country there is nothing worth reading in either of your volumes but what is his   c sir it is not my business to set up my opinion against that of gentlemen who do me the favor to call at my shop but some of my customers whose judgment is much esteemed among their acquaintance have said that mr popes share in this second volume is the very worst part of the book   b z  s what do you mean by that will you pretend to name any writer in competition with mr pope   c sir they do pretend to say that the pieces of bishop atterbury in this volume are something beyond mr popes compass his style in prose his judgment in the criticaltaste his heroic love of his country his vindication of lord clarendons history from an unattested calumny and his absalon and achitophel though done when he was a youth at the university are all inimitable by mr pope   b your judges are blockheads there is not a polite man about the town reads any thing but what is popes how impertinent is it to publish that absalon and achitophel in latin without getting it translated for the ladies if it be good for any thing what a pox do you think gentlemen must be at the slavery like schoolboys of construing it to them in english it would be well for you if you could pacify mr pope perhaps if he and you were friends he might be prevailed on to take a hundred guineas to do it for you   c sir i presume you have seen the poem in its english original by mr dryden i doubt whether the public would desire mr popes finishing hand to that piece   b dryden was a tolerable poet in his time but nothing in comparison to pope there is le neves will and creed i like well enough because they contain partly my own religion but there is his epitaph in latin why is not that translated   c because sir it contains some particulars that cannot be so well expressed in any other language   b sir i think as i please but what do you mean by those political letters of addison prior harley and the rest there is not any wit in them surely   c i grant it sir because the writers of them did not intend it but i am told there is much good sense in them that they open the scene of the famous partition treaty and the designs of france upon the death of king charles ii of spain that they discover the importance of a man who is trusted with affairs and how mere un homme sans consequence a man may be with a great employment if the conduct of the secret springs of action is placed in other hands with many other useful lessons   b why mr curll you are a great politician   c very little of a politician truly sir but since there are some gentlemen inclined to adore a single name among the polite writers to the prejudice of all the rest and to point me out as heretical for being of a different opinion it is necessary i should be able to give some reason for my dissent and that i apprehend is done to the purpose if i am able to show the excellency the superiority of many others over mr pope in this epistolary taste especially   b pray mr curll have you sorted your materials for your third volume   c yes sir   b do you make it a secret or may we be informed what the principal parts are to be   c sir i will inform you with pleasure it is no secret at all i assure you there are more of mr popes letters to ladies particularly her grace the duchess of buckinghamshire some very pretty letters of mrs manley full of true humor perfectly picturesque in a genteel unaffected style natively pleasant and as horace says simplex munditiis  there are excellent ones of the late lord lansdowne they convince the reader of the patriot the englishman the christian the tenderness of the most humane mind the politeness of the finest gentleman the dignity of the british peer are here united and shine forth with full luster in the utmost propriety and perspicuity of language   b you flourish abundantly curll why lansaowne was a jacobite   c now sir you are quite out read his lordships character of queen caroline my lord was indeed very young when he wrote some of these letters and the prince of orange was not then landed but i presume had it been so a jacobite might possibly be a man of wit for mr pope is allowed to be so though he owns himself a papist but here are letters of my lords that show other sort of sentiments at a riper age with regard to the revolution settlement   b well are there any other writers in your third volume   c yes yes sir we are only got forward   0 pages and then we present you an invaluable tract of mr walshs be pleased sir to read mr drydens opinion of him and of this piece   b sir i pay no regard to mr drydens flattery   c wycherley and pope for that but hear sir how mr pope sings to walsh the wit of greece and rome was known and every authors merit but his own   and in his epistle to arbuthnot he prides himself that the knowing walsh would tell him he could write    b well i see it appears by mr pope that mr walsh was a very great man are we to have any thing more   c yes sir the hospital of fools is an imitation of lucian by mr walsh and gentlemen of the best taste among my customers agree that lucian wrote nothing equal to it i had forgot to mention a letter concerning asses containing abundance of wit the rest of the book will consist of dr atterburys pieces translated letters of lady chudleigh mrs thomas and others of great character for wit or literature or both and there will be some curious anecdotes concerning that indefatigable antiquary the late mr thomas hearne of oxford and his writings and relating to that most exemplary as well as most noble princess the late duchess of ormonde with a fine copy of verses in her praise by a greater man than mr pope   b ay who is that pray   c one john dryden  sir    b curll you are really impertinent   c sir you are really conceited and i would advise you to enter yourself of tim lancets society and read the dunciad on sundays as he says he constantly does i cannot lose any more time sir in such trifling debates you are resolved not to like any writer but mr pope and i am resolved to carry on this scheme of a literary correspondence so long as works of real worth are sent me by the polite and judicious part of mankind my respects sir to mr pope when you see him   yours ec   nb the fourth volume of our literary correspondence will open with a collection of historical letters beginning      and ending    0 wherein the most important points of the british affairs are discussed by an old whig printed from an original manuscript with which i received the following letter from a very eminent gentleman of the longrobe upon his reading the sheets of this third volume as they came from the press  e curll  to mr curll i have read the three volumes of your literary correspondence with satisfaction a collection of good letters is much wanted in our language the french have several and i think they outdo us in no other article of polite literature artificial letters written on purpose to be published are apt to fall short of the vivid force and openness found in the unbosoming of friend to friend therefore it is extremely difficult to imitate well as it also is to obtain the papers of a valuable real correspondence  if gentlemen could be satisfied there would be no endeavors to know how letters came to the press i am persuaded our free learned polite age and country might easily find you a genuine collection in the best taste  for my own part i will not have any doubt of your conduct in this respect therefore you now receive enclosed the very mind of a man of sense and rank in his country upon public affairs from the revolution to the year    0 most of them were letters to the late bishop atterbury and the rest to an intimate friend of his who died before him  the bishop a few months before his death lent them to a nobleman in france from whom i had them and at the same time he told him they were written by the honestest whig of his acquaintance that he differed from the writer upon several points but looked upon him to be a good englishman in the main that he the bishop had been censured by his enemies as a hot partyman but that he could always relish the correspondence of a person of sincerity and honor though of different sentiments in politics or religion and that if he did not live to ask for these letters again as he found himself in a declining condition he desired they might not be lost because there was much truth and good sense in them but insisted that if they went abroad it would be in such a manner as not to prejudice the writer of them in any branch of his family which might have occasion for the countenance of men in power  if you think it agreeable to your scheme you may publish them if not i wish you supplies more to your purpose and am  sir your humble servant bt london sept         e curll ad a pope s p d that our name and fame may be equally transmitted to posterity in this our literary correspondence most earnestly desiring a faithful register of matters of fact will be the best method for obtaining these desirable ends  having given notice in the st jamess eveningpost of saturday july   th that the second volume of literary correspondence would be published on monday the   th you was pleased in the london gazette of tuesday the   th to insert an advertisement which i shall here paraphrastically reinsert for the true information of the public viz  whereas several booksellers printers and publishers viz l gilliver t cooper and j watson have printed several surreptitious and incorrect editions of letters as mine some of which are not so being written by those persons to whom they are by e curll justly ascribed and others interpolated by the editor of those six hundred copies sold by the reverend mr r smythe pursuant to the direction of his cousin pt both agents of mine to the aforesaid e curll and whereas there are daily advertisements of second and third volumes of more such letters particularly my correspondence with dr francis atterbury the late bishop of rochester the said second and third volumes being now published i think myself under a necessity to publish such of the said letters as are genuine not hitherto published with the addition of some others of a nature less insignificant especially those which passed between the said bishop atterbury and myself or were any way relating to him which shall be printed with all convenient speed and which will likewise be faithfully reprinted by e curll as a supplement to the three volumes of literary correspondence by him published and carried on with the universal approbation of the public  a pope  this sir must be understood to be the true meaning of the foregoing advertisement and which shall be by me literally made good  as to r smythe whom you have been pleased to inform me was only a pretended clergyman against therefore this nominal r smythe exclusive of his function i have exhibited a bill in chancery to hold him to his contract of delivering to me six hundred printed copies of the first volume of your letters printed by your own direction to complete your correspondence with mr wycherley as lawton gilliver has himself acknowledged whom with yourself i have made parties to my bill against r smythe not in the least doubting but from such an equitable triumvirate i shall obtain justice  for with you sir flattery in every shape i hold a shame and think a lie in verse or prose the same epistle to dr arbuthnot  bravo to god and coward unto man the liar is dr souths character of the liar deny this truth who can   this vice sir is as mean as it is base and as you have found in all debates between us has been the abhorrence of  your humble servant e curll peckham sept         ps as i am pretty conversant with those authors whose works i print in revising vising my old friend voiture for a new edition i find you have very politely pillaged his letters your first to a lady with a book of drawings is evidently taken from one he wrote to madame rambouillet in the name of callot the engraver presenting a book of his prints your second is i find a compliment to our friend parson broom and mrs betty marriot of sturstonhall in suffolk and lastly the compliments in those letters of this volume to miss b are transplanted from what voiture wrote to madame rambouillet m vigean and other ladies of the court of france    errata letter  d to miss b line   for liberty read liberality belluchi mentioned in the letter to the duchess of b  was a painter not a statuary  to mr edmund curll bookseller in rosestreet covent garden mr curll the characteristicks whereby the author of the enclosed letters may be known are too many and glaring to need any mentioning of his name were there no other arguments to confirm this his own pen betrays him but for your farther satisfaction i must inform you that i found them among some papers of a deceased friend with several others of a nature more insignificant which therefore i would not transcribe the gentlemans wife before she was so is known to have been personally acquainted with your adversary which puts the matter past doubt  with many thanks for your two former volumes these are at your service for your third which i find you are about  yours se aug   d      letters of mr pope to miss blount to miss b blount on the death of her brother madam having no less admiration for your courage and good nature than sympathy with your grief i am so highly sensible of both the one and the other that if i were capable to render you those commendations which were justly due to you and that comfort whereof you stand in need i must confess i should be much troubled where to begin for what obligations can be more equally enforcing than to render to so eminent a virtue the honor it merits and to so violent affliction the comfort it requires but i am to blame to put a distance between these two things since charity has so perfectly united them that the fond assistance you afforded your late brother should now prove an extraordinary comfort to you since god will bestow that on you out of justice which others obtain out of his indulgence his infinite goodness being such as will not suffer unrewarded so exemplary an act of tenderness as what through a contempt of your own life engaged you in the offices of the best and tenderest sister in the world beyond the limits of all obligations and by an admirable constancy made you assured amidst a danger that terrifies the most daring  upon this account am i confident that he will preserve you from it the smallpox  and will shower on you as a reward of your virtue the blessings which are wished you by  madam yours etc  to the same madam i here send you the elegy this with some other poetical pieces will be found in our fourth volume  which you have but too often demanded of me and which heretofore has indeed been heard by others but till now has not been read by any  it is my wish that the same fortune may in this happen to me as has befallen you who after you have for so long time concealed the noblest things in the world have in the discovery of it dazzled all those that have seen it but it is an overgreat fondness for my own verses to wish them that advantage nor indeed should i wish them better since they were not made for you if you think them very ill you are so much the more obliged to me for them in that knowing it as well as you yet i have not forborne sending them to you and to deal freely with you a less power than what you have within these few days gained upon me would not have been sufficient to have prevailed with me to do it and without your command madam they had never known any other place than that of my own memory but it is high time it were delivered of them to make room for something more delightful i mean that which mrs  had the grace to acquaint me with the other day and which fills it so much at present that i doubt whether there be place for any thing else  i perceive madam that where it was my design to send you a letter of excuse and compliment i am fallen into one of love but i wish all the other defects you shall find in it were as pardonable as that in the mean time let me assure you that i have not of a long time been so engaged and that there are many in the world to whom i would not say so much even though they held a dagger at my throat  but since there is no fear of any scandal you are obliged madam at least in my opinion to look favorably on those elements of affection were it but to see how i should behave myself if i should fall in love and if i were permitted what might be the consequence of it  i am madam etc  to the same madam though my liberty were as you say greater than alexanders it were more than recompensed by the thanks you have been pleased to return it even his ambition as insatiable as it was would by so extraordinary a favor have been limited he would have valued this honor more highly than the persian diadem and he would not have envied achilles the praises of homer might he have yours in like manner madam considering the reputation you do me if i envy his it is not so much that which he has acquired as what you have bestowed on him and he has received no honors which i do not look upon below my own unless it be that you do him when you call him your gallant neither his own vanity nor his flatterers have ever advanced any thing so advantageous to him and the quality of the son of jupiter ammon was not so glorious as that but if nothing can cure me of the jealousy i have of it yet madam knowing you as i do i am confident if you do him that favor it is not so much because he is the greatest of mankind as because it is two thousand years since he was  however it be we may see in this the greatness of his fortune which not able to forsake him so many years after his death adds to his conquests a person which celebrates them more than the wife and daughter of darius and has reinfused into him a soul greater than that of the world he has subdued  i should fear by your example to write in too high a style but can a man aim at one too high speaking of you and alexander i beseech you madam to assure your self i have for you the same passion which you have for him and that the admiration of your virtues shall ever engage me to be madam  yours etc  to the same madam i could never believe it possible that the receipt of a letter from you should add to my affliction or that you could have possibly sent me such bad news as that you could not comfort me at the same time  i thought my unhappiness at such a point as could not admit of any addition and that since you were able something to strengthen my patience to endure the absence of your mother and you there could not be any misfortune which you could not have encouraged me to suffer but give me leave to tell you that i have found the contrary in the affliction i have for the death of mrs a which has been heavy enough to crush me and wanted not much to spend the remainder of my patience  you may easily judge madam what an excessive grief it must needs be to me to have lost a friend so good so sprightly and so accomplished as she and one that having always given me so many expressions of her affection would needs do something when she had not many hours to continue here but though i reflected not on my own concernments yet could i not but infinitely regret a person by whom you were infinitely beloved and who among many particular endowments had that of knowing you as much as may be and esteeming you above all things yet i must confess if this disturbance can admit of any remission it is to reflect on the constancy she expressed and the fortitude wherewith she has suffered a thing whereof the name would make her tremble at any time  i am extremely comforted to understand that at her death she had those qualities which only she wanted in her life and that she so opportunely found courage and resolution when i consider it seriously it is somewhat against my conscience to bemoan her and methinks it speaks an overinterested affection to be sad because she has left us to better her condition and is gone into the other world  from whose bourne no traveller returns hamlet  to find that quiet she could never meet with in this  i very heartily entertain the exhortations you give me thereupon which is often to con over a lesson so profitable and necessary and to prepare myself for the like one day i know how to make my advantage of your remonstrance the miseries we have run through all this while is no small preparation for it there is no better lecture to instruct a man how to die well than not to take much pleasure in living  but if it be not impossible for the hopes that fortune proposes to prove effectual if after so many years we may presume to expect some few fair days be pleased to give me leave madam to entertain thoughts more diverting than those of death and if it be likely that we are shortly to see one another let me not fall out with my life  where you say you think me destined to great things you give so great security of my life and so happy a presage of the adventures that shall happen to me that i shall not be sorry for its continuance yet a while for my part if destiny does promise me any thing that is good i assure you i will do my utmost to get it i will contribute all i can thereto that your prophesies may be fulfilled in the mean time i beseech you to be confident that of all the favors i can beg of fortune what i most passionately desire is that she would do for you what she ought and for myself only afford me the means to acquaint you with the passion which obliges me to be so much  madam your etc  nb the works of voiture translated

alludes whereon are represented the portraiture of his grace habited like a roman general and at his feet that of her grace weeping on the top of the basis of the column is seen in relievo time bearing away the four deceased children of the duchess whose effigies are represented in profilebustos supported by cupids lamenting but parting in haste i had not his opinion at large only he assures me he thinks the figures will not be too small considering that those which are nearest the eye are at least as large as the life i cannot but be of opinion that my lord dukes and your graces ought to be made portraits and as like as possible of which they have yet no resemblance there being no picture as i believe of the duke in profile it might be well i fancy if belluchi copied the sideface from chat busto that stands in the salon  i beg your graces pardon for the freedom with which i write to you and i ought to ask it now i think on it on another occasion in which i have used too much freedom having a great esteem for the famous bononcini not only from his great fame but from a personal knowledge of his character and this being increased by the ill treatment he has met with here i ventured among other persons of the first distinction who subscribed to me for his composures newly ingraved to set down the name of your grace when i did this your grace was at bath and i forgot ever since to tell you of it till now when the books his cantatas coming out put me in mind of it  if you can excuse this fault i sincerely think i shall not err this way again till such another great man as bononcini arises for whenever that happens i doubt not the english will use him as scurvily but that your grace needs not apprehend during our lives i am with the sincerest respect  madam your

repay his bounty or exalt his fame an original letter from his grace the late duke of shrewsberry relating to a manuscript copy of the lord holless memoirs in answer to a letter sent his grace by mr curll the bookseller to mr curll sir these memoirs go no farther than the parliaments resolving to treat no more with the king my lord holles was of the presbyterian party zealous at first to take arms against the king but would not have carried it so far as the independents did he writes very virulently against them gives instances of cromwells and haslerigs cowardice as may be seen in the annexed table alluding to the table in the manuscript mentions lord savile as an impostor who accused himself and others  this book is an apology for the scots and english presbyterians and a satire against the army and independents but wrote in so angry and declaiming a style that it does not please me it treats only of public facts known to every body and tells none of those secret intrigues schemes conferences etc which are what is most valuable in these sort of books  shrewsberry   0  to mr curll bookseller etc chapter chapter oxford jan        sir i am very glad it was ever in my power to do you any good office the favor i received from this very worthy prelate was the drawing up a list of the chancellors of norwich printed at the end of sir thomas brownes antiquities of that cathedral      and should be ready to do the same again especially in a cause of justice and truth but your author in his defense of the clarendonfamily bishop atterburys defense of the earl of clarendon is an irrefragable answer to the latent lie hatched and propagated by messrs ducket and oldmixon for i believe the dead man smith wholly innocent  see the clarendonfamily vindicated printed for e curll  vo        must not appeal to me on account of any interpolations in the characters of that famous history for i have no such originals nor ever saw any it was reported that his lordship had such a ms which was the motive of my writing to him ec   i have great reason to believe that that work was as faithfully published as ever any posthumous piece was which i believe will shortly be made evident to the public by a more able hand to the new edition of the earl of clarendons history printed at oxford      is prefixed bishop atterburys defense which is sufficient   i am sir your humble servant thom asaph elect  to sir berkeley lucy bart sir what mr nelson in his life of bishop bull says of that learned prelate may with the strictest veracity be applied to mr collins viz he has received so great a brightness from his own pen that it needs no auxiliary light to increase its luster and his character is so secure from the example of his life that all calumnies raised against it fly like chaff before the wind  by a letter from kingscollege cambridge i am informed that mr collins was bred at eton in quality of an oppidane where he was very remarkable even while a boy for a good taste of the classics etc he was admitted a fellowcommoner of kingscollege july        where under the tuition of dr hare he was soon perceived to grow indefatigable in the roughest tracts of philosophy particularly the ars cogitandi he was almost a singular example among those of his station rarus ferme communis sensus in illa fortuna says horace is as applicable to a man of flourishing circumstances as to the patriot and though it has been much controverted what was the poets view yet in both lights mr collins has been thought to be an exception  since mr lock has declared that he considered mr collins as a philosopher and a christian all the sneering and lucrative sarcasms of ecclesiastics ought to be held in the utmost contempt his character is so secure from the example of his life that i am the less concerned for my own inability to embalm his memory especially as the weight and importance of the matter will make some amends for those defects which may arise from the manner of handling it  that part of biography sir which records men famous in the republic of letters is generally acceptable to the learned because it attempteth to gratify a curiosity which prevails much and is nourished among them whereby they are prompted to search for and enquire after the minutest circumstances which relate to such authors who are no otherwise known to them than by the works they have left behind them  and now sir as the best and most firm basis i can lay for the support of my superstructure give me leave to mortify the wrangling priesthood by exhibiting the sincere sentiments mr lock had of mr collinss virtues and abilities a character which i am certain with all those who knew his intrinsic worth will turn the balance even against the constitutions of popes the decrees of councils or the cavils of convocations  you have exceedingly obliged me says mr lock to mr collins in the books of yours that you have sent me and continues our immortal christian philosopher i am overjoyed with an intimation i have received also that gives me hopes of seeing you next week you are a charitable good friend and are resolved to make the decays and dregs of my life the pleasantest part of it for i know nothing calls me back to a pleasant sense of enjoyment and makes my days so gay and lively as your good company come then and multiply happy minutes upon and rejoice in the good you do me for i am with a perfect esteem and respect  yours etc   upon mr collinss return to town   0  after paying the visit mentioned in the foregoing letter mr lock returns him the following acknowledgment  i owe you my thanks for the greatest favor i can receive the confirmation of your friendship by the visit i lately received from you  in some other letters he thus expresses himself  there is one mr collins with whom if i desire to live upon equal terms it is not that i forget how much he is superior to me in many things wherein he will always have the precedence  you make my life since i have had your friendship much more valuable to me than it was before  though my friendship be of very little value or use yet being the best thing i have to give i shall not forwardly bestow it where i do not think there is worth and sincerity and therefore pray pardon me the forwardness wherewith i throw my arms about your neck and holding you so tell you you must not hope by any thing that looks like compliment to keep one at a civiller and more fashionable distance  yours of the   th instant of feb   0   makes me love and value you if it were possible more than i did before you having therein in short so well described wherein the happiness of a rational creature in this world consists though there are very few who make any other use of their halfemployed and undervalued reason but to bandy against it it is well as you observe that they agree as ill with one another as they do with common sense for when by the influence of some prevailing head they all lean one way truth is sure to be borne down and there is nothing so dangerous as to make any enquiry after her and to own her for her own sake is the most unpardonable crime  it is no small advantage to me to have found such a friend at the last scene of my life when i am good for nothing and am grown so useless that i cannot but be sure that in every good office you do me you can propose to your self no other advantage but the pleasure of doing it letter of    march   0   give me leave to desire you to bestow some of your spare hours on the epistles to the corinthians mr lockes paraph on those epistles and to try whether you can find them intelligible or no  if i regret my old age it is you that make me and calls me back to the world just as i was leaving of it and leaving it as a place that had very little valuable in it but who would not be glad to spend some years with you  he that has any thing to do with you must own that friendship is the natural product of your constitution and your soul a noble soil is enriched with the two most valuable qualities of human nature truth and friendship what a treasure have i then in such a friend with whom i can converse and be enlightened about the highest speculations  souls sir berkeley endowed like mr lockes mr collins or your own were made to converse with each other only far very far removed from the insolence of priests or the pedantry of schools such stoical apathy as they were and you are possessed with put mr addison upon leaving us this perpetual memento in his campaign great souls by instinct to each other turn demand alliance and for friendship burn raised of themselves their genuine charms they boast and those who paint them truest praise them most   these characteristics given of mr collins by mr lock will surely make every little or indeed the greatest canonical pedagogue dread to attack the memory of our dear friend especially when they find the esteem he had for him reached even beyond the grave see mr lockes pieces  vo p         where is a letter thus superscribed by mr lock for anthony collins esquire to be delivered to him after my decease and with which testimonial i shall close what i have to offer on this head for the present  the knowledge i have of your virtue of all kinds secures the trust which by your permission i have placed in you  may you live long and happy in the enjoyment of health freedom content and all those blessings which providence has bestowed on you and your virtue intitles you to i know you loved me living and will preserve my memory now i am dead all the use to be made of it is that this life is a scene of vanity that soon passes away and affords no solid satisfaction but in the consciousness of doing well and in the hopes of another life this is what i can say upon experience and what you will find to be true when you come to make up the account adieu i leave my best wishes with you  john lock   i am sir berkeley lucys most obedient humble servant ec  a letter to mr p rejoice with me my friend there is probability of mine advancement this is the reign of expectancy never if not now shall i become considerable places of national and mighty trust are given to those the world will trust no longer emulous of the roman simplicity our nobility like so many cincinnatuss seem to be taken from the plough our clergy representing the mechanic piscatory founders of christianity are men of mean descent and altogether as eminent for their ignorance but as the uninterrupted succession of their apostleship is most undeniable the lord inspire these with those saul from a tender of his fathers asses became a tender father to the people israel and left his former care caesar too was called to be a king but he retained his asses some he made judges some bishops and some ambassadors which occasioned the scoffers to say that caesar only wore the lions skin what led me i believe to this subject was the hearing of papers now crying about the streets entitled the congress of asses which naturally brought to my remembrance many folks and occurrences both at home and abroad we have a poet laureat here thanks to my lord chamberlain now grown old who is twice a year brought forth to be kicked at by his brethren  the heels of every ass salute old c  if dean b  or doctor s  pride themselves too highly on the linguose faculty may not the ass of balaam serve for their reproof as well as he did for that of his master nothing seems to me more unjust than the contempt which is offered to this noble animal by the vulgar who mistake his solemn majesty for dullness should this epistle ever appear in public as i hope it never will i am sensible it would be thought an insinuating artifice of mine to get a place at court or recommend myself to somebody in power whereas i have no such intention i assure you but shall disinterestedly and without flattery as far as i am able take away part of the burden from the back of this generous beast for what is heavier than an ill name in doing which i have only imitated the renowned osborns and walsinghams of these our times whose labors i must acknowledge to be as far superior to mine as they are more difficult but to proceed asses formerly were not contemptible their names were not made a reproach they sometimes were clothed in furs like our aldermen and sometimes in scarlet and cloth of gold and kings and princes used to ride upon them midas a phrygian monarch had himself the ears of an ass which was in those days held an uncommon thing kings will not out of brotherly affection despise them moreover this stately beast is not to be prevailed upon by blows the venerable dispensers of our laws are not endowed with more gravity all the holygifted ones should respect him as an elder and one of themselves for he once spoke by the same divine power they would be thought to speak by besides he has that in him which is well worthy of their imitation i mean his patience both sacred and profane history have emblematized strength and heroism by the ass than which nothing can be more natural noble beautiful or just jacob when he blesses his sons says issachar is a strong ass crouching down between two burdens and homer in the eleventh book of the iliad compares ajax making a noble retreat to one of these animals forcing his way into a field of corn there satisfying his hunger and then retiring with a tardy sullen intrepidity maugre the opposition of a troop of boys whose rattling strokes resound upon his sides had i nothing else to offer in their behalf the abovementioned instances are sufficient to abate all ridicule and draw respect from the viperous tongue of calumny itself  but farther the most eminent poets orators historians and naturalists have not thought it beneath them to treat of the ass either in metaphor simile or description narrative pliny lib    cap    gives large account of him describes his nature passions etc and shows us what judgment we are to form of the prickingup and what from the limber and halferected position of his ears virgil mentions him but sparingly horace more frequent the thirteenth epistle of his first book is wrote ad vinnium asellum whom he banters on his name he was to present horaces poems to augustus who desires if they are too burdensome to him that he will cast them away and not bear them like panniers to be laughed at and get the surname of ass because his paternal one was asella cicero speaks of one asellius sempronius an historian by which we know this name to have been considerable with the romans there are likewise two stars in cancer called the aselli and silenus the fosterfather of bacchus according to ovid was always mounted upon an ass i shall here repeat something truly poetical spoken of the ass in our own language not inferior to any thing of the ancients it is taken from the dunciad where no less than a goddess proclaims several sorts of games and promises a drum to him of all her favorites who shall outvoice the ass  and his this drum whose hoarse heroic base drowns the loud clarion of the braying ass first having encouraged her children they begin the sports the goddess thus giving the word of command sound forth my brayers and the welkin rend as when the longeard milky mothers wait at some sick misers triplebolted gate for their defrauded absent foals they make a moan so loud that all the guild awake sore sighs sir gilbert starting at the bray from dreams of millions and three groats to pay so swells each windpipe ass intones to ass harmonic twang of leather horn and brass such as from laboring lungs the enthusiast blows high sounds attempted to the vocal nose but far over all sonorous blackmores strain walls steeples skies bray back to him again in totnhamfields the brethren in amaze prick all their ears up and forget to graze long chancrylane retentive rolls the sound and courts to courts return it round and round thames wafts it thence to rufus roaring hall and hungerford reechoes bawl for bawl   scarce do i know whether the ass is more indebted to the poet for this excellent description of him or the poet to the ass for those qualifications of his which were the occasion of it but certain i am that every language is enriched with many terse sayings proverbs and sentences drawn from the known qualities of this quadrupede fait en dos dasne signifies any thing done with cunning asinus antronius is a lobcock asinus ad lyram and  in the greek are proverbs which seem to reflect upon the ass for his unskilfulness in music whereas the contrary is manifest for this animal pays an extraordinary attention to every sort of windmusic as may be easily discovered by the prickingup of his ears his simpering gesture his frolic spurning of the heels attended by the clangor of his own pipe with a seeming desire to bear a part it is most unquestionable that he has the advantage of all other beasts the sounds he utters being more articulate and many learned critics agree that no living pipe so nearly resembles the hautboy bagpipe or that more admired newinvented watermusic the frenchhorn the performers upon which instruments if he does not excel every body will readily allow it is not for want of ear  sir richard blackmore was sneered at by the critics but what will not critics sneer for applying the word bray to the sound of armor war etc which must needs have been right in him for if the hero himself is justly likened to an ass there is as it were a chain of propriety in comparing the noise of arms and clangor of the battle to braying vide milton lib   lin  0   arms on armor clashing brayed horrible discord  sir richard we see was but a later copiest of this beauty he it seems stole it from milton who stole it from homer who stole it from the ancients his predecessors who copied from nature   there are others also who reflect upon the ass for his ears which is whimsical indeed and i doubt not but that this clamor proceeds from those only who have lost their own while i treat of this subject methinks i feel some of that assistance which the poets so often call for i am hurried away a flood of fire pours itself upon me nature is overpowered violently thou o art assist me to restrain her force lo i again subside steady is my seat and tight my rein how copious is the theme i handle surely the world could not contain the volumes which might be wrote upon it what i can say is nothing it would not be esteemed as a sentence in the great folio twelve books each twelve times bigger than doomsdaybook are to be wrote solely upon the milk of this animal it is mothers milk to half the nation it is the kettle of medaea the waters of aganippe to this is owing our remarkable progress in the liberal sciences and polite literature to this is owing the politics so nobly defended by walsingham and osborne to this is owing the histories of the burnets the cooks and the oldmixons the divinity of the henleys and the fosters the physic of the misaubins and the wards the poetry of the fieldings and the savages and to this is owing these my labors to this also but whether am i going those of our party already mentioned are sufficient how greatly have they labored to be thought asses and how greatly have they succeeded  here i must take notice of a remarkable instance of the asss principles if that expression may be permitted me when our immortal deliverer landed at torbay the vociferous acclamation of a congregated drove was heard by multitudes of his followers and if i am not misinformed the famous dr burnet assured them it was a happy omen and i doubt not but that upon the publication of the second volume of his history we shall find that he after his usual pious manner has discovered providence to be eminently interested in favor of that undertaking from the declaration these animals made as a sort of joining with their own party  i have already exceeded the limits of a letter and shall conclude after i have interpreted two fables famous for their antiquity  first oenus a ropemaker in hell had an ass always standing by him who as fast as he twisted the cord bit it asunder his labor was thereby rendered abortive eternally renewed eternally frustrated  oenus resembles those hellish ministers who through their evil counsels make ropes to bind the people in slavery by the ass is meant the honest patriot who ever watchful for the public safety destroys his schemes discovers his designs drives him to invent new mischief which he still renders ineffectual by his vigilance  secondly an ass being honored with carrying on his back the statue of isis the people bowed fell on their knees and worshipped the goddess the ass thinking his merit to be the cause of their adoration grew insolent and proud but when he was unloaded they convinced him by blows it was not him they respected  by the ass you are to understand all such as have places at court what respect they meet with is not paid to them but to their office from which when they are once discarded every man carries a cudgel which will convince them of the truth of what i say i am my dear friend in all shapes comforted with hopes and expectations  yours etc philoa  s  love letters by mrs manley advertisement this small packet of letters though written under the fatigue of traveling is a delightful proof of the true taste both of the thoughts and sense of their inimitable author all who had the happiness of her conversation were soon convinced how free she was from the general frailties of her sex what a nobleness and generosity of temper she possessed how distant her views from the least appearance of selfinterest or mean design how often have i heard her compassionately regretting the miseries of mankind and never her own but when they prevented her extensive charity to others  never was she vindictive against the most inveterate enemy the innate softness of her soul rendered her deportment equally obliging to friends and foes and never did she resent but with the strictest justice  a journey to exeter was undertaken by her on account of a lawsuit in the year      and two years afterward these letters were made public without her leave by jh james hargrave late of the middle temple esquire esquire so highly was she disgusted at this ungenerous treatment that she caused them to be suppressed  the copy from which this edition is reprinted i received from her own hands near twenty years ago with this positive injunction that it should never more see the light till the thread of her life was cut  ec  letter i egham st john baptist      i am got as they tell me sixteen miles from you and london but i cannot help fancying it is so many degrees though midsummer to all besides in my breast there is nothing but frozen imaginations the resolutions i have taken of quitting london which is as much as to say the world for ever starts back and asks my gayer part if it has well weighed the sense of ever nor does your letter which i received this morning taking coach less influence me than when i first formed the design you should have used but half these arguments and they had undoubtedly prevailed it is of the latest now to ask me why i leave the crowded market and retire to starve alone in solitude whereas you quote the poet all your beauty no more light will have than a sundial in a grave i am too much afraid sloth and sadness are going to be my eternal companions and you know my soul is unfitted for such guests till upon the road to execution i fancied  dying to the world horace cowley all those illustrious lovers of solitude debauched my opinion against my reason and i took coach with mr granvilles late lord lansdowne words in my mouth place me ye gods in some obscure retreat o keep me innocent make others great in quiet shades content with rural sports give me a life remote from guilty courts where free from hopes and fears at humble ease unheard of i may live and die in peace yet you see how great a change two hours has produced all my constancy is not proof against the thought that i am going to have no lover but myself for ever the green inviting grass upon which i promised to pass many pleasing solitary hours seems not at all entertaining the trees with all their blooming spreading beauties appear the worst sort of canopy because where i am going they can offer their shade to none but solitary me but it is not reasonable my dullness should extend to you who have every thing in your nature just and pleasing you asked and i eagerly engaged because you desired me to give an account of myself and travels every stage i have not forgot when i told you it was too often how you answered not for a mind so fruitful as mine in variety of inconstant thoughts you find at present they run all upon melancholy apprehensions which have so wholly possessed me i have not had time to observe my wretched fellowtravellers only a pert sir in the company that will make himself be taken notice of by his dullness  they most unmercifully set us to dinner at ten of clock upon a great leg of mutton it is the custom of these dining stages to prepare one day beef and another our present fare it is ready against the coach comes and though you should have a perfect antipathy there is no remedy but fasting the coachman begs your pardon he would not stay dressing a dinner for the king god bless him should he travel in his coach i have left the limb of the sheep to the mercy of my

jersey and guernsey and christened by the name of de la riviere manley she wrote these letters to her namesake and kinsman john manley esquire they fully express what kind of esteem she had for him  the life of mrs manley written by herself is printed for mr curll     letter ii i am got safe to hartleyrow and in a little better humor than when i wrote my last our landlord is a perfect beau and most exquisitely performs the honors of his house i am in pain for his assiduity i cannot fetch a step no not to the window from the table etc but he is squiring me and so dressed and so conceited that nothing but serving a loose apprenticeship could have set him up a master in the trade of foppery he was a goldsmiths prentice where he studied more his pleasures than profit this house fell to him and he wisely resolved to keep it himself with the help of his sister who is a neat housewifely obliging sort of woman i suppose it is by much the best entertainment this road affords they have a tolerable cook and i was glad to find something i could eat at three oclock for we came in here at two and i can give you a little better account of my fellowtravellers the sir i spoke of is a baronets son as he has carefully given me to understand i take it for granted he likes me and would have me do the same by him as he came in he put off his traveling suit for a coat and vest designed to dazzle the curate and all his congregation the way i took to mortify his foppery was not to speak a word of the change which made him extreme uneasy at length cut of all patience he desired my opinion if his tailor had used him well what the brocade was worth a yard how many ounces of silverfringe and recommended to my curiosity the exquisite workmanship of the loops and then gave me the sum total of his cost i answered him that finery was lost upon me i neither was nor pretended to be a judge he pertly answered he perceived by my sullenness that i had a great deal of wit though i understood he had but little by his remark well all this did not do he would fain have had me enquired into his family intrigues and fortune which when he perceived i had no curiosity for faith madam says he i beg your ladyships opinion if i am not the most unfortunate man breathing i will tell you a very mortifying adventure nay you must hear me i vow this indifferency does not look natural to you your eyes promise us much more fire i will shut em thought i for ever rather than such a fop shall find any thing to like them for what no answer madam says he i perceive your attention by your silence gad i love a person of your breeding that know themselves better than to interrupt a good story perhaps madam is not well with her journey answered mrs mayoress of totness alas i wonder riding in the coach should not have got you a better stomach poor gentlewoman she has scarce eat any thing i will recompense that by a feast of the mind answered my fop how say you madam shall i begin the regalio i had as good consent quoth i with or without my leave i see you are resolved upon it well then madam says he since you are disposed to be delighted i will about it instantly  it happened at oxford three months ago where i often came my fathers estate being not far distant i saw a lady and fell in love with her ay gad madam downright in love with her she was a person genteely bred and had seen the beaumonde made the tour of all the places of gallantry shined in the drawing room languished in the boxes adorned the park in a word was all a man of my circumstances could desire in one he was resolved to make an oblation of his heart to but as her honor was my care and not marrying my design i searched for a dexterous pretense to visit and be happy i took mr slye with me a gentleman of the town who had a wife to give you the character of my friend he was naturally amorous had a handsome person and strains of natural wit beyond whatever i saw in the most acquired and your ladyship must allow me to be a judge of wit by so dexterously finding out yours maugre your silence i bowed for this extraordinary compliment and thought i could not more agreeably return it than by continuing my silence and as the poet has it left him to his dear mistake mr slye continued he was to propose a marriage between me and my lady conquest to the old people her relations whom she was just come to live with but as soon as he saw her if i was her first oxford victim he was certainly the second and as i found presently took with her she had a very fine hand which mr slye according to the country liberty kissed and then with cleveland said so soft it is air but once removed tender as twere a jelly glovd she gave him a look which seemed to say she wondered in that place at such a piece of gallantry and then pursuing with her wit the victory of her eyes charmed my friend to that degree that he told me he must enjoy her or die gad madam was not this a very odd turn i carried him to speak for me and he comes to make me the confidant of his designs we agreed though as friends should to keep our mutual confidence secret from her and to endeavor each of us to make himself happy and faithfully to relate the progress of our amors but because the country is much given to tatling the pretensions of marriage went on lady conquest was airy and coquet loved company and gallantry if they could be purchased with safety but she knew so well how to manage every body that none durst speak to her more than she had a mind to hear i was one of the awed fools gad would you believe madam that love could make so great an ass of a man of my understanding and yet it was not altogether that neither my pride was concerned i was resolved not to serve for her diversion till i was sure she was consenting to be mine but could no more keep out of her company than i could hang myself i desired her to walk she consented with a crony she picked up upon condition i would engage mr slye of the party i was jealous but to no purpose either my rivals company or not my mistresss slye pretended fear of his wife that he durst not appear in public with any other woman for she already began to have apprehensions of my lady conquest whose way of living was remote to those of countrygentlewomens and therefore he was resolved to think no more of her though infinitely pleasing to him for his fortune depended in a great measure upon his wifes mother i came back with this doleful news to lady conquest go tell him answered she he who has pretended to love me should fear nothing more than not being beloved and that i command him to meet us at the appointed place i ran like a fool to do her message which i believed raillery because she ought to have been more cautious of a married mans love if serious slye wanted but entreaty he consented and we met but not to my comfort though the expense was mine he had the profit she was not easy unless he sat nigh her she talked to him stared at him did every thing to show she was pleased whilst i by a notion of pride would pretend nothing for fear i should not have all for gad madam i do not love being baulked thus several times we met but all as little to the purpose undoubtedly she saw i loved her but would not see because i was of use in her affair with slye the whole town talked of our approaching wedding and i began to be fool enough to resolve on it through slyes persuasion who continually extolled her honor and virtue and tickled my pride with the news of her love but that she wanted a declaration from me before i could expect a confession from her i told him i would think on it and so we parted that night as chance would have it i passed along by the house where she lived and i found the gate open i know not what devil of curiosity carried me in and when in to go to her chamber i did both unseen and concealed myself behind the bed which i saw sitted for night i resolved to wait till she should be in bed and then to take advantage of her womans absence who lay in the antichamber and there to declare my love and offer her marriage long i had not waited though gad madam i was very impatient and thought every minute seven when the charming fair came from her dressing room with nothing on but her nightgown and slippers which were soon thrown off and the goddess appeared more beauteous than the naked queen of love the happy bed soon received her and she cried haste and bring my lover to me at these words her woman went into the antichamber and returned softly with slye who flew to her arms sighed kissed and died there  imagine my surprise twas so great i could not in a long time show myself to interrupt em at length seeing him undress for bed gad madam my patience was quite expired traitor says i showing myself is it thus thou preservest thy feigned duty to thy wife i laid my hand upon my sword and he did the like on his and we had certainly drawn had not the amorous fair thrown herself out of bed between us and conjured us on her knees to make no noise else she was lost for ever i raised her naked beauties and carried them whence they came but complained at my hard fortune which had made me the instrument of my own ruin she saw i was extremely touched at it and after her shame and surprise was a little over you have no reason sir said she to complain of me i could have no engagements with a man who never pretended to love me though you have given me the glory of refusing you as a husband in the eyes of the town it could not but nettle me to know there was nothing serious on your side but done like a gentleman to secure my reputation amongst illbred fools who know not the charms of conversation and will not permit it without censure to those that do but gad madam answered i your ladyship is not so dull but to know i loved you all my assiduities uneasiness sighs and ogleings must have informed you our sex dares hardly believe yours she replied when you take pains to speak and sure it were an unpardonable vanity to draw such consequences without it these circumstances you pretend i have found common to all gentlemen therefore must i conclude the whole world is in love with me and deny myself those who tell me they are my servants for the vain imagination that another is silently so gad madam answered i i cannot possibly forgive the preference of a dull silly sober married man to an airy welldressed young amorous one i will be gone to london by break of day for fear i should not conceal my resentments and so injure your ladyship irreparably for gad madam i must repeat again you were to blame to slight all the pains i took to breed you for nobler game this last i confess broke my splenetic silence and i could not hold laughing heartily which amply paid my squire for the pains he had taken in his relation he concluded it with telling me his journey to london and short stay there only to accouter his design of visiting a ladysister married into devonshire and closed with lauds to his good fortune that had thrown him into a coach with a lady of my charms and sense to whom he had sacrificed the relics of lady conquest the first minute that he saw me i answered him that i found experience had made him resolve against losing a second mistress for want of speaking he had manners sufficient or rather conscience to think he had given me enough of his beauself for one day and withdrew  i could not forbear late as it was sending you an account if you laugh in your turn i am paid for my pains as well as the squire it is now past eleven and they will call us by two good night i am going to try if i can drown in sleep that which most sensibly affects me the cruel separation we have so lately suffered  dm  letter iii do not you think i am more constant than your friendship could hope or mine pretend to i think it a great proof of it amidst the fatigues of a westcountry journey to give you thus duly an account of my insignificant self and travels we parted from hartleyrow at three this morning through a crowd of beggars who watch our coach for alms and will never leave it unblessed hence my beau took occasion of simile bid me to observe how wakeful those wretches were for small charities that he would do the like in hopes of greater and that my divine idea had so filled his sight he could not resolve to let sleep intrude for fear of shutting me out i perceived he took pains to be thought uneasy and i have more good manners than to disappoint him mrs mayoress now she is acquainted has all the low disagreeable familiarity of people of her rank she entertained us all the morning with a sorry lovebusiness about her second husband stuff so impertinent i remember nothing of it beau continues in his assiduities i think none was ever so plagued with dying eyes his are continually in that posture and my opposites that i am forced to take a good deal of pains to avoid them the two other fellowtravellers were never so promoted before and are much troubled their journey is to last no longer and wish the four days four months i hope every jolt will squash their guts and give them enough of it but they are proof against any such disasters and hugely delighted with what they are pleased to call riding in state after this ridiculous account you need not doubt but i am thoroughly mortified the trouts are just brought upon the table which are the only good thing here they look inviting and will not stay for cooling compliments i hope time will show none to say  i am unalterably yours dm sutton    june letter iv i cannot give myself any reason why these coachmen are such unreasonable rogues they make us rise at two in the morning to bring us into our inn at the same hour in the afternoon after we were reposed a little beau shined again as yesterday and waited upon me to eveningprayers i need say nothing to you of salisbury cathedral if in a foreign country as the lady in her letters of spain the countess d annoiss travels into spain i could entertain you with a noble description but you have either seen or may see it and so i will spare my architecture there are abundance of pretty innocentlooked women genteel enough but i have lost my heart to ahandsome churchman i never thought before that dress was tolerable but so wore it seems a mighty ornament he was placed behind me but i turned my devotion and kneeled to him imagining him no less than as in antique days some high priest of the sun the canon gave me cause to think he had dined too well and was obliged to his snuff more than religion for keeping him awake well devotion done i was forced to break up mine and leave him without a knowledge of his conquest as we were walking to our inn i asked beau what we should do to pass the next day without being very weary of each other for sunday does not permit traveling he you may be sure did not fail to tell me he could never be weary of me though himself expiring by my sight and cruelty i waved his compliment and told him my design of engaging the people in the exeter coach if they seemed worth it to live with us for the time when we returned we were told it was not yet come in occasioned by the breaking of the axletree five miles off but that a fellow was gone to mend it and they were expected every moment my chamberwindow answered the court i rose to it at the noise of the coach and presently saw alight a tall blustering bigbond raw thing like an overgrown schoolboy but conceited above any thing he had an appurtenance called a wife whom he suffered to get out as well as she could as long as he had lain by her he did not think her worth the civility of his hand she seemed a giant of a woman but very fine with a right cits air he blustered presently for the best lodging which he saw taken up by her that held the fine fan before her face you may guess this was your humble servant the chamberlain told him it was their custom first come first served but that there were very good chambers besides the rest of the company were two things that looked pert and awkward tradesmens daughters i judged them but methoughts casting my eyes upon a gentlewoman and her servant that came out last i found something pleased me whether it were because she really deserved it or that the stuff she was with set her off i had a basin of fine heartcherries before me just come from the garden i caused them to be brought after me into the gallery and designed them as a bait to the woman whom i was to begin the acquaintance with for beau designed to set up to get a fortune in devonshire and was unwilling to show any irregularity and i thought myself above their reflections the first that appeared was the wife with a rising belly this seemed a good hint i offered them to her not knowing but she might long the sight i suppose did not displease her for she readily accepted and eat very greedily the genteellooked lady had much to do to be persuaded as for the other two they were gone to choose a lodging we presently grew acquainted taking travelers liberty and supped together but shall i tell you the wife grew jealous of me it seems her temper was such and her husband no small man in his country though himself just set up in merchandising at london his father one of the canons at exeter thought he might carry all hearts before him as well as the countrylasses they were come from visiting their friends and returning to their house in london mrs stanhope for that was the ladys name whom i liked told me i was not to count upon the conquest for he had given her douceurs all the way and made her extreme uneasy because his wife appeared to be such we grew into an intimacy and left the company my beau was to me faithless and inconstant one of the awkward little things i told you of and who had a tolerable face was a goldsmiths daughter of exeter and acquainted with his ladysister that began their acquaintance she seemed free and fond he took the hint and applied himself to her which i was very glad of mrs stanhope went with me to my chamber and after much discourse offered friendship and mutual knowledge of each other she gave me this account of her last adventure  i came now from falmouth says she where i have been ever since the beginning of the spring to visit a brother and his wife who live there until within these six weeks i saw nothing that pleased me at last it was a captain of a man of war had the chance my brother brought him to his house and for my excuse i must tell you he is a very pretty genteel young gentleman of a good family and education and in prospect of coming to very good fortune they talked of the town and country beauties at last a young creature was named whom i had not seen but the captain set her before every thing he had i was concerned at his opinion and asked him his of the duchess of grafton he gave her due praise but yet in his esteem this exceeded i could not but think him extremely in the wrong and was angry when i heard him wish himself a man of mighty fortune to deserve her he sailed that night and after ten days cruise came in again his first visit was to me i asked him if he had seen his mistress he said he had none i remembered him of what he had spoke he answered that i had taught him better he continued his applications visited me three times a day and because i was still jealous of his words i had him watched and an account brought of all his visits the young ladys uncle made a ball but because my brother and he were not well together there was no hopes of my being invited which my lover very well knew and therefore said he would not be there having received orders to sail he took his leave with transporting sorrow and had the glory to find mine was real however i would not lose the ball because i desired to see my reputed rival i forgot to tell you he had never seen her but once when he praised her to that degree and dexterously told me a second sight had undeceived him i dressed myself like a farmers wife with a basket on my arm and by the help of one of the servants was placed like a country gazer at the corner of the room i needed not to be told my rival a thousand dazzling charms distinguished her and though i looked with jealous eyes must acknowledge i never saw any beauty more perfect all my hopes lay in a certain softness which did not promise much wit in a little time my traitor whom i imagined in the wide ocean came to the ball danced with his mistress and was as assiduous as she deserved i was so well pleased at the discovery i stayed not for any more for fear i should not escape myself about midnight he came for a minute to see me and told me he was just come ashore the ship under sail yet without another sight it was impossible for him to depart i confounded him with telling him what had so lately passed at the ball yet he drew himself out of the embarrass and said every thing to make me think he loved me and we were seriously treating upon the affair of matrimony i told him he must get my fathers consent who lived at london where i was going he begged me to defer my journey till he came in which i too readily promised and so we parted i knew my fortune fairer than my rivals and began to be persuaded i had the better of her for what else could draw him to address me when i saw him return it was with mutual joy but he was ordered that same night to sail to plymouth and did not expect to be back in a week therefore we agreed upon my journey he swore an inviolable love and would have contracted himself if i durst without my fathers consent he intended to write to his friends above to ask it and thus we once more parted but not till he had severely exclaimed against any designs upon my rival before a whole crew of towngossips that i was sure would tell her you may conclude we agreed upon writing i took my journey and stayed at an aunts house in exeter ten days where i heard that within four of my departure my lover returned and in three more was publicly married to my rival i wrote to thank him for ridding me of a knavish husband wished him joy took coach and resolved against too easily believing any man again  the post has just brought me a letter from you i find you curse me with the continuation of egham uneasiness till i return to the world in london methinks it is unreasonable to impose the continued slavery of writing i assure you i shall take truce with it till at my journeys end unless something happen worth your notice general talmashs body was brought in here this evening his secretary i am acquainted with and have sent to desire the favor of his company tomorrow at dinner and if any thing in his relation be entertaining you shall not fail of it from  your sincere faithful servant dm saturday night from salisbury letter v the account of so great a mans death as general talmash this fine gentleman died of his wounds at portsmouth which he received in the unfortunate expedition before breast anno      in the middle of all his enterprises when fortune seemed to promise him much greener laurels than he had yet gathered has so added to my melancholy that i will not describe his misfortune to you for fear it be contagious but rather suffer you to expect the public account for i am one of those that esteem you more than to make you uneasy as i think none can be otherwise that hears the particulars of his loss something there was extremely touching  after this doleful subject methinks my beau may justly complain i have so long a time neglected his most singular self we parted this morning from our sunday acquaintance fop told me when i gently reproached him for inconstancy gad madam it is but to make myself the newer to your ladyship tomorrow i rather thought it was to keep me such to him he has given me a relation of his success with the damsel she treated him in her chamber with rosa solis and what he calls sucket the rest he could willingly have acquainted me with but i recommended discretion in ladies affairs and he almost bursting is yet forced to be silent how long he will keep such i do not know for he has often offered at breaking his most painful penance we have passed dorchester and blandford today but i found nothing in either place worth your notice the toils of the body influence the mind i suppose by my dullness you find i speak woeful truths we are lodged at bridgeport and very ill but it is but for a night here is just come into the inn an acquaintance of beaus who promises yielding matter for tomorrows letter this was infected in the beginning by general talmash and the most uneasy journey as dully concludes it  your ever constant and obliged servant dm bridgeport june    letter vi beau is now grown so insipid that i shall say very little of him for the future and i have reason to believe myself such to him for these two last evenings contrary to custom he has not redressed the fatigue which he seems more sensible of than any of us has tarnished the luster of his eyes and instead of any farther ogleing drowns all his amorous pretensions in as profound sleep as the uneasy jolting of the coach will permit this is what i can never be so happy to gain but to tell you something of our last nights entertainment whilst supper was getting ready the gentleman i told you of at beaus entreaty gave us an account of what affairs were carrying him to london the short of it is this  your ladyship says he may soon perceive by my accent that i am a foreigner i had the glory of following the prince of orange now our auspicious king in his expedition into england we landed in the west with all those particulars which are needless to repeat during our stay at exeter i rendered my constant devotion at the cathedral and in coming thence one evening an old woman with a look as mean as a beggar presented me a letter which when i had opened i found from an unknown who styled himself my friend and gave me this advice that a lady of good countryquality and fortune and who was then in exeter was going to be disposed of by her mother to a man she no way affected but that she had been heard to say if the handsome switzer were in his place she should obey without reluctance and concluded the letter with giving me advice like a good friend to improve my growing fortune for so considerable an one as twelve thousand pounds was not every day thrown into a soldiers lap i had forgot to tell your ladyship the letter was writ in french the ladys name and directions to her lodgings my heart gave me a secret presage that the matter would not be lucky to me which i followed and therefore took no notice of the letter three days after the same old woman brought me another much more pressing upon which i gave myself blindly up to my destiny i visited and found the lady though not a beauty yet genteel and taking it was easy to guess by my reception that the letters came from her i will omit the discourse we had and only rest upon matter of fact she obliged me to leave my command and go with her to her estate her mother looked upon me with an evil eye but my mistress was transportingly kind and much concerned that none of the ministers round durst marry us for fear of the old lady whereupon we concluded i should pretend to take my leave as desingning for london but instead of that go directly into cornwall where she had a considerable estate and would meet me the matter happened as we agreed but for fear her mother should pursue us she consented to take me for her husband before the parson could be got to make us such that happy night i had all the reason in the world to believe myself agreeable to her and all was confirmed in the morning by the priest thus caressed and blessed we returned to her house the old lady who had no command of her daughters fortune and saw the business beyond remedy was one of the first to make her court to me and wish me joy three happy months i had all the satisfaction that innocent marriage and excessive love in a bride could give me then i began to consider a little my affairs and proposed to my wife my being naturalized that i might look after hers she swooned at the name and when she recovered she snatched a bayonet of mine and wounded herself under the left breast but not much i cannot express my surprise we hushed the matter for fear of her mother and i employed some of my soldiery skill to cure it which had the effect i enquired into the reason of this extravagancy she told me the discovery of interest in me when she had believed love was the only motive of our marriage some days passed and as often as i offered at it she received such mighty disgust that i resolved to get it done without her notice for she took me not as a husband but a lover it was true i was received as a guest but not a master and my circumstance having left my command required that i got her leave for my journey she showed such extravagant passion at our separation that i swore a speedy return and resolved to leave my naturalization depending look after my other affairs and return within a fortnight to her but before that time i had a dangerous fit of sickness at london i wrote often to her and gave her an account that the act was passed and i could now happily call myself an english husband she only answered she knew how to interpret it but she was out in her cunning if i should find an english wife at my service who knew not the true value and use of one this letter damped me but trusting to the greatness of that power love had given me in her heart i did not question but my presence would make all things easy i took post my impatience would not stay the coach though the remains of my fever seemed to expect it i gave myself no rest during the whole journey i sent to give her notice of my arrival but what was my surprise to find all shut at home i called under her window where i perceived light it was a heavy night of rain i knocked at the gates and stormed but all to no purpose i was glad to take up my lodging in the porch at six in the morning an underservant appeared i asked for her lady she told me she was gone none knew whether and had conveyed away her plate etc so that if i pleased an empty house was at my service i calmly bore all this imagining it but a trial sought her round the country but in vain she often shifted places and went disguised not long after she commenced a process against me and by a pretense which will for ever make her notorious rendered me to the court as incapable i was still so tender of her fame as to suffer the aspersion common law separted us she got the better by my refusing to vindicate myself and i fifteen hundred pounds of her fortune and the charges of the court it is since last august that this has happened i have vainly tried to remove her implacable aversion or to learn the cause of it but i see my endeavors are all fruitless and i am now going to leave england i think for ever  i complimented him upon his misfortunes and really in my opinion he could not be deserving of them gad madam  says beau see what inconstant things you ladies are i happened to be at this gentlemans house when he was first married and never saw any thing so fond of him as his wife gad i do not believe whatever woman i make happy though her esteem be equal to my merit she can possibly be fonder  i am now got safely weary into exeter and i thank god rid of the impertinency of my fellowtravellers beau excepted who will see me safe home though distant from his the cathedral here is very fine the bishops seat in it surpasses salisbury though short in every thing else forgive me for leaving you thus abruptly since it is more pleasingly to entertain myself with a letter of yours just brought to me  i am most constantly and sincerely yours dm exeter june    letter vii if i have omitted answering your three last it proceeded from nothing but the desire of doing something new and you know it is extremely so in me not eagerly to show you all testimonies of friendship my solitude is much more pleasing than i fancied it as yet i am not weary of that happy indifferency which leaves me nothing either to hope or fear  thus empty and thus idle do i live nor loved nor loving can nor take nor give i have most foppish letters from beau who parted with a world of seeming regret and yet i hear he is endeavoring at a mistress i suppose i may bid his impertinence farewell for ever i think i bid you hope in one of mine to hear no more of him i know not how i am fallen upon the nauseous repetition themistocles refused simonides when he would have taught him the art of memory pertinently saying he had more need of forgetfulness than memory i remember what i would not but i cannot forget what i would my study has fallen upon religion i am searching into all sorts you shall not fail to hear what that chancemedley produces i can now with cold indifferency shake hands with all things beyond this solitude how long the extraordinary humor may last i cannot inform you at present i repeat with stoical pride keep me ye bounteous gods my cave and wood in peace let tares and acorns be my food   yours etc dm july  0      letter viii i am sorry i cannot make good my promise to so indearing a friend as yourself looking over my papers i find but one of colonel packs letters in imitation of the portugal nuns i certainly had three which he sent to me for my opinion but two are lost which i very much regret and the more because i know not where he is to repair it i would hear how you approve his style i think imitation the hardest part of writing it confines a freeborn genius which naturally loves untrod wilds at least if i may guess at anothers by my own and now i am speaking of that let me tell you all those romantic ideas of retirement which viewed at a distance give a ravishing prospect now i am wedded and bedded to prove the worst sort of matrimony but it is only to such a particular friend as yourself that i dare complain to the remoter sort i assume a stoical appetite and air  tell them the world with all its gaudy pleasures are but rich delusions which at once corrupt our senses and our fame that the little spot of earth i have chose to fix my fate in has more solid entertainments more real innate delights than the glories of a court then sigh and seem to pity the more elevated part of the world that can bury themselves in noise and crowd but let me tell you there is no real satisfaction without conversation i have had so much of the dead since i settled here and as i may say nothing of the living for i find none deserves the name that i wish for the conjuring art and would rather converse with the ghosts of the departed than always with their books or with myself but i forget i detain you from better company i mean the enclosed write to me still but nothing of news i desire to hear none till i see london again and when that will be i have not the pleasure so much as to imagine it will be new to lie forgotten and forgetting and as it were be born with understanding to all the vanities and virtues if any of that hydra  i am sir withgreat esteem your most obedient servant dm march          ps i enclose colonel packs imitation of the nuns love letters to a cavalier    a letter from a nun in portugal to a gentleman in france oh my fled heart and he that so unjustly keeps it from me was not your barbarous resolution sufficient that i should never possess yours but you must add the use of all your best art to keep me from my own in what disorder do i speak and write for want of a poor tender heart that is gone a pilgrimage to love and the unkind heavens not hearing its prayer has through distraction lost its way and never will return again fire fets on fire why then does not my flame make you burn it is a false maxim extremity of cold scorches had i at first put on a behavior more cool and remote to your pretended affection and treated you with unkindness how many bows and vows would you have offered at lovesaltar with what ardency would you have continued your protestations who would have thought that a fire at first so well kindled as yours should need fanning with an infectious blast to preserve its heat or that the wholesome sun should put it out but that alas was my misfortune my burning was the greater and drew yours away  how can i then with any confidence blame you for what i myself was truly and principally the occasion of you too easily perceived how earnestly i was wont to watch your eyes that they looked not on others as if mine took it unkindly they were not gazed on altogether how perverse are our fates why else was it not contrived that you might be as happy in me as it was possible for me to be in you say what you will you was to blame what care you took to assault my affections was sufficiently discoverable in the constant ardour and formality of your approaches contriving to appear at all times as engaging as possible your conquest was not so great you could not well have met with a heart less fortified for a defense ye gods that i should yield upon your very first summons and so dishonourably that i was not allowed flying colors nay what is yet more that i should bear so mean so low and so contemptible a spirit as to take infinitely more delight in my own captivity and vassallage than in the most flourishing tranquillity what do i thus rave upon what would i have if i am happy in my condition why do i not rest and retain my senses like others of my sex but that still and i fear ever i have the same sad tune to sing  my conqueror whom i adored for being so is gone and my cloister is now as much a prison to me as it was heaven and liberty and all things when i had him there it was an unworthy thing to steal my better part my soul away and not think this little frame its old companion worth taking with you but what you had got you thought was of light carriage needed little stowage paid no freight and i dare stake my life was the all you ever intended to have of me and to be so served is it seems the all i am ever likely to expect from you how grossly did i flatter myself and abuse you whenever i imagined you would be kind and true to me you that are so cruel that could you reduce any other woman into my ill circumstances if there was a third in the world you would certainly leave the former and there feign fresh adorations if there was not yet purely to gratify your inhumanity to her even i now slighted and neglected should then have your company for you could not brook being put by a pleasure of that kind though it cost you the trouble of going to one who loved you more than the world  how very odd and as though you were writing to some public place of intelligence was that discourse of yours in your last letter concerning the great lightning and thunder which you say happened in your parts also you desire to know what weather we have had here are these proper enquiries for a loveletter truly it might have thundered lightened and rained or it might have been very pleasant delightful weather for aught i know for i am not capable of making any remarks of that kind but this i can inform you being too sure of the truth of it that it has been very stormy weather in my eyes ever since your departure and until you return the only sun whose influence can disperse these clouds i fear it will ever be tempestuous this account it may be pleases you more than if i had sent you word the ill weather had reached our country demolished our monastery set me at liberty and i was in pursuit of you then then how i would glut my revenge by the incursions of my love for it should hunt you in all places and all countries and since it wore so much the visage of an evil spirit in your conceit here as to make you quit the spot i would try whether change of air would alter its complexion and features so as to force you into a better opinion of it and be thoroughly revenged on you that way for to love i find is the unhappiness you would avoid above all other things but your appetite and taste is as much depraved as my project is vain and impracticable i find the sour of france gratifies your palate above the sweets of portugal and a french lady with her distant regards to your address and at last counterfeit artificial acceptance shall engage you much more than the loyalty integrity truth and freedom of my unlimited passion will not the world swear we are both mad you for preferring a counterfeit because it glisters before the true metal itself which is known to every child by its weight i for my fidelity to so much ingratitude but let the world blame us as it pleases i am resolved to be as true to you as you to your natural inconstancy to what a degree of bliss should i be advanced if i could find you complaining of the remissness of my love and admiring the intenseness of your own then i should be but too happy if that fault was not found on your side as alas to all the world too visibly it is and the same conceptions you make of an immensity will but just serve you to fathom my zeal which although cherished and pruned after the most careful manner is productive of nothing but the most bitter sour and unpleasant fruits imaginable  your unkind dealings and actions to me are the fruits of my extraordinary passion what soul could imagine such dissonant notes should strike to interrupt the harmony of my affection in what had you been the worse had you retaliated my extreme kindness with but a little of yours and although more than a little be my due yet with the least grain i could have wrought my own contentment but you are so unjust to deny all and leave me to a racking and a miserable despair one hours torment of which i would not wish you should endure ages to come to be set free myself and yet no otherwise fond of my condition but as it is a gift of yours and which for any thing less than your love i will never part with o barbarous barbarous man to deny me that which you take more pains to throw away upon another than i can do to obtain it you shall not use me thus indeed you must not it is i say it but you regard not that so insensible are you of my condition which though never so unfortunate as to my own particular yet is aggravated with cares for your welfare who are the sole cause of my unhappiness how you will relish this letter i know not i fear you will think there are too many invectives against your tyranny in which i will agree with you myself and ask your forgiveness but alas they are as gentle as i could possibly persuade my pen to drop for since you take so much pleasure in a hard heart i would not for the world any ways cross you by making you less obdurate so tenderly i value your satisfaction and so little for your sake my own but oh the infinite pleasures you would find in love if you thought them worth the looking after love as it is or is not mutual is the truest epitome of the supernatural states if mutual the joys are lasting and never cloy if not the torments are intolerable yet must be endured oh that any thing i could say might dissolve you to a sense of my miserable life or indeed rather your own and yet if it could in the least enter into my thoughts that you are altogether at repose i assure you i would never interrupt you no noise of my afflictions should ever be your disturbance but i am very much mistaken if you are altogether without remorse for the sufferings you have brought upon me i remember you once was flexible and of a compassionate nature and your behavior very like a gentleman whatever has misguided you to the abuse of my favors which if i have knowledge of my heart were at first much more for your sake than my own you were the aggressor and not i and whatever kindness i showed you was more to make me happy than yourself that by charity to a serpent i at last was stung it is said that venomous creatures have a balsamic quality in themselves to cure the wounds they make but you more unnatural than all the rest have none at least most cruelly you withhold it from me oh heaven that i had but power to contain myself that i had but temper to be a little calm but it is a condition i have long since abandoned and till i see you again will never reassume in the rage i am in i could think in you as many unkindnesses as by and by the fury of love would find a task to unravel for if one half hour i blame you in the next i call it injustice so careful am i that no ill thought of you appear deserving that were you worse than you are my pleasure would consist in being flattered that you are better than i think you nay sometimes i persuade myself that you are a man of the greatest justice in the world and that it is not even in your nature wilfully to do an unequal thing but it is most certain i am doomed to a fruitless love without the least possibility of a deliverance indeed formerly i had a faint prospect as i thought of being in some measure restored but i looked through false optics that presented me with a wrong object and since that i have done the great work of learning to be well satisfied with my intolerable condition did my love run parallel with what is commonly found in the world it would not be so desperate  happy they who in a pet or upon some small disgust can recede from their passions and set up for new ones elsewhere and whatever they pretend selfinterest is the greatest thing this is the way of amouring most in fashion this is that imposture which prevails upon so many tender hearts and in cases of denial very artificially can usurp languishing eyes want no expressive insinuations counterfeit melancholy and distraction and all to serve some base byeend if this had been the quality of my love the vengeance you assign me had then been merited i verily believe if it had had but the least tincture of treachery i should have won your heart should have made you jealous and that temper would have been very inconsistent with your resolutions to make a thorough conquest nothing less than which to a man of prowess like you could have been a real pleasure yes yes it is very plain if my passion had been forged and bore a false accent it would certainly much better have agreed with yours as being much nearer related but the fatal consequence of a true fervency returned with fair assurances and foul actions none knows but the wretched solitary i upon the whole i think verily i love you because you make me miserable if that be true go on be signalized to the world for your unkindness that the more i may be so for my unaccountable affection that i love you heaven knows you know else i should see you here again cringing out the feigned allegations of your sincerity though much more distant than we are o that we were to begin again what course would i then take i fear even fool myself as i have done for since i know no greater pleasure than the love of you i should too willingly run the risque of any disadvantage that could happen by it i die a thousand deaths every hour and still revive to die them over again adieu what could i not endure for your sake i have at this moment so lively an idea of you that i almost fancy you here in person methinks how very kind you are how affectionately you condole me for the torments i have suffered in your absence and how thankful i am to you for them how you press my hand and swear you will never part with me and ah monsieur how i believe you for being hitherto so faithful  once more adieu i think i never writ letters to you in my life but their length made them stayed for the post at my request has waited a great while and i am now sent to i wonder else when i should give over you may judge a little of my condition when you see even hurryingposthaste itself can admit of a delay to please me the actions of all people that see me are designedly kind and of a desire to divert me one takes me by the hand begging of me to be cheerful and leave my unprofitable thinking showing me good reason for it but alas i find reason and love two very separate things not at all influencing each other today a sister brought me variety of the best fruits of which nothing but a piece of a pomgranate could i be persuaded to eat i might thank her but i am not sure i had so much manners every body excuses my ill breeding but much wonder at my alteration the rigor and severity of our religion can dispense with many great faults in me that it will not allow in others what shall i do well i have only one thing more besides a thousand to say to you which is that if you can have regard for any one sentence in this long letter it may be to this last i implore you to let me see you in portugal before i die adieu adieu  sophia  portrait of

other for my king and my country  i cannot bear living under the reproach of lying obscure and idle in a country retirement when every man who has the least sense of honor should be preparing for the field  you may remember sir with what reluctance i submitted to your commands upon monmouths rebellion when no importunity could prevail with you to permit me to leave the academy i was too young to be hazarded but give me leave to say it is glorious at any age to die for ones country and the sooner the nobler the sacrifice  i am now older by three years my uncle bathe was not so old when he was left among the slain at the battle of newbury nor you yourself sir when you make your escape from your tutors to join your brother at the defense of scilly  the same cause is now come round about again the king has been misled let those who have misled him be answerable for it nobody can deny but he is sacred in his own person and it is every honest mans duty to defend it  you are pleased to say it is yet doubtful if the hollanders are rash enough to make such an attempt but be that as it will i beg leave to insist upon it that i may be presented to his majesty as one whose utmost ambition it is to devote his life to his service and my countrys after the example of all my ancestors  the gentry assembled at york to agree upon the choice of representatives for the county have prepared an address to assure his majesty they are ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes for him upon this and all other occasions but at the same time they humbly beseech him to give them such magistrates as may be agreeable to the laws of the land for at present there is no authority to which they can legally submit  they have been beating for volunteers at york and the towns adjacent to supply the regiments at hull but nobody will list  by what i can hear every body wishes well to the king but they would be glad his ministers were hanged  the winds continue so contrary that no landing can be so soon as was apprehended therefore i may hope with your leave and assistance to be in readiness before any action can begin  i beseech you sir most humbly and most earnestly to add this one act of indulgence more to so many other testimonies which i have constantly received of your goodness and be pleased to believe me always with the utmost duty and submission sir  your most dutiful son and most obedient servant george granville nb the above letter was wrote before his lordship was    years old    to williamhenry earl of bathe etc at the camp in flanders sept        my dear lord whilst you are pursuing honor in the field in the earliest time of your life after the example of your ancestors i am commanded by the queen to let you know she has declared you her lord lieutenant of the county of cornwall the earl of rochester to act for you till you are of age  you will do well to write your most humble thanks to her majesty for so graciously remembering you unsollicited in your absence you should likewise do the same to my lord rochester for accepting the trouble  this my dear lord is a preparative to bring you upon the stage with some luster at your first appearance in the world you are placed at the head of a body of gentry entirely disposed in affection to you and your family you are born possessed of all those amiable qualities which cannot fail of fixing their hearts you have no other example to follow but to tread in the steps of your ancestors it is all that is hoped or desired from you  you are upon an uncommon foundation in that part of the world your ancestors for at least five hundred years never made any alliance male or female out of the western counties thus there is hardly a gentleman either in cornwall or devon but has some of your blood or you some of theirs i remember the first time i accompanied your grandfather into the west upon holding his parliament of tinners as warden of the stannaries when there was the most numerous appearance of gentry of both counties that had ever been remembered together i observed there was hardly any one but whom he called cousin and i could not but observe at the same time how well they were pleased with it let this be a lesson for you when it comes to your turn to appear amongst them nothing is more obliging than to seem to retain the memory of kindred and alliances though never so remote and by consequence nothing more disobliging than a forgetfulness of them which is always imputed to an affected disdainful superiority and pride  there is another particular in my opinion of no small consequence to the support of your interest which i would recommend to your imitation and that is to make stowe your principal residence i have heard your grandfather say if ever he lived to be possessed of newhall he would pull it down that your father might have no temptation to withdraw from the ancient seat of his family from the conquest to the restoration your ancestors constantly resided amongst their countrymen except when the public service called upon them to sacrifice their lives for it  stowe in my grandfathers time till the civil wars broke out was a kind of academy for all the young men of family in the country he provided himself with the best masters of all kinds for education and the children of his neighbors and friends shared the advantage with his own thus he in a manner became the father of his country and not only engaged the affection of the present generation but laid a foundation of friendship for posterity which is not worn out at this day  upon this foundation my lord you inherit friends without the trouble of making them and have only to preserve them an easy task for you to whom nature has been so liberal of every quality necessary to attract affection and gain the heart  i must tell you the generality of our countrymen have been always royalists you inherit too much loyal blood to like them the worse there is an old saying amongst them that a godolphin was never known to want wit a trelawney courage or a granville loyalty wit and courage are not to be mistaken and to give those families their due they still keep up to their character but it is the misfortune of loyalty not to be so clearly understood or defined in a country subject to revolutions what passes for loyalty today may be treason tomorrow but i make great difference between real and nominal treason in the quarrel of the houses of york and lancaster both sides were proclaimed traitors as the other prevailed even under cromwells usurpation all who adhered to the king were proclaimed traitors and suffered as such but this makes no alteration in the thing itself it may be enacted treason to call black black or white white but black will be black and white will be white in spite of all the legislators in the world  there can be no doubt about allegiance unless princes become tyrants and then they cease to be kings they will no longer be respected as gods vicegerents who violate the laws they were sworn to protect the preacher may tell us of passive obedience that tyrants are to be patiently suffered as scourges in the hands of a righteous god to chastise a sinful nation and to be submitted to like plagues famines and such like judgments from above such doctrine were it true could only serve to mislead illjudging princes into a false security men are not to be reasoned out of their senses human nature and selfpreservation will eternally arm against slavery and oppression  it is therefore not to be supposed that even the weakest prince would run that hazard unless seduced by advice wickedly palliated by evil counselors nero himself under the influence of a good ministry was the mildest the most gracious and best beloved of the emperors the most sanguinary the most profligate and the most abhorred under a bad one a prince may be deceived or mistaken in the choice of his favorites but he has this advantage he is sure to hear of it from the voice of the public if then he is deaf he seems to take upon himself the blame and odium of those actions which were chargeable before but upon his advisers  idle murmurs groundless discontents and pretended jealousies and fears the effect of private prejudice and resentments have been and will ever be under the wisest administrations we are pestered with them even now when we have a queen who is known to have nothing so much at heart as the contentment of her people these are transitory vapors which scatter at the first appearance of light the infection spreads no farther than a particular set of four splenetic enthusiasts in politics not worth minding or correcting universal discontent can never happen but from solid provocations  many wellmeaning persons however abounding in zeal have been often unwarily caught by popular pretenses and not undeceived till it was too late have a care my dear cousin of splitting upon that rock there have been false patriots as well as false prophets  to fear god and honor the king were injunctions so closely tacked together that they seem to make but one and the same command a man may as well pretend to be a good christian without fearing god as a good subject without honoring the king  deo patrice amicis was your greatgrandfather sir bevils motto in three words he has added to his example a rule which in following you can never err in any duty of life the brightest carriage and the gentlest disposition is part of the lord clarendons character of him so much of him you may have begun to show us already and the best wish i can make for you is to resemble him as much in all  but his untimely fate  my dear lord i am for ever etc george granville  to williamhenry earl of bathe at the camp in flanders      every living creature my dear lord is entitled to offices of humanity the distress even of an enemy should reconcile us to him if he thirsts give him drink if he hungers give him food overcome evil with good it is with this disposition i would have you enter into the exercise of that authority  lord lieutenant of cornwall with which her majesty has honored you over your countrymen let no body inspire you with partyprejudices and resentments let it be your business to reconcile differences and heal divisions and to restore if possible harmony and good neighborhood amongst them if then there should be any left to wish you ill make them ashamed and confounded with your goodness and moderation not that i would ever advise you to sacrifice one hair of the head of an old friend to your family to gain fifty new ones but if you can increase the number by curtesy and moderation it may be worth the trial  believe me my dear lord humanity and generosity make the best foundation to build a character upon a man may have birth and riches and power wit learning courage but without generosity it is impossible to be a great man whatever the rich and powerful may think of themselves whatever value they may set upon their abundance and grandeur they will find themselves but the more hated and despised for the ill use they make of it  you should look upon yourselves but as stewards and trustees for the distressed your overabundance is but a deposit for the use and relief of the unhappy you are answerable for all superfluities misspent it is not to be supposed that providence would have made such distinctions among men such unequal distributions but that they might endear themselves to one another by mutual helps and obligations gratitude is the surest cement of love friendship and society  there are indeed rules to be observed and measures to be kept in the distribution of favors we know who have both the power and inclination to do good but for want of judgment in the direction they pass only for goodnatured fools instead of generous benefactors  my lord  will grudge a guinea to an honest gentleman in distress but readily give twenty to a common strumper another shall resuse to lend fifty pounds to his best friend without sufficient security and the next moment set his whole fortune upon a card or a die a chance for which he can have no security my lord  is to be seen every day at a toyshop squandring away his money in trinkets and baubles and at the same time leaves his brothers and sisters without common necessaries  generosity does not consist in a contempt of money in throwing it away at random without judgment or distinction though that indeed is better than locking it up for multitudes have the benefit of it but in a right disposition to proper objects in proportion to the merit the circumstances the rank and condition of those who stand in need of our service  princes are more exposed than any others to the misplacing their favors merit is ever modest and keeps its distance the forward and importunate stand always nearest in sight and are not to be put out of countenance nor thrust out of the way  i remember to have heard a saying of the late king james that be never knew a modest man make his way in a court david floyd whom you know being then in waiting at his majestys elbow replied bluntly pray sir whose faults that the king stood corrected and was silent if princes could see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears what a happy situation it would be both for themselves and their subjects to reward merit to redress the injured to relieve the oppressed to raise the modest to humble the insolent what a godlike prerogative were a right use made of it  how happy are you my dear lord who are born with such generous inclinations with judgment to direct them and the means to indulge them of all men most miserable is he who has the inclination without the means to meet with a deserving object of compassion without having the power to give relief of all the circumstances in life is the most disagreeable to have the power is the greatest pleasure  methinks i see you ready to cry out good cousin why this discourse to me what occasion have i for these lectures none at all my dear lord i am only making my court to you by letting you see i think as you do  but one word more and i have done  in trust intimacy and confidence be as particular as you please in humanity charity and benevolence universal  i am for ever etc george granville  to my nephew mr bevil granville upon his entering into holy orders when i look upon the date of your last letter i must own myself blameable for not having sooner returned you my thanks for it  i approve very well of your resolution of dedicating yourself to the service of god you could not choose a better master provided you have so sufficiently searched your heart as to be persuaded you can serve him well in so doing you may secure to yourself many blessings in this world as well as a sure expectation in the next there is one thing which i perceive you have not thoroughly purged yourself from which is flattery you have bestowed so much of that upon me in your letter that i hope you have no more left and that you meant it only to take your leave of such flights of fancy which however well meant oftener put a man out of countenance than oblige him  you are now become a searcher after truth i shall hereafter take it more kindly to be justly reproved by you than to be undeservedly complimented  i would not have you understand me as if i recommended to you a sour presbyterian severity that is yet more to be avoided advice like physic should be so sweetened and prepared as to be made palatable or nature may be apt to revolt against it be always sincere but at the same time always polite be humble without descending from your character reprove and correct without offending good manners to be a cynick is as bad as to be a sycophant you are not to lay aside the gentleman with your sword nor to put on the gown to hide your birth and good breeding but to adorn it such has been the malice of the world from the beginning that pride avarice and ambition have been charged upon the priesthood in all ages in all countries and in all religions what they are most obliged to combat against in their pulpits they are most accused of encouraging in their conduct it behooves you therefore to be more upon your guard in this than in any other profession let your example confirm your doctrine and let no man ever have it in his power to reproach you with practicing contrary to what you preach  you had an uncle dr dennis granville dean of durham whose memory i shall ever revere make him your example sanctity sat so easy so unaffected and so graceful upon him that in him we beheld the very beauty of holiness he was as cheerful as familiar and condescending in his conversation as he was strict regular and exemplary in his piety as well bred and accomplished as a courtier as reverend and venerable as an apostle he was indeed in every thing apostolical for he abandoned all to follow his lord and master  may you resemble him may he revive in you may his spirit descend upon you as elijahs upon elisha and may the great god of heaven in guiding directing and strengthening your pious resolutions pour down his best and choicest blessings upon you  you shall ever find me dear nephew your most affectionate uncle and sincere friend etc  lansdowne  to the queen these verses were written by his lordship in the blank leaf of a copy of his works in   to presented to her majesty      he died anno       my muse expiring who with earliest voice made kings and queens king james and queen mary ii queen anne his myra ie the countess of newburgh etc  and beautys charms her choice alluding to his poem entitled the progress of beauty  now on her deathbed the last homage pays o queen to thee accept her dying lays so at the approach of death the cygnet tries to warble one note more and singing dies  hail mighty queen whose powerful smile alone commands obedience and secures the throne contending parties and plebeian rage had puzzled loyalty for half an age conquering our hearts you end the long dispute all that have eyes confess you absolute to tory doctrines even whigs resign and in your person own the right divine thus sung the muse in her last moment fired with carolinas praise and then expired lansdowne  a dialogue concerning women being a defense of the sex written to eugenia by william walsh esquire to the reader the perusal of this dialogue in defense of the fair sex written by a gentleman of my acquaintance much surprised me for it was not easy for me to imagine that one so young could have treated so nice a subject with so much judgment it is true i was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious and that he had improved himself by traveling and from thence i might reasonably have expected that air of gallantry which is so visibly diffused through the body of the work and is indeed the soul that animates all things of this nature but so much variety of reading both in ancient and modern authors such digestion of that reading so much justness of thought that it leaves no room for affectation or pedantry i may venture to say are not overcommon amongst practiced writers and very rarely to be found amongst beginners it puts me in mind of what was said of mr waller the father of our english numbers upon the sight of his first verses by the wits of the last age that he came out into the world forty thousand strong before they had heard of him here in imitation of my friends apostrophes i hope the reader need not be told that mr waller is only mentioned for honors sake that i am desirous of laying hold on his memory on all occasions and thereby acknowledging to the world that unless he had written none of us could write i know my friend will forgive me this digression for it is not only a copy of his style but of his candor the reader will observe that he is ready for all hints of commending merit and the writers of this age and country are particularly obliged to him for his pointing out those passages which the french call beaux endroits wherein they have most excelled and though i may seem in this to have my own interest in view because he has more than once mentioned me so much to my advantage yet i hope the reader will take it only for a parenthesis because the piece would have been very perfect without it i may be suffered to please myself with the kindness of my friend without valuing myself upon his partiality he had not confidence enough to send it out into the world without my opinion of it that it might pass securely at least amongst the fair readers for whose service it was principally designed i am not so presuming to think my opinion can either be his touchstone or his passport but i thought i might send him back to ariosto who has made it the business of almost thirty stanzas in the beginning of the   th book of his orlando furioso not only to praise that beautiful part of the creation but also to make a sharp satire on their enemies to give mankind their own and to tell them plainly that from their envy it proceeds that the virtue and great actions of women are purposely concealed and the failings of some few amongst them exposed with all the aggravating circumstances of malice for my own part who have always been their servant and have never drawn my pen against them i had rather see some of them praised extraordinarily than any of them suffer by detraction and that in this age and at this time particularly wherein i find more heroines than heroes let me therefore give them joy of their new champion if any will think me more partial to him than really i am they can only say i have returned his bribe and the worst i wish him is that he may receive justice from the men and favor only from the ladies  john dryden      some account of william walsh esquire the author of the following excellent treatise was  athen oxon vol ii page   0  edit ult william walsh esquire son of joseph walsh of abberley in worcestershire he became a gentlemancommoner of wadhamcollege oxford in easterterm      aged    years left it without a degree retired to his native country and sometimes to london he wrote a dialogue concerning women being a defense of the fair sex and addressed it to eugenia       he also wrote another small piece entitled letters and poems amorous and gallant         mr wood will have it that the lady characterized by mr walsh under the name of eugenia was his mistress for this he could not have any other ground than his own malevolent conjecture but that our author was a gentleman very susceptable of the soft passion appears plainly from his own pen sending forth his love letters and poems with the following address to the public go little book and to the world impart the faithful image of an amorous heart those who loves dear deluding pains have known may in my fatal stories read their own those who have lived from all its torments free may find the thing they never felt by me perhaps advised avoid the gilded bait and warned by my example shun my fate while with calm joy safe landed on the coast i view the waves on which i once was tossed love is a medley of endearments jars suspicions quarrels reconcilements wars then peace again o would it not be best to chase the fatal poison from our breast but since so few can live from passion free happy the man and only happy he who with such lucky stars begins his love that his cool judgment does his choice approve ill grounded passions quickly wear away what is built upon esteem can never decay   as for three amors i have had in my lifetime says mr walsh see his xxth letter to a friend  i valued the one mistress after i left loving her i loved another after i left valuing her i love and value the third after having lost all hopes of her so that methinks according to the course of my passions i ought to love and value the next after having obtained her however from this time forward upon what follies soever you fall be pleased for my sake to spare those of love being very well satisfied there is not one folly of that kind except marriage which i have not already committed i have been without railery in love with the beauty of a woman whom i have never seen with the wit of one whom i never heard speak nor seen any thing that she has written and with the heroic virtues of a woman without knowing any one action of her life that could make me think she had any  cupid will have it so and what can weak mortals do against so potent a god adieu live pleasantly that is philosophically and guard your heart from the pains of love such were the sentiments of our author when about thirty years of age  mr walsh pursued the advice he gave his friend and left cupid in the lurch wholly gave himself up to a literatum otium became one of the best of subjects to his sovereign king william whom he has immortalized in his inimitable version of that ode of horace begininng justum and tenacem propositi virum etc and his immortal successor queen anne constituted mr walsh her master of the horse  this gentleman was in the opinion of mr dryden see his postscript to his translat of virgil   the best critic of our nation in his time and mr pope speaking of the earl of roscomon thus concludes his essay on criticism viz to him the wit of greece and rome was known and every authors merit but his own such late was walsh the muses judge and friend who justly knew to blame or to commend to failings mild but zealous for desert the clearest head and the sincerest heart   in the year      the public were obliged with a small posthumous piece of mr walshs entitled aesculapius or the hospital of fools an imitation of lucian hereunto subjoined  a defense of the fair sex to eugenia it is a dangerous thing madam it must be confessed this conversing with fair ladies and it draws us into inconveniences of which we do not at first see the consequences i little thought when i talked with your ladyship of the virtues of your sex that you would have commanded me to have given my sentiments upon that subject in writing i grant you madam you might have spoken to several of your acquaintance who would have undertaken the business at first word with all the courage imaginable but to me who never durst take pen in hand to write any thing beyond a billet the enterprise seems very terrible i confess when you spoke to me of it first i was well enough pleased with the design for i thought a defense of the sex would be a means of obliging all of the sex who were worth defending and therefore looked upon it as the writing a circular loveletter to all the fair ladies in the kingdom but as men generally mix interest with honor so upon second thoughts i considered what i should get by it besides fame if it should succeed and i found if i persuaded all men to be as passionate servants to the ladies as myself i should make but a very indifferent hand of it thus madam you would engage me in a controversy where it would be a scandal to be vanquished and a disadvantage to overcome for i who could never succeed in an amor where there was any fool pretended besides myself should have great hopes indeed when i had persuaded all mankind to be my rivals after all madam there were your commands to encourge me to it and the commands of a fair lady are to me beyond all the arguments in nature i therefore resolved upon the undertaking but as it is no new thing to see people undertake a business that they are altogether unable to perform so i must own i found a thing of this nature quite beyond my strength you may believe madam i was very melancholy at it and it was then that a friend coming into my chamber asked me the occasion as i never love to conceal any thing that afflicts me from a friend so i presently told him the business that a lady had commanded me to write her a treatise in defense of women if that be all says he briskly i am come to your deliverance for this very morning have i been at a conversation where the question concerning the virtues and vices of that sex has been handled as fully as can be desired thou appearest to me my dear friend said i embracing him like my better genius and therefore without any farther ceremony sit down and give me an account of the conference  taking a walk says he this morning in st jamess park with several of my acquaintance there was one among the rest who was all the while either gazing upon the ladies as they came by or speaking with that indifference to us that made us very plainly see he did not mind the subject of our discourse though we talked of all the most considerable things that offer themselves in such conversations a very strange man this madam who was thinking upon some mistress i warrant when they were raising taxes and beating the french another who was a person of excellent sense and had a particular friendship for this though they would often dispute about their several thoughts of women in which point they could never agree i wonder they should dispute about that madam for the greatest disputes in those cases are when they do agree began to rally him upon this subject which he did so handsomely that he pleased the rest of the company very well without displeasing his friend in the least philogynes which was the name of the first as misogynes was of the other here madam i must confess i fancied my friend put false names upon me for besides that i remember neither of these families in england the one you must know signifies a womanhater and the other a womanlover cried to misogynes though i allow you to rally me as much as you please and am glad of any occasion i can give you to exercise a talent you possess in so eminent a degree yet i hope you do not in earnest think the conversation of women so ridiculous as you would make us believe ten times worse said misogynes than i can represent it and since we have often had slight skirmishes upon that occasion and we have now time enough to fight it out if you have the courage to lose one mornings gazing at them i challenge you to the private walk by the canalside to defend their cause and these gentlemen if they please shall be our judges though i am very unwilling answered philogynes to lose a morning that has called out all the best company of the town yet since it is in defense of the ladies and you so boldly challenge me i take you at your word upon condition that if i get the better in the judgment of these gentlemen you shall engage to be in love by tomorrow morning upon condition that if i overcome said misogynes you will engage to be out of love by the same time i agree that is no equal stake replied philogynes for it is to lay happiness against unhappiness however i am so well satisfied of my cause that i will undertake you even upon those odds  upon this agreement we walked all to the other side of the park full of expectation of the event of the debate when we were come thither we found we had the whole walk to ourselves and so misogynes who gave the challenge began in this manner  the propagation of mankind being the only way to preserve it from extinction and the copulation with women being the only means that nature has ordained to that end there is no doubt but all commonwealths ought to give any reasonable encouragements to it i have therefore always admired the wisdom of those governments that incited or compelled their subjects to marry as a thing so much more necessary to mankind in general than pleasing to any one in particular but that a man should out of a mere act of judgment run after women that he should find delight in their company is so very extraordinary that the wise men of old thought it hardly possible otherwise they had had no need of making such severe laws to force them to it as they did  your ladyship who is so well versed in greek and roman authors knows that amongst the plutarch in life of licurgus spartans they who lived long batchelors were condemned to ignominious punishments and debarred the privileges of other citizens that the strabo lib  0 cretans had a law to compel all the handsomest young men to marry as the diod sicul b   thurians had to invite them to it both by honors and rewards that ibid lib   and   plato ordains that whoever lived a bachelor to the five and thirtieth year of his age should be capable of no honor in his commonwealth and that the aul gell lib   cap   sueton in life of augustus dion in ibid lucius florus livy lib    romans did not only take all care imaginable to encourage people to marriage but frightened them into it by punishments if they refused  notwithstanding this had you a design of marrying them i should not altogether so much condemn you nay had you but a design of enjoying them without it there might be somewhat still alleged in your excuse how unjustifiable soever such a design may be as to the moral part the action itself is very agreeable to the natural but to pick them out only for the benefit of their conversation to fall in love with their understandings and to leave the company of wise men for handsome women is just the same thing as if you should choose rather to eat jays and parrots than woodcocks and partridges because the feathers of the former make the finer show  it is a very good as well as a very general way to guess at people by the company they keep and thus we may give a great judgment of the female sex by a view of those with whom they are the most pleased of our own well let them appear then what do you find fine coats large cravatstrings and good perriwigs i must own but for any thing else they and their perriwig blocks are critics alike it is true to do them justice they talk most learnedly of points and ribbons have most mathematical heads for the erecting of ladies topknots make as considerable figures talk as loud and laugh more than any in drawingrooms and playhouses and those who know nothing of their language would take them by their gestures to be the wittiest persons in christendom but if unluckily you understand them you will find it only false fire and that all this violent laughter is produced by no jest then take them out of their own element begin a discourse of any thing that is worth knowing they are dumb out of modesty no but they hate to talk of things that are grossier and the pedantry of scholars and gravity of men of business is utterly unfit for a gentleman  were it nothing but the company of such sort of creatures as these it would be enough i should think to frighten a man of sense from them can you see these fops as much as you are used to them without laughing except it rather makes you blush to think you should bring yourself into competition with such tools as they are i am far from blaming them for following the ladies they avoid the company of men who despise them for that of women who admire them nor do i find fault with the ladies for being pleased with them for since likeness they say breeds love what wonder is it they are fond of those men whose follies make them most like themselves but for a man who has some pretenses to wit and learning for one who might be acceptable to men of sense to run after them nay for a man who spends all the morning in the study of homer and aristotle to spend the afternoon among the impertinencies of women puts me in mind of the mountebank stages in naples where the jesuits and jackpuddings entertain the spectators by turns  it is possible you will say that all this makes for you that the faults of your rivals render your virtues the more remarkable and that there is no doubt but a man of merit may succeed in any place where a man of no merit may pretend but alas sir you deceive yourself very much if you encourage that opinion had you fit judges there is no doubt but you were in the right but if the fairest lady in christendom were amongst the indians where they paint the devil of her color do you expect they should do her beauty justice or if a slender man were among the muscovites do you think they would admire him for being well shaped where they thought none but bigbellyd men to be so credit me sir a man who leaves his parts to the judgment of women is very near the same circumstances will you not believe me in that case because i profess an enmity to them you do well but will you believe themselves view all the town take good notice among all the young heiresses who run away from their guardians is there any one who does it with a man of sense among all those widows who ruin themselves by second marriages is there any one who does it with a man of sense among all those ladies who cuckold their husbands is there any one who does it with a man of sense we see them do these things every day with chaplains dancingmasters butlers and footmen who are the men that show the tender billets received what are they who boast of the favors of all the finest women in town are they not the most despicable of mankind are they not such whose conversation is the jest of men of sense and have they above one thing about them that distinguishes them from the other sex  after all sir are not the women in the right in this point or do they ever show more judgment than when they pitch upon such men what do they look for in a husband but one who will admire them who will be governed by them and upon whom all their little tricks will pass and who but fools are fit for that what do they propose in a gallant but giving them pleasure without scandal and to the former part they have a received notion of the ability of fools then for the scandal who so likely to give none as those men whom the world will hardly believe were favored by them though they took their oaths upon it for notwithstanding experience teaches us the contrary yet people are apt to fancy a man of sense must succeed before a coxcomb and will rather believe the former are favored though they swear they are not than the latter though they swear they are  but alas sir men of sense they think know them and that they take as well as i do to be a sure means to hinder their being in love it was upon this account that chap   etc solomon gives such severe characters of them in his proverbs that v stobaei senten cap de vituperio mulierum euripides represented them so faithfully as to get the name of the womanhater that v stobaei senten cap de vituperio mulierum simonides has distinguished them into so many sorts of evil things that see the dialogues of the courtesans and that of love lucian has so naturally described their tricks that homily on the beheading st john baptist st chrysostom has made such a severe invective against them that satire  th juvenal has given his friend such counsel against having any thing to do with them and in fine it is upon the same account that all the epigrammatists comic poets and satirists are so continually exposing them to the world making their follies ridiculous and their vices odious it is upon the same account likewise that to call a man effeminate has always been reckoned such a reproach and that to say a man is governed by a woman has been one of the worst characters you could give of his understanding  see here a dreadful army madam against us i asked my friend what these gentlemen had said upon this occasion he told me juvenal had written a very severe satire the xith against women which i should see very much to its advantage if i would consult mr drydens translation of it for simonides he told me he had written iambics against them in which he divides them into ten sorts the first he said was descended from a sow you will find very noble families among them madam and she was sluttish the second from a fox and she understands every thing and has a great deal of good in her and a great deal of ill too the third from a dog and she is prying about and snarling at every body the fourth is made of the earth and she understands nothing but how to fill her belly and sit by the fireside the fifth of the sea and she is changeable and inconstant sometimes in a calm and then on a sudden in a storm the sixth is made of ashes and a laboring ass an odd composition you will say and she is scarce driven to her business with threatenings or force but crams herself night and day and lies with every one that comes now whether she takes this quality of lying with all who come from the fathersside or the mothersside i cannot absolutely determine the seventh was descended from a pole cat and she is nauseous and stinking the eighth from a mare and she never cares to do any work and minds nothing but appearing neat and fine the ninth from a monkey and her ugliness is a jest to every body the tenth from a be and she makes an excellent wife camerar hist med l   c    there is a story also of this simonides that being asked about a wife he said she was the shipwreck of man the tempest of a house the disturber of rest the prison of life a daily punishment a sumptuous conflict a beast in company a necessary evil and on matt chap xix st chrysostom besides the homily upon the beheading st john baptist which is almost all an invective against women says in another place what is a wife the enemy of love the inevitable pain the necessary evil the natural temptation a desirable calamity a domestical peril a pleasing damage thus you see these ancients madam had a very commendable faculty of calling names what think you might not the matrons of billinsgate improve in their conversation but it is natural when people cannot convince our reason to endeavor to move our passions  i know you will object against these anacreon theocritus catullus tibullus ovid horace propertius and all those poets and wits ancient and modern who pleased themselves whilst they lived in the pursuit of women and have rendered themselves immortal after their death by the trophies they raised to them it is confessed that spending their time upon the sex they ought to know them best but on the other side to excuse their own spending their time ought to represent them as favorably as possible and yet pray what is the account they give us of them do they not all with one consent complain either of the cruelty or falsehood of their mistresses are not their books full of quarrels picques and jealousies and do they not show the levity perjury and lewdness of the sex does not    od    anacreon and a hundred more tell you they mind nothing but wealth this

certainly they must have some very great perfections to make amends for all these faults well then let us see what they are let us view these pleasant comfits that are to make the poison go down let us enjoy a little of that conversation that is diversitive enough to make people neglect all their danger sit in one of their drawingrooms all day observe the discourse which passes is it not a tedious repetition of the same impertinencies over and over again to every new visitant and is not one half of that spent in censuring all the town and the other half in railing at those who censure do they not inveigh against the lampooners and at the same time talk as scandalously as they can write the horrid affectation the ridiculous vanity the gross dissimulation and the inveterate malice that appears in all their discourses are things for which i should think all the paint on their faces could not make amends for my own part i confess i have been fool enough to be in love too and have followed women upon that account but to another sort of end than you say you do but when that end was once satisfied to talk with them afterward was as great a penance to me as it would be to sit in a greasy cooks shop when my belly was full  this misogynes is a very rude fellow and i am sure your ladyship will be of my opinion that his last simile was very fulsome it is a sign he hates women for had he conversed with them they would have taught him better manners  but there are doubtless you will say women of understanding pray where are they is it your prudent woman your good housewife who is plaguing all the world with her management and instructing every body how to feed geese and capons or is it your politician who is always full of business who carries a secretary of states office in her head and is making her deep observations upon every days news or is it your learned woman who runs mad for the love of hard words who talks a mixed jargon or lingua franca and has spent a great deal of time to make her capable of talking nonsense in four or five several languages what think you sir do you not wish for your visitant again as the more tolerable folly of the two do not you think learning and politics become a woman as ill as riding astride and had not the duke of montagnes essays b   c    mad gournay legalite des deux sexes brittany reason who thought a woman knowing

maria schurman out of holland and think that in showing me three learned women in three thousand years you have gained your point and from some few particular instances proved a general conclusion if i should bring you half a dozen magpies that could talk and as many horses that could dance you would not i suppose for all that choose out the one to converse with or the other to walk a corant  but would you see them to their best advantage would you have their wit courage and conduct displayed take them upon the business of lust that can make sapho witty aloisia eloquent a countrywife politic

loena lucians time but is practiced frequently in see taverniers travels turkey at this day you cannot but be sensible sir that there is no necessity of going so far for instances of their lewdness and were it civil to quote the lampoons or write the amors of our own time we might be furnished with examples enough nearer home  here madam i could not forbear telling my friend that his disputant grew scurrilous he told me considering him as a womanhater he thought it was no more than his character required and that if i compared his discourse with what others had said against them i should think him a very wellbred man  after this to talk of their levity or babbling what were it but trifling all the lovers and poets who have had any thing to do with them can furnish themselves with instances enough of the first and any man who will give himself the trouble of reading any one history shall find instances enough of the other if his own wisdom has hindered him from making them at his own cost plutarch of garrulity there being a senate called in rome upon some very extraordinary occasion one of the senators was desired by his wife to tell her what it was he replied he was obliged to secrecy she swears it shall never be known to any one by her means upon that promise he informs her that there was a lark seen flying over the senate house with a golden helmet on his head and a spear in one of his claws and that they had thereupon called the soothsayers together to know what it portended no sooner was the husband gone but the wife tells it too under a vow of secrecy to her maid she to another who was her fellow servants who told it to her lover so that to be short it ran so fast that as soon as the senator came into the marketplace one took him aside and told it him for a great secret aways goes he and tells his wife she had undone him in divulging what he had trusted with her she denies it with a true feminine impudence how could it come to be known then says he alas replied she are there not three hundred senators and might it not come from any of them as well as you no says he for i invented it on a sudden to satisfy your curiosity and thus had i been served if i had trusted you with the secret it is such another story they tell us of young papirius to his mother who asking him what had been debated that morning in the senate told her they were making a law for men to have a plurality of wives but it is somewhat a more tragical relation plutarch gives of fulvius augustus complained to him that he was dissatisfied with what he had done in adopting livias sons and disinheriting his own nephews fulvius goes home and tells it his wife she tells it to the empress who upbraids the emperor with it augustus when he saw fulvius next checked him for it by which he perceived himself ruined and therefore went immediately told his wife what she had done and that he resolved to stab himself but certainly the wifes answer was very sufficient nor did you deserve less said she who having lived so long with me did not know i could not keep a secret  but omitting these whose actions are recorded to their infamy let us see a little of those who are quoted as the glories of their sex and who more cried up amongst them than jud xiii judith what action more celebrated than her murdering holofernes when he had treated her with all the kindness and respect imaginable in his tent for my part i must own my virtue does not arrive to so high a pitch and should rather have suffered my town to have been ruined than have been guilty of an action that appears to me so barbarous but i confess that of judges iv v    jael is yet worse to invite a man into her tent promise him protection and when he had trusted his life in her hands to murder him whilst he was asleep what shall we say to penelope who is instanced as a pattern of chastity and conjugal love i will not with penelope vires juvenum tentabat in arcu qui latus argueret corneus arcus erat ovid amor l   el   ovid and speaking of ulysses ad vetulam tamen ille suam properabat and omnis mens erat in cunno penelopea tuo quae sic casta manes ut jam convivia visas utque fututorum sit tua plena domus e quibus ut scires quicunque valentior esset haec es ad arrectos verba locuta procos nemo meo melius nervum tendebat ulysse sive illi laterum seu fuit artis opus qui quoniam periit modo vos intendite qualem esse virum sciero vir sit ut ille meus priapeia virgil if the priapeia are his make malicious reflections upon her trying her lovers strength in a bow but take the story as it lies in the odysses i am sure she would hardly pass for such a saint in our days and if a lady had her house full of lovers for twenty years of her husbands absence and if her husband were forced to fight all these before he could have his wife again it is possible the lampooners of the town would not have represented her case so favorably as homer has done but what shall we say to v domin in ovid el   l   see also senecas epistles lycophron even amongst the greeks who speaks of her as a most profligate sort of woman or to lilius giral hist deorum gent pan duris samius who asserts her to have been so very common as to have lain with all comers during her husbands absence from whose promiscuous copulations pan was born and therefore took the name  pan your ladyship knows in greek signifies all for lucretia i shall not insinuate as a sir charles sedley in his translation of ovids viiith elegy b   great wit seems to do that she stabbed herself rather than return to the embraces of a husband after having been so much better pleased by a gallant but if she were one who valued her chastity so much and her life so little as they would make us believe it is somewhat odd that she should rather let tarquin enjoy her alive than a slave lie in the bed with her when she was dead and that she should choose to commit the sin rather than bear the shame  but let us forgive them all these things i have mentioned and since lart de connoitre les hommes or art how to know men c   le chamber assures us that there is no beauty in a woman but what is a sign of some vice let us attribute it to natures fault not theirs and reckon that the more vicious they are the nearer they come to the perfection of the sex and indeed not spending much time in their conversations i will pardon them all their levity babbling malice and impertinence and being unmarried shall not be so severe upon their lusts and adulteries provided they will stop there let helen run away from her husband with a handsomer man but let her not suffer all troy to be ruined for the keeping her there let clytemnestra lie with another man during her husbands absence but let her not murder him for it when he comes home let diodor sicul b   semiramis make use of all the handsomest fellows of her army but let her not put them to death for fear they should tell tales and though i would forgive her yet her own sex would never pardon her being the first maker of ammian marcellin b    eunuchs let phaedra and fausta invite their husbands sons to supply their fathers defects but let them not accuse them and have them put to death for refusing let joan of naples make use of all the men in her kingdom but let her not strangle her hushand for his imperfections in a point that he could not help that cruelty and barbarity i confess is what provokes me so much against the sex i can see tibulluss mistress jilt him for a fool who is not half so handsome i can see ovid waiting all night at his mistresss door whilst another man is in her arms and i can see half a score impertinent women plaguing you with nonsensical stories and be very well diverted all the while but i confess i cannot hear of medeas cutting her brother in pieces and strewing his limbs in the way to stop her pursuing father without horror and dread nor of her treating her own children after the same manner to revenge herself upon jason without a like emotion i know not how other people may bear such things but for my part when i see all the murders and barbarities they commit to revenge themselves on their inconstant lovers to get rid of their husbands for some one they like better or to prevent the discovery of their lewdness but my hair stands on end my blood shrinks and i am possessed with an utter detestation of the sex go but one circuit with the judges here in england observe how many women are condemned for killing their bastard children and tell me if you think their cruelties can be equalled or whether you think those who commit such actions fit for your or for any civil conversation but i see by your looks you are convinced i see you abandon your cause and i shall cease to expose any farther a sex of whose patronage you seem already ashamed  here misogynes left off and phylogynes began to answer him but i must beg your pardon sir said my friend for my time is come and i must necessarily be gone the devil you shall said i you would engage me in a pretty affair i promise a lady a defense of her sex and you will make me send her a satire against it truly my dear friend said he i designed to have told you all but it is later than i thought and i have business waits for me no business said i can be so considerable to you as the satisfying a fair lady is to me therefore sit down and bring me fairly off what you have told me already or you and i shall be friends no longer after all madam to tell you the truth though there is no great matter in this speech of misogynes yet i can hardly believe he made it upon a sudden it is possible though they two having discoursed the matter as they told us before might have provided themselves each with arguments but supposing that i can scarce believe one man would be suffered to talk so long without interruption at least i am sure some who we know were none of the company but it is possible that he who told me might leave out all that was spoke by others for brevity sake being as you see in haste  if you are as apt to be mistaken in your judgment of things as of looks replied philogynes it is no wonder you should make such strange conclusions whatever seriousness you may see in my face does not i will assure you proceed from any distrust of my cause but an astonishment at what strange arguments the invention of man can suggest against the best things that are i say the invention of man for i am far from believing you in earnest in this point i have too just an opinion of misogynes to think he does any thing but put on this humor for a trial of skill and i no more believe you a hater of women for the invective you have made against them than i believe erasmus a lover of folly for the encomium he has writ upon it if you have therefore any thing more to urge forbear it not upon any supposed conviction you see in my countenance for notwithstanding that i think you have handled the subject as fully as any one who has undertaken it yet i will assure you i cannot submit to your arguments and therefore am very ready to hear any thing you have further to urge no says misogynes i am sensible i have troubled the company long enough about a trifle and it is very fit you should have your turn of speaking now part of the company was already convinced by his arguments the other part thought he had said as much as the matter would bear and therefore both agreed in desiring philogynes to speak what he had to say which he did in this manner  i confess sir said he smiling when i saw the associates you allotted me at first i began to despair of my cause i own i was ashamed of my company and resolved to pack up baggage instantly and quit a trade in which none but fops and fools were engaged but when i saw the anacreons the ovids and all the wits ancient and modern in the same circumstances i even took heart again courage said i the business is not so bad as i thought and it is possible his heart may relent and allow us some better company than he condemned us to at first at least thought i if it is a folly to converse with women it is some comfort that he owns it to be a folly of which the greatest wits of the world have been guilty before us and when i saw all greece and the greater part of asia venturing their lives for one woman i thought i had somewhat the advantage of them whilst i ventured nothing but my rhetoric for them all together and when you named samson achilles hannibal and mark anthony i enquired who those gentlemen were for certainly thought i if they were such brave men and great soldiers as i have heard them represented we have no reason to despair of the victory when we have them to lead us on  you might have spoken more generally of them too if you had pleased you might have told us that there never was a great soldier who was not as famous for his amors as his battles that a poet was scarce thought free of his trade who had not paid some duties to love cowleys preface  and you might have added to these all the wisemen and philosophers of the world you might have informed us that david though a man after gods own heart was not contented without some share in the womens that solomon who knew the virtue of every plant from the cedar of libanus to the hysop that grows upon the wall took as much pains to have as general a knowledge of the ladies that see diogenes laertius in his lives of these three philosophers socrates who was the ugliest as well as the wisest man of his time would in spite of nature aim at love too and not terrified by one ill wife would try to mend his hand in another that see diogenes laertius in his lives of these three philosophers plato whom antiquity has called divine did not spend all his time in erecting commonwealths but that some of it was bestowed upon the xantippes and archeanassas that see diogenes laertius in his lives of these three philosophers aristotle whom philip made governor to alexander made himself a slave to his mistress that this was not an effect of his passion alone but of his reason  diog laert in  aristot that he said love was not only upon the account of copulation but philosophy and commands his wiseman to be in love before he bids him meddle with the commonwealth and in fine that this great man who fathomed all arts and sciences who has given us the best rules of philosophy politics poetry etc did also not think it unbecoming his gravity to write one treatise of love and four amatory theses you might have mingled sacred story with profane you might have told us that st peter was married that st paul defended the leading about a sister that we owe one of the most celebrated st austin was converted by his mother fathers of the church to the endeavors and conversion of a woman and that st jerome had so great an esteem for the sex as to dedicate a great part of his works to some of them you might have added to these a thousand more which you see i purposely omit to avoid prolixity and mention none but whom you will allow to be the most celebrated of their profession without doing your cause and injury in the least for after all it is but showing us a drawing room of fops reading a dialogue out of lucian seeing a scene of a play quoting a sentence out of solomons proverbs searching all history for two or three ill women and the business is done the cause is gained let the trumpets sound and io poean be sung for the victory  i am sorry sir that i cannot be as civil to you as you have been to me it goes against my conscience to place you with so bad company considering with what you have obliged me and of those few great men whom you have seduced to your party i am concerned that i must take better part from you i fancy after what i have already said of solomon after reflecting upon his history you cannot think him a true friend to your cause and therefore will not i hope depend too much upon him i shall say nothing of his wives and concubines i shall not so much as mention his canticles which est autem  it is a dialogue between solomon and the king of egypts daughter two choruss one of young men the other of virgins who lay near the bedchamber speaking between the nuptial secrets lie hid here under modest words which was the cause the ancient hebrews would not suffer this book to be read but by those who were near marriage grot in canti grotius as well as i affirms to be a lovepoem and which rapin de carmine pastorali rapin reckons both the first and best of pastorals but i shall attack you at your own weapon i shall oppose proverb against proverb if he has been severe in them upon ill women whose cause i do not undertake he has spoken as favorably of the proverbs chap last etc wise and the good for whom we appear in like manner if euripides has represented women so in his tragedies as to get the name of the womanhater i appeal from his writings to his life and conversation which show him far otherwise if simonides gives you severe characters of several women he gives you one at last that makes amends for all one in whom no fault can be found and if you think that is not enough to take him off from your party if you are still so very fond of him we will tell you that men who are deformed and ugly as girald in vit simonidis plutatch in vit themistoclis simonides was naturally declare themselves enemies to women because they fancy women are enemies to them and upon that account not upon the account of his wit we will allow him to you as for st chrysostom though we have all the respect imaginable for a father of church and upon that account shall not enter into the merits of the cause betwixt v socrat schol sozomen evagr him and the empress eudoxia yet this we shall say sir that as fathers of the church are subject to passions as well as other men so it is no wonder that a man who is used very ill by one woman and converses with few else should conclude them all alike thus after having taken two of your patriots from you and if not taken at least disabled the other two from being very credible witnesses you are reduced to lucian and juvenal for the former if i should quote you what the old fathers say of him if i should tell you that he did not only abuse the christian religion but even his own that he rallied all the philosophers orators and historians of his time that not content with that he falls foul upon those his own religion taught him to worship as gods i fancy you would not think what such a man says of any great weight but truly sir there is no need of that in this case what does this lucian do pray why see the dialogues of the courtesans he describes the bawds griping covetous and encouraging their daughters in lewdness his courtesans false jilting and true courtesans throughout and what of all this pray what does this make for you it is not the cause of bawds or courtesans that we undertake though even amongst them he represents a great part easy loving goodnatured fools and used accordingly by their lovers but does lucian pretend that there are no good women does he fall upon the sex in general or does not he bring in in the dialogue of love charicles in one place defending them and does not he make the greatest encomium that can be of panthaea in another and speak with abundance of esteem of several other women in the same and if he does introduce callicratides in one of his dialogues railing at the sex in opposition to charicles he does it in the defense of a sin which i am sure you will scarce think it civil to name what shall we say to juvenal but what plato did to xenocrates bid him sacrifice to the graces he is always violent always declaiming always in a passion and what wonder if he falls upon the women in one of his fits after all you will make no great matter of him for if he has writ one satire upon the women he has writ fifteen upon the men for the comic poets and satirists whom you mention in general when you name them in particular i shall give them particular answers and now truly sir see yourself reduced to a miserable equipage some old husbands and jilted lovers some men with ill faces and worse miens may possibly stick to you still but that is all i am sorry to see a man so well made of so much wit and who has been so successful amongst the ladies rank himself with such a tribe but you do it i suppose by way of variety only and so let misogynes appear at the head of his regiment that makes a worse figure than sir john falstaffes let them be encouraged with stummed wine and muddy ale let them give fire to their mundungus and so let the battle begin whilst we with all the heroes wits and philosophers see how we can defend the cause we have undertaken  i am sensible sir that i have broken the order of your discourse and i beg your pardon for it but i thought it was necessary to distinguish our enemies from our friends before the armies joined that so we might know whom to attack and whom to spare and having done that i shall now confine myself to your method and follow the course that you please to lead me  though i perfectly agree with you in the esteem of the laws made for the encouragement of marriage and consequently cannot but regret the want of them amongst ourselves yet i must beg your pardon sir if i wholly dissent from you in the inference you would draw from it for it is very apparent to me and to any unbyassed person else i suppose that those laws were never made as you fancy for the forcing men to the love of women to which all countries were naturally enough inclined but for the restraining them to particulars that whilst they followed the general pleasures of the sex they might not lose the useful part which was the procreation of children had there been so few virtues amongst them as you please to imagine there had been no need of this when we have but one dish of meat that we like we fall upon that without any deliberation but when the fancy is distracted with variety of dainties we often lose more time in the making our choice than would otherwise be requisite to the satisfying our appetites  it is true sir it is a very good way to judge of people by the company they are fond of but it is not a certain way to judge of people by the company that is fond of them there was a tailor in love with queen elizabeth but it does not necessarily follow that queen elizabeth was in love with a tailor if there are ridiculous fellows who follow the ladies before we run down the ladies for it let us see if they do not laugh at them as well as we our selves and i cannot think their pursuing them any reason at all for men of sense to avoid them you would think it very hard that alexander and caesar should quit the art of war because some thrasoes and bragging bullies pretended to it as well as they and virgil and horace would take it very ill that you should damn all sorts of poetry because of the baviuss and maeviuss who set up for it and whatever reason you would give against the being a minister of state i dare say sir politic woudbees aiming at it would be none here philogynes seems to me not to understand the right use of that considerable part of mankind called fools for it is only the halfwit that is intolerable and a true fool is next a true wit the best company in the world for as a noble author has extremely well observed wit like terce claret when it begins to pall neglected lies ands of no use at all but in its full perfection of decay turns vinegar and comes again in play dorset  after this i need not tell you sir that it is very ill judging of people by their outside and as i laugh at those who like a man only for his being well dressed so i fancy you will allow them to be as ridiculous who run him down only for the same reason it was objected against diogenes laertius in vit aristot aristotle and plutarch in vit ciceronis cicero that they were too sumptuous in their apparel and overcurious in their dress and without doubt there were deep see verress jests upon cicero for his effeminacy plut critics in those times said they minded nothing but making themselves fine who yet without any offense to their learning we may suppose could not give so good an account of their studies as these two great men have done of theirs  courage there are two good precedents for the beaux  after all sir i know there are a great many of these gay coxcombs of these eternal pretenders to love and i have nothing to say in their behalf let them even shift for themselves amongst the thrasoes and baviuss but they do not only pretend you say they are successful too it is very possible sir i do not know but there may be fools enough of the other sex to like the fools of ours but it is with the best sort of women too you say that they succeed and who tells you so pray they themselves i swear sir though i have a very great esteem for those gentlemen yet i must beg their pardon for my faith in this point i can never think a woman whose wit we all allow can be fond of a man whose folly we all see on the other side i know how natural it is for every one to avoid contempt and when a man is despised in one place what so reasonable as to make you believe he is esteemed in another and i hope the gentlemen themselves will take it for a compliment when i tell them i do not believe a word they say in this point since certainly a man of honor would rather of the two tell a lie to the prejudice of a woman who uses him ill than a truth to the utter ruin of one who grants him all the favors he can ask  but let us judge them by their actions say you do not most of the young heiresses run away with the pitiful fellows if they do sir it should rather deserve your pity than your anger or if you must be angry be angry with the guardians whose severity frighten them away and yet hinders them the sight of any men of merit to run away with it is no wonder that one who has never seen any town but where he was born should think that the finest in the world and you cannot blame a woman for being in love with a man who does not deserve her if she never saw any who did all that we can reasonably expect in that point is that she should make some satisfaction when she sees the world better and if she shows her contempt of her choice then it is as much if not more than can be required in like manner you cannot say a widow makes an ill choice except you prove she was offered a better if a man who is obliged to ride a journey does it upon an ill horse you will be very well satisfied certainly when he tells you it is the best he could get i confess madam this seems to me but a very indifferent excuse for the widows for he would make us believe it is but next oars with them and so i told my friend but he replied i must consider it is only those widows who make an ill choice about which he is to speak and as he cannot say of them as of the young maids that it was for want of seeing the world so they must be contented with this excuse or make a better for themselves for the wives who you say cuckold their husbands there may be somewhat more to be said modesty being almost an inseparable quality of wit there is no wonder that a man who is possessed of that should so seldom succeed in these undertakings whilst fools by their natural impudence push on the thing and married women are a sort of forts that are sooner taken by storm than treaty so that this shows rather the great confidence of the man than the little judgment of the woman who it is forty to one had much rather a man of sense was possessed of her if he would take the same methods to gain her as the other had done  after all madam i think none of these excuses extraordinary therefore if i were worthy to advise the ladies they should rather make use of men of wit in all these capacities than put their friends to the trouble of inventing such pitiful defenses for them  now sir as i cannot see any reason why women should naturally love fools more than men of wit so i shall very hardly be brought to believe they do in a husband i suppose they propose a man whose conversation shall be agreeable as well as his person and who shall have wit to entertain them as well as wisdom to direct them and in whom can this be found but in men of the best sense if in a gallant as you say they propose pleasure without scandal it is very hard the heat that warms a mans brain should so entirely settle there as to render him incapable of pleasing them otherwise though it is possible by reason of his having variety of thoughts to divert him he may not give himself so entirely up to those pleasures as people less capable of thinking do and for the scandal who so proper to hinder that as those who have prudence to manage things so as not to be found out and wit enough to turn it off if they are whilst a fool by his want of sense shall quickly make the thing public if there be an intrigue or by his vanity brag of one though there be none add to this that when a woman seems pleased with a man of wit every body is apt to attribute it to the pleasure of his conversation whereas when she is fond of a man in whom we can see nothing to be liked we naturally suppose she likes him for something that we do not see and though it is possible it may be only want of judgment in the lady yet the world is apt to compliment her understanding in that case to the prejudice of her reputation and to conclude sir though i do not believe all those men successful who say they are not yet i am very much inclined to believe all those men not to be successful who say they are  for your examples of womenhaters i have sufficiently i think replied to them already and for your other arguments if it be an affront to call a man effeminate i hope you do not think it any great compliment to tell a woman she is masculine and had that argument been urged against you i dare answer for you you would have said that that only proved the perfections of the sexes different and as man was made for the ruder labors it was requisite he should be strong and coarse and the women being made for the easier things ought to be soft tender and delicate and as for mens being governed by their wives though the being hectored by them is not so commendable yet it v alex ab alex l   c   was observed by plutarch in vit cato cato of the romans that they governed all the world and that their wives governed them amongst the v leges connubiale assyrians it was a custom introduced by semiramis who had ruled that kingdom with so much glory that the wives should have dominion over the husbands the same custom prevailed likewise among the nicholaus  and from him stobaeus sermon    sauromatae and the diodor sieul l   egyptians had an express law to that purpose we know how much the aristot politic l   cap   spartans the bravest men of the world were commanded by their wives and that all the care and management of domestic affairs was committed to them so that i cannot imagine how a thing should be so very scandalous that was practiced by most of the bravest people under the sun  here are very good precedents for married women which it is to be hoped they will lay up in their hearts and practice in their lives and conversations  i have as great a veneration for those poets you mention as any man can and upon that account i shall not believe all the ill they say of their mistresses because i suppose they would not have me as i have been a lover myself so i know very well that people are apt in those cases to take suspicions for realities and surmises for matter of fact does not see the tragedy by mr dryden aurengzebe call indamora faithless and ingrate and yet i believe he would be very angry that you should call her so too and would not any one who came in when he was in one of his rants conclude a man who loved so well would not be enraged against a mistress at that rate unless her falsehood was very apparent and yet when we come to examine the cause of this disorder what is it but morats giving him his life at her request or his leaning upon her lap when he died i rather mention this than any of the poets you spoke of not only because all the motions and passions of a lover are described with as much art and delicacy as in any of those ancients but also that seeing the whole business before you you may judge of every little cause of his disorder as well as he himself which in odes and elegies you cannot do you see the lover there in a fury but what cause he has to be so there is no body to tell you but he who is in it add to this that a man often feigns jealousy of his mistress to binder her from being so of him and will upbraid her falsehood to defend his own that is a thing now i confess madam which i can hardly believe and it is evident they had not really any such bad opinion of women since with all this they did not cease to run after them however if you think these general answers not sufficient let us see what we can say to particulars for the complaints of cruelty and scorn i look upon them as things of course and therefore shall say nothing to them if anacreons mistress did ask him nothing but money why did he choose one whose necessities drove her upon it and if other men have made complaints of the womens minding wealth more than love i desire to know whether women have not as much reason to make the same complaints of the men and for those who talk of their mistresses inconstancy let us see first whether they were constant to them for ovid he does not pretend to put it upon you but complains in eleg   l  0   one place of his being in love with two at once and tells you frankly in eleg   l   another that he was in love with all the town for horace suetonius or whoever it was that writ his life informs you that he was intemperately given to women and what wonder then that a man who tried so many should find one or two false tibullus had two delia nemesis mistresses whom he celebrates by name and there are some more elegies that it does not appear whether they are writ to them or others and though he tells us the rumor ait crebro nostram peccasse putam quid miserum torques rumor acerbe tace  report was that his mistress was kind to other men yet the report gave him so much torment that he desired it should be stifled if therefore you have any friendship for him endeavor to fulfill his desire in that point for propertius besides his aspice uti coelo modo sol modo luna ministrat sic etiam nobis una puella parum   lib el    intemperate love of all women he tells you his lib   el   mistress caught him with two wenches at the same time and confesses that he rails at the incontinence of women only because she upbraided him with his thus whatever qualifications those great men had constancy you see was none and though we allow you each of them had merit enough for any one woman yet one man can hardly have enough for half a score  now if ruin and desolation has come to great men and states from women it showed they had a good opinion of the sex in general that they would suffer for them and had they not been sensible the greatest part were good they could never have been imposed upon by the bad then as for those ill women whom you have mentioned as i suppose you will not undertake to defend all the actions of tyrants and murderers so i do not think myself at all obliged to defend all the women who have been guilty of some of their crimes the dispute is not whether there have been any ill women in the world but whether there are not more good and when i have told you that the book that condemns dalilah cries up deborah and jael that if homer has represented helen guilty of some faults for you will see that homer does not represent her cause so violently bad he tells us of hecuba and andromache and a thousand others who were very good ones that if clytemnestra was false to agamemnon penelope was as famous for her truth to ulysses and so put you example against example which i forbear to do only because it is so very easy should i i say do but this you could not complain that your arguments were unanswered but truly sir we might carry the thing much farther we might defend some of those women you mentioned and excuse the rest for dalilah i shall say say nothing out of respect to the scripture that represents her as an ill woman it is possible were she alive she might tell you in her own defense that what account you have of her is from her professed enemies that however taking the thing as they tell it if she did commit a piece of treachery it was against an enemy of her country and that it was very hard she should be so much run down for the same thing they have so much admired in jael and judith as well as every body else did in marcus brutus she would perhaps push her defense further and tell you that though she delivered samson to the philistines to be kept prisoner yet she neither drove a nail through his head nor cut it off but for helen give me leave to tell you it is a great dispute amongst the historians whether she was forced away by paris or went by her own consent several are of the former opinion and prologom ad apollon hoelztzim says plainly he wonders homer will put such a ridiculous story upon the world as to make her the occasion of the trojan war  menelaus it must be confessed madam if the story be true was a very easy goodnaturd husband who would be at so much pains and charge to fetch back a wife who run away with another man i do not remember in my own memory to have known above five or six examples like it and plato in phaed speaks as if the belying her were the cause of homers blindness as well as of stesichoruss but that the latter understood the way of expiating his fault better and made his recantation to this effect that there was not a word of truth in the story of her going to troy if clytemnestra was consenting to her husbands death yet it was egisthus a man who gave the blow and if thais did advise the burning persepolis yet it was no less a person than alexander the great who put it in execution and as for deianira and cleopatra whatever fatality arrived to their lovers from them may certainly be very well excused upon the innocence of their intentions and their punishment of themselves afterward the one hanging the other poisoning herself if the capuan women destroyed hannibals army they destroyed a body of enemies that all the men in italy could not in like manner for your other instances we might tell you that procopius who tells those terrible stories of theodora anecdota is so very passionate all along and mixes such ridiculous fables with what he tells that there is no great credit to be given to him this procopius was a soldier under justinian and has writ amongst other things a secret history of those times in this he represents the empress theodora more like a devil than a woman he makes her and the emperor converse frequently with spirits and makes her put them to an employment that savours more of the flesh than the spirit though granting she was as lewd as he represents her what wonder is it that one who had been a stroling playwench and common strumpet before the emperor married her should not turn saint after if the sea bentivoglio strada garnier princess of parma embroiled flanders she did it by the command of philip for whom she governed and as for your two queen marys caussin in his holy court you know makes a saint of the one and parsons of the other with whom i leave you to fight it out not thinking our dispute very much concerned in it  then sir if there are impertinents if there are ridiculous persons of the other sex i hope you do not think they are all platos nor all aristotles of our own and i will undertake for every woman who plagues you with her business for every woudbee politician and for every pedant amongst them to bring you double the number of the men if olivia is impertinent in the plaindealer i hope there are novels and plausibles who keep her company and if i should carry you to a city coffeehouse and there show you a parcel of people talking of things that they understand nothing at all of and settling the governments of countries which they never saw as much as in a map from thence to a playhouse and show you the pert and insipid railery of the sparks upon the vizardmasks from thence to a new market course and enter you at a table where you should hear nothing talked of but dogs and horses from thence to a tavern and show you a set of men in their drunken frolics i fancy you would wish yourself in your drawing room again as a more agreeable folly than any of those i have mentioned and i appeal to you whether lucian in his timon boileau in his eighth satire and my lord rochester in his upon the like subject say not as much against mankind and make them as ridiculous as you can do the women and i will assure you sir i am far from being of the duke of britannys mind that learning is unfit for a woman and shall without any offense either to him or you continue of the same opinion till you have answered anna maria schurmans arguments in their behalf and till you have taken away herself who is one of the best arguments  this anna maria schurman was a dutch lady of utrecht of whom you will hear more anon there was a long dispute between her and rivetus whether learning was fit for women it is printed in her works in latin here madam there follows a tedious chapter of women who have been famous for wit and learning which though it may be convenient for those who question their abilities that way yet i do not see of what use it can be to your ladyship or to any who have the honor of being acquainted with you therefore if you please madam we will cast off here and take hands again at the bottom  nor indeed you fear that i should search three several countries and three several ages to furnish me with a learned woman apiece no sir even greece itself to go no further had nine muses nine siblys and nine lyric poetesses if you are delighted with the number nine which is three times three and if you have more mind to particulars we will show you there vassius de poet grecis megalostrate the mistress of alcman who had a gift of poetry as well as he the daughters of lilius girald in vit stesich stesichorus who were as good poets as their father we have also an eretrian sapho as well as she who was in love with phaon erinna and demophila the first the mistress of sapho the other equal to her who flourished all four in the same time after these we have theano the wife of pythagoras who undertook his school when he was dead with two others of the same name if you will believe suidas whereof one was a lyric poetess the other a thurian who writ of pythagoras we have also about the same time cleobulina the daughter of cleobulus one of the seven wise men of greece a poetess and corinna who had the surname given her of the lyric muse we have presently after telesilla an argive poetess not only famous for her wit but for her inspiring her countrywomen with so much courage as to make them put to flight the spartiates who came upon them in the absence of their husbands at the same time lived praxilla one of the nine lyrics and of whom we have a copy of verses to calais yet extant what will you say to aspatia milesia who is celebrated as a sophistress you know the word plutarch in vit themistoch sophister was not then abused a teacher of rhetoric and a poetess there was also hestiaea mentioned by strabo antyte by tatian and nyssis by antipater thessalus of the two last of which there are some things yet extant if you have a mind to see what they did after they turned christians we will produce eudocia the wife of theodosius instructed in all sort of learning and who writ several treatises very much cried up by photius i have not said a word here of lasthemia the mantinaean nor axiothea the phliasian though they are mentioned amongst the disciples of plato by diogenes laertius and i own i forgot hipparchia whose life he writes and commends both as a philosopher and a writer of tragedies and hedyle the poetess whom athenaeus quotes and vossius mentions neither of these two in his poetis grecis vossius it seems has forgot them as well as i i question not but there are several others whose names we want and i question not but there are several named whom i remember not however this is enough to let you see we are not so hard put to it as you imagine since one little country can furnish us with all these what say you sir are you yet satisfied there are women of wit and learning or shall we fetch you the quintil l   cornelia you mentioned salust bell catil sempronia vossius de poetis latin for the rest cornisicia polla argentaria the wife of lucan and who assisted him in his poem sulpitia proba falconia helpine the wife of boethius from among the latins or if these are not enough shall we bring up our reserves of italian spanish french german and english and if you are not yet contented because i fancy every body else is i shall refer you to jacobus a sancto carolos library of women illustrious for their writings or to anna maria schurman who was indeed a library herself since you mention her pardon me sir if i detain you a little longer than ordinary with this woman and though you may think it lost time because you knew it before yet it is possible every body does not know that she was very well skilled in the hebrew chaldee syriac arabic turkish greek latin french english italian spanish german dutch and flemish languages that she had a very good faculty at poetry and painting that she was a perfect mistress of all the philosophies that the greatest divines of her time were proud of her judgment in their own profession and that when we had this character of her she was not above thirty years of age what think you sir is not this woman sufficient of herself or shall we refer you to mademoiselle legalite des deux sexes gournay among the french or nobilita delle done lucretia marinella among the italians who have both writ in defense of their sex and who are both arguments themselves of the excellency of it i shall not as much as mention any of those ladies whose wit balzac and voiture so much admire i shall say nothing of the mesdemoselles scuderie and le fevre to the first of which we do not only owe several excellent treatises published under her own name but who is said also to have had a great share in those that appear under her brothers and to the latter of which we are obliged for so many admirable versions and judicious observations upon most of the greek and latin poets i shall not as much as trouble you with our own countrywomen i shall say nothing of sir thomas mores daughters about whose education epist ad budeum erasmus has written i shall pass by sir nicholas bacons who were as learned as they shall say nothing of sir philip sidneys lady pembroke nor as much as mention mrs philips or any of the rest of our english poetesses but i can hardly forbear saying something of the lady jane gray of whom all nations else speak and whose fame is more celebrated in italy both for her learning and piety by the account that michael angelo has given them of her than it is here at home should i reckon up all those ladies whose wit and learning has been celebrated by our own poets should i but enter upon the praises of queen elizabeth of england or mary of scotland in that particular i should never have done but i can hardly omit two ladies who are strangers and however i am straightened for room yet methinks i ought to be just to those who were civil to me since therefore i received particular favors from the procurator cornara during my stay at venice let me not pass over in silence his daughter for whom most of the greatest princes and learned men of europe have testified such an esteem this lady besides her skill in rhetoric logic music and astronomy writ and spoke perfectly well seven several languages and made the course of all the speculative sciences with so much success that she might very well profess herself a mistress of them and all this before she was thirty years of age her sister whom i had the honor to see she herself being dead some time before is likewise a person of very singular endowments and all this whilst they are one of the best families of a town where the nobility seem almost as proud of their ignorance as their liberty the other i shall mention is christina queen of sweden a princess whose accomplishments are so generally known that it is enough to have named her a lady of that true judgment that she knew how to esteem wit and learning at the same time that she despised crowns and seemed to be born as a sufficient recompense to the commonwealth of letters for all the mischiefs her predecessors the goths and vandals had done it before i am satisfied it is impossible for me to add any thing to a glory so established as that of this princess is yet as i never passed any time either with greater benefit or greater satisfaction than what i passed in her conversation so i am very well pleased methinks with any thing that gives me occasion to call it to my remembrance there might be as advantageous characters perhaps given of some ladies of our own country now living did not their modesty that inseparable quality of wit and women deter me from it  we might tell you farther sir that this modesty too often hinders them from making their virtues known that they are not of those eternal scriblers who are continually plagueing the world with their works and that it is not the vanity of getting a name which several of the greatest men of the world have owned to be the cause of their writing that is the cause of the womens had not sapho been so much in love it is possible we had never heard any mention of one of the greatest wits that ever was born had not cicero and quintilian given us accounts of cornelia and the daughters of laelius and hortensius they had never done it themselves had not jane gray been put to death her virtues had never been so much taken notice of had not the portugueze nun been deserted by her gallant we had missed some of the most passionate letters that these latter ages have produced and had not anna maria schurmans works been published by a friend without her consent we had lost the benefit of them we may tell you too that it is not only in respect of their own sex that they are admired but even of ours that of those two odes we have yet of sapho we owe one to dionysius halicarnassaeus the other to longin the two best critics of greece who chose them out for examples to their rules before any of the mens that the epistle of sapho to phaon which is esteemed the most delicate of ovids is supposed to be taken out of her writings that corinna was five times victorious over pindar the best lyric poet of our sex and were we here in england as forward in printing letters as they are in france and italy we might furnish volumes of them written by our own ladies that would make all the womenhaters blush or make all men else blush for them  here madam i must own to you i grew jealous for i could not imagine that philogynes would have said this without having seen some of your ladyships letters  we may tell you too that granting the equal capacities of both sexes it is a greater wonder to find one learned woman than a hundred learned men considering the difference of their educations if you should go into greece and seeing the ignorance is among them at present tell them their countrymen were incapable of learning would you not be very well satisfied when they told you of the platos and aristotles of antiquity and that if they had not as famous men now it was because they have not the same advantages they had then and pray why may not the women be allowed the same excuse will you by your laws and customs endeavor to keep them ignorant and then blame them for being so and forbid all men of sense keeping them company as you do and yet be angry with them for keeping company with fools consider what time and charge is spent to make men fit for somewhat eight or nine years at school six or seven years at the university four or five years in travel and after all this are they not almost all fops clowns dunces or pedants i know not what you think of the women but if they are fools they are fools i am sure with less pains and less expense than we are  upon second thoughts i hope sir you will allow that women may have wit and learning for their courage and conduct we may possibly say more anon but for heavens sake do not aggravate their faults always at that rate for whatever saphos life and conversation were there is nothing in her writings but what represents the most tender and delicate passion in the world and as for aloisia sigaea i give you thanks for putting me in mind of vasaeus chron hisp thuanus aloisia sigaea who was as remarkable for her wit and learning as any of the other i am very well assured you do not believe that infamous book which goes under her name to have been written by her vid eloges des hommes illustres de monsieur de thou all who speak of it assure us the contrary and that she was so far from writing it that she vid biblioth hispan never published any thing on the other side all historians represent her as remarkable for her virtue as her learning for the queen of sheba there is no mention in scripture of her traveling for any thing but to be satisfied with the wisdom of solomon however if you will believe she went to him for the same reason that vid quint curtius b   thalestris did to alexander the great it was no such great matter in countries where is was thought no sin if the one had a mind to have a child by the wisest man in the world and the other by the bravest after all we must own if there are lewd women they endeavor to conceal their lewdness they do not brag of it nor fly openly in the face of religion and if they once come to be publicly discovered they are rendered infamous to all the world and their nearest friends and relations avoid their company whilst there are several men who boast of their iniquities value themselves upon their being thought lewd and what is worse find others to value them upon it too nay by their incitements and encouragements to wickedness often bring themselves to that pass that the least part of the sins they are to answer for are what they have committed themselves but not a word more i beseech you of sapho nor her new crime let lucian be forgotten for putting us in mind of it and let it be cloistered up within the walls of a turkish seraglio i speak not this in behalf of the female sex but of our own for if they should once hear of this argument and fall upon us with socrates was in love with alcibiades socrates plato writes verses to aster a boy with whom he was in love plato and all those heroes of antiquity whom plutarch and lucian produce in defense of a like sin in our sex should they mention anacreon tibullus martial and all those poets who have eternized their infamy in their writings and after that show you what progresses this crime has made not only in the turks dominion but even in spain and italy i am sure sir you would wish you had said nothing of a point that may be so severely made use of against our selves  now though you are pleased to quote the lampoons yet you think as well as i that such things are not worth any bodies taking notice of we both know there are a sort of people about this town who please themselves with defamations one of these if they see a man speak to a woman make their little signs their politic winks and possibly when they meet him in their insipid way of railery tax him with it if he is angry at them then he is piqued and afraid the intrigue should be found out if he says nothing as it deserves nothing then he is out of countenance and cannot say a word and if he laughs at them which is all the answer a man would make to such stuff then he is pleased with the thing so that every way the poor ladys reputation suffers and these sparks shall not fail to blow it about town that there is an amor not that they think so of you but that you may return the compliment and say so of them when they speak to any lady themselves  for their garrulity if you would see things which are against you in that treatise of de garrulitate plutarch from whence you bring two of your instances you might have been furnished with enough of the mens but though it is lawful to forget stories that are not for you yet methinks you ought to tell out those you do mention and when we have heard that the wife of fulvius seeing what she had done showed her husband the way to avoid the consequences of it by stabing herself first we must certainly own that such a woman had virtue enough to make amends for all her faults and if in answer to the instances you bring i should mention the plutarch de clar mulierib melitish or the saxon women who though they were all engaged in plots with their husbands yet not one discovered it if i should show you plin b   plutarch de garul leaena at athens or tacitus annal b    epicharis at rome who being both engaged in plots one against the tyrant pisistratus the other against nero yet could not by all their tortures be brought to discover them and that the former for fear her torments should make her reveal it bit off her tongue certainly sir you would have a better opinion of their taciturnity but we need not go so far for instances our own country and our own time will furnish us with enough in all the plots we have had continually on foot though we have had women engaged and accused though there was one pilloried in the first three executed in another and sixteen or seventeen excepted in a general pardon though there have been several seized upon like accounts since yet you see there has not been one of them who ever made a discovery give me leave sir to commend them for their virtues at the same time that i am far from defending their faults and though i have a very good opinion of those men who discover a conspiracy upon remorse of conscience yet i must take leave to believe that there are some at least who do it upon another account and without any sorrow at all for their design except that it did not succeed think to save their own lives by the sacrifice of other peoples and make amends for their treason against the government by their treachery to their friends  but no wonder you are so severe upon the faults of modern women when you fall upon those whom all antiquity has reverenced it is hard that jael and judith whose actions have been so long admired should be called to account for them so many thousand years after it would be an injury to their cause to say any thing in their defense and a presumption in me to justify actions that the scripture has celebrated so much but must poor penelope fall under your displeasure too i am sensible how much she is like to suffer who is defended by so dull a fellow as homer against those most ingenious gentlemen who are the lampooners of our age however as their ability in scandal needs no foreign aid and as i am satisfied they would think it a disparagement to them to be reckoned with virgil and ovid let us free them pray from such unworthy companions for the former i believe you are fully satisfied the priapeia are none of his and as fully satisfied that the authority of such sort of verses is not extremely much to be depended upon and for ovid if in the person of a bawd who he tells you was a liar he gives you a reflection upon penelope yet he makes her very sufficient amends when penelope mansit quamvis custode remoto inter tam multos intemerata procos ovid amor l  el  he speaks in his own person and taking the story as it lies that her house was always full of lovers whom she could by no means get away laertes being too old telemachus too young to encounter them it certainly shows her virtue so much the more for as there is no great courage required to keep a fortress in the time of peace so a very little virtue is sufficient to preserve that chastity which no body ever thought it worth his while to attempt now if lycophron and duris samius represent her as a lewd woman as i understand not how they should come to know it all the writers who lived before them giving so very different an account so for lycophron it is no great wonder a greek and a poet should lie or that duris samius seeing the etymology of the word pan come so pat should feed us with a story upon it of his own invention  pan you remember madam in greek signifies all and who would not tell a lie for so pretty a conceit you may observe also that this author was not of so established a reputation as cicero would make us believe since life of alcibiades plutarch who quotes him once does it only to contradict him in a point of history that he ought to have known better than this for lucretia observe of sir charles sidley as of ovid before that he only makes the bawd say it and if you consider the fear in which she was you will find that that passion often makes people run into a greater danger to avoid a less of which you have instances enough in our own plantations of the ligons history of barbados fol p  0 slaves who hang themselves to avoid their being beat  after all this sir if you still think with le chamber that men have a greater natural inclination to virtue than women yet i hope you will grant they have taken a very becoming care to overcome that inclination and if nature has not given so large a talent to the other sex yet they have improved that talent much better than we have done ours then for your instances of some few ill women i tell you as i did before that the cause in general is not at all concerned in them and when i show you an atreus cutting his brothers children in pieces and giving them to him to eat a phalaris roasting people alive in a brazen bull a busyris murdering all his guests a nero ripping open the womb of his mother to see the place where he had lain and so for every crime of that sex show you how far they have been outdone by some of our own as that lucretia marinella la nobilta e leccellenza delle done on deffetti e mancamenti degli huomini italian lady i mentioned does in her treatise upon a like occasion i am sure you will find a very great disadvantage of your side but i take you at your word let us go a circuit with the judges and if you find not six men condemned for one women i will pay the charges of the journey it is true indeed as most of the women who are condemned are so for a crime which they commit to prevent their shame so the care of that and hypocrisy are two faults of which out sex is not so generally guilty now though i do not think myself obliged to say one word for any one of those women you have condemned and shall therefore leave phoedra and fausta to your mercy though neither of them expected the cruelty of their husbands should have carried things so far and shall not argue much for semiramis though certainly her having all the bravery wisdom and virtues of our sex in the greatest perfection might move you to forgive her the having some of our faults and for her putting men to death i am contented that every one who boast of ladies favors should be served in the same manner here madam i cannot at all agree with philogynes because it might be severe upon some honest gentlemen whom all the laws against adultery and fornication would never reach yet methinks i have an inclination to say somewhat for queen joan of naples because she is generally represented so very ill the common essais de montagne l   c   story is that having married andreossa an hungarian and her kinsman and not finding him so capable of satisfying her as his youth and beauty promised she caused him to be strangled in a silk cord of her own making the first and chief author of this story is villani a florentine for istoria di napoli l   collenuccio takes it from him though as such things use it has lost nothing in his hands who tells you that he had it from a v annotazione e supplimente al istoria di collenuccio per costo relation made to his brother by a certain hungarian who had been a servant of andreossas and in his return to hungary passed through florence now the author of this story being an hungarian one of those of whom petrarch writes so much ill and also a servant of the dead king he ought to speak passionately against the queen of whom they were professed enemies you may observe also that the inordinata vita praecedens retentio potestatis in regno neglecta vindicta vir alter susceptus and excusatio subsequens necis viri tui te probant fuisse participem and consortem letter which lewis the brother of andreossa writes to her at the time that he came with a potent army to revenge his brothers death speaks of her being privy to it as a thing that was suspected rather than a thing that did plainly appear on the other side casi degli huomini illustri boccace who lived a great while in that court throws all the blame of the action upon the conspirators and none at all upon the queen after all believe as you please and do as you please with all these women who have offended you if helen runs away from menelaus let all greece arm and fetch her back again if clytemnestra consents to the killing agamemnon let orestes kill her for it if semiramis puts the men she has made use of to death let her own son serve her in the same manner if joan of naples causes andreossa to be strangled let durazzo cause her to be strangled in the same place let not your severity stop there but let their infamy live when they themselves are dead and let the euripidess the juvenals and the misogyness set out their actions in their true colors but let the business go no farther i beseech you let not hecuba nor andromache suffer because helen is a wanton woman nor penelope be run down because clytemnestra is an ill wife and if joan of naples strangles her husband let not all those who have died for theirs fall under the same condemnation it is one of the chiefest ends of punishments to distinguish the good from the bad do not you therefore by punishments confound them if tibullus and ovids mistresses jilt their lovers let it be remembered against them two thousand years after and if misogyness serve him so let him show his resentment in as severe a manner as he pleases let him disdain the mean revenge of malicious whispers and nameless lampoons and the much meaner way of railing at all because one has injured him but let him boldly hunt her out from the herd let him publish her infamy in lasting characters though she is free from conscience let her be plagued with the stings of shame and let all women be terrified by her example from being false to men of wit or kind to fools but let him have very full satisfaction of the matter of fact first let him not go upon dubious grounds nor jealous surmises let him not believe the vanity of some nor the malice of others let him consider the stories of orlan furioso canto    bradamante in ariosto of aurestilla in consalo de cepedes of othello in shakespeare and let him see how far jealousy may seem reasonable whilst nevertheless the person of whom they are jealous may be innocent after all i give you even in that greater power than i should care to take myself i would rather by other peoples faults correct my own and should think the noblest revenge a man could take upon a woman who injured him would be the doing some action that would make all the world admire him i would have every body upbraid her with my wrongs whilst i myself was silent it is true if by the injuries she did me there were any aspersions cast upon my reputation there justice to myself would oblige me to make the story public but i would certainly endeavor to reclaim her by mildness before i made use even of that severity and as i should scorn any favor that was the effect of fear so if i once broke into an open war all the submission she could make should never bring me to an amity again though perhaps my own goodnature might in time prevail upon me for a forgiveness  this sir is what i thought necessary to reply to what you said in which i see we have quite exceeded the bounds of a dialogue and turned that into declamation which was intended only for conversation i have troubled the company so much already that i dare trespass no farther upon their patience and shall therefore omit some other things which i intended to have said upon this occasion  you are like those people cried misogynes who when they have provided all the dainties they could get make an apology at the end of the treat for their having got no more if i am not altogether convinced of the goodness of your cause yet i am very well convinced that you have said all the cause will bear  though perhaps i should have no great mercy upon you replied philogynes yet i have too much for these gentlemen to detain them so long as to hear all that i could say upon so glorious an occasion should i make a collection of what is written by the best authors of antiquity in their praises should i but refer you to what stobaeus has collected for them since you mention what he has done against them should i but transcribe what de claris mulier plutarch de foemina christian lodovicus vives dialoghi delle done speron sperone the most learned of his countrymen de la gloire immortelle des dames illustres ribera eloges des dames illustres hilarion de cost femme heroique scuderie and a thousand others have said of them in treatises written expressly in their praises should i but search all the bibliotheques for a catalogue of those who were famous for their writings should i afterward tell you of those who were remarkable for their piety conjugal affection penitence and contempt of worldly vanities should i but repeat the names of those who have died for the preservation of their chastity should i show you a see berniers history of indostan taverniers and mandelsos travels country even at this day where they cannot by any severity hinder women from burning themselves with the bodies of their deceased husbands should i mention the women of plutarch de clar mulieribus cios amongst whom for seven hundred years there never was the least mention of any adultery or fornication should i tell you that the first of those sins was so little known amongst the spartans that they did not think it worth their while to make any law against it now said my friend whether this were not as good an argument of the mens chastity as the womens i leave you to judge but really i think not madam for besides intrigues with their own sex which were common enough amongst the men in those eastern countries i do not doubt but the men being men of honor would ask though the women being women of honor would deny should i but give you a list of the martyrs of that sex from those who suffered under tiberius to those who suffered under our own queen mary i fancy i should make you ashamed of your simonides your juvenal and all your satirists put together should i after this defend them in the virtue to which they are thought to have least pretenses which is courage should i but name those who have been famous for their warlike achievements should i tell you of deborah penthesilaea thalestris camilla should i show you a country see acostas history of the west indies of amazons even in our own time should i carry you into france and show you a warlike virgin at least an unmarried woman whose memory is still annually celebrated by one of their chiefest orleans towns and who besides her fame in their chronicles has given a subject to one of the most famous la pucelle de monsieur chapelaine heroic poems which that nation has produced would you not after all confess they might very easily be defended even in this point too but i shall wave that i am satisfied with the care universal custom has taken of them and as seamen in a storm to preserve their things of greatest value throw away those of less so i am very well pleased that mankind should be exposed to the hazards of war whilst the fair sex is preserved in safety at home whose smiles are the noblest reward a brave man can desire for all the hazards and fatigues he has endured in a campaign  but it is generally agreed that all virtues are requisite for those who govern well and since there are some countries where women are excluded from the throne and no country where they are not postponed it would be convenient methinks to see what they do when by accident they are placed upon it i shall not trouble you here with deborah nor esther nor as much as mention semiramis though you have mentioned her upon another occasion and yet certainly the bravery of most of her actions ought to make us forget the faults of some few but i shall confine myself within the bounds of our own country  tacitus in vita agric and from him sammes in his britania illustrata at a time when the britons groaned under the servitude of the romans when the king by thinking to oblige the emperor gave him an opportunity of pillaging his country and that their patience under their sufferings was only a means of making them more when their houses were robbed their wives and daughters ravished and their sons taken away from them then boadicea arose and by her courage as well as eloquence inspired her dispirited countrymen with a resolution of throwing off that yoke which was grown intolerable to be born it is true indeed the end was not answerable to the successes of the beginning nor to the glory so heroic an undertaking deserved however as it was neither want of courage nor conduct in her so we ought to render her that veneration which is due to so resolute an enterprise  but as one of the greatest attempts the britons made for their liberty was whilst they were led by a woman so we must own the greatest glory our nation could ever boast was under the government of one of the same sex it was in the time of queen elizabeth that this island arrived at that pitch of greatness to which it had been ascending for several ages and from which it has been declining till very lately ever since it is the name of this princess that is dearer to all englishmen than the names of all the monarchs since the conquest besides and the only one whose birthday has been celebrated after her death by the voluntary gratitude of the people  but however we may forget things that are past let us not oversee that which lies before our eyes and since the occasion is so very fair i know not how we can omit the showing our sense of those virtues of which the whole nation has demonstrated so grateful an acknowledgment by the body of their representatives and never were they more truly their representatives before yes sir without going to foreign countries without searching the histories of our own we have even in our own time and our own country a princess who has governed to their general satisfaction a people the most curious to pry into the faults of their governors of any people under the sun a princess who though she never showed any fondness of vainglory or authority yet when the necessity of the kingdom called her to the helm managed affairs with that dexterity which is very rarely found in those who are the most ambitious of command every thing during that little time of her government was ordered with that courage conduct and prudence that her greatest friends cannot find eloquence enough to commend nor her greatest enemies the least pretenses to condemn though she had a husband venturing his life in another country with a bravery equal to what has made us suspect the stories of antiquity though our fleet the bulwarks of the nation was managed in a manner the courage of the english seamen was utterly unacquainted with though a monarch who thinks himself able to contend with all europe together seemed to make his utmost efforts against a princess who had nothing but the universal hearts of her subjects to defend her though all christendom was in suspense to see the event of the undertaking and every little prince had forgot his own danger to contemplate hers even at this time did we see her look with all the unconcern imaginable and whilst every body else was alarmed for her safety she only seemed to have known nothing of the danger not that this unconcern proceeded from any ignorance of her condition or unreasonable contempt of her adversary no she provided against their attempts with all the prudence could be wished for at the same time that she looked upon the danger with all the courage in nature  but however great these virtues may appear when they are set off by the luster of a public command yet they are in effect much greater when they teach people to despise all such dazzling trifles here it is sir that we have a fresh field for eloquence when we see a lady dissatisfied at that glory which she had to every bodies satisfaction beside and grudge herself that authority which she owed to the absence of a husband whom she loved so much better than that what think you sir of that alacrity of that joy with which she resigned up the government does it not put you in mind of the old roman generals who quitted their plough to command an army and when the victory was gained returned with greater content to their plough again this is that wisdom which we should admire this is that virtue which we should adore and we ought to despise all those little pretenders to business who thrust themselves into the management of affairs against every bodies will but their own and having neither virtue nor prudence enough to retire from it at the universal murmurs of the people are generally made sacrifices at last to the just resentment of an enraged nation  these are those blazing comets whose fatal glories portend destruction to a government whilst the virtues of the others like those of the sun give it life and heat by their benign influence much more sir might be said in defense of the sex which i shall purposely omit because i am satisfied i can never conclude with a more illustrious example  aesculapius or the hospital of fools an imitation of lucian by william walsh esquire aesculapius make the third proclamation mercury   mercury o  yes o  yes o  yes whereas daily complaints are made by all the world of the innumerable follies of mankind by reason of which they are neither happy themselves nor will suffer others to be so the great jupiter out of his fatherly compassion to mankind has sent aesculapius to apply medicines to them whoever therefore there is that is troubled with folly of what kind soever let him repair hither and he shall be cured without any fee   aesculapius what should be the meaning of this every particular man complains of the follies that are in the world and when we come hither to apply medicines to them there is not one man that offers himself to be cured   mercury if i might be allowed to advise aesculapius in points relating to physic i would tell him there is one thing in this disease of folly different from all other kind of diseases which is that the men can easily find the least symptom of it in other people yet there is no man that perceives the greatest in himself i think it therefore advisable to make proclamation that every man should give notice of what other people he knows who are troubled with this disease   aesculapius let it be as you say   mercury o  yes o  yes o  yes whoever has any relation friend or acquaintance that is troubled with folly of whatever kind let him bring him hither and he shall be cured without any fee   aesculapius see see what crowds are getting together every man seizes his next neighbor without any deliberation at all and they come willingly too because every man seems ready to accuse the other   first man here sir i have brought you a fool to be cured   second man pray sir take this first for he is dangerously ill   third man take pity upon this good sir for he has a complication of folly upon him   mercury pray gentlemen have a little patience you shall be all cured one after another   first man nay for my part i have no occasion for myself   second man how no occasion neighbor i wish for your own sake you had not for my part indeed    third man prithee good neighbor hold thy tongue what cuckolded and henpecked and pretend to be free from folly   aesculapius mercury keep the crowd off with your caduceus and bring the patients up in order   mercury stand off there gentlemen and do not press upon us so here you old fellow come in here with your patient make your reverence to aesculapius and tell him what you would have   old man ant please you sir this young man is a kinsman of mine he came very young to a great estate half of which he has made a shift to squander away already and he is in great danger of doing so by the rest in a short time if you do not cure him of his folly i have taken a great deal of pains in advising him but all in vain if he could not live upon his whole estate i asked him how he hopes to live upon the half and if he spent his estate when he was young and able to get one what would become of him when he was old and past getting one but when i talk to him he laughs at me and that is all the thanks i have for my pains   aesculapius mercury put him in the hospital care shall be taken of him   young man i desire sir that you would please to hear me first and judge whether it is this old man or i who have most need of your medicines i confess indeed that what he says is true but pray consider that i spend this estate in pleasing myself and were it not a great folly to debar myself of pleasure for the present moment which is all i am sure of for fear of not having means to enjoy them in a future time to which i have no security that i shall ever arrive but granting i were certain of life is it not a madness to waste all my youth which is the only time we are capable of pleasure to lay up wealth which we are to make use of in an age when we are not capable of any pleasure at all but this old man who has the confidence to accuse me does ten times worse he did not only heap up wealth all his youth but he continues to do so still and though his age and the infirmities of his body give him hourly notice that he can hardly live one year longer yet is he at his usury his extortion and a hundred ways to hoard up wealth as if he were to live ten thousand years   aesculapius a very palpable folly indeed mercury put him aside too   young man i did not doubt sir but that i should convince you at last i may go away now   aesculapius how friend does that mans being a fool hinder you from being a fool too if it be a folly in him to heap up money that he can never probably live to spend is it not a folly therefore in you to squander away that money which probably you will live to want take care mercury that they may be both put in the hospital   mercury it shall be done in the mean time here are some others   aesculapius well gentlemen what have you to say   first man this sir is a friend of mine an honest goodnatured man as lives but he has a wife who makes him the greatest fool in nature and though she abuses him in the grossest manner imaginable insomuch that half the town laugh at him yet is he himself blind to that in his own house which any stranger sees here is one who has been often found with her and who can tell you more if you examine him   aesculapius well sir and what can you say   second man all that i can say sir is that the gentleman is a very worthy gentleman and his lady a very fine lady he has often indeed bragged to me of the happiness of a married life i thought the best way to find out this happiness was in going to his lady who has fully convinced me of all her husband said but as i have a perfect friendship for the gentleman i must confess sir i am as well satisfied with his having a fine wife as if i had one myself   aesculapius he has a fine time on it the mean while   husband i confess sir i have nothing to say in contradiction to these gentlemen all that the one says and the other would insinuate may be true for aught i know nor do i think it much worth my while to enquire after it half the town the first says laugh at me for being a cuckold and he would have me make it public that the other half might laugh at me too but pray let us consider how much wiser he acts he married a wife who by the way is not extremely taking and yet you cannot imagine what care what contrivances what cunning stratagems this wise person made use of to search out a thing which after all he did not care to find and though with all his bustle he could find out nothing that really made against her yet he has cast her off with infamy and shame chiefly indeed to himself for using a woman ill who never gave him occasion for it if there be so many who laugh at me for a tame husband let him hearken after his own concerns and he will find a much greater number who rail at him for a base and illnatured one  now for this brisk monsieur here for this finished gentleman who can with so much delicacy rally the poor fools that marry so very ingenious a person no doubt acts much more wisely himself lord how is his estate divided one part upon tailors another upon milliners a third upon perfumers a fourth upon perriwigmakers all his time spent between the toilet the playhouse the park and drawing room and upon what noble design pray is all this time and all this money wasted even gentlemen that this most charming person of his may attain that with all this cost which i received twenty thousand pound for doing would his niceness be contented with the meat that had been tumbled and cold upon my trencher truly sir his happiness is little more than this i that am the fool come to her when i will stay with her as long as i will and command her as i will while this wise gentleman is waiting a frosty night under her window breaking his brains for songs and billets for her bribing her women losing his rest and venturing the being abused kicked down stairs and having his throat cut whenever he happens to be found out   aesculapius very great fools truly all three is it not strange mercury one would think every man wise when we hear him talk of other peoples concerns and yet we find them all fools when we look into their own   mercury alas aesculapius how should it be otherwise when a man is told of his folly he does not consider whether it be true and endeavor to mend it he only considers whether the man who tells him of this be not guilty of some folly too and if he find he is as i doubt we shall find few who are not he rests as well satisfied in laughing at him as if he were absolutely free from all sort of folly himself   aesculapius well old gentlewoman what is it you have to say against that young man   old woman ant please you sir this young man is my husband he made fair pretenses to me before marriage but now he neglects and despises me for every other woman now i appeal to you sir and to all the world whether it be not a very great folly for a man to tie himself during life to a woman he does not love   aesculapius yes without doubt it is mercury put them both up   old woman ant please you sir it is i who make the complaint   aesculapius very good mistress and if it be a folly in him to marry a woman that he does not love was it not a folly in you to marry a man without knowing first whether he loved you or no   mercury here are several other wives who complain of their husbands and husbands who complain of their wives   aesculapius put them in all without farther deliberation for though people may be allowed to be as critical in their choice as they please before marriage yet when that is once done it is a great folly to complain   mercury here are a vast quantity more of both men and women brought upon account of their marriage   aesculapius it were an endless work to hear of every one who played the fool in marriage to save time therefore we will put up all the married people at a venture and if there be any one who can give us satisfactory reasons to prove that he did not play the fool in it we will let him out again   husband no sir i will not go in no one can say i committed any folly in marrying   aesculapius how friend marry and commit no folly what wife have you pray   husband one who has wit beauty virtue riches and is of a very considerable family   aesculapius it is very much to be suspected that thou art guilty of folly in having this opinion of her a woman with wit and beauty marry an odd disagreeable fellow and not cuckold him however friend if it be so you may go away but be sure you send your wife in your place   husband do you reckon it a folly then in a woman not to cuckold her husband   aesculapius no friend we do not tell you so but when a woman who finds by her constitution that she shall make any husband a cuckold takes one who is very fit for that purpose there are some wicked people who think she does as wisely as a woman in her circumstances could but when a woman marries a man who is fit for no other use than to make a cuckold of without a design of putting him to any use that that woman commits a folly there was never any one yet could doubt   mercury but see what vast crowds are waiting for audience and with how much eagerness are they set upon discovering the follies of one another it is impossible for us to hear all the particular follies of which particular men are guilty it seems to me therefore by very much the easiest way to pick out the wise men first and when we have done that we may apply general medicines to the rest without enquiring farther into their particular distempers make proclamation therefore mercury that people may no longer trouble themselves with bringing the fools of their acquaintance but henceforward let them bring none but the wise men   mercury alas aesculapius art thou no better acquainted with the nature of mankind than this believe me if we stay here till one man accuses another of being wise we may stay till the end of the world no aesculapius no in searching the follies of mankind it was necessary to have an account of them from others and not from themselves but if you would search for wise men you must not ask mens opinion of one another but take what every man thinks of himself   aesculapius thou art better acquainted with the humors of mankind than i am do therefore as thou will   mercury o  yes o  yes o  yes let all those that are wise range themselves upon the right hand and distinguish themselves from the rest   aesculapius what is the meaning of this every man places himself on the right side but one and they jostle one another for room with the greatest violence imaginable here you sir what are you pray who appear so very confidently in the very head of the wise   poet who i sir i am a poet   aesculapius well and pray mr poet what pretense have you to place yourself so confidently before all the rest   poet can aesculapius know i am a poet and ask that question as much as a man is above a beast so much is a poet above another man it is we who converse with the gods and despise the rest of mankind it is we who elevate ourselves above the transitory things that the vulgar are fond of who despise riches glory and honor and seek for nothing but fame and immortality  when conquering death shall ravish from their eyes those trifling glories that the vulgar prize when crowns shall fall when empires shall be lost and all that is mortal be dissolved to dust then shall i live immortal in my fame and future ages shall extol my name in several places of mr popes works it will be found that he has a most ardent thirst after immortality   statesman i think there is no great need of convincing aesculapius how little that man deserves the title of wise since he himself has been pleased to prove it sufficiently already i will not say any thing to the man himself or enquire what pretenses he has to the title of a poet but taking it for granted that he is as good as he fancies himself yet can any thing be so ridiculous as the very design he proposes he does not pretend that poetry makes people happy in this world because we very plainly see the contrary but he pleases himself with a vain reversion of imaginary honors that he is never to enjoy till he himself is insensible of them it will be a very great satisfaction doubtless to a man when he is in the grave to think his verses run as smoothly as ever and one must be an infidel to doubt but that the author of a fine poem will be extremely considered in the other world  i do not say this out of any malice to the profession of a poet nor would i pretend to take a title from them though they do not deserve it but in order to show you those who do do you ask me then who it is that deserves the title of a wise man whom should i answer but him who knows how to govern the state if particular persons of a community think they have any title to wisdom how much more must they allow that title to those who are capable of governing the community it is they certainly who can move assemblies who can advise kings who can govern commonwealths that deserve the title of the wise how considerable a figure does such a man make in a government how much is he followed and caressed what advantages does he get to himself and family and how much is he flattered and adored by these very poets who would vainly arrogate the title of wise to themselves such has been the quondam advice of mr popes lelius alias saint john alias the examiner    stoic though i am of a profession that do not trouble themselves with the trifles of the world yet i cannot i confess be pleased to see people take a title to themselves to which they have not the least pretense i might observe here that considering how kings are for the most part advised and commonwealths governed a man has no great reason to boast of his having a hand in either but i shall wave all that as to my particular and speak to the employment of a statesman in general is there then any thing so ridiculous as for a man to propose the making himself great as the end of all his actions the only end a wise man proposes is the making himself happy how ridiculous then must he appear who makes himself miserable in order to make himself great who seeks the contempt of the wise that he may get the admiration of fools who leads a false dissembling life fawning upon those who treat him insolently and treating those insolently who fawn upon him who values himself upon the bearing other peoples burdens for which the only thanks he gets is envy or contempt envy if he succeed and contempt if he fail should a man who came late to an inn instead of taking the rest that was requisite to refresh him for the next days journey enter into cabals form designs and manage intrigues to get the best room in the house which would make him very uneasy if he failed of it and from which though he succeeded he must necessarily depart the next morning would not this man appear ridiculously foolish and contemptible to all the world and when we see a man in a world from which he must necessarily depart in a very short space of time instead of preparing himself for what is to follow waste all that little time in senseless cabals in vain designs and in ridiculous intrigues to make himself great and powerful which if he do not attain it makes him uneasy and which if he do he must leave immediately again is not this man ten times more ridiculous and more foolish than the other the man who by his folly loses his rest one night will without doubt grow wiser and take a double share of rest the next but alas in the other case it is quite different there is no second opportunity of correcting the first and he who has spent one life foolishly will never be trusted with another to employ better   aesculapius wisely urged o incomparable stoic the folly of this sort of men is very palpable and you certainly who can so sagely find out their infirmities can easily discover to us the men who are subject to no infirmities at all   stoic you judge right divine aesculapius it is among us and only us that you must expect to find a real wise man and our leaders have taught us upon a due consideration of the world to pronounce all men mad beside it is true their extravagance does not appear perhaps to the vulgar but as in a madhouse one of the patients does not perceive that madness in his companion which is presently found out by a sober standerby so in this universal madness which possesses the world in general though they do not discover it in one another yet it is at first sight apparent to the eyes of the sage do you ask me then who is this wise man that i have mentioned it is he who places not his felicity in his beauty his wealth or his learning who desires no pleasure who fears no pain whom the frowns of fortune cannot deject nor her smiles exalt who is happy in prisons in banishments in torments who if he were broiling in phalariss bull would cry out how pleasant is this it matters not how many arrows fortune aims at him since he is impenetrable to them all as there are some stones so hard that the iron cannot touch as diamonds can neither be cut nor broken but resist the strongest force as rocks in the sea break the fury of the waves and beaten upon so many ages retain no marks of its rage so is the soul of a wise man solid and firm and has collected so much strength that it remains as safe from all injuries as any of the things i mentioned but what will you say is there no one then who will attempt the injuring a wise man yes they will attempt it but they cannot perform it he is elevated so much above the vulgar that none of their ill designs can arrive at him when that foolish king darkened the day with his arrows there was not one of them which reached the sun when the chains were cast into the sea they could not bind the waves and those who destroy the temples do no injury to the divinity in like manner whatever is done proudly maliciously or insolently against a wise man who is in nothing different from a god but in point of time is but attempted in vain   aesculapius o sage o wonderful o incomparable stoic this this is a wise man indeed is it possible that people can continue slaves to their follies when wisdom proposes such sublime such noble rewards to her followers but descend a little from this high region in which you are placed conform yourself to the weaknesses of others and convince their stupidity by living examples of this high pitch of wisdom you have so nobly described to them but what is the matter with that man to laugh so you there who stand by yourself on the left side while all the rest are gotten upon the right   man solus alas sir who can forbear laughing to see men hope by their pride and vanity to exempt themselves from those infirmities to which all mankind are naturally subject this sage this wonderful this incomparable stoic after all his noble and highflown similies is neither so hard as a diamond so firm as a rock nor so elevated as the sun this mighty man who would laugh in phalariss bull yet is liable to pain and anguish as well as the meanest of the people the most vulgar weapon shall hurt him and the most ordinary strength shall reach him this contemplative person who has found out the follies of all mankind has one of his own that he does not see ten times more extravagant than any of theirs since there is no folly sure so extravagant as for one who labors under all the frailties and weaknesses and infirmities of mankind to think himself in any wise comparable to the perfection of a god   aesculapius well friend what are you then who dare accuse the stoics of folly who accuse all the world beside   man alas sir i am a fool too and am so well convinced of it that you see i keep by my self on the left side when all the rest go to the right and were i not convinced my self i have given sufficient reason to convince any one else by troubling myself with correcting the follies of others while i have so many follies of my own that are uncorrected still   aesculapius what are become of all the wise men then are there none left   man if you take every mans opinion of himself never were there so many if you take their opinions of one another never were there so few   aesculapius are all men then alike   man no there are some who are called wise and some who are called fools not but that the wisest man has a sufficient stock of folly too but the best method i can propose to distinguish mankind is by calling those men wise who know themselves to be fools and those men fools who think themselves to be wise   aesculapius mercury thou art a swift messenger haste away to jupiter inform him of what we have done and know his further pleasure in the matter you may tell him that upon a full survey of mankind it appears that every one has such a sufficient share of folly that he has no reason at all to complain of his neighbors having more that in answer to those who think their folly obstructs their happiness it is very plain that the happiness of mankind is so complicated with this folly that it is impossible to cure them of the one without endangering the other too should we convince the fool who squanders away his money that he might live to want it should we convince the fool who heaps up treasure that in a little time he must die and have all his treasure taken from him should we convince the husband who places his happiness in his wife and children that the one cuckolds him and the other are none of his should we convince the man who does things to be eternally famous that after death he will have no sense of fame or of whatever is said of him we should make them all miserable and wretched on the other side by taking away their folly we should take away one of the most useful qualities in the world since it is very evident that mankind live upon the follies of one another were there not fools who sell estates what would become of the fools who buy them were there not fools who marry human kind would come to an end were there not fools of business how would the fools that meddle with no business be managed were there not fighting fools who would protect the fools that would not fight from oppression and were there not writing fools what would the reading fools do for a diversion so that upon the whole matter i think we had even as good leave the world as we find it however if he thinks there ought to be somewhat done in this matter after having made so much noise about it the most general folly in men being that of showing severity to other peoples faults while they neglect those they commit themselves he may order a solemn proclamation to be made that no man shall have the privilege of censuring the follies of other people till he can bring a certificate under the hands of three judicious neighbors that he has none at all of his own   letters between thomas uvedale esquire and the celebrated mrs elizabeth thomas this lady was mr drydens corinna  madam if any thing could render the solitude of a country retirement agreeable to my temper certainly it would be the opportunity of receiving your obliging letters which next to your ingenious conversation give me the greatest satisfaction in the world but since my affairs will not at present permit me to enjoy that happiness i must beg the continuance of an epistolary correspondence i protest madam it is the highest piece of charity imaginable to throw away a friendly hour in writing to a poor wretch condemned to live threescore miles from london amongst a parcel of sour unsociable animals who have nothing but their outside forms by which a man would take them to be rational for indeed their humors and their understanding favor much of the brute i have made some observations on the inhabitants and i find the gentlemen to be a miscellany of idiots and madmen and the ladies a mixture of coquet and homebred which being odly blended together makes a wretched composition of affectation and illmanners so that out of mere necessity i am forced to converse with the dead and make my study the chiefest entertainment of my hours though i cannot oblige you with a sample of winchester wit as yet because either our rhymsters are asleep or want a subject to work on but to return our favor of those excellent verses on musidora see corinnas poems  vo i present you with two copies of my own homespun   song for st caecilias feast    the mosaic creation   poetry by which you will see what it is youre to trust to if you trade with me in verse and how great a loser you will be at the years end for whosoever trafficks with me in such sort of ware will make as indifferent a bargain as the indians heretofore who bartered gold for spanish glass if this tiresome scrawl has not frighted you madam from writing to me be pleased to direct your letter to captain browns in hydestreet and it will safely be received by  madam your most humble servant thomas uvedale winton april      0  a song for st caecilias feast set to music by mr richardson organist of winton and performed at the bishops palace   0  i from sounds celestial sounds arose this universal shining frame the atoms which the world compose by harmony to order came the hudled chaos which before gloomy marks of horror wore with its charming notes beguiled assumed a brightness and serenely smiled soon as the waters heard the voice divine bright streaks of glorious light sprung from the dusky womb of night over the

hail patroness of music hail whose charms over all mankind prevail bright caecilia sacred maid to thee our tributary sounds are paid to thomas uvedale esquire sir though i received your generous present two days after the date yet the affairs of my parents and the commands of a noble lady lady delawar have harrassd me so much that i could not get time to return my thanks sooner i doubt you will quickly be convinced you have formed a very unjust idea of me for i protest on a selfexamination i cannot find one of those good qualities you lay to my charge however it is highly obliging in you to fancy me ingenious and agreeable till you know the contrary as such i accept the compliment and acknowledge your uncommon candor the question now is whether i ought not to stop here and preserve your favorable opinion by my silence rather than hazard it by a farther discovery of my ignorance the first is certainly most prudent but the latter being more just i think it a point of honor to undeceive you and dispel the false charms of an imaginary prospect your american simile would have been proper enough for me but i can by no means allow you to make use on it neither can i admit of a barter so exceedingly disadvantageous to my correspondent no sir i will preserve your finished poems as a standard of good verse but i shall not pretend to traffic with you because i never wrote any thing that pleased myself and surely if an author cannot satisfy her own judgment it is in vain to expect she should please others  i hope you will be contented with this answer because it is truth and i hope also that if i should not send so quick a return to your letters as you may expect or as they deserve you will not presently accuse me of disrespect for what with the continued weakness of my grandmother and the necessary concerns of life i have so little time at my own disposal that i dare not promise a constant correspondence lest i should engage for more than i can perform i conjure you by your most beloved muse never more to call any thing of mine excellent since in my opinion unmerited praise is no better than civil lampoon i should pity your hard fate in living among such unsociable animals did i not believe that a wise man scorns to be beholden to fortune for a precarious happiness and that you are this philosopher i no more doubt than that you imitate the elder scipio and improve your lucky idleness however since you seem too modest to own the happiness you find in solitude and again think fit to descend to complaint i will also confess that i join in your just resentments for i have had the same account of the illnatured wintonians by another hand and am now sensible that what i took for a satire was no more than a character well drawn but is it possible the inhabitants should be all of a piece is there no shining exception no generous mind who has fortitude enough to resist the malignant particles of its native air yes yes you will confess i know you will that mrs martland has learning virtue wit and good humor sufficient to atone for the vices folly and ill nature of a much larger city than winchester how then can you complain of solitude or how can you call that place dull where our english sapho resides sapho was the name mr cromwell chose for her and not undeservedly her excellent verses requiring a nobler epithet if the records of time had afforded it i know not whether you have the good fortune to be acquainted with this incomparable lady if you are and find a convenient opportunity i would entreat you to give her my best respects and to assure her that i have been many years very ambitious of subscribing myself her unfeigned admirer i have also another request which is this that you would send me the title of that book wherein is durfys lampoon on mr drydens marriage or do me the favor to transcribe it from your own memory i am  sir your most humble servant corinna london april  0   0  to mrs thomas madam instead of convincing me that i have formed a very unjust idea of you your last letter has but the more confirmed my opinion of your worth and goodness and though an unwillingness of owning the shining qualifications of your mind and the distinguishing character of true merit has conjured me never to use the word excellent for any thing of yours yet i must and will say that i never saw any of your writings but what deserved that title neither can i admit of your excusive arguments for solid reasons why you should deny me the advantage and satisfaction of a poetical merchandise but only take them to be a modest refusal of my offer upon the account of my insufficiency to become your correspondent in so precious a commodity as verse though i have been somewhat slow in answering your letter yet do not accuse me of disrespect or negligence since it is not designed as a premeditated silence for indeed i have been seized with so severe a fit of melancholy that for the space of ten days i have not had the heart to apply my mind to any thing but the unsociable companions of an uneasy being sorrow and discontent and how long it would have continued upon me had not the prevailing thoughts of fair corinna roused me from that lethargy of temper i cannot well determine stupidity and insipidness are the epidemical distempers of our town therefore it is no wonder that my spirits naturally prone to dullness should so soon catch the reigning contagion lucius florus in his history of the second punic war gives us an account how hannibal in his nonage was sworn romes eternal foe in like manner do i verily believe that the wintonians in their infancy fretfully resolved to be everlasting enemies to mirth and sense for at the least appearance of either they start like wild beasts at firearms and raise all their posse of malice and ill nature to suppress whatever bears the face of wit or diversion though i am a stranger madam to mrs martlands perfections yet since you are pleased to bestow so high an elogy on her learning virtue wit and good humor i believe her to be an extraordinary lady and on your commendation am very desirous of her acquaintance but how to introduce myself to her is the point for you must know that our ladies here like snails keep every one in their own shell and are wondrous shy of men visitants how far a person of such fine notions and such an exalted mind as the elder scipio was might improve the minutes of a solitary retirement i am not able to judge but sure i am that one of my slender understanding destitute of books and ingenious conversation can reap no other advantage from a country life than what domitian did from killing of flies passing away time in an idle employment whatever pleasures that renowned hero found in solitude were certainly owing to his choice but my retirement is only the result of invincible necessity which gives a tincture of bitterness and disgust to all the pleasures of a rural life i am concerned that my memory cannot oblige you with neither the title of the book nor the lampoon on mr drydens the piece here referred to was not durfys but written by a nobleman and may be found in the works of the earls of rochester roscomon and dorset in   volumes   mo printed for e curll it is entitled satire to his muse by the author of absalom and achitophel and begins thus hear me dull

for either twas never heard of or else wholly forgotten by  madam your most humble servant thomas uvedale winton may      0  the mosaic creation when first the starting hours with fleeting pace over times eternal plain began their race the wise creator with his hands did rear the fabric of this beauteous theater the wondrous frame of heaven and earth arose at his command and did their forms disclose the expanded earth was one continued void till his creating power its strength employed no form the hudled mass of nothing bore but gloomy marks of wild confusion wore clouds of substantial darkness to be felt on the brown face of unshapd nature dwelt the almightys spirit on the waters played and all his heavenly energy betrayed the eternal spoke let smiling light convey around thabyss an unaccustomed day strait from the region of tremendous night dawned forth in ruddy streaks primaeval light its orient beams even charmed the almightys sight then by his power a separation made between the lovely light and beamless shade the streaming light was called refulgent day the darkness night and sunk in horror lay and when the evening and the morn came round thus far the almightys first days work was crowned again the godhead spoke let strait appear a firmament amidst the waters clear to part the streams with an officious care soon a new modeled firmament was seen divide the waters with its lucid screen so in distinguished channels calmly move waters beneath the sky and those above then by his mouth the sacred name of heaven was to the newcreated ether given and when the evening and the morn came round the labor of gods second day was crowned then from his throne thus said the power supreme let all these waters make one flowing stream which roll beneath the vast aetherial mold and let one place their liquid troops infold that the dry land may show its recent head and with extended force its beauties spread no sooner spoke but the dry land appeared and from the deep its barren forehead reared the name of earth thunmeasurd land possessed as that of sea the congregated waves expressed the spacious forms his powerful hands had made with secret pleasure did his mind invade once more the eternal spoke let teeming earth disclose a sudden and prolific birth let grassy burdens load the naked plain and useful herbs in verdant triumph reign let fruit trees bearing fruit in vigor grow which on the years their product may bestow and let the pregnant seeds of every kind to every herb and every tree assigned with springing grass the fields were covered over and herbs which in themselves their seedings bore in stately rows the spreading fruit trees stood bearing their proper seed and god pronounced it good so when arrived the evening and the morn thus far his work the third day did adorn jehovah said let glorious lights display their beamy splendour round the heavenly way which may distinguish night from cheerful day whilst in its orb each shining spark appears for signs for seasons and revolving years when strait with lights the crystal plain was spread that on the earth their dazzling luster shed two lights immensely great he formed in haste which in the skies were to advantage placed the greater orb to rule the burning day the less amidst the shades of night to stray and from the darkened space its beams convey to these the stars with twinkling luster bright he added to adorn the face of night high in the azure roof they took their place with their fair rays this under world to grace so when the godhead saw how all things stood his awful voice declared the labor good and when the evening and the morning closed the fourth days work in order was composed again the almighty spoke let now the watery field unnumberd shoals of moving creatures yield with a vast product of the feathered kind to fan with various wings the buxom wind huge whales he formed the monsters of the deep and creatures which on earths low surface creep with springing fowls that wing the airy steep each in themselves their proper kind contained that all was good his sacred tongue explained increase and multiply the maker said and over the earth be fruitfully conveyed full to the brim the foaming ocean lade and let the numerous fowl the land invade so when the evening and the morn rolled on the fifth days labor was completely done jehovah said let the obsequious earth produce a mingled instantancous birth of cattle creeping forms and beasts of prey and let their seed be stored in the cemented clay lest moldring time should wear the kind away the furious herds the shady forest trace low groveling reptiles print the flowery space and every creature filled his proper place the eternal looked and saw twas wondrous good cause all things in a just decorum stood thus from his seat the almighty did declare let us make man whose nobler form may bear our heavenly image and our likeness wear and let the finny race and every drove with beasts that round the globous ball shall rove and those whose belly sweep the dusty plain confess him lord and own his powerful reign in his own image god created man as male and female joined his hours began the father hand poured wondrous blessings round and with unmeasured bounty they were crowned increase be fruitful and the earth subdue the maker said this power is given to you rule with unrivaled sway the scaly land beast fishes birds each living thing command the lord went on behold to you i have given the use of every herb that is under heaven and every tree that bears fruit for food pleasing to life and to the palate good to every beast that roams the forest round and every creeping thing that crawls the ground with all the winged flocks the wholesome herbs whose green is with an everlasting verdure seen with this sweet grass they may their hunger ease and all its meagre ravenous troops appease then god surveyed the finished globe with care and lo the work appeared divinely fair so when the evening and the morning came the sixth days light smiid on the glorious frame lady chudleigh to mrs thomas    0 your various styles of cross and kind recals a custom to my

wrote that letter of the  0th and how peevish and splenatic in that of the   th but i ought to be the last who should arraign you since i know by unhappy experience it is not always to be avoided nor will i ever complain of the style when you take the pains to write and are not absolutely angry what pity it is that the brightest genius should not inhabit the strongest constitution and that our intellects must sympathize with those crazy machines our bodies which like barometers are affected with every change of air but it is always so the richest jewels are set in the most malleable metals and brass and iron serve for implements of common use it is very rare that one shall meet with a fine genius in a herculean figure and i am often induced to compare such persons to great houses where the garrets are generally the worst furnished  i must confess however they have an advantage which the others wants they are pleased better cheap and as they have less delicacy they find no difficulties to their satisfaction for it is certainly a misfortune to have a taste too refined for the age one lives in and to spin such cobweb notions of excellence as it is probable one may never find but in ones own treasury of ideas  i have often endeavored to correct in myself this research after what reason would persuade me was a nonentity but i could never make my relish descend to the

original see vol ii  most excellent youth this your reception of me in the entrance of your court with your obliging oration is truly acceptable i rejoice not so much that i am as that this house is adorned thereby which has always been esteemed the nursery of ingenuous education and i am with pleasure induced to believe that your cotemporaries are in all things like yourself in which expectation if i am not deceived you may with confidence assure yourselves of such incouragment and rewards as i have power to bestow  your congratulation select batchelour and that of your society is the more pleasing to me for that it proceeds from those who are grown up to a maturity of judgment enlarged and perfected by the precepts and instructions of philosophy and other various kinds of learning i wish i was altogether the man which i understand from you they take me to be he i truly am who with the utmost satisfaction behold a learned body of young men happily pressing after whatever is praiseworthy and who cannot therefore but greatly encourage the growing commendation of your house i know i shall hear much concerning your love of the profound sciences the commendable course of your studies and the progress of your learning from that worthy man the subdean of this house whose vigilance and industry if i can any ways assist he will find in me when occasion offers an active sharer of his care and counsel  most eloquent reader of rhetoric you indeed show yourself well fitted to that your province which you have sustained for many years with reputation when having so slender a subject to work upon you dignify and enlarge it with a plentiful flow of words and all the forceful charms of eloquence both i myself am but too conscious and you notwithstanding the great things you say of me cannot be insensible how little i deserve these commendations yet with what ingenuity and modesty do you treat me when not judging it convenient to admonish me publicly you have recourse to those rules of your art which say that an exhortation is then most effectual when you extol him whom you mean to excite if any therefore led away by this kind of speech should imagine that the virtues recited are mine great is his mistake it was designed to a different intent that whilst you thus discharged your own duty you might remind me of mine and your whole endeavor was that the auditors of this panegyric might understand not who i am but what he ought to be that has the honor to preside in this flourishing college who being placed over so numerous a body of those already learned and others yet a learning should be ever mindful to defend the cause of religion cultivate good manners and promote sound literature truly a very difficult undertaking however you show me the way to make it easier for even at this instant we cannot but remember those worthy men my predecessors in this trust from which remembrance you readily hit upon all those perfections required to compose a picture highly finished of the greatest man and the most skilful governor  however when i think of filling this post now fallen to my lot and consider my own abilities there arises a dread and diffidence sufficient to confound and overwhelm me nor am i ever so dispirited or out of love with myself as when fell and aldrich those two great luminaries of your commonwealth of letters present themselves to my remembrance for who has not reason to dread treading in the paths they trod who being endowed with the choicest gifts of nature furnished with a great variety of arts exercised in a long tract of academical employments brought this house which ever had its share of glory ever illustrious for its praise of learning to the utmost pitch of splendour and perfection  both of them were eagerly studious of knowledge and earnestly disposed to cultivate the liberal sciences both of them were possessed with extraordinary candor so as to cherish every appearance of virtue that presented itself ever interpreting favorably and to the milder sense whatever bore the face of doubt both of them were noble and generous not carried away with the thirst of riches or of honors they were careless of their private affairs but vigilant for the public good no man ever loved his family more ardently or cherished it with more affection than both of them did this house no mans country was ever dearer to him than this university to them by their own labor by their own cost to increase the art of printing to repair to rebuild these walls as it was always a care to them so was it a pleasure with these thoughts with these desires were they employed when living nor was there any intermission to the hour of their deaths you are not unacquainted with the things i speak of which so lately were and still are in your sight and hearing but be they rivetted ever so strongly in your minds the repetition of them will always be a pleasure and the remembrance of them delightful who excelled in every qualification that could be in man the image of that most humane man can never be forgot by me or you by whose demise this house as though it were deprived of a parent now lies in mourning and in sorrow god grant that now by my coming among you it may in some measure be refreshed and comforted to him nothing was wanting which indulgent nature could bestow either to the propagating or embellishment of learning nothing which could excite either the love or admiration of those over whom he presided what perspicuity what strength of thought what a ready utterance was he endowed with applying himself to different kinds of learning with ease and quickness never at a loss nor a stranger to any sort of literature that was laid before him whatsoever he undertook in any art was performed to exactness so that one might say he was alone born for that part which he then sustained and that all his time and labor had been employed therein whether he followed more serious studies or delighted himself with those of less consequence whether he treated of divine or moral subjects you could not perceive which he was more capable to perform this or that but then in his address and conversation in his recess and business how genteel was his behavior how plain and open was his mind what integrity in his life what truth in his words what modesty in his countenance what gracefulness in his front adorned with these gifts of nature that which often seems morose and severe in abstrase learning he was wont to allay with a wonderful pleasantness so that he could mould and form the minds of young beginners not barely by his precepts and instructions but by his aspect and engaging manner to the love of learning and all the praises of humanity in this man were many things admirable many things excellent but nothing more so than that he held the memory of blessed fell in singular regard and veneration looking upon him and declaring him to be the unerring guide and pattern of all his public actions the best master for the instruction and government of youth a restorer of that discipline which was interrupted amongst us in the times of distraction and in a word the guardian establisher of this spacious building and truly ever since a way was opened for the return of true religion and sound learning to this place from whence it was driven whatsoever this house has contributed to the help of science or the increase of piety whatsoever benefit has accrued from it to the church or state all flows from the labor care and counsels of that most holy prelate by him was laid the foundation of our praises by him were sown the seeds of virtue industry and learning which even now flourish and which from him both living and dead has so often ripened into a plenteous and joyful harvest  as often therefore as i consider this body still flourishing by the instructions of fell methinks i see that well planted field which cyrus formerly showed lysander where if i may say so one might admire the height ranks and regular disposition of trees the ground cultivated smooth and clean with the sweet and flagrant odor wafted from the flowers but above all the diligence and industry of him by whom they were thus planted and designed  happy that husbandman of ours who can truly say with cyrus all these have i thus disposed mine is the order the design is mine many of these trees have i also planted with my own hands for the benefit of this and perhaps of the coming generation to me therefore in the discharge of this office shall i say it was a happiness or a misfortune immediately to succeed such eminent men what now remains but that i who am diffident of my own abilities should rouse myself up by the contemplation of those virtues with

0th      sir as you intend to publish the life of that eminent antiquary mr thomas hearne it is to be wished that it might be complete and just not in that manner as it was set out about four years ago by a chaplain of all souls college which was intended rather as a sneer upon mr hearne the gentlemen herein hinted at is the reverend mr bilson who published mr hearnes vindication of taking the oath of allegiance the preface to which is so far from sneer that it contains many judicious remarks and is a full detection of our antiquarys gross errors than to give us an impartial account of his life and writings  among the manuscripts he has left is a diary of his life interspersed spersed with many curious passages characters and his whole conversation and correspondence till within a few days of his death  i am sir your humble servant pq   july        sir i received yours much too late and after a solemn promise to the gentleman you mentioned not to communicate aught without permission relating to him this i could not but comply with as yourself well know the friendship and long correspondence between us so that i must not contribute but if called upon by any who may hereafter do him the honor designed by you as i hope nothing else is or that any thing mean trifling or injurious will be handed into the world  your etc ab   july  0      sir as to the gentlemans character you intend to attack i must desire to be excused if i dont concern myself he is dead and has answered elsewhere and how far his censures are just i know not he cannot now defend himself de mortuis nil nisi bonum as to the gentleman to whom the mss are left i will not encourage you or any body to apply to him by the will you will find he has directions from the testator as to that affair and he is a man of too nice honor not to strictly adhere to them so that all manner of application there will be ineffectual  your etc ab   our correspondent ab is very tenacious of the antiquarys character we hope he will not find any thing mean trifling or injurious unless doing justice to that truly fine gentleman walter moyle esquire may be mistakenly so deemed  as to the good old caution he gives de mortuis etc instead of which mr hearne cries cut ad plures abiit  it were to be wished that mr hearne had had more regard to it himself but neither he nor his predecessor wood had any the least regard either for the characters of the living or the memory of the dead the writings of both being over loaded with calumny  a catalogue of mr hearnes works is annexed to most of the books he has published among which we cannot point out any thing useful unless it be his ductor historicus and his index to the earl of clarendons history  philalethes   the life of mr thomas hearne that he may never be forgotten who has raked the repositaries of antiquity and been indefatigable in fetching learning from places where many would not have sought after it a few memorials of his life and some observations on his writings will we hope redound to his credit  in the parishregister of abbots or whitewaltham a village about six miles distant from windsor it stands upon record that he was baptized by the name of thomas son of george hearne and edith his wife on the eleventh of june      his father we have been informed was a considerable antiquary of the lower class and was sacristan of that parochial church to the day of his death so that mr hearne in all probability received his great propensity to the study of antiquity as it were ex traduce  it is agreed on all hands that his early inclination to letters first discovered itself among the tumuli of his own parish churchyard over which he was observed to be continually plodding lmost as soon as he was master of the english alphabet to this soon after adding a little writing he grew impatient after antiquity resolved never to be unprepared for collecting materials that might be serviceable hereafter and accordingly stuffed his diary which was his constant companion with every occurrence worthy his notice this he prudently foresaw would turn to a good account in his more advanced years vacancies in his future labors might be supplied with a story from his journal and though it might not be very methodical or perhaps not at all to his purpose in hand yet the design of preserving it might sufficiently justify its publication  this was the advantageous method he pursued all his life time he copied monuments and inscriptions original letters and venerable ballads of antiquity stories of honest john ross and peter langtoft robert of brune and st thomas cantilupe men who had not mr hearne lived might have lain for ever buried in an ignoble obscurity the preservation of these things may be ascribed to his collectanea which are now swelled to a prodigious size  it is difficult indeed to determine to what particular number these mss volumes are now grown because they are kept with as strict and sacred a care from the eyes of mankind as the sea dr prideauxs account of these choice leaves in the     page of vol   of his connection where we find that none but the keepers of them were ever suffered to peruse them and they only upon particular exigencies oracles of the sibylls deposited in the capitol the highest number we have yet seen quoted by himself is cxxiii in his preface to the p    annals of john of trokelowe so that notwithstanding there can be no certain calculation made of an exact number yet there is some room for a conjecture that they are not fewer than five hundred  several passages there are in his rob de glouc vol   p     xcv volume which enough convince us of his not being then arrived at years of discretion notwithstanding he had filled so many of them if therefore his industry was as great in his advanced years as in his youth which we believe all will allow when they consider the uninterrupted state of health he all along enjoyed we think we may be allowed not to have exceeded the number but rather to have fallen short of it this however we only took notice of to show what an inestimable loss the world must sustain should this prodigious treasure perish with its collector  this digression we hope the reader will pardon and so without dwelling on the first eight or ten years of his life we shall follow him to the school where we are told he laid the foundation of his future greatness  it was happy for him as well as the world that he fell into the hands of a good mr gibson author of the excellent grammatical exceptions against the late alterations made in the common accidence and grammar master at bray school it being a malancholly thing to consider how many great genii have either been cramped or utterly spoiled through the ignorance or indolence of trifling pedagogues here he soon mastered the rudiments of learning and by a gradual but speedy progress became acquainted with the roman and greek historians  thus encouraged by the pregnancy of his parts his assiduous industry and proficiency in school learning his liberal friend mr cherry of shettesbroke berks this gentleman paid for mr hearnes education which he has gratefully acknowledged thought them sufficient motives to the continuance of his bounty and sent him accordingly in the year mdcxcv with a considerable addition to the university of oxford fortune here again if we are rightly informed seemed particularly fond of him the vicar white kennet ma afterward bp of peterborough of the parish where his benefactor lived was at that time a considerable tutor in edmund hall and in the study of antiquity most eminently remarkable through this gentlemans means he was admitted into this place and used more like a son than barely a pupil by him  a few years being spent in academical learning by the help of which he had improved his propensity to antiquity he gave the world a specimen of his future designs in the year mdccii but seven years from his matriculation he published a copious index of the principal passages in sir roger lestranges translation of josephus which seems to have met with so good a reception that the same was reprinted not long after in an octavo edition in mdcciii he obliged the world with or at least occasioned the publication of the reliquiae bodleianae or some genuine remains of sir thomas bodley adding the same year to his other labors plinys epistles and panegyric with various lections and annotations not to mention his edition of eutropius with many other things published all in this year in mdcciv and v came out that laborious work called doctor historious in two volumes   vo being a short system of universal history and an introduction to the study of it  it would be almost endless to expatiate particularly on his labors or to give an account of the product of every year for which reason we must refer the reader to his own printed catalogue of them inserted at the end of every book he published since they became numerous  during this period however it is observable that his vindication of those who take the oath of allegiance was written which loudly speaks in the behalf of mr hearnes industry and shows the early application he had made to books the many just quotations in it from sacred history as well as profane from acts of parliament and lawyers of the greatest name we flatter ourselves will excuse our writing a panegyric and its authors name recommend it enough to the perusal of mankind  in mdcciii on the  d of july he took the degree of master of arts and had no sooner completed it but the eyes of the whole university were upon him his industry was almost become a proverb and notwithstanding a little surliness of temper which it is thought he brought into the world with him and which probably increased with his severe studies he met with friendship in a great many and much respect from all men  i should have mentioned indeed before this the encouragement he had from the dr hudson principal of st maryhall head librarian who acquainted with his diligence made him underkeeper of the bodleian library there he had room enough for his inquisitive genius to range in of which he made so good a use that the product of every year afterward may justly be ascribed to the acquisitions he had made in this treasure of learning  after some years spent in this way of printing indexes itineraries and collectanea his labors met with an additional reward being on the   th of jan        elected architypographus of the university and superior beadle of civil law leland collect vol   p    this we find him acknowledging with pleasure and humility to be an honor which he took the first opportunity of mentioning to the world on purpose that his gratitude might be made known to posterity and notwithstanding he was conscious to himself that the university favors were conferred upon one who every way undeserved them in respect of learning and other requisite qualifications yet still he had very good reason for accepting them upon this account amongst others as they seasonably assisted and relieved one of their members who had for many years led an obscure and retired life and was at that time reduced to a necessitous condition through the great expense he had been at in carrying on many public designs  in this happy posture of affairs one would have imagined he might have been easy and satisfied but neither friendship nor preferment could put a stop to his enquiry after truth soon after this promotion he acquired better reasons to himself at least for noncompliance with the oaths which were necessary for keeping it than he had before for the acceptance of it and accordingly resigned that advantageous post which the university had so lately consered on him as inconsistent with his conscience or at least his manner of thinking  ever since he steadily adhered to the principles of a nonjuror spent his time in annually obliging the world with something relating to the history of england or with some other affairs as they accidentally have fallen in his way both for the benefit and pleasure of mankind here we think he might have been left still laboring at the oar deserving the favor and compliments of the learned upon his yearly revival of something as it were lost to every one but himself acta

duritie pot ius lumen elidentem videor videre these passages how much soever they may look like ridicule to men who deal only in polite learning are still undoubted confirmations of mr hearnes industry and will ever be thought so by persons of deeper penetration  amongst many qualities remarkable in him his strict and unshaken integrity is none of the least no regard for any ones merit could ever prevail with him to connive at their errors he chose rather to break off the strictest friendship than to be led aside by it in his search after truth nay his very gratitude when it interfered with his integrity was at once renounced as no longer binding leland collect vol   p    operae pretium est says he lectorem monere me nulla alia de causa a richardsono dissentire nisi quod veritatem aliis quibuscunque amicitiis anteferendam esse censeam and in another place alured  p    ed collineat operum nostrorum scopus ut veritatem pro virili asseramus cui litavimus  there is one thing indeed relating to university college to which society he leland itin p     declares himself indebted which it would really be a fault in us not to take notice of because we are positive his veritatis amor can never be reconciled with it  during the late unhappy contest in that house occasioned by the death of dr charlett mr hearne published peter langtofts chronicle at the end of the second volume of which he adds a glossary upon english words upon the word writ he has it thus we commonly understand by writ the same with the latin breve a written order or precept from the king or court of judicature by which any thing is commanded to be done relating to suit or action  had he left off here he had done very well rob de avesbury praef p   sed ad agendum nati sumus are his own words upon which principle we suppose he proceeded in this place of this kind he tells us is that remarkable one relating to university college of king richard the second with his seal annexed which he just saw and hastily run over  whether he ever saw this instrument we shall not scruple at present but whether there is any seal to it or has been within the compass of mr hearnes years we leave to the enquiries of the fellows of that society  the same he tells us was done afterward expressly by king henry vi in a writing quoted from the muniments of the same college by b twyne apolog antiq acad oxon p     mr twyne the thing will appear best to the reader if we produce the passage printed by mr twyne and the translation of it by mr hearne  nam cum temporibus henrici sexti inter guilielmum abbatem de osney and richardum witton illius collegii magistrum esset controversia etc and then follows the instrument itself which is only a common form in the case of a lawsuit drawn by some attorney which mr hearne without the least authority whatever makes to be one of these writs or precepts from the king or court of judicature relating to the depending suit between the abbot of osney and richard whitton then master of the college  how he came to translate temporibus hen vi ti by the order of henry the vith looks more like design than blunder though we would not suggest that he had any intent of giving a turn to a cause then depending in some measure upon such instruments as he would have made this  the annals of this college lately published by mr smith we find gave our antiquary some distaste but upon what bottom this anger is raised a little enquiry if the reader will permit will soon discover  in his preface to sprott pref p    dr sprott we find this gentleman a very great favorite of mr hearnes whose character there given is vir pereruditus and benevolus but we are afraid his temper grew four and morose as he advanced in years in his preface to the life of richard ii we have another account of mr smith viz scriptor ille ferreus atque mendax gulielmus faber de joh rosso tam malign passim locutus est  haec in gratiam gulielmi fabri ecclesiae anglicanae quod vix credas sacerdotis qui multum temporis in isto uno  scil antiquitatis studio consumsit nuperque jam pene octogenavius librum prolixum annals collegii universitatis verbo haud satis apto appellatum lingua vernacula conscripsit ne dicam conscribillavit and in publicum protrusit  we cannot but observe here that mr smiths age is made a part of his bad character when old age by some more sacred writers than mr hearne is thought honorable rather than scandalous many other sentences there are in this preface which abound with the same sort of language of this reverend old gentleman which the veritatis amor can never justify  life of rich   pref p    one passage there is respecting sprott whose authority we own we have some reason to scruple which proves that mr hearne had either not kept up to his avowed regard for truth or else had unhappily blundered in a point of chronology though he abused mr smith for it in the very same case his words are these sprottus floruit an dom      long nimirum citius quam exoptat guil faber qui  immemor audectar falsoque retulit ranulphum higdenum primum omnium fuisse qui de scholis aluredianis aliquid tradidit etc  it is observable here in the fifth place that sprott lived according to mr hearnes own confession in      which was in the reign of edward the first that he studied in ea part aedis christi quam vulgo vocant quadrangulum cantuariense and that he wrote of canterbury college and left a book behind him concerning it is evident from the above cited preface to sprotts chronicle  this is a very surprising canterbury tale indeed and that would make sprott provided it could be proved more famous than the samian philosopher who by the help of transmigration passed through two or three successive stages of generation but never under the same name  sprott who lived in      in the reign of edward the first studied in canterbury college which was not built till      and therefore agreeable to this account must either have lived about    years before he was born or at least written of a place as many years before it was built  this mistake we would have accounted for in our authors behalf had it been in our power but as it was not we left it to himself who was better qualified to reconcile difficulties of this nature  another slip of this kind appears in page  0  of his collection of curious discourses academia says he scripsit guilielmo wykham episcopo winton ut illis accommodaret machinas quarum open scholam theologicam voltis and fornicibus exornarent it is very well known that the divinity school for which this loan was desired was built in the year      by tho kempe bishop of london this mr hearne allows in the page preceding the place before cited le neve p     william of wikham bp of winton died the   th of sept   0  so that according to this assertion the university sent to him ut illis accommodaret machinas etc  0 years after his death rymer foed vol   p     rymer in his foedera tells us that hen beaufort bp of winton died the  d id of april      and was succeeded by william waynflete who lived in possession of the same till      so that if for wikham we read waynflete as the person petitioned to by the university we shall come within the time of building the divinity school and set mr hearne right in his chronology this we believe was an alteration of no design but only a simple thoughtless blunder mistakes of this sort we shall conclude with an assertion of his relating to university college where he makes william of durham to have studied in the great hall which was not bought for the use of william of durhams scholars till     years after his death  as for the censure passed upon mr smith in the passage above cited which really is too severe without better grounds for it we may venture to say it is unjustifiable for supposing that sprotts book was written before higdens yet still mr smith who had never seen or heard of it till he had finished his annals might undoubtedly say and consistent with truth too that ralph higden was the first he ever had met with quoted as a friend to the weak cause of k alfreds halls and who seemed first to have introduced this novelty into the world  mr hearne therefore in the former case seems to deserve the sentence of being  immemor and int he latter to be very ungenteel to make no worse of it leland collect vol   p     utinam igitur auctor noster to use almost his own words errores expungat librumque retractationum ipse confestim edat crimenque nefandum quod clerico huic digno intulit pro virili eluat hoc enim non extorsit veritatis amor  whilst we are thus impartially considering our antiquarys character by setting him right in his mistakes as well as commending his virtues one thing occurs which we should have been glad never to have had the opportunity of correcting about twenty years before the publication of the life of richard ii which was wrote by one of the monks of evesham our author in his leland itin pref p    preface to the seventh volume of lelands itinerary expresses a hearty concern for the just rights of the crown in opposition to those who in order to advance and maintain republican principles strain their inventions to give a wrong turn to and pervert the true meaning of our best historians and studiously asperse blacken and desame the memory of king charles the ii as others with less modesty have done that of k charles the i what he has said upon these points he hoped no ingenuous or impartial person will think uncharitalle or unbecoming  these are sounding words and express a great deal of loyalty to the memory of those princes but such fickle things are our memories that sometimes they seem to take pleasure in exposing us hence doubtless it was that mr hearne lately run counter to his own above cited declarations it must be forgetsulness we hope so at least that will suffer a man to draw his own character in an infamous i light and whether he has not done it to the life let the reader judge when he has heard the accusation and is referred to the place where he may soon inform himself  at the latter page  0  end of the life of richard the  d there is a letter printed and mr  hearne says an original one of charles the first when prince of wales it is directed to the duke of buckingham and interpreted by the publisher of it as carrying on an affair of gallantry be the letter what it will original or not he ought to have given a better reason for making it public he was apprehensive he tells us that if such a letter should be stifled some persons might interpret it an instance of partiality and be apt to make base reflections upon it let us examine this kind of reasoning a little the stifling this letter would have been thought an instance of partiality the reason of which must be this because mr hearne was necessarily obliged to publish every thing he met with and then he says that some persons would be apt to make base reflections on it on the letter we snppose which if stifled they might never see or hear of or if he meant those gentlemen who communicated it to him he again forgot his veritatis amor because they never intended it should be printed that it might escape therefore all censure he published it in a heap of appendixes and curae secvndae and made it a hundred times more easy for base reflections to be cast on it than it was before  this is the reason given for publishing this letter in the next book printed by him which was trokelowes annals of edward the  d we have an apology in his preface for the very same thing the letter became the subject of almost every ones discourse and a reflection cast upon a prince remarkable for his uncommon chastity could not but be taken notice of by many of his friends whether it had like to have discontinued any of his subscriptions or whether he had more maturely considered the matter we cannot say this however is plain that his apology was designed to give a softer turn than was hinted in his explanation of the letter and that he had rather have it thought that the prince was unwarily misled than inclined to this gallantry  it had been more prudent and we may add less officious in mr hearne whilst he was thus endeavoring to clear himself to have first got leave for the printing this letter from the gentleman who showed it him and who we are informed since so highly resents it that he broke off a friendship with him which had been kept very strict for many years we must subjoin by the way that it is certainly a greater instance of partiality to publish a letter as an original which the editor could not at that time nor afterward prove to be so  the apology will appear upon a little consideration not at all inferior to his reason for printing it especially if we observe that though he did not know what the intrigue was yet he happily conjectured by making the prince to be enticed like joseph by the importunity of a lewd mistress though we do not remember that joseph ever wrote to a third person about his affair nay it may be remarked farther that mr hearne makes the this blunder reached our authors ears and in his preface to tho caius stands corrected th with some reluctance for he says it signifies nothing whether it was pharoahs or potiphars wife wife of pharaoh the importunate woman when the scriptures assure us it was potiphars spouse that was so deeply smitten with the comeliness of the hebrew but a man may possibly forget his bible who is so very much taken up with adam de domerham and the black book of the exchequer etc  had this unfortunate prince lived some hundred years before he did mr hearnes love for antiquity might probably have engaged him in his defense rather than in exposing him we find him in the page    appendix to lelands collectanea very angry with tyrrel the historian for staining the reputation of ethelred and his first queen there he says it is a great crime to scandalize any person the heinousness of it increases according to the dignity of the person of whom the scandal is raised but this says he may be wiped off by a public retraction  this was good doctrine had not a preface to candens queen elizabeth showed that men do not always practice as they advise but a public retractation which from the ingenuousness of mr hearnes dposition we had reason to think he would make might wipe off the blemish he may have contracted either in the case of prince charles or the indecent language given mr smith his pretense to strict integrity we were almost confident would prevail with him to do it in a better manner than disguising it in a trifling apology and as he was a strict enquirer after truth and is by this time convinced it was wrong to publish the letter or abuse the aged divine we do not doubt but that he retracted what he had said in both cases and frustrated the expectations of some people who thought he delighted in abuse though we hope he acowledged our friendship in setting him right  thus have we considered one of his excellent qualities the next is his fidelity as an editor  one rule which we have been informed he at first laid down and generally speaking closely observed was always to follow his authors religiously their mistakes by this means were punctually copied and sacredly preserved nay the very blunders of transcribers were faithfully penned down for the amusement of posterity prurigo emendandi ac commutandi a nobis plane absit are his own words in the notes after the appendix of john of trokelowes annals of edward the second and again in leland itin vol   p    lelands itinerary he declares that he was so nice in this affair that i observed says he mr lelands way of spelling and omitted nothing not so much as the asterisks and other notes of that nature which had been inserted by him nor did we leave out even those words that are plainly redundant nor pretend to alter those which are manifestly wrong and occasioned by the haste the author was in or else by the defect of his memory  this method is very observable throughout the numerous volumes he has obliged the world with sic ms he has noted perhaps in the margin to show that he was not ignorant of the error in the copy delenda sunt ut opinor may possibly be seen at the bottom of one page and lege etc at another here perhaps may be a desunt etc and there a subintellige etc but still amidst all these regulations the text is generally kept purely corrupt and scarce a blunder through the whole but what is very industriously preserved nay so great a regard had he for the old way of spelling that the following epistle which we have printed as like the original as possibly we could is a standing proof of it  there are indeed a few cases in which he has varied from this rule history of rich ii p  0  cur sec which might have been concealed  had we not been apprehensive to use his own words in another case that some persons if such slips should be stifled might have interpreted it a great instance of partiality and made base reflections upon it one of this nature we must not pass by lest his character should prevail as probably it might with some men hereafter to establish his errors for truths  dr hutton student of christchurch about the year      dr leonard hutton in his antiquities of oxford has quoted a line from shepreves life of dr claymond president of corpus dr claymond concerning a shed which formerly stood in the cornmarket built to skreen the corn from the weather upon this there was an inscription and the copy from whence he transcribed it had it thus viz ut possit sircum saccus habere locum   in this verse there appears a palpable error which a reader of no extraordinary capacity might have discovered and corrected but see the misfortune of not following an old rule by an unhappy conjecture he has wandered from his copy and to make better sense of it he has acted the critics part and mended sircum with circum but we think the alteration of this letter makes but little difference in the sense the lines as we copied them from the manuscript life now in the musaeum at oxford run thus viz plebs ubi rura colens empturis hordea vendit aspice quadrifido tecta propinqua foro hoc erexit opus talem claymundus in usum ut siccum possit saccus habere locum   whether this mistake arose from his not having an ear for the monkish music an error of the like nature may serve to determine  antiq glaston p     in the catalogue of his works annexed to the history of glastonbury he has published an inscription in the following manner now to be seen in the remains of rewly ele longespe comitisse de vervic viscera svnt hic mr wood saw this entire but afterward it was broken and unskilfully placed in a wall of one of the lower rooms of a monastery adjoining oxon rewly where mr hearne says he has often seen it and that it is very legible in this ancient inscription we find there is a jingle too and had it been so legible as he declares it was when he saw it we are surprised that he of all men would be so inaccurate a copyer a trade he followed all his life as to transpose one word and add another instead of taking it as it really is ele de werwick comitisse viscera sunt hic the word longespe inserted in his account of it is not upon the stone how legible soever he asserted it to be and the spelling of werwick quite altered by him without the least authority whatever but his own  this blunder may in some measure be accounted for in this manner  there is now in the anatomy school which was formerly under the care of mr hearne a stone found at rewly probably the foundationstone of a chapel there bearing this inscription  ele longesp commit warew hanc capellam fecit this no doubt had often been perused by our antiquary as well as the other before mentioned and perhaps the trusting too much to memory might raise a confused notion of both inscriptions and corrupt the monkish jingle in the former case  these few mistakes then having taken their rise from not sticking closely to his copy we shall take notice of but one more which was occasioned by following it too closely and it may be seen in his edition of that valuable ms latino graec fol    ms which is said to have belonged formerly to venerable bede  let it be observed in the first place that this ms is in very old capital letters and each page divided into two columns the first contains the latin the greek is wrote collaterally in the other through the oscitancy of the scribe the latin sentence is frequently carried beyond the bounds of its own column by which means it becomes intermixed with the greek the text as he has printed it stands thus viz mirari coepervnt ethayaon et confvndebantvr entekaidieegrpopoyn at the bottom of his page not contented with dr millss reading he adds sic plane in codice nostro non  ut apud millium though it will appear beyond all dispute upon any ones enquiry that the doctor was not in the least to be blamed for as we observed before through the carelessness of the scribe the latin line being carried beyond its due bounds into the greek column and the words mente and men te consisting of five capital letters just the same in both languages unhappily led mr hearne into this mistake so that by defalcating one word from the latin and converting it into two greek ones of no signification at all he spoiled the sense of the one and made the other quite superfluous  but some faults sure are pardonable in so voluminous a writer  to be particular in showing his talent at reasoning would we fear be making too free with our readers time we might quote three parts of his discourse on the stunsfield pavement had not mr peyntr thoroughly considered it already and give such instances of it which nothing but envy or ill nature could find fault with but the following epistle prevents our dwelling upon this excellency it being a masterpiece of its kind and what the reader we hope will be greatly delighted with  but let the epistle speak for itself there is one paragraph in his page       preface to sprotts chronicle which really seems to be a new method of reasoning such as no writer but himself we believe dares lay any claim to he is there speaking in sprotts praise and his words are these  adeo ut non videam cur mihi sit detrimento si public declarem me opinari de academia nostra oxoniensi opus etiam justum ac distinctum contexuisse and then comes the reason in the very next sentence viz opinioni favet auctoris pietas quod si tu aliter sentias ego in sententia non perstabo nec quorsum recidant quaecunque animadverti magnopere laborabo si modo illud concesseris de collegio cantuariensi opus post se reliquisse in quo multa itidem de tota academia e monumentis praeclaris obiter notaverit  this is the argument produced to prove that the author of that lean chronicle whether sprott or some other it not clearly appearing that sprott was the author of it composed many other valuable books not at all inferior to the chronicle which is published great pity indeed that such profitable works should be buried in obscurity and doubtless was there not some hope of their being still recoverable sprotts admirers how inflexible soever in other cases would lament greatly under their loss in this  agreeable to this new method of reasoning we find an uncommon conjecture in his preface to the sixth volume of lelands itinerary which very few writers would ever have made from a medal of carausius bearing this inscription victoria cea he endeavors to prove that the brogue of the common people is the true standard of the roman dialect and pronunciation the word caesar according to this curious remark is not to be pronounced as it generally is by people of fashion and breeding caesar but agreeable to the broad manner of speaking used by the most rustic of mankind and as it stands upon the coin ceasar  we acknowledge the observation to be a very curious one and to stand upon the authority of a medal but if it should ever be discovered that it proceeded from an error of the mintmaster from a simple literal transposition or from any other accident as possibly it might the remark will then sink into its value the coin indeed may be curious upon the account of the blunder but is no more an argument to ascertain the truth of dialect or pronunciation than that spurious halfpenny of his present majesty would be a standard in the next age for pronouncing geogivs instead of georgius  it would waste too much of the readers time probably to offer here a collection of all the poetical fragments scattered through his labors the preservation of which by printing them we must observe shows no small desire to be useful to mankind as these rhythmes contain either lessons of economy such as with a red man read thy read with a brown man break thy bread at a pale man draw thy knife from a black man keep thy wife rob glouc   vol p     or an account of an ancient local custom ule ule ule ule three puddings in a pule crack nuts and cry ule rob glouc p      or else an illustration of a pedigree william de coningsby came out of britany with his wife tiffany and his maid manfas and his dog hardegrass   thus have we collected some memorials of mr hearnes life and have taken the liberty to correct some few mistakes in his writing in a thing of such moment we have been very careful not to offend any impartial reader we have avoided flattery on the one hand and scandal on the other we have described his good qualities as they occurred and rectified such as must be acknowledged to have been gross errors and such as he would not pass over in any author that fell in his way either living or dead nay if any person differed from him but in his own private opinion it was ground sufficient for him to let loose the reins of his utmost vengeance a flagrant and very unjustifiable instance of which we shall here produce  in the year      mr hearne in the catalogue of trifles of which he had been the editor subjoined to one of his most trifling ones johannis

judgment of mr moyles works  as to my clypeus votivus for such the best antiquaries judge it to be mr moyle passes sentence upon it without ever having seen it from two very imperfect sketches of dr clarke and drakensberg and without having consulted mr dodwells excellent book de parma etc where he might have seen the question of the theaters fairly discussed in order to the ascertaining the true antiquity of the shield that truly learned man is far from carrying the antiquity of it up to the time of the sacking of rome by the gauls so that mr moyle in demolishing that notion only demolishes a mere fancy of his own but that it was ancient is agreed by the best judges of all nations and the baron spanheim and mr abednego sellers two of the most learned men of the last century thought it so considerable that they had both begun to write dissertations on it but were both prevented finishing them by death  this treatment of mr moyle was by mr curll a bookseller in london very justly reprehended who with an edition he had printed of mr moyles works published in his life time sent the following letter to anthony hammond esquire as an apology for his friend mr moyle some account of whose life and writings he had just then published  let us a little consider sir says mr curll the antagonists mr moyle has met with through the management of mr sergeant mr thomas sergeant of the tower published mr moyles posthumous works as the whole of his writings without so much as taking notice of what that gentleman had himself published as to the attacks of mess whiston and woolston relating to the thundering legion their guides are so very bad that i dare say their followers will be very few i shall therefore content my self with what monsieur le clerc observes upon a particular occasion see bibliotheque choice artic of mr addisons remarks on italy etc mr addison is of opinion says he that the figure of jupiter pluvius sending down rain on the fainting army of marcus aurelius and thunderbolts on his enemies is the greatest confirmation possible of the story of the thundering legion this learned man would apparently mean to say that this figure is a monument of the shower which fell on the roman army and of the thunder which confounded the germans for as to the thundering legion the learned are agreed that it had that denomination long before this circumstance and that there is no probability that it was entirely made up of christians see henry de valois upon eusebius lib   cap   and father pagi upon the year clxxiv  thus with monsieur le clerc i leave this thundering legend and may it still continue to lead up the van of miracles in the romish church for as mr moyle well remarks as it took its name from paganism see his posthum works vol   p     it is most proper that it should end in popery  i shall by and by incur the same censure as mr moyle has undergone for i freely acknowledge that i have the same opinion of archibishop tillotson which he had of bishop sanderson that he had more judgment than all the fathers put together and i believe the same character might justly be given of bishop tailor bishop pearson dr barrow and that truly great man you have named bishop stilling fleet and several other of our english divines  before i mention any part of mr hearnes charge i shall give a summary of mr moyles religious principles in his own words viz if men says he would but consider that it is not only our duty but our interest to be virtuous one would think this were no hard task to perform viz reforming the manners of the people and restoring them to their ancient sobriety and virtue among a thousand advantages that christianity has above all other religions this is none of the least that it has united our interest and our duty together would not a wise man be chaste for the sake of health honest for the sake of profit temperate for the sake of pleasure and all three for the sake of fame for vice was never yet so triumphant as to be in greater reputation than virtue these considerations together with the innumerable mischiefs and inconveniences which attend a vicious course of life ought in reason to reclaim men from all unmanly excesses one would think in a christian nation that religion and conscience our own hopes and fears the prospect of eternal happiness or endless misery should be considerations strong enough to lay an effectual restraint on the most violent lusts and appetites  one of the greatest obstacles in my opinion to the reformation of manners is that too many men place all virtue and religion in warmly adhering to the interest of this or that particular sect or party as if a fiery zeal for the church or the meeting house could atone for lewdness and debauchery or as if vicious and immoral men could be of any christian church or community see his charge to the grand jury at lseard  works vol   p             and       now sir though i should be as far from interrupting the indefatigable labors of mr hearne in his historical studies as any man living yet i think no man ought to be indefatigable in slander and that the unchristian temper he has shown ought to be reprehended and it gives me no small concern to find the grave style of an antiquarian changed to the foulmouthed language of the most abandoned prostitute neither can i by any means agree that whatever unguarded expressions mr moyle may have dropped can be just grounds of provocation for such scurrility as i believe never before fell from the pen of any controvertist but mr moyle has himself hit the right nail on the head in the passage above cited mr moyle was a professed whig and a hearty wellwisher to his country mr hearne is a professed nonjuror and a fiery bigot to those of his own principles with him pope clement the xi and mr dodwell were equally infallible and in the true meaning of the word i believe so too mr moyle as a whig must be a republican a contemner of religions one who had a natural antipathy to the clergy and their friends a mere ignoramus and in good ecclesiastical charity gone to the devil i cannot help therefore asking you sir whether you really think the positions advanced by mr moyle in his lescardcharge or any part of his conduct to which you were ever a witness could deserve such treatment especially from one who never knew him otherwise than by his writings  as to the critical dispute i shall be as silent as i resolve to be about the legendary one above mentioned yet i cannot help observing that what dr woodward says is very merrily dogmatical for he will have it that mr hearne forms a right judgment of all mr moyle s works  because the best antiquaries have judged his shield to be a clypeus votivus and mr moyle is highly criminal and passes sentence upon it without ever having seen it otherwise than by two draughts now i would only ask the learned doctor one plain question if i see the picture of a horse am i to believe the living animal it represents to be a bear but indeed he descends a little and says that the baron spanheim and mr sellers intended to write dissertations upon it and that some other antiquarians really believed it to be an antique anglice the back of an old sconce which i have been credibly informed he bought in ragfair  as to that piece of mr dodwells which mr hearne complains is imperfectly printed it is to be hoped he will oblige the learned world with a more correct copy though this imputation does not lie against mr moyle but against the person who transmitted that piece to him  may mr hearne hereafter retain a more christian temper may his useful studies as you are pleased to call them meet with all the success he can expect and may the scurrillous cavils both of him and every other writer meet with that just contempt which is due to such performances this is the hearty wish of  sir yours etc e curll   upon this occasion mr curll also wrote the following letter to mr hearne viz  sir your late invective against mr moyle i shall prove to be wholly groundless and therefore it turns upon yourself  in the first place you will have it that all who dissent from mr dodwell are a set of abandoned wretches and such indeed was walter moyle esquire whose posthumous works all good men ought to lay aside for reasons hereafter to be considered as to mr dodwell i had above twenty years intimate correspondence with him and always believed him to be a learned and very pious man but at the same time all who knew him will allow that mr drydens character of a certain peer in absalom and achitophel too much resembled mr dodwell for he truly was what the poet asserts stiff in opinions mostly in the wrong was every thing by starts and nothing long the first book i ever printed was the present of a manuscript he made me in defense of his now sufficiently exploded doctrine of the divine imortalizing spirit transfused by baptism an explication of a famous passage in the dialogue of st justin martyr with tryphon concerning the immortality of human souls etc  vo printed in the year   0  price   s   d  and if you will undertake to vindicate every notion he advanced god speed the plough secondly you will have it that mr moyle treats with great contumacy and arrogance many of the best and most excellent authors as well ancient as modern though you name none but your doctissimus woodwardus vir clarissimus of whom more in the sequel and you add he does not spare even the holy fathers of whom he confidently asserts that bishop sanderson had more judgment than all of them put together and i am as confident that every man of judgment in europe believes this article of mr moyles creed  now since your breast is animated with so much heat in behalf of these venerabilia the fathers i desire to know by what better authority than a popish canonization are they invested with the epithet of holy if indeed all the libertinism of youth be sufficient to confer that title and all the impotence of age be sufficient to confirm it the plea is good and the precedents produced may be st augustine st origin and that notorious saint of creedmaking memory st athanasius who in their works may say of each other  quantum mutatus ab illo therefore as to their sacredness i think it may be fairly said to be extinct upon these considerations indeed you ought to be sorry and ashamed to mention mr moyle as you have done  thirdly with what face other than that of an assuming arrogance can you say that mr moyle was but a superficial writer after dean prideaux with whom certainly you will have the modesty to own you cannot stand in competition has thanked him for the pains he had taken about his connection and declares that he should have been glad of the assistance of so learned a friend near him to whom he might have communicated that history before it was printed posth works vol   p    you farther add with an equal share of confidence and falsehood as will appear from the sentiments of learned men that he was one who on account of his hatred to the clergy and their friends has boldly according to the measure of his understanding i heartily wish yours was either as deep or as honest railed against the best writers and the most excellent men but latet anguis in herba the men you here hint at are the professed enemies of our constitution both in church and state and as such only were opposed by mr moyle what you farther with the greatest disingenuity insinuate against him may be strictly applied to your own temper that as all good men must despise the censure of so scurrilous an antagonist so they must upon the same principles have but a very slight opinion of those persons whose encomiums are drawn by your pen  mr moyles waywardeditor you have indeed justly reprehended but as to your cavils concerning the bath inscription they are equally disingenuous does he not tell dr musgrave whom he allowed to be a superior judge with all the becoming modesty of a well bred gentlemen that he could pretend to no great skill in these matters but since you ask my opinion says he to the doctor i will give it with my usual frankness not doubting but you will receive it with your usual candor posth works vol   page       0  this is corresponding like men of sense and integrity  as you began with mr dodwell i am sorry to conclude that you are guilty of the charge he brings against his opponents in the piece i printed for him abovementioned page     it is my great unhappiness says he that i have to do with adversaries who will not be confined to the subject of our principal dispute without deviating to personal reflections wherein the reader is not any way concerned this is the bane of all controversy and i hope for the future you will avoid it  lastly as to your vir clarissimus woodwardus doctissimus he most learnedly follows the lowbell of your scandal and shields himself under your sentiments of his clypeus votivus but i would advise neither of you to be too fond of your own confined speculation and rest assured that there has already been more thousands sold of mr moyles works than ever there will be hundreds either of your monkish chronicles or his fossilarianlabours including his late fardle of selfconceit prefixed to his selfdefence against the objections of the learned camerarius which was written by himself though he has franked it under the cover of his translator holloway and to my other wishes for your welfare may you during life reign unrivalled legendarygrubber to the university of oxford  e curll ps that the public may be fully convinced how different the sentiments of the truly learned are from those selfconceited sciolists who have attacked mr moyles writings it will be sufficient to produce the judgment given by monsieurde la roche see new memoirs of literature for the month of september      vol   page     and seq of the whole works of walter moyle esquire published by himself  wit good sense and learning are equally conspicuous in the works of the late mr moyle and therefore it was very proper to reprint those pieces which were published by the author himself at several times by which means we have now in three volumes all the works of that ingenious and learned gentleman he being a very honest man was always very zealous for the liberty of his country and that noble character appears in many parts of his works when he came into parliament he always acted a very honorable part he was a person of an uncommon beneficence and humanity a more extensive charity and a truer love for his country was scarce to be found in any man it appears he had a great esteem for the clergy and was admirably well qualified for critical enquiries mr moyles works are printed for mr curll      now lest we should be thought partial as to what we have written concerning the triflings of this notable antiquary we shall here produce what mr alexander pope of twickenham in the county of middlesex has noted concerning him viz i can never enough praise my very good friend the exact mr thomas hearne who if any word occur which to him and all mankind is evidently wrong yet keeps he it in the text with due reverence and only remarks in the margin sic mss or sic orig and in another place he thus delivers himself our own antiquary mr thomas hearne has published many curious tracts which our poet has to his great contentment perused  in glossar to rob of glocester artic behett others say behight promised and so it is used excellently well by thomas norton in his translation into meter of the    th psalm verse    i to the lord will pay my vows that i to him behight   where the modern innovators not understanding the propriety of the word which is truly english from the saxon have most unwarrantably altered it thus i to the lord will pay my vows with joy and great delight   v ibid  hight in cumberland they say to hight for to promise or vow but hight usually signifies was called and so it does in the north even to this day notwithstanding what is done in cumberland  v     arede  read or peruse though sometimes used for counsel read thy read take thy counsel thomas sternholde in his translation of the first psalm into english meter has wisely made use of this word the man is blessed that has not lent to wicked read his ear but in the last spurious editions of the singing psalms the word read is changed into men i say spurious editions because not only here but quite throughout the whole book of psalms are strange alterations all for the worse and yet the title page stands as it used to do and all which is abominable in any book much more in a sacred work is ascribed to thomas sternholde john hopkins and others i am confident were sternholde and hopkins now living they would proceed against the innovators as cheats a liberty which to say no more of their intolerable alterations ought by no means to be admitted or approved of by such as are for uniformity and have any regard for the old english saxon tongue hearne gloss on rob of gloc art read  we do herein agree with mr hearne little is it of avail to object that such words are become unintelligible since they are truly english we ought to understand them and such as are for uniformity should think all alterations in a language strange abominable and unwarrantable scriblerus not in dunc  this is all ironice and scriblerianrailery and as such only is it here produced of all such antiquaries therefore as mr hearne well has mr pope decribed them  dim in clouds the poreing scholiasts mark wits who like owls see only in the dark a lumberhouse of books in every head for ever reading never to be read   well likewise might he ask this question viz but who is he in closet closs ypent of sober face with learned dust besprent right well mine eyes arede the myster wight on parchment scraps yfed and hight hearnius wormius  to future ages may thy dullness last as thou preservst the dullness of the past   with equal justice has mr pope finely rallied another species of these poring wretches the mere medalists who are wholly ignorant of the true use of those coins which they seem so intensely to study viz with sharpened sight pale antiquaries pore the inscription value but the rust adore this the blue varnish that the green indears the sacred rust of twice two hundred years to gain pescennius one employs his schemes one gains a cecrops in exstatic dreams poor vadius dr woodward long with learned spleen devoured can taste no pleasure since his shield was scoured and curio restless by the fairones side sighs for an otho and neglects his bride popes verses to mr addison on his dialogues upon medals    it is now high time to take leave of such glossographers and medallists as these so justly censured by mr pope for according to mr hearnes very silly defense of sternholde and hopkins our language should not have admitted of any improvements but have continued in the obsolete guise of geoffrey of monmouth and chaucer nor is it to be doubted but mr hearne was full in opinion that mr dryden had injured chaucers diction as much as those he calls the innovators upon the psalms  we shall next consider our antiquarys political and religious principles  mr hearne wrote a letter to his patron mr cherry in vindication of those who took the oath of allegiance to king william it was entitled a vindication of these who take the oath of allegiance to his present majesty from perjury injustice and disloyalty charged upon them by such as are against it wherein is evidently showed that the common good of a nation is what is primarily and principally respected in an oath and therefore when the oath is inconsistent with that the persons who have taken it are absolved from it in proving of which the case of maud and king stephen is particularly considered in a letter to a nonjuror conscientia mill testes printed in the year       vo and we cannot think it any bad part of a mans character to give his reasons for complying with that oath which others refused the point was disputable and censures no doubt were passed upon the jurors as well as nonjurors his reasons for compliance how weak soever in the eyes of those of a different persuasion were doubtless good in his own and if he discovered better afterward for refusing the oath than he before gave for the taking it we think and with strict justice that he ought to have produced them for the benefit of the public and clearing the point in dispute how he became dissatisfied in this affair is not the business of our inquiry  what mr hearne could mean by publishing a letter of king charles i when prince of wales therefrom insinuating that his royal highness had then an intrigue upon his hands and the duke of buckingham played the part of pimp upon the occasion is a mystery which we believe his fautors will have much ado to unravel but at the earnest request of many friends we have here reprinted that letter to show what little grounds there were for so ill a construction as has been put upon it it is as follows viz  steenie a nickname given by king james i to the duke of buckingham  i have nothing now to write to you but to give you thanks both for the good council ye gave me and for the event of it the king gave me a good sharp potion but you took away the working of it by the well relished comfites ye sent after it i have met with the party that must not be named once alreddie and the cullor of writing this letter shall make me meet with her on

human nature not to be sensible of that curiosity which prompts mankind to be acquainted with the history of persons distinguished by their extraordinary virtues and qualifications and who have experienced many uncommon varieties of life in reading their transactions we become agreeably intimate with the characters which have raised our admiration we attend them in the different scenes through which they pass and are sensible of a secret longing to imitate the shining parts of their conduct they frequently teach us an easy moderation in prosperity and are no less successful in reconciling us to the severe dispensation of providence  the impressions we receive from personal characters are more lively and affecting than such as are imparted to us by moral precepts and those virtues which institutions of philosophy might give us but a languid invitation to imitate are altogether irresistible when they are set off by the conduct of persons of elevation and they must be thrown into action in order to give them their last polish and refinement  this may be one reason why biography has generally met with such a favorable reception and we may venture to affirm that if the authors who engage in this kind of writing would select such characters as are entertaining and instructive at the same time they would have no cause to complain of any disregard from the public

accomplishments an enchanting harmony of person and mind a virgin purity of youth and a taintless fidelity of conjugal life have any charms in the softer sex they have all lent their full luster to the late duchess of ormonde  it should seem as if providence intended to guard this lady from every imputation that could be formed against her by envious and detracting minds and therefore would not confine her virtues to scenes of satisfaction and prosperity she had long convinced the world of her ability to act an unexceptionable part in such a situation but something still remained to give her conduct its full perfection the appointed period arrived this incomparable person was deprived of the dearest of all her enjoyments she saw herself for ever separated from her darling consort and her former affluence contracted into a very moderate limitation her sunshine of happiness darkened with adversity but that adversity only gave her an opportunity of charming all who knew her by her inimitable resignation to the decrees of heaven  as there was reason to believe the public would be curious to know the particulars of a life so diversified by such unusual events all possible care has been taken to collect every authentic circumstance that could make such a relation useful and entertaining and we presume that the impartiality with which we have proceeded on this occation will entitle this performance to a candid reception from those who are pleased to favor it with their perusal  the life of her grace mary duchess of ormonde the duchess of ormonde whose life we propose to write was the elder surviving daughter of henry duke of beaufort by his duchess mary daughter of that unfortunate patriot the lord capel whose steady attachment to his distressed sovereign king charles i deprived him in      of a life which deserved a much happier period  the most noble house of beaufort as it was august in its original so it has been perpetuated by a train of descendants who have been justly esteemed the ornaments of their country and the great plantagenets who founded this illustrious family have transmitted their virtues through a long series of their posterity and adorned the kingdom with a progeny of both sexes which will be ever remembered with honor  the duchess of ormonde was born at beauforthouse near chelsea anno      and in her early years presented such a dawn of amiable qualities to her noble parents as convinced them that the luster of their family would receive no diminution from their lovely daughter animated by this persuasion they were particularly careful to cultivate by a suitable education the virtues which had already sprung up in her mind with such a luxuriant bloom their cares succeeded to their wish and there was no accomplishment necessary to give perfection to her sex but what appeared with all its charms in the conduct of this young lady  nature sometimes presents us with a great deal of inequality in her productions and it is no uncommon thing to see a very disagreeable exterior allotted to a finished mind but she now determined to be uniform in her operations and prepared for the duke of beauforts daughter a form as amiable as the soul which was to claim it for her habitation  it would require a pen much more masterly in description than mine to give the reader a competent idea of this engaging lady the enchanting harmony of her shape the luster and vivacity of her eyes which inspired all who beheld them with unutterable impressions the glowing blush of the rose which was blended in her cheeks with the virgin purity of the lilly the flowing shade of hair which wantoned in a profusion of ringlets that no pencil could imitate the delicate turn of her face and the bewitching softness which diffused itself through every feature the panting snow of her bosom and the taper whiteness of her arms with a thousand other beauties which perpetually played around her formed such an assemblage of perfection that was to be resisted by nothing but insensibility itself  we believe we shall not be taxed with falsehood when we affirm that such a prodigality of charms were capable without any other assistance of captivating a thousand hearts but we have already intimated that nature discarded all partiality in her plan and made this irresistible form the residence of a soul which was altogether as attractive as its lovely mansion the most refined poignancy of her wit was contrasted by the sedatest judgment and each of these fine qualifications were so beautifully softened by her native sweetness of temper that her pleasantry never gave pain and none ever thought themselves insulted by her superior penetration  the happiness of her memory facilitated her improvement by those books and industry with which she was daily conversant and in a few years it proved such a treasury of knowledge and politeness as few ladies of her age were ever enriched with the little levities of the sex and those refined deviations from sincerity and sanctity of manners which are become so fashionable a part of modern education were altogether unknown to her true virtue is certainly amiable in herself but she puts on redoubled charms when she shines in the conduct of a blooming virgin  such was the lady we are describing her mind was as immaculate as her face and every year that added to her youth presented her with new perfections and awakened a general curiosity to know what happy man was to be blessed with the endearments of her nuptial love  it is not to be imagined in what manner that pleasing expectation influenced some of the noblest of the british youth a virtuous young lady of rank and beauty is a public blessing she civilizes the souls of her admirers more than all their academical institutions and fires them to aim at a proper similitude of accomplishments innocence purity and honor appear so persuasive in the fairone that it is no wonder if she daily increases the number of their votaries and brings them fresh accessions of homage  amongst the shining crowds of adorers who wished to inspire her with the soft sensibility of love none made so conspicuous a figure as the duke of ormonde he was descended from a very ancient and illustrious family that had given many heroes to their country and in the person of the duke had presented it with an ornament that did not a little contribute to its luster death had for some time deprived him of his first lady who was the eldest daughter of the earl of rochester and left him a widower in the full bloom of his youth his endearing behavior to his deceased duchess warmed many of the fairest with secret wishes to succeed her in his embraces his person was such as might impart the softest impressions to the chastest heart and was set off by such a winning singularity of sweetness generosity and every other quality which constitutes the fine gentleman that it was almost impossible for him to be long considered with indifference by any lady to whom he breathed his passion we may add to this that he possessed such a princely estate that fortune seemed to contend with nature which of them should be his greatest benefactor it is true the duke only valued the favors of the former as they enabled him to distinguish himself by numberless acts of humanity and indulged him in his natural propensity to benevolence and if the goddess has not of late been so liberal to many others it may have proceeded from their being destitute of his inclinations to communicate her bounties to their fellow creatures  after the account i have attempted to give of these two illustrious persons it will be natural to conclude that they were formed for each other and therefore without entering into the particulars of that tender intercourse which love and a similitude of dispositions established between them it will be sufficient if we acquaint the reader that his grace was so fortunate in his addresses as to prevail on the duke of beauforts charming daughter to consent to be the loveliest bride in england  the number of the young dutchesss admirers was not diminished by her marriage and though they found themselves restrained from disclosing to her the sentiments with which her charms had inspired them yet there were several who  merited that friendship by a number of amiable qualities  it often happens that men of wit through too much partiality to themselves are apt to fancy that a ladys satisfaction in their conversation must create a fondness for their persons and the earl did not fail to impute to the duchess impressions in his favor which she herself was never sensible of and consequently he was always ready to improve every instance of her complacency too much to his own advantage the opinion he entertained of his being more agreeable to her than he really was made him look on the dishonorable conduct he was meditating against the duke as a crime that was capable of a very easy vindication he thought it more honorable to succeed with the duchess than to preserve fidelity in his friendship to her lord and to such an infatuation was he hurried by his guilty love that he imagined it to be the most criminal action in the world to neglect the happiness which his vanity represented the duchess inclinable to afford him  in consequence of this persuasion as he had the honor one evening to lead her grace from the drawing room he slipped a letter into her hand as she was stepping into her coach and then retired with a profound reverence the lady believed the paper contained some agreeable piece of poetry in which the earl as we intimated before was very happy and was impatient to read this new product of his capacity but who can describe her confusion and resentment when she found it to be a declaration of love and her displeasure was the greater as she was conscious that no part of her conduct could possibly give that nobleman any pretentions to the indecent presumption with which he treated her and though it was late at night she resolved to acquaint the duchess her mother with the affront that had been offered to her virtue  she accordingly ordered her coachman to drive to the duchess of beauforts house and at her arrival there went into her graces bedchamber and entreated her with a flood of tears to read the letter she put into her hands the duchess was not a little surprised to see her daughter in a disorder of mind entirely new to her and immediately read over the letter with an astonishment natural to such an event is it possible madam said the duchess of ormonde that any man can dare to think he has a privilege to treat me in this dishonorable manner i can appeal to heaven and earth that my conduct has hitherto been without reproach which makes this violation of the respect due to me so insupportable  the duchess of beaufort was as much dissatisfied with this adventure as her daughter and was justly apprehensive that it might be attended with very fatal consequences to prevent which all imaginable discretion was necessary  whilst they were deliberating what steps were most proper to be taken in so delicate an affair a lady of great quality and a near relation to them both came in very seasonably to assist at the consultation and after she had heard a particular account of the whole affair she gave it as her opinion that it would be most proper for the duchess of ormonde to dissemble her resentment and treat the amorous peer with such an air of indifference as would effectually mortify his vanity and discourage him from persisting in his criminal desires the lady added that if such a course of behavior should not have the effect that might be reasonably expected she would undertake to disclose the affair to the duke of ormonde in such a light as should engage him to come into a scheme she had formed for making this new lover the diversion of the whole town  this advice was allowed to be just and after some farther consideration the duchess of ormonde took her leave with a determination to conduct herself according to her relations sentiments it was not long before the young earl saw her and as he was pleased to flatter himself that the graces of his wit and person were irresistible he was not a little surprised at the negligent manner in which the duchess heard all the fine things he said to her and as he found that he had not made the least impression on her heart he began to imagine she might possibly not have read his letter for he could not believe that so much premeditated wit and tenderness as it contained could prove ineffectual and therefore resolved to be certain that his next letter should be read by the duchess for which purpose he found means to gain as he imagined one of her women to his interest he made her a present of a large purse of gold accompanying it with a second billet which he entreated her to deliver into her ladys hands and at the same time gave her to understand that if she acquitted herself of the confidence he reposed in her to his satisfaction there was nothing she might not promise herself from his future bounty  the dutchesss woman performed her commission and gave the letter to her lady with a particular account of the earls liberality and all the large promises he had made her the duchess after she had read the letter made her mother and the other lady who had instructed her how to behave acquainted with the contents upon which they thought it now a proper time to make the duke of ormonde privy to the secret this they did in such a manner as easily disposed his grace to come into their measures to make his rival as ridiculous as his vanity ought to render him to accomplish which it was agreed among them that the duchess should answer her lovers letter and it is easy to imagine that an epistle dictated by such persons and on such an occasion was artful enough to deceive even a gentleman of the earls penetration it would be no disagreeable entertainment to the reader could i repeat all the pleasant things and the diverting contrivances that were invented by this illustrious company to expose the presuming lover the duchess of ormonde was for having him privately admitted into the house and shut up in some place where he might be half frozen before he should be set at liberty but the duke replied that would be a management of too low a turn for the earls nice and delicate taste and then recollecting that his garden wall was of a very convenient height he thought it would be best for the lover to climb over it in order to come to his lady the danger and difficulty only tending to complete the glory of such a gallant adventure besides added he we shall by this means see whether his lordship is in earnest and dare hazard his fine person in the prosecution of his amor  this proposal meeting with the approbation of all the ladies they went into the garden to examine the wall and observing a place that had hooks which a ladder might be commodiously fastened to the dutchesss woman had directions to describe this convenient situation to the earl but it was not done till several letters had passed between him and the duchess and he became persuaded that his addresses were as successful as he could wish and now the dutchesss woman acquainted him he had made all imaginable impressions on her lady and that she expected the pleasure of his company with the greatest impatience but then continued she it will be impossible for your lordship to pass by the porter in any disguise and you are not insensible what regard is due to a ladys reputation in an affair of this nature and therefore some expedient must be thought of to prevent any discovery of your being admitted into my ladys apartment  the earl upon this gave her the strongest assurances of his strict regard for the dutchesss honor and therefore said he i am desirous of being introduced in any manner you can contrive to prevent my being discovered by any of the servants and there is no danger that i will ever decline to accomplish my happiness with all the privacy my lovely duchess can possibly desire  the gentlewoman finding him in such a resolution thought it then proper to acquaint him that no way would be more effectual to prevent the affair from being detected than for his lordship to climb over the gardenwall and then she described that particular part of it where the hooks were fastened your lordship added she is too gallant to hesitate at any little danger that you may be exposed to on such an occasion and you are likewise to consider that you could not have a more favorable opportunity of convincing my lady that your passion for her can make you despise every hazard and difficulty that may lie between you and the happiness you are in pursuit of and therefore if your lordship has no objection to what i have been proposing i will be at eleven this night in the garden to receive you  his lordship was so animated with the hopes of his imagined joys that he told the gentlewoman in a kind of transport that he thought fortune was very propitious to him in giving him such an opportunity of convincing her lady how much his passion could surmount every danger and impediment upon which he took his leave with a solemn promise to be punctual to the appointed time and then went to pay a visit to the duke of ormonde by whom as was before observed he was treated with the greatest friendship and intimacy  the duke received him with his usual affability and after some conversation walked with him in his garden where he could not forbear smiling to himself to observe with what a curious eye his visitor examined the wall he was to scale that evening after they had taken a few turns the earl took his leave and went to his own house where he passed the remainder of the day with all the impatient desires natural to a lover who expects the happy period of all his wishes the appointed hour was at last come and his lordship did not fail to be exactly punctual at the place agreed on where he found the ladder of ropes thrown over the wall by the means of which he mounted to the top with wonderful activity and from thence as nimbly descended into the garden but alas how frequently do disappointments and disgrace attend the finest schemes of poor mortals and how common is it for men to meet with the most disagreeable accidents in the very instant that he promised himself nothing but rapture and the most perfect felicity the adventrous peer had no sooner set foot on the fatal ground than the gardener who happened to be a very sturdy fellow pretending to mistake him for a person who intended to rob the house fell upon him with herculean force and gave him such a vigorous drubbing that he was obliged to cry out for assistance the noise alarmed the house and the duke with all the company who were then at supper with him came out in a seeming surprise to know the occasion of the clamours they heard any one will imagine that the unfortunate lover made no very graceful figure in such a conjuncture and as it was impossible for the spectators of his disgrace to keep their countenances he grew sensible that this had been a premeditated scheme to expose him but as he had a peculiar presence of mind and was likewise one of those philosophic lovers who never run distracted at the disappoinment of their passion he asked the dukes pardon for the folly he had committed desiring his grace to impute it to a youthful inconsideration he would no longer indulge after which he joined with the company in their mirth and rallied himself very pleasantly for the discipline he had received from the honest gardener  the earls ill success in his amor soon became public and was for a considerable time the entertainment of all the gay company about the court and besides this it entirely extinguished the hopes of all who sighed for the amiable duchess in secret they were convinced that her virtue was impregnable and that it was possible for a lady to be the fairest of her sex and at the same time capable of preserving an untainted fidelity to her nuptial vow the foregoing was an adventure of the late duke of buckinghamshire when he was earl of mulgrave   any one will easily believe that the duke after this amiable proof of his ladys virtue could not but cherish such a treasure with the utmost fondness and indeed our noble pair lived in so mutual an intercourse of endearments as rendered them the envy and admiration of the age i say the envy because there have been people malicious enough to declare that the duchess some time after her marriage entertained such a fondness for cards as in a great measure alienated the dukes affection from her for a considerable time but whilst some have been so ungenerous as to propagate such a report and others so weak as to believe it all must acknowledge this to be the only frailty that was ever imputed to that lady and even this has been aggravated much beyond the reality of the fact the truth is cards being at that time as well as now the fashionable amusement of the fair it was impossible for the duchess whose house was continually filled with the best company in the kingdom to do otherwise than comply with the inclinations of her visitors in that diversion and it may be true that she might sometimes sit up late at play to oblige her company and we will not deny that the duke might be sensible of some uneasiness to find his lady compelled by the reigning decorum among the great to be absent more hours from him than were agreeable to her inclinations but at the same time in justice to the memory of that incomparable lady we must affirm that the moment she was sensible of the least uneasiness in her lord on that account she never after would suffer play to detain her from him to any late or unseasonable hour a singular instance this of a lady who could resolve to sacrifice what was then thought an innocent amusement to the repose of her consort whereas the same motive now is frequently insufficient to make numbers of the sex resign pleasures that are really criminal and injurious to their own and their husbands reputation but to return to this noble pair  when the duke was constituted lord lieutenant of ireland the duchess undertook that voyage and her reception and return is so truly and so elegantly described by mr dryden in his address to her grace see the dedication of his fables  that it would be injustice to his memory to omit it on this occasion viz already have the fates your path prepared and sure presage your future sway declared when westward like the sun you took your way and from benighted britain bore the day blue
