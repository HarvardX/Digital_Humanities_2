chapter xiv  an interview between parson adams and parson trulliber   parson adams came to the house of parson trulliber whom he found stript into his waistcoat with an apron on and a pail in his hand just come from serving his hogs for mr trulliber was a parson on sundays but all the other six might more properly be called a farmer he occupied a small piece of land of his own besides which he rented a considerable deal more his wife milked his cows managed his dairy and followed the markets with butter and eggs the hogs fell chiefly to his care which he carefully waited on at home and attended to fairs on which occasion he was liable to many jokes his own size being with much ale rendered little inferior to that of the beasts he sold he was indeed one of the largest men you should see and could have acted the part of sir john falstaff without stuffing add to this that the rotundity of his belly was considerably increased by the shortness of his stature his shadow ascending very near as far in height when he lay on his back as when he stood on his legs his voice was loud and hoarse and his accents extremely broad to complete the whole he had a stateliness in his gait when he walked not unlike that of a goose only he stalked slower  mr trulliber being informed that somebody wanted to speak with him immediately slipt off his apron and clothed himself in an old nightgown being the dress in which he always saw his company at home his wife who informed him of mr adamss arrival had made a small mistake for she had told her husband she believed there was a man come for some of his hogs this supposition made mr trulliber hasten with the utmost expedition to attend his guest he no sooner saw adams than not in the least doubting the cause of his errand to be what his wife had imagined he told him he was come in very good time that he expected a dealer that very afternoon and added they were all pure and fat and upwards of twenty score apiece adams answered he believed he did not know him yes yes cried trulliber i have seen you often at fair why we have dealt before now mun i warrant you yes yes cries he i remember thy face very well but wont mention a word more till you have seen them though i have never sold thee a flitch of such bacon as is now in the stye upon which he laid violent hands on adams and dragged him into the hogstye which was indeed but two steps from his parlour window they were no sooner arrived there than he cryd out do but handle them step in friend art welcome to handle them whether dost buy or no at which words opening the gate he pushed adams into the pigstye insisting on it that he should handle them before he would talk one word with him  adams whose natural complacence was beyond any artificial was obliged to comply before he was suffered to explain himself and laying hold on one of their tails the unruly beast gave such a sudden spring that he threw poor adams all along in the mire trulliber instead of assisting him to get up burst into a laughter and entering the stye said to adams with some contempt why dost not know how to handle a hog and was going to lay hold of one himself but adams who thought he had carried his complacence far enough was no sooner on his legs than he escaped out of the reach of the animals and cried out nihil habeo cum porcis i am a clergyman sir and am not come to buy hogs trulliber answered he was sorry for the mistake but that he must blame his wife adding she was a fool and always committed blunders he then desired him to walk in and clean himself that he would only fasten up the stye and follow him adams desired leave to dry his greatcoat wig and hat by the fire which trulliber granted mrs trulliber would have brought him a basin of water to wash his face but her husband bid her be quiet like a fool as she was or she would commit more blunders and then directed adams to the pump while adams was thus employed trulliber conceiving no great respect for the appearance of his guest fastened the parlour door and now conducted him into the kitchen telling him he believed a cup of drink would do him no harm and whispered his wife to draw a little of the worst ale after a short silence adams said i fancy sir you already perceive me to be a clergymanay ay cries trulliber grinning i perceive you have some cassock i will not venture to caale it a whole one adams answered it was indeed none of the best but he had the misfortune to tear it about ten years ago in passing over a stile mrs trulliber returning with the drink told her husband she fancied the gentleman was a traveller and that he would be glad to eat a bit trulliber bid her hold her impertinent tongue and asked her if parsons used to travel without horses adding he supposed the gentleman had none by his having no boots onyes sir yes says adams i have a horse but i have left him behind mei am glad to hear you have one says trulliber for i assure you i dont love to see clergymen on foot it is not seemly nor suiting the dignity of the cloth here trulliber made a long oration on the dignity of the cloth or rather gown not much worth relating till his wife had spread the table and set a mess of porridge on it for his breakfast he then said to adams i dont know friend how you came to caale on me however as you are here if you think proper to eat a morsel you may adams accepted the invitation and the two parsons sat down together mrs trulliber waiting behind her husbands chair as was it seems her custom trulliber eat heartily but scarce put anything in his mouth without finding fault with his wifes cookery all which the poor woman bore patiently indeed she was so absolute an admirer of her husbands greatness and importance of which she had frequent hints from his own mouth that she almost carried her adoration to an opinion of his infallibility to say the truth the parson had exercised her more ways than one and the pious woman had so well edified by her husbands sermons that she had resolved to receive the bad things of this world together with the good she had indeed been at first a little contentious but he had long since got the better partly by her love for this partly by her fear of that partly by her religion partly by the respect he paid himself and partly by that which he received from the parish she had in short absolutely submitted and now worshipped her husband as sarah did abraham calling him not lord but master whilst they were at table her husband gave her a fresh example of his greatness for as she had just delivered a cup of ale to adams he snatched it out of his hand and crying out i caald vurst swallowed down the ale adams denied it it was referred to the wife who though her conscience was on the side of adams durst not give it against her husband upon which he said no sir no i should not have been so rude to have taken it from you if you had caald vurst but id have you know im a better man than to suffer the best he in the kingdom to drink before me in my own house when i caale vurst  as soon as their breakfast was ended adams began in the following manner i think sir it is high time to inform you of the business of my embassy i am a traveller and am passing this way in company with two young people a lad and a damsel my parishioners towards my own cure we stopt at a house of hospitality in the parish where they directed me to you as having the curethough i am but a curate says trulliber i believe i am as warm as the vicar himself or perhaps the rector of the next parish too i believe i could buy them bothsir cries adams i rejoice thereat now sir my business is that we are by various accidents stript of our money and are not able to pay our reckoning being seven shillings i therefore request you to assist me with the loan of those seven shillings and also seven shillings more which peradventure i shall return to you but if not i am convinced you will joyfully embrace such an opportunity of laying up a treasure in a better place than any this world affords  suppose a stranger who entered the chambers of a lawyer being imagined a client when the lawyer was preparing his palm for the fee should pull out a writ against him suppose an apothecary at the door of a chariot containing some great doctor of eminent skill should instead of directions to a patient present him with a potion for himself suppose a minister should instead of a good round sum treat my lord  or sir  or esq  with a good broomstick suppose a civil companion or a led captain should instead of virtue and honour and beauty and parts and admiration thunder vice and infamy and ugliness and folly and contempt in his patrons ears suppose when a tradesman first carries in his bill the man of fashion should pay it or suppose if he did so the tradesman should abate what he had overcharged on the supposition of waiting in shortsuppose what you will you never can nor will suppose anything equal to the astonishment which seized on trulliber as soon as adams had ended his speech a while he rolled his eyes in silence sometimes surveying adams then his wife then casting them on the ground then lifting them up to heaven at last he burst forth in the following accents sir i believe i know where to lay up my little treasure as well as another i thank g if i am not so warm as some i am content that is a blessing greater than riches and he to whom that is given need ask no more to be content with a little is greater than to possess the world which a man may possess without being so lay up my treasure what matters where a mans treasure is whose heart is in the scriptures there is the treasure of a christian at these words the water ran from adamss eyes and catching trulliber by the hand in a rapture brother says he heavens bless the accident by which i came to see you i would have walked many a mile to have communed with you and believe me i will shortly pay you a second visit but my friends i fancy by this time wonder at my stay so let me have the money immediately trulliber then put on a stern look and cried out thou dost not intend to rob me at which the wife bursting into tears fell on her knees and roared out o dear sir for heavens sake dont rob my master we are but poor people get up for a fool as thou art and go about thy business said trulliber dost think the man will venture his life he is a beggar and no robber very true indeed answered adams i wish with all my heart the tithingman was here cries trulliber i would have thee punished as a vagabond for thy impudence fourteen shillings indeed i wont give thee a farthing i believe thou art no more a clergyman than the woman there pointing to his wife but if thou art dost deserve to have thy gown stript over thy shoulders for running about the country in such a manner i forgive your suspicions says adams but suppose i am not a clergyman i am nevertheless thy brother and thou as a christian much more as a clergyman art obliged to relieve my distress dost preach to me replied trulliber dost pretend to instruct me in my duty ifacks a good story cries mrs trulliber to preach to my master silence woman cries trulliber i would have thee know friend addressing himself to adams i shall not learn my duty from such as thee i know what charity is better than to give to vagabonds besides if we were inclined the poors rate obliges us to give so much charity cries the wife pugh thou art a fool poors reate hold thy nonsense answered trulliber and then turning to adams he told him he would give him nothing i am sorry answered adams that you do know what charity is since you practise it no better i must tell you if you trust to your knowledge for your justification you will find yourself deceived though you should add faith to it without good works fellow cries trulliber dost thou speak against faith in my house get out of my doors i will no longer remain under the same roof with a wretch who speaks wantonly of faith and the scriptures name not the scriptures says adams how not name the scriptures do you disbelieve the scriptures cries trulliber no but you do answered adams if i may reason from your practice for their commands are so explicit and their rewards and punishments so immense that it is impossible a man should stedfastly believe without obeying now there is no command more express no duty more frequently enjoined than charity whoever therefore is void of charity i make no scruple of pronouncing that he is no christian i would not advise thee says trulliber to say that i am no christian i wont take it of you for i believe i am as good a man as thyself and indeed though he was now rather too corpulent for athletic exercises he had in his youth been one of the best boxers and cudgelplayers in the county his wife seeing him clench his fist interposed and begged him not to fight but show himself a true christian and take the law of him as nothing could provoke adams to strike but an absolute assault on himself or his friend he smiled at the angry look and gestures of trulliber and telling him he was sorry to see such men in orders departed without further ceremony    chapter xv  an adventure the consequence of a new instance which parson adams gave of his forgetfulness   when he came back to the inn he found joseph and fanny sitting together they were so far from thinking his absence long as he had feared they would that they never once missed or thought of him indeed i have been often assured by both that they spent these hours in a most delightful conversation but as i never could prevail on either to relate it so i cannot communicate it to the reader  adams acquainted the lovers with the ill success of his enterprize they were all greatly confounded none being able to propose any method of departing till joseph at last advised calling in the hostess and desiring her to trust them which fanny said she despaired of her doing as she was one of the sourestfaced women she had ever beheld  but she was agreeably disappointed for the hostess was no sooner asked the question than she readily agreed and with a curtsy and smile wished them a good journey however lest fannys skill in physiognomy should be called in question we will venture to assign one reason which might probably incline her to this confidence and goodhumour when adams said he was going to visit his brother he had unwittingly imposed on joseph and fanny who both believed he had meant his natural brother and not his brother in divinity and had so informed the hostess on her enquiry after him now mr trulliber had by his professions of piety by his gravity austerity reserve and the opinion of his great wealth so great an authority in his parish that they all lived in the utmost fear and apprehension of him it was therefore no wonder that the hostess who knew it was in his option whether she should ever sell another mug of drink did not dare to affront his supposed brother by denying him credit  they were now just on their departure when adams recollected he had left his greatcoat and hat at mr trullibers as he was not desirous of renewing his visit the hostess herself having no servant at home offered to fetch it  this was an unfortunate expedient for the hostess was soon undeceived in the opinion she had entertained of adams whom trulliber abused in the grossest terms especially when he heard he had had the assurance to pretend to be his near relation  at her return therefore she entirely changed her note she said folks might be ashamed of travelling about and pretending to be what they were not that taxes were high and for her part she was obliged to pay for what she had she could not therefore possibly nor would she trust anybody no not her own father that money was never scarcer and she wanted to make up a sum that she expected therefore they should pay their reckoning before they left the house  adams was now greatly perplexed but as he knew that he could easily have borrowed such a sum in his own parish and as he knew he would have lent it himself to any mortal in distress so he took fresh courage and sallied out all round the parish but to no purpose he returned as pennyless as he went groaning and lamenting that it was possible in a country professing christianity for a wretch to starve in the midst of his fellowcreatures who abounded  whilst he was gone the hostess who stayed as a sort of guard with joseph and fanny entertained them with the goodness of parson trulliber and indeed he had not only a very good character as to other qualities in the neighbourhood but was reputed a man of great charity for though he never gave a farthing he had always that word in his mouth  adams was no sooner returned the second time than the storm grew exceedingly high the hostess declaring among other things that if they offered to stir without paying her she would soon overtake them with a warrant  plato and aristotle or somebody else hath said that when the most exquisite cunning fails chance often hits the mark and that by means the least expected virgil expresses this very boldly      turne quod optanti divum promittere nemo     auderet volvenda dies en attulit ultro  i would quote more great men if i could but my memory not permitting me i will proceed to exemplify these observations by the following instance  there chanced for adams had not cunning enough to contrive it to be at that time in the alehouse a fellow who had been formerly a drummer in an irish regiment and now travelled the country as a pedlar this man having attentively listened to the discourse of the hostess at last took adams aside and asked him what the sum was for which they were detained as soon as he was informed he sighed and said he was sorry it was so much for that he had no more than six shillings and sixpence in his pocket which he would lend them with all his heart adams gave a caper and cryd out it would do for that he had sixpence himself and thus these poor people who could not engage the compassion of riches and piety were at length delivered out of their distress by the charity of a poor pedlar  i shall refer it to my reader to make what observations he pleases on this incident it is sufficient for me to inform him that after adams and his companions had returned him a thousand thanks and told him where he might call to be repaid they all sallied out of the house without any compliments from their hostess or indeed without paying her any adams declaring he would take particular care never to call there again and she on her side assuring them she wanted no such guests    chapter xvi  a very curious adventure in which mr adams gave a much greater instance of the honest simplicity of his heart than of his experience in the ways of this world   our travellers had walked about two miles from that inn which they had more reason to have mistaken for a castle than don quixote ever had any of those in which he sojourned seeing they had met with such difficulty in escaping out of its walls when they came to a parish and beheld a sign of invitation hanging out a gentleman sat smoaking a pipe at the door of whom adams inquired the road and received so courteous and obliging an answer accompanied with so smiling a countenance that the good parson whose heart was naturally disposed to love and affection began to ask several other questions particularly the name of the parish and who was the owner of a large house whose front they then had in prospect the gentleman answered as obligingly as before and as to the house acquainted him it was his own he then proceeded in the following manner sir i presume by your habit you are a clergyman and as you are travelling on foot i suppose a glass of good beer will not be disagreeable to you and i can recommend my landlords within as some of the best in all this country what say you will you halt a little and let us take a pipe together there is no better tobacco in the kingdom this proposal was not displeasing to adams who had allayed his thirst that day with no better liquor than what mrs trullibers cellar had produced and which was indeed little superior either in richness or flavour to that which distilled from those grains her generous husband bestowed on his hogs having therefore abundantly thanked the gentleman for his kind invitation and bid joseph and fanny follow him he entered the alehouse where a large loaf and cheese and a pitcher of beer which truly answered the character given of it being set before them the three travellers fell to eating with appetites infinitely more voracious than are to be found at the most exquisite eatinghouses in the parish of st jamess  the gentleman expressed great delight in the hearty and cheerful behaviour of adams and particularly in the familiarity with which he conversed with joseph and fanny whom he often called his children a term he explained to mean no more than his parishioners saying he looked on all those whom god had intrusted to his care to stand to him in that relation the gentleman shaking him by the hand highly applauded those sentiments they are indeed says he the true principles of a christian divine and i heartily wish they were universal but on the contrary i am sorry to say the parson of our parish instead of esteeming his poor parishioners as a part of his family seems rather to consider them as not of the same species with himself he seldom speaks to any unless some few of the richest of us nay indeed he will not move his hat to the others i often laugh when i behold him on sundays strutting along the churchyard like a turkeycock through rows of his parishioners who bow to him with as much submission and are as unregarded as a set of servile courtiers by the proudest prince in christendom but if such temporal pride is ridiculous surely the spiritual is odious and detestable if such a puffedup empty human bladder strutting in princely robes justly moves ones derision surely in the habit of a priest it must raise our scorn  doubtless answered adams your opinion is right but i hope such examples are rare the clergy whom i have the honour to know maintain a different behaviour and you will allow me sir that the readiness which too many of the laity show to contemn the order may be one reason of their avoiding too much humility very true indeed says the gentleman i find sir you are a man of excellent sense and am happy in this opportunity of knowing you perhaps our accidental meeting may not be disadvantageous to you neither at present i shall only say to you that the incumbent of this living is old and infirm and that it is in my gift doctor give me your hand and assure yourself of it at his decease adams told him he was never more confounded in his life than at his utter incapacity to make any return to such noble and unmerited generosity a mere trifle sir cries the gentleman scarce worth your acceptance a little more than three hundred a year i wish it was double the value for your sake adams bowed and cried from the emotions of his gratitude when the other asked him if he was married or had any children besides those in the spiritual sense he had mentioned sir replied the parson i have a wife and six at your service that is unlucky says the gentleman for i would otherwise have taken you into my own house as my chaplain however i have another in the parish for the parsonagehouse is not good enough which i will furnish for you pray does your wife understand a dairy i cant profess she does says adams i am sorry for it quoth the gentleman i would have given you halfadozen cows and very good grounds to have maintained them sir said adams in an ecstasy you are too liberal indeed you are not at all cries the gentleman i esteem riches only as they give me an opportunity of doing good and i never saw one whom i had a greater inclination to serve at which words he shook him heartily by the hand and told him he had sufficient room in his house to entertain him and his friends adams begged he might give him no such trouble that they could be very well accommodated in the house where they were forgetting they had not a sixpenny piece among them the gentleman would not be denied and informing himself how far they were travelling he said it was too long a journey to take on foot and begged that they would favour him by suffering him to lend them a servant and horses adding withal that if they would do him the pleasure of their company only two days he would furnish them with his coach and six adams turning to joseph said how lucky is this gentlemans goodness to you who i am afraid would be scarce able to hold out on your lame leg and then addressing the person who made him these liberal promises after much bowing he cried out blessed be the hour which first introduced me to a man of your charity you are indeed a christian of the true primitive kind and an honour to the country wherein you live i would willingly have taken a pilgrimage to the holy land to have beheld you for the advantages which we draw from your goodness give me little pleasure in comparison of what i enjoy for your own sake when i consider the treasures you are by these means laying up for yourself in a country that passeth not away we will therefore most generous sir accept your goodness as well the entertainment you have so kindly offered us at your house this evening as the accommodation of your horses tomorrow morning he then began to search for his hat as did joseph for his and both they and fanny were in order of departure when the gentleman stopping short and seeming to meditate by himself for the space of about a minute exclaimed thus sure never anything was so unlucky i had forgot that my housekeeper was gone abroad and hath locked up all my rooms indeed i would break them open for you but shall not be able to furnish you with a bed for she has likewise put away all my linen i am glad it entered into my head before i had given you the trouble of walking there besides i believe you will find better accommodations here than you expectedlandlord you can provide good beds for these people cant you yes and please your worship cries the host and such as no lord or justice of the peace in the kingdom need be ashamed to lie in i am heartily sorry says the gentleman for this disappointment i am resolved i will never suffer her to carry away the keys again pray sir let it not make you uneasy cries adams we shall do very well here and the loan of your horses is a favour we shall be incapable of making any return to ay said the squire the horses shall attend you here at what hour in the morning you please and now after many civilities too tedious to enumerate many squeezes by the hand with most affectionate looks and smiles at each other and after appointing the horses at seven the next morning the gentleman took his leave of them and departed to his own house adams and his companions returned to the table where the parson smoaked another pipe and then they all retired to rest  mr adams rose very early and called joseph out of his bed between whom a very fierce dispute ensued whether fanny should ride behind joseph or behind the gentlemans servant joseph insisting on it that he was perfectly recovered and was as capable of taking care of fanny as any other person could be but adams would not agree to it and declared he would not trust her behind him for that he was weaker than he imagined himself to be  this dispute continued a long time and had begun to be very hot when a servant arrived from their good friend to acquaint them that he was unfortunately prevented from lending them any horses for that his groom had unknown to him put his whole stable under a course of physic  this advice presently struck the two disputants dumb adams cried out was ever anything so unlucky as this poor gentleman i protest i am more sorry on his account than my own you see joseph how this goodnatured man is treated by his servants one locks up his linen another physics his horses and i suppose by his being at this house last night the butler had locked up his cellar bless us how goodnature is used in this world i protest i am more concerned on his account than my own so am not i cries joseph not that i am much troubled about walking on foot all my concern is how we shall get out of the house unless god sends another pedlar to redeem us but certainly this gentleman has such an affection for you that he would lend you a larger sum than we owe here which is not above four or five shillings very true child answered adams i will write a letter to him and will even venture to solicit him for three halfcrowns there will be no harm in having two or three shillings in our pockets as we have full forty miles to travel we may possibly have occasion for them  fanny being now risen joseph paid her a visit and left adams to write his letter which having finished he despatched a boy with it to the gentleman and then seated himself by the door lighted his pipe and betook himself to meditation  the boy staying longer than seemed to be necessary joseph who with fanny was now returned to the parson expressed some apprehensions that the gentlemans steward had locked up his purse too to which adams answered it might very possibly be and he should wonder at no liberties which the devil might put into the head of a wicked servant to take with so worthy a master but added that as the sum was so small so noble a gentleman would be easily able to procure it in the parish though he had it not in his own pocket indeed says he if it was four or five guineas or any such large quantity of money it might be a different matter  they were now sat down to breakfast over some toast and ale when the boy returned and informed them that the gentleman was not at home very well cries adams but why child did you not stay till his return go back again my good boy and wait for his coming home he cannot be gone far as his horses are all sick and besides he had no intention to go abroad for he invited us to spend this day and tomorrow at his house therefore go back child and tarry till his return home the messenger departed and was back again with great expedition bringing an account that the gentleman was gone a long journey and would not be at home again this month at these words adams seemed greatly confounded saying this must be a sudden accident as the sickness or death of a relation or some such unforeseen misfortune and then turning to joseph cried i wish you had reminded me to have borrowed this money last night joseph smiling answered he was very much deceived if the gentleman would not have found some excuse to avoid lending iti own says he i was never much pleased with his professing so much kindness for you at first sight for i have heard the gentlemen of our cloth in london tell many such stories of their masters but when the boy brought the message back of his not being at home i presently knew what would follow for whenever a man of fashion doth not care to fulfil his promises the custom is to order his servants that he will never be at home to the person so promised in london they call it denying him i have myself denied sir thomas booby above a hundred times and when the man hath danced attendance for about a month or sometimes longer he is acquainted in the end that the gentleman is gone out of town and could do nothing in the businessgood lord says adams what wickedness is there in the christian world i profess almost equal to what i have read of the heathens but surely joseph your suspicions of this gentleman must be unjust for what a silly fellow must he be who would do the devils work for nothing and canst thou tell me any interest he could possibly propose to himself by deceiving us in his professionsit is not for me answered joseph to give reasons for what men do to a gentleman of your learningyou say right quoth adams knowledge of men is only to be learned from books plato and seneca for that and those are authors i am afraid child you never readnot i sir truly answered joseph all i know is it is a maxim among the gentlemen of our cloth that those masters who promise the most perform the least and i have often heard them say they have found the largest vails in those families where they were not promised any but sir instead of considering any farther these matters it would be our wisest way to contrive some method of getting out of this house for the generous gentleman instead of doing us any service hath left us the whole reckoning to pay adams was going to answer when their host came in and with a kind of jeering smile said well masters the squire hath not sent his horses for you yet laud help me how easily some folks make promiseshow says adams have you ever known him do anything of this kind beforeay marry have i answered the host it is no business of mine you know sir to say anything to a gentleman to his face but now he is not here i will assure you he hath not his fellow within the three next markettowns i own i could not help laughing when i heard him offer you the living for thereby hangs a good jest i thought he would have offered you my house next for one is no more his to dispose of than the other at these words adams blessing himself declared he had never read of such a monster but what vexes me most says he is that he hath decoyed us into running up a long debt with you which we are not able to pay for we have no money about us and what is worse live at such a distance that if you should trust us i am afraid you would lose your money for want of our finding any conveniency of sending ittrust you master says the host that i will with all my heart i honour the clergy too much to deny trusting one of them for such a trifle besides i like your fear of never paying me i have lost many a debt in my lifetime but was promised to be paid them all in a very short time i will score this reckoning for the novelty of it it is the first i do assure you of its kind but what say you master shall we have tother pot before we part it will waste but a little chalk more and if you never pay me a shilling the loss will not ruin me adams liked the invitation very well especially as it was delivered with so hearty an accent he shook his host by the hand and thanking him said he would tarry another pot rather for the pleasure of such worthy company than for the liquor adding he was glad to find some christians left in the kingdom for that he almost began to suspect that he was sojourning in a country inhabited only by jews and turks  the kind host produced the liquor and joseph with fanny retired into the garden where while they solaced themselves with amorous discourse adams sat down with his host and both filling their glasses and lighting their pipes they began that dialogue which the reader will find in the next chapter    chapter xvii  a dialogue between mr abraham adams and his host which by the disagreement in their opinions seemed to threaten an unlucky catastrophe had it not been timely prevented by the return of the lovers   sir said the host i assure you you are not the first to whom our squire hath promised more than he hath performed he is so famous for this practice that his word will not be taken for much by those who know him i remember a young fellow whom he promised his parents to make an exciseman the poor people who could ill afford it bred their son to writing and accounts and other learning to qualify him for the place and the boy held up his head above his condition with these hopes nor would he go to plough nor to any other kind of work and went constantly drest as fine as could be with two clean holland shirts a week and this for several years till at last he followed the squire up to london thinking there to mind him of his promises but he could never get sight of him so that being out of money and business he fell into evil company and wicked courses and in the end came to a sentence of transportation the news of which broke the mothers hearti will tell you another true story of him there was a neighbour of mine a farmer who had two sons whom he bred up to the business pretty lads they were nothing would serve the squire but that the youngest must be made a parson upon which he persuaded the father to send him to school promising that he would afterwards maintain him at the university and when he was of a proper age give him a living but after the lad had been seven years at school and his father brought him to the squire with a letter from his master that he was fit for the university the squire instead of minding his promise or sending him thither at his expense only told his father that the young man was a fine scholar and it was pity he could not afford to keep him at oxford for four or five years more by which time if he could get him a curacy he might have him ordained the farmer said he was not a man sufficient to do any such thingwhy then answered the squire i am very sorry you have given him so much learning for if he cannot get his living by that it will rather spoil him for anything else and your other son who can hardly write his name will do more at ploughing and sowing and is in a better condition than he and indeed so it proved for the poor lad not finding friends to maintain him in his learning as he had expected and being unwilling to work fell to drinking though he was a very sober lad before and in a short time partly with grief and partly with good liquor fell into a consumption and diednay i can tell you more still there was another a young woman and the handsomest in all this neighbourhood whom he enticed up to london promising to make her a gentlewoman to one of your women of quality but instead of keeping his word we have since heard after having a child by her himself she became a common whore then kept a coffeehouse in covent garden and a little after died of the french distemper in a gaoli could tell you many more stories but how do you imagine he served me myself you must know sir i was bred a seafaring man and have been many voyages till at last i came to be master of a ship myself and was in a fair way of making a fortune when i was attacked by one of those cursed guardacostas who took our ships before the beginning of the war and after a fight wherein i lost the greater part of my crew my rigging being all demolished and two shots received between wind and water i was forced to strike the villains carried off my ship a brigantine of   0 tonsa pretty creature she wasand put me a man and a boy into a little bad pink in which with much ado we at last made falmouth though i believe the spaniards did not imagine she could possibly live a day at sea upon my return hither where my wife who was of this country then lived the squire told me he was so pleased with the defence i had made against the enemy that he did not fear getting me promoted to a lieutenancy of a manofwar if i would accept of it which i thankfully assured him i would well sir two or three years passed during which i had many repeated promises not only from the squire but as he told me from the lords of the admiralty he never returned from london but i was assured i might be satisfied now for i was certain of the first vacancy and what surprizes me still when i reflect on it these assurances were given me with no less confidence after so many disappointments than at first at last sir growing weary and somewhat suspicious after so much delay i wrote to a friend in london who i knew had some acquaintance at the best house in the admiralty and desired him to back the squires interest for indeed i feared he had solicited the affair with more coldness than he pretended and what answer do you think my friend sent me truly sir he acquainted me that the squire had never mentioned my name at the admiralty in his life and unless i had much faithfuller interest advised me to give over my pretensions which i immediately did and with the concurrence of my wife resolved to set up an alehouse where you are heartily welcome and so my service to you and may the squire and all such sneaking rascals go to the devil togethero fie says adams o fie he is indeed a wicked man but g will i hope turn his heart to repentance nay if he could but once see the meanness of this detestable vice would he but once reflect that he is one of the most scandalous as well as pernicious lyars sure he must despise himself to so intolerable a degree that it would be impossible for him to continue a moment in such a course and to confess the truth notwithstanding the baseness of this character which he hath too well deserved he hath in his countenance sufficient symptoms of that bona indoles that sweetness of disposition which furnishes out a good christianah master master says the host if you had travelled as far as i have and conversed with the many nations where i have traded you would not give any credit to a mans countenance symptoms in his countenance quotha i would look there perhaps to see whether a man had the smallpox but for nothing else he spoke this with so little regard to the parsons observation that it a good deal nettled him and taking the pipe hastily from his mouth he thus answered master of mine perhaps i have travelled a great deal farther than you without the assistance of a ship do you imagine sailing by different cities or countries is travelling no      caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt  i can go farther in an afternoon than you in a twelvemonth what i suppose you have seen the pillars of hercules and perhaps the walls of carthage nay you may have heard scylla and seen charybdis you may have entered the closet where archimedes was found at the taking of syracuse i suppose you have sailed among the cyclades and passed the famous straits which take their name from the unfortunate helle whose fate is sweetly described by apollonius rhodius you have passed the very spot i conceive where daedalus fell into that sea his waxen wings being melted by the sun you have traversed the euxine sea i make no doubt nay you may have been on the banks of the caspian and called at colchis to see if there is ever another golden fleece not i truly master answered the host i never touched at any of these placesbut i have been at all these replied adams then i suppose cries the host you have been at the east indies for there are no such i will be sworn either in the west or the levantpray wheres the levant quoth adams that should be in the east indies by right oho you are a pretty traveller cries the host and not know the levant my service to you master you must not talk of these things with me you must not tip us the traveller it wont go here since thou art so dull to misunderstand me still quoth adams i will inform thee the travelling i mean is in books the only way of travelling by which any knowledge is to be acquired from them i learn what i asserted just now that nature generally imprints such a portraiture of the mind in the countenance that a skilful physiognomist will rarely be deceived i presume you have never read the story of socrates to this purpose and therefore i will tell it you a certain physiognomist asserted of socrates that he plainly discovered by his features that he was a rogue in his nature a character so contrary to the tenour of all this great mans actions and the generally received opinion concerning him incensed the boys of athens so that they threw stones at the physiognomist and would have demolished him for his ignorance had not socrates himself prevented them by confessing the truth of his observations and acknowledging that though he corrected his disposition by philosophy he was indeed naturally as inclined to vice as had been predicated of him now pray resolve mehow should a man know this story if he had not read it well master said the host and what signifies it whether a man knows it or no he who goes abroad as i have done will always have opportunities enough of knowing the world without troubling his head with socrates or any such fellows friend cries adams if a man should sail round the world and anchor in every harbour of it without learning he would return home as ignorant as he went out lord help you answered the host there was my boatswain poor fellow he could scarce either write or read and yet he would navigate a ship with any master of a manofwar and a very pretty knowledge of trade he had too trade answered adams as aristotle proves in his first chapter of politics is below a philosopher and unnatural as it is managed now the host looked stedfastly at adams and after a minutes silence asked him if he was one of the writers of the gazetteers for i have heard says he they are writ by parsons gazetteers answered adams what is that it is a dirty newspaper replied the host which hath been given away all over the nation for these many years to abuse trade and honest men which i would not suffer to lye on my table though it hath been offered me for nothing not i truly said adams i never write anything but sermons and i assure you i am no enemy to trade whilst it is consistent with honesty nay i have always looked on the tradesman as a very valuable member of society and perhaps inferior to none but the man of learning no i believe he is not nor to him neither answered the host of what use would learning be in a country without trade what would all you parsons do to clothe your backs and feed your bellies who fetches you your silks and your linens and your wines and all the other necessaries of life i speak chiefly with regard to the sailors you should say the extravagancies of life replied the parson but admit they were the necessaries there is something more necessary than life itself which is provided by learning i mean the learning of the clergy who clothes you with piety meekness humility charity patience and all the other christian virtues who feeds your souls with the milk of brotherly love and diets them with all the dainty food of holiness which at once cleanses them of all impure carnal affections and fattens them with the truly rich spirit of grace who doth this ay who indeed cries the host for i do not remember ever to have seen any such clothing or such feeding and so in the mean time master my service to you adams was going to answer with some severity when joseph and fanny returned and pressed his departure so eagerly that he would not refuse them and so grasping his crabstick he took leave of his host neither of them being so well pleased with each other as they had been at their first sitting down together and with joseph and fanny who both expressed much impatience departed and now all together renewed their journey     book iii    chapter i  matter prefatory in praise of biography   notwithstanding the preference which may be vulgarly given to the authority of those romance writers who entitle their books the history of england the history of france of spain c it is most certain that truth is to be found only in the works of those who celebrate the lives of great men and are commonly called biographers as the others should indeed be termed topographers or chorographers words which might well mark the distinction between them it being the business of the latter chiefly to describe countries and cities which with the assistance of maps they do pretty justly and may be depended upon but as to the actions and characters of men their writings are not quite so authentic of which there needs no other proof than those eternal contradictions occurring between two topographers who undertake the history of the same country for instance between my lord clarendon and mr whitelocke between mr echard and rapin and many others where facts being set forth in a different light every reader believes as he pleases and indeed the more judicious and suspicious very justly esteem the whole as no other than a romance in which the writer hath indulged a happy and fertile invention but though these widely differ in the narrative of facts some ascribing victory to the one and others to the other party some representing the same man as a rogue while others give him a great and honest character yet all agree in the scene where the fact is supposed to have happened and where the person who is both a rogue and an honest man lived now with us biographers the case is different the facts we deliver may be relied on though we often mistake the age and country wherein they happened for though it may be worth the examination of critics whether the shepherd chrysostom who as cervantes informs us died for love of the fair marcella who hated him was ever in spain will any one doubt but that such a silly fellow hath really existed is there in the world such a sceptic as to disbelieve the madness of cardenio the perfidy of ferdinand the impertinent curiosity of anselmo the weakness of camilla the irresolute friendship of lothario though perhaps as to the time and place where those several persons lived that good historian may be deplorably deficient but the most known instance of this kind is in the true history of gil blas where the inimitable biographer hath made a notorious blunder in the country of dr sangrado who used his patients as a vintner doth his winevessels by letting out their blood and filling them up with water doth not every one who is the least versed in physical history know that spain was not the country in which this doctor lived the same writer hath likewise erred in the country of his archbishop as well as that of those great personages whose understandings were too sublime to taste anything but tragedy and in many others the same mistakes may likewise be observed in scarron the arabian nights the history of marianne and le paisan parvenu and perhaps some few other writers of this class whom i have not read or do not at present recollect for i would by no means be thought to comprehend those persons of surprizing genius the authors of immense romances or the modern novel and atalantis writers who without any assistance from nature or history record persons who never were or will be and facts which never did nor possibly can happen whose heroes are of their own creation and their brains the chaos whence all their materials are selected not that such writers deserve no honour so far otherwise that perhaps they merit the highest for what can be nobler than to be as an example of the wonderful extent of human genius one may apply to them what balzac says of aristotle that they are a second nature for they have no communication with the first by which authors of an inferior class who cannot stand alone are obliged to support themselves as with crutches but these of whom i am now speaking seem to be possessed of those stilts which the excellent voltaire tells us in his letters carry the genius far off but with an regular pace indeed far out of the sight of the reader      beyond the realm of chaos and old night  but to return to the former class who are contented to copy nature instead of forming originals from the confused heap of matter in their own brains is not such a book as that which records the achievements of the renowned don quixote more worthy the name of a history than even marianas for whereas the latter is confined to a particular period of time and to a particular nation the former is the history of the world in general at least that part which is polished by laws arts and sciences and of that from the time it was first polished to this day nay and forwards as long as it shall so remain  i shall now proceed to apply these observations to the work before us for indeed i have set them down principally to obviate some constructions which the good nature of mankind who are always forward to see their friends virtues recorded may put to particular parts i question not but several of my readers will know the lawyer in the stagecoach the moment they hear his voice it is likewise odds but the wit and the prude meet with some of their acquaintance as well as all the rest of my characters to prevent therefore any such malicious applications i declare here once for all i describe not men but manners not an individual but a species perhaps it will be answered are not the characters then taken from life to which i answer in the affirmative nay i believe i might aver that i have writ little more than i have seen the lawyer is not only alive but hath been so these four thousand years and i hope g will indulge his life as many yet to come he hath not indeed confined himself to one profession one religion or one country but when the first mean selfish creature appeared on the human stage who made self the centre of the whole creation would give himself no pain incur no danger advance no money to assist or preserve his fellowcreatures then was our lawyer born and whilst such a person as i have described exists on earth so long shall he remain upon it it is therefore doing him little honour to imagine he endeavours to mimick some little obscure fellow because he happens to resemble him in one particular feature or perhaps in his profession whereas his appearance in the world is calculated for much more general and noble purposes not to expose one pitiful wretch to the small and contemptible circle of his acquaintance but to hold the glass to thousands in their closets that they may contemplate their deformity and endeavour to reduce it and thus by suffering private mortification may avoid public shame this places the boundary between and distinguishes the satirist from the libeller for the former privately corrects the fault for the benefit of the person like a parent the latter publickly exposes the person himself as an example to others like an executioner  there are besides little circumstances to be considered as the drapery of a picture which though fashion varies at different times the resemblance of the countenance is not by those means diminished thus i believe we may venture to say mrs towwouse is coeval with our lawyer and though perhaps during the changes which so long an existence must have passed through she may in her turn have stood behind the bar at an inn i will not scruple to affirm she hath likewise in the revolution of ages sat on a throne in short where extreme turbulency of temper avarice and an insensibility of human misery with a degree of hypocrisy have united in a female composition mrs towwouse was that woman and where a good inclination eclipsed by a poverty of spirit and understanding hath glimmered forth in a man that man hath been no other than her sneaking husband  i shall detain my reader no longer than to give him one caution more of an opposite kind for as in most of our particular characters we mean not to lash individuals but all of the like sort so in our general descriptions we mean not universals but would be understood with many exceptions for instance in our description of high people we cannot be intended to include such as whilst they are an honour to their high rank by a wellguided condescension make their superiority as easy as possible to those whom fortune chiefly hath placed below them of this number i could name a peer no less elevated by nature than by fortune who whilst he wears the noblest ensigns of honour on his person bears the truest stamp of dignity on his mind adorned with greatness enriched with knowledge and embellished with genius i have seen this man relieve with generosity while he hath conversed with freedom and be to the same person a patron and a companion i could name a commoner raised higher above the multitude by superior talents than is in the power of his prince to exalt him whose behaviour to those he hath obliged is more amiable than the obligation itself and who is so great a master of affability that if he could divest himself of an inherent greatness in his manner would often make the lowest of his acquaintance forget who was the master of that palace in which they are so courteously entertained these are pictures which must be i believe known i declare they are taken from the life and not intended to exceed it by those high people therefore whom i have described i mean a set of wretches who while they are a disgrace to their ancestors whose honours and fortunes they inherit or perhaps a greater to their mother for such degeneracy is scarce credible have the insolence to treat those with disregard who are at least equal to the founders of their own splendor it is i fancy impossible to conceive a spectacle more worthy of our indignation than that of a fellow who is not only a blot in the escutcheon of a great family but a scandal to the human species maintaining a supercilious behaviour to men who are an honour to their nature and a disgrace to their fortune  and now reader taking these hints along with you you may if you please proceed to the sequel of this our true history    chapter ii  a night scene wherein several wonderful adventures befel adams and his fellowtravellers   it was so late when our travellers left the inn or alehouse for it might be called either that they had not travelled many miles before night overtook them or met them which you please the reader must excuse me if i am not particular as to the way they took for as we are now drawing near the seat of the boobies and as that is a ticklish name which malicious persons may apply according to their evil inclinations to several worthy country squires a race of men whom we look upon as entirely inoffensive and for whom we have an adequate regard we shall lend no assistance to any such malicious purposes  darkness had now overspread the hemisphere when fanny whispered joseph that she begged to rest herself a little for that she was so tired she could walk no farther joseph immediately prevailed with parson adams who was as brisk as a bee to stop he had no sooner seated himself than he lamented the loss of his dear aeschylus but was a little comforted when reminded that if he had it in his possession he could not see to read  the sky was so clouded that not a star appeared it was indeed according to milton darkness visible this was a circumstance however very favourable to joseph for fanny not suspicious of being overseen by adams gave a loose to her passion which she had never done before and reclining her head on his bosom threw her arm carelessly round him and suffered him to lay his cheek close to hers all this infused such happiness into joseph that he would not have changed his turf for the finest down in the finest palace in the universe  adams sat at some distance from the lovers and being unwilling to disturb them applied himself to meditation in which he had not spent much time before he discovered a light at some distance that seemed approaching towards him he immediately hailed it but to his sorrow and surprize it stopped for a moment and then disappeared he then called to joseph asking him if he had not seen the light joseph answered he hadand did you not mark how it vanished returned he though i am not afraid of ghosts i do not absolutely disbelieve them  he then entered into a meditation on those unsubstantial beings which was soon interrupted by several voices which he thought almost at his elbow though in fact they were not so extremely near however he could distinctly hear them agree on the murder of any one they met and a little after heard one of them say he had killed a dozen since that day fortnight  adams now fell on his knees and committed himself to the care of providence and poor fanny who likewise heard those terrible words embraced joseph so closely that had not he whose ears were also open been apprehensive on her account he would have thought no danger which threatened only himself too dear a price for such embraces  joseph now drew forth his penknife and adams having finished his ejaculations grasped his crabstick his only weapon and coming up to joseph would have had him quit fanny and place her in the rear but his advice was fruitless she clung closer to him not at all regarding the presence of adams and in a soothing voice declared she would die in his arms joseph clasping her with inexpressible eagerness whispered her that he preferred death in hers to life out of them adams brandishing his crabstick said he despised death as much as any man and then repeated aloud      est hic est animus lucis contemptor et illum     qui vita bene credat emi quo tendis honorem  upon this the voices ceased for a moment and then one of them called out dn you who is there to which adams was prudent enough to make no reply and of a sudden he observed halfadozen lights which seemed to rise all at once from the ground and advance briskly towards him this he immediately concluded to be an apparition and now beginning to conceive that the voices were of the same kind he called out in the name of the ld what wouldst thou have he had no sooner spoke than he heard one of the voices cry out dn them here they come and soon after heard several hearty blows as if a number of men had been engaged at quarterstaff he was just advancing towards the place of combat when joseph catching him by the skirts begged him that they might take the opportunity of the dark to convey away fanny from the danger which threatened her he presently complied and joseph lifting up fanny they all three made the best of their way and without looking behind them or being overtaken they had travelled full two miles poor fanny not once complaining of being tired when they saw afar off several lights scattered at a small distance from each other and at the same time found themselves on the descent of a very steep hill adamss foot slipping he instantly disappeared which greatly frightened both joseph and fanny indeed if the light had permitted them to see it they would scarce have refrained laughing to see the parson rolling down the hill which he did from top to bottom without receiving any harm he then hollowed as loud as he could to inform them of his safety and relieve them from the fears which they had conceived for him joseph and fanny halted some time considering what to do at last they advanced a few paces where the declivity seemed least steep and then joseph taking his fanny in his arms walked firmly down the hill without making a false step and at length landed her at the bottom where adams soon came to them  learn hence my fair countrywomen to consider your own weakness and the many occasions on which the strength of a man may be useful to you and duly weighing this take care that you match not yourselves with the spindleshanked beaus and petitmaîtres of the age who instead of being able like joseph andrews to carry you in lusty arms through the rugged ways and downhill steeps of life will rather want to support their feeble limbs with your strength and assistance  our travellers now moved forwards where the nearest light presented itself and having crossed a common field they came to a meadow where they seemed to be at a very little distance from the light when to their grief they arrived at the banks of a river adams here made a full stop and declared he could swim but doubted how it was possible to get fanny over to which joseph answered if they walked along its banks they might be certain of soon finding a bridge especially as by the number of lights they might be assured a parish was near odso thats true indeed said adams i did not think of that  accordingly josephs advice being taken they passed over two meadows and came to a little orchard which led them to a house fanny begged of joseph to knock at the door assuring him she was so weary that she could hardly stand on her feet adams who was foremost performed this ceremony and the door being immediately opened a plain kind of man appeared at it adams acquainted him that they had a young woman with them who was so tired with her journey that he should be much obliged to him if he would suffer her to come in and rest herself the man who saw fanny by the light of the candle which he held in his hand perceiving her innocent and modest look and having no apprehensions from the civil behaviour of adams presently answered that the young woman was very welcome to rest herself in his house and so were her company he then ushered them into a very decent room where his wife was sitting at a table she immediately rose up and assisted them in setting forth chairs and desired them to sit down which they had no sooner done than the man of the house asked them if they would have anything to refresh themselves with adams thanked him and answered he should be obliged to him for a cup of his ale which was likewise chosen by joseph and fanny whilst he was gone to fill a very large jug with this liquor his wife told fanny she seemed greatly fatigued and desired her to take something stronger than ale but she refused with many thanks saying it was true she was very much tired but a little rest she hoped would restore her as soon as the company were all seated mr adams who had filled himself with ale and by public permission had lighted his pipe turned to the master of the house asking him if evil spirits did not use to walk in that neighbourhood to which receiving no answer he began to inform him of the adventure which they met with on the downs nor had he proceeded far in the story when somebody knocked very hard at the door the company expressed some amazement and fanny and the good woman turned pale her husband went forth and whilst he was absent which was some time they all remained silent looking at one another and heard several voices discoursing pretty loudly adams was fully persuaded that spirits were abroad and began to meditate some exorcisms joseph a little inclined to the same opinion fanny was more afraid of men and the good woman herself began to suspect her guests and imagined those without were rogues belonging to their gang at length the master of the house returned and laughing told adams he had discovered his apparition that the murderers were sheepstealers and the twelve persons murdered were no other than twelve sheep adding that the shepherds had got the better of them had secured two and were proceeding with them to a justice of peace this account greatly relieved the fears of the whole company but adams muttered to himself he was convinced of the truth of apparitions for all that  they now sat chearfully round the fire till the master of the house having surveyed his guests and conceiving that the cassock which having fallen down appeared under adamss greatcoat and the shabby livery on joseph andrews did not well suit with the familiarity between them began to entertain some suspicions not much to their advantage addressing himself therefore to adams he said he perceived he was a clergyman by his dress and supposed that honest man was his footman sir answered adams i am a clergyman at your service but as to that young man whom you have rightly termed honest he is at present in nobodys service he never lived in any other family than that of lady booby from whence he was discharged i assure you for no crime joseph said he did not wonder the gentleman was surprized to see one of mr adamss character condescend to so much goodness with a poor manchild said adams i should be ashamed of my cloth if i thought a poor man who is honest below my notice or my familiarity i know not how those who think otherwise can profess themselves followers and servants of him who made no distinction unless peradventure by preferring the poor to the richsir said he addressing himself to the gentleman these two poor young people are my parishioners and i look on them and love them as my children there is something singular enough in their history but i have not now time to recount it the master of the house notwithstanding the simplicity which discovered itself in adams knew too much of the world to give a hasty belief to professions he was not yet quite certain that adams had any more of the clergyman in him than his cassock to try him therefore further he asked him if mr pope had lately published anything new adams answered he had heard great commendations of that poet but that he had never read nor knew any of his worksho ho says the gentleman to himself have i caught you what said he have you never seen his homer adams answered he had never read any translation of the classicks why truly replyd the gentleman there is a dignity in the greek language which i think no modern tongue can reachdo you understand greek sir said adams hastily a little sir answered the gentleman do you know sir cryd adams where i can buy an aeschylus an unlucky misfortune lately happened to mine aeschylus was beyond the gentleman though he knew him very well by name he therefore returning back to homer asked adams what part of the iliad he thought most excellent adams returned his question would be properer what kind of beauty was the chief in poetry for that homer was equally excellent in them all and indeed continued he what cicero says of a complete orator may well be applied to a great poet he ought to comprehend all perfections homer did this in the most excellent degree it is not without reason therefore that the philosopher in the twentysecond chapter of his poeticks mentions him by no other appellation than that of the poet he was the father of the drama as well as the epic not of tragedy only but of comedy also for his margites which is deplorably lost bore says aristotle the same analogy to comedy as his odyssey and iliad to tragedy to him therefore we owe aristophanes as well as euripides sophocles and my poor aeschylus but if you please we will confine ourselves at least for the present to the iliad his noblest work though neither aristotle nor horace give it the preference as i remember to the odyssey first then as to his subject can anything be more simple and at the same time more noble he is rightly praised by the first of those judicious critics for not chusing the whole war which though he says it hath a complete beginning and end would have been too great for the understanding to comprehend at one view i have therefore often wondered why so correct a writer as horace should in his epistle to lollius call him the trojani belli scriptorem secondly his action termed by aristotle pragmaton systasis is it possible for the mind of man to conceive an idea of such perfect unity and at the same time so replete with greatness and here i must observe what i do not remember to have seen noted by any the harmotton that agreement of his action to his subject for as the subject is anger how agreeable is his action which is war from which every incident arises and to which every episode immediately relates thirdly his manners which aristotle places second in his description of the several parts of tragedy and which he says are included in the action i am at a loss whether i should rather admire the exactness of his judgment in the nice distinction or the immensity of his imagination in their variety for as to the former of these how accurately is the sedate injured resentment of achilles distinguished from the hot insulting passion of agamemnon how widely doth the brutal courage of ajax differ from the amiable bravery of diomedes and the wisdom of nestor which is the result of long reflection and experience from the cunning of ulysses the effect of art and subtlety only if we consider their variety we may cry out with aristotle in his   th chapter that no part of this divine poem is destitute of manners indeed i might affirm that there is scarce a character in human nature untouched in some part or other and as there is no passion which he is not able to describe so is there none in his reader which he cannot raise if he hath any superior excellence to the rest i have been inclined to fancy it is in the pathetic i am sure i never read with dry eyes the two episodes where andromache is introduced in the former lamenting the danger and in the latter the death of hector the images are so extremely tender in these that i am convinced the poet had the worthiest and best heart imaginable nor can i help observing how sophocles falls short of the beauties of the original in that imitation of the dissuasive speech of andromache which he hath put into the mouth of tecmessa and yet sophocles was the greatest genius who ever wrote tragedy nor have any of his successors in that art that is to say neither euripides nor seneca the tragedian been able to come near him as to his sentiments and diction i need say nothing the former are particularly remarkable for the utmost perfection on that head namely propriety and as to the latter aristotle whom doubtless you have read over and over is very diffuse i shall mention but one thing more which that great critic in his division of tragedy calls opsis or the scenery and which is as proper to the epic as to the drama with this difference that in the former it falls to the share of the poet and in the latter to that of the painter but did ever painter imagine a scene like that in the   th and   th iliads where the reader sees at one view the prospect of troy with the army drawn up before it the grecian army camp and fleet jupiter sitting on mount ida with his head wrapt in a cloud and a thunderbolt in his hand looking towards thrace neptune driving through the sea which divides on each side to permit his passage and then seating himself on mount samos the heavens opened and the deities all seated on their thrones this is sublime this is poetry adams then rapt out a hundred greek verses and with such a voice emphasis and action that he almost frightened the women and as for the gentleman he was so far from entertaining any further suspicion of adams that he now doubted whether he had not a bishop in his house he ran into the most extravagant encomiums on his learning and the goodness of his heart began to dilate to all the strangers he said he had great compassion for the poor young woman who looked pale and faint with her journey and in truth he conceived a much higher opinion of her quality than it deserved he said he was sorry he could not accommodate them all but if they were contented with his fireside he would sit up with the men and the young woman might if she pleased partake his wifes bed which he advised her to for that they must walk upwards of a mile to any house of entertainment and that not very good neither adams who liked his seat his ale his tobacco and his company persuaded fanny to accept this kind proposal in which sollicitation he was seconded by joseph nor was she very difficultly prevailed on for she had slept little the last night and not at all the preceding so that love itself was scarce able to keep her eyes open any longer the offer therefore being kindly accepted the good woman produced everything eatable in her house on the table and the guests being heartily invited as heartily regaled themselves especially parson adams as to the other two they were examples of the truth of that physical observation that love like other sweet things is no whetter of the stomach  supper was no sooner ended than fanny at her own request retired and the good woman bore her company the man of the house adams and joseph who would modestly have withdrawn had not the gentleman insisted on the contrary drew round the fireside where adams to use his own words replenished his pipe and the gentleman produced a bottle of excellent beer being the best liquor in his house  the modest behaviour of joseph with the gracefulness of his person the character which adams gave of him and the friendship he seemed to entertain for him began to work on the gentlemans affections and raised in him a curiosity to know the singularity which adams had mentioned in his history this curiosity adams was no sooner informed of than with josephs consent he agreed to gratify it and accordingly related all he knew with as much tenderness as was possible for the character of lady booby and concluded with the long faithful and mutual passion between him and fanny not concealing the meanness of her birth and education these latter circumstances entirely cured a jealousy which had lately risen in the gentlemans mind that fanny was the daughter of some person of fashion and that joseph had run away with her and adams was concerned in the plot he was now enamoured of his guests drank their healths with great chearfulness and returned many thanks to adams who had spent much breath for he was a circumstantial teller of a story  adams told him it was now in his power to return that favour for his extraordinary goodness as well as that fund of literature he was master ofa which he did not expect to find under such a roof had raised in him more curiosity than he had ever known therefore said he if it be not too troublesome sir your history if you please  a the author hath by some been represented to have made a blunder     here for adams had indeed shown some learning say they perhaps     all the author had but the gentleman hath shown none unless his     approbation of mr adams be such but surely it would be preposterous     in him to call it so i have however notwithstanding this     criticism which i am told came from the mouth of a great orator in     a public coffeehouse left this blunder as it stood in the first     edition i will not have the vanity to apply to anything in this     work the observation which m dacier makes in her preface to her     aristophanes je tiens pour une maxime constante quune beauté     mediocré plait plus généralement quune beauté sans défaut mr     congreve hath made such another blunder in his love for love where     tattle tells miss prue she should admire him as much for the     beauty he commends in her as if he himself was possessed of it  the gentleman answered he could not refuse him what he had so much right to insist on and after some of the common apologies which are the usual preface to a story he thus began    chapter iii  in which the gentleman relates the history of his life   sir i am descended of a good family and was born a gentleman my education was liberal and at a public school in which i proceeded so far as to become master of the latin and to be tolerably versed in the greek language my father died when i was sixteen and left me master of myself he bequeathed me a moderate fortune which he intended i should not receive till i attained the age of twentyfive for he constantly asserted that was full early enough to give up any man entirely to the guidance of his own discretion however as this intention was so obscurely worded in his will that the lawyers advised me to contest the point with my trustees i own i paid so little regard to the inclinations of my dead father which were sufficiently certain to me that i followed their advice and soon succeeded for the trustees did not contest the matter very obstinately on their side sir said adams may i crave the favour of your name the gentleman answered his name was wilson and then proceeded  i stayed a very little while at school after his death for being a forward youth i was extremely impatient to be in the world for which i thought my parts knowledge and manhood thoroughly qualified me and to this early introduction into life without a guide i impute all my future misfortunes for besides the obvious mischiefs which attend this there is one which hath not been so generally observed the first impression which mankind receives of you will be very difficult to eradicate how unhappy therefore must it be to fix your character in life before you can possibly know its value or weigh the consequences of those actions which are to establish your future reputation  a little under seventeen i left my school and went to london with no more than six pounds in my pocket a great sum as i then conceived and which i was afterwards surprized to find so soon consumed  the character i was ambitious of attaining was that of a fine gentleman the first requisites to which i apprehended were to be supplied by a taylor a periwigmaker and some few more tradesmen who deal in furnishing out the human body notwithstanding the lowness of my purse i found credit with them more easily than i expected and was soon equipped to my wish this i own then agreeably surprized me but i have since learned that it is a maxim among many tradesmen at the polite end of the town to deal as largely as they can reckon as high as they can and arrest as soon as they can  the next qualifications namely dancing fencing riding the great horse and music came into my head but as they required expense and time i comforted myself with regard to dancing that i had learned a little in my youth and could walk a minuet genteelly enough as to fencing i thought my goodhumour would preserve me from the danger of a quarrel as to the horse i hoped it would not be thought of and for music i imagined i could easily acquire the reputation of it for i had heard some of my schoolfellows pretend to knowledge in operas without being able to sing or play on the fiddle  knowledge of the town seemed another ingredient this i thought i should arrive at by frequenting public places accordingly i paid constant attendance to them all by which means i was soon master of the fashionable phrases learned to cry up the fashionable diversions and knew the names and faces of the most fashionable men and women  nothing now seemed to remain but an intrigue which i was resolved to have immediately i mean the reputation of it and indeed i was so successful that in a very short time i had halfadozen with the finest women in town  at these words adams fetched a deep groan and then blessing himself cried out good lord what wicked times these are  not so wicked as you imagine continued the gentleman for i assure you they were all vestal virgins for anything which i knew to the contrary the reputation of intriguing with them was all i sought and was what i arrived at and perhaps i only flattered myself even in that for very probably the persons to whom i showed their billets knew as well as i that they were counterfeits and that i had written them to myself write letters to yourself said adams staring o sir answered the gentleman it is the very error of the times half our modern plays have one of these characters in them it is incredible the pains i have taken and the absurd methods i employed to traduce the character of women of distinction when another had spoken in raptures of any one i have answered dn her she we shall have her at hds very soon when he hath replied he thought her virtuous i have answered ay thou wilt always think a woman virtuous till she is in the streets but you and i jack or tom turning to another in company know better at which i have drawn a paper out of my pocket perhaps a taylors bill and kissed it crying at the same time by gad i was once fond of her  proceed if you please but do not swear any more said adams  sir said the gentleman i ask your pardon well sir in this course of life i continued full three yearswhat course of life answered adams i do not remember you have mentioned anyyour remark is just said the gentleman smiling i should rather have said in this course of doing nothing i remember some time afterwards i wrote the journal of one day which would serve i believe as well for any other during the whole time i will endeavour to repeat it to you  in the morning i arose took my great stick and walked out in my green frock with my hair in papers a groan from adams and sauntered about till ten went to the auction told lady  she had a dirty face laughed heartily at something captain  said i cant remember what for i did not very well hear it whispered lord  bowed to the duke of  and was going to bid for a snuffbox but did not for fear i should have had it      from    to   drest myself  a groan             to   dined         a groan             to   coffeehouse             to   drurylane playhouse             to  0 lincolns inn fields           0 to    drawingroom a great groan  at all which places nothing happened worth remark  at which adams said with some vehemence sir this is below the life of an animal hardly above vegetation and i am surprized what could lead a man of your sense into it what leads us into more follies than you imagine doctor answered the gentlemanvanity for as contemptible a creature as i was and i assure you yourself cannot have more contempt for such a wretch than i now have i then admired myself and should have despised a person of your present appearance you will pardon me with all your learning and those excellent qualities which i have remarked in you adams bowed and begged him to proceed after i had continued two years in this course of life said the gentleman an accident happened which obliged me to change the scene as i was one day at st jamess coffeehouse making very free with the character of a young lady of quality an officer of the guards who was present thought proper to give me the lye i answered i might possibly be mistaken but i intended to tell no more than the truth to which he made no reply but by a scornful sneer after this i observed a strange coldness in all my acquaintance none of them spoke to me first and very few returned me even the civility of a bow the company i used to dine with left me out and within a week i found myself in as much solitude at st jamess as if i had been in a desart an honest elderly man with a great hat and long sword at last told me he had a compassion for my youth and therefore advised me to show the world i was not such a rascal as they thought me to be i did not at first understand him but he explained himself and ended with telling me if i would write a challenge to the captain he would out of pure charity go to him with it a very charitable person truly cried adams i desired till the next day continued the gentleman to consider on it and retiring to my lodgings i weighed the consequences on both sides as fairly as i could on the one i saw the risk of this alternative either losing my own life or having on my hands the blood of a man with whom i was not in the least angry i soon determined that the good which appeared on the other was not worth this hazard i therefore resolved to quit the scene and presently retired to the temple where i took chambers here i soon got a fresh set of acquaintance who knew nothing of what had happened to me indeed they were not greatly to my approbation for the beaus of the temple are only the shadows of the others they are the affectation of affectation the vanity of these is still more ridiculous if possible than of the others here i met with smart fellows who drank with lords they did not know and intrigued with women they never saw covent garden was now the farthest stretch of my ambition where i shone forth in the balconies at the playhouses visited whores made love to orangewenches and damned plays this career was soon put a stop to by my surgeon who convinced me of the necessity of confining myself to my room for a month at the end of which having had leisure to reflect i resolved to quit all farther conversation with beaus and smarts of every kind and to avoid if possible any occasion of returning to this place of confinement i think said adams the advice of a months retirement and reflection was very proper but i should rather have expected it from a divine than a surgeon the gentleman smiled at adamss simplicity and without explaining himself farther on such an odious subject went on thus i was no sooner perfectly restored to health than i found my passion for women which i was afraid to satisfy as i had done made me very uneasy i determined therefore to keep a mistress nor was i long before i fixed my choice on a young woman who had before been kept by two gentlemen and to whom i was recommended by a celebrated bawd i took her home to my chambers and made her a settlement during cohabitation this would perhaps have been very ill paid however she did not suffer me to be perplexed on that account for before quarterday i found her at my chambers in too familiar conversation with a young fellow who was drest like an officer but was indeed a city apprentice instead of excusing her inconstancy she rapped out halfadozen oaths and snapping her fingers at me swore she scorned to confine herself to the best man in england upon this we parted and the same bawd presently provided her another keeper i was not so much concerned at our separation as i found within a day or two i had reason to be for our meeting for i was obliged to pay a second visit to my surgeon i was now forced to do penance for some weeks during which time i contracted an acquaintance with a beautiful young girl the daughter of a gentleman who after having been forty years in the army and in all the campaigns under the duke of marlborough died a lieutenant on halfpay and had left a widow with this only child in very distrest circumstances they had only a small pension from the government with what little the daughter could add to it by her work for she had great excellence at her needle this girl was at my first acquaintance with her solicited in marriage by a young fellow in good circumstances he was apprentice to a linendraper and had a little fortune sufficient to set up his trade the mother was greatly pleased with this match as indeed she had sufficient reason however i soon prevented it i represented him in so low a light to his mistress and made so good an use of flattery promises and presents that not to dwell longer on this subject than is necessary i prevailed with the poor girl and conveyed her away from her mother in a word i debauched herat which words adams started up fetched three strides across the room and then replaced himself in his chair you are not more affected with this part of my story than myself i assure you it will never be sufficiently repented of in my own opinion but if you already detest it how much more will your indignation be raised when you hear the fatal consequences of this barbarous this villanous action if you please therefore i will here desistby no means cries adams go on i beseech you and heaven grant you may sincerely repent of this and many other things you have relatedi was now continued the gentleman as happy as the possession of a fine young creature who had a good education and was endued with many agreeable qualities could make me we lived some months with vast fondness together without any company or conversation more than we found in one another but this could not continue always and though i still preserved great affection for her i began more and more to want the relief of other company and consequently to leave her by degreesat last whole days to herself she failed not to testify some uneasiness on these occasions and complained of the melancholy life she led to remedy which i introduced her into the acquaintance of some other kept mistresses with whom she used to play at cards and frequent plays and other diversions she had not lived long in this intimacy before i perceived a visible alteration in her behaviour all her modesty and innocence vanished by degrees till her mind became thoroughly tainted she affected the company of rakes gave herself all manner of airs was never easy but abroad or when she had a party at my chambers she was rapacious of money extravagant to excess loose in her conversation and if ever i demurred to any of her demands oaths tears and fits were the immediate consequences as the first raptures of fondness were long since over this behaviour soon estranged my affections from her i began to reflect with pleasure that she was not my wife and to conceive an intention of parting with her of which having given her a hint she took care to prevent me the pains of turning her out of doors and accordingly departed herself having first broken open my escrutore and taken with her all she could find to the amount of about £ 00 in the first heat of my resentment i resolved to pursue her with all the vengeance of the law but as she had the good luck to escape me during that ferment my passion afterwards cooled and having reflected that i had been the first aggressor and had done her an injury for which i could make her no reparation by robbing her of the innocence of her mind and hearing at the same time that the poor old woman her mother had broke her heart on her daughters elopement from her i concluding myself her murderer as you very well might cries adams with a groan was pleased that god almighty had taken this method of punishing me and resolved quietly to submit to the loss indeed i could wish i had never heard more of the poor creature who became in the end an abandoned profligate and after being some years a common prostitute at last ended her miserable life in newgatehere the gentleman fetched a deep sigh which mr adams echoed very loudly and both continued silent looking on each other for some minutes at last the gentleman proceeded thus i had been perfectly constant to this girl during the whole time i kept her but she had scarce departed before i discovered more marks of her infidelity to me than the loss of my money in short i was forced to make a third visit to my surgeon out of whose hands i did not get a hasty discharge   i now forswore all future dealings with the sex complained loudly that the pleasure did not compensate the pain and railed at the beautiful creatures in as gross language as juvenal himself formerly reviled them in i looked on all the town harlots with a detestation not easy to be conceived their persons appeared to me as painted palaces inhabited by disease and death nor could their beauty make them more desirable objects in my eyes than gilding could make me covet a pill or golden plates a coffin but though i was no longer the absolute slave i found some reasons to own myself still the subject of love my hatred for women decreased daily and i am not positive but time might have betrayed me again to some common harlot had i not been secured by a passion for the charming sapphira which having once entered upon made a violent progress in my heart sapphira was wife to a man of fashion and gallantry and one who seemed i own every way worthy of her affections which however he had not the reputation of having she was indeed a coquette achevée pray sir says adams what is a coquette i have met with the word in french authors but never could assign any idea to it i believe it is the same with une sotte anglicè a fool sir answered the gentleman perhaps you are not much mistaken but as it is a particular kind of folly i will endeavour to describe it were all creatures to be ranked in the order of creation according to their usefulness i know few animals that would not take place of a coquette nor indeed hath this creature much pretence to anything beyond instinct for though sometimes we might imagine it was animated by the passion of vanity yet far the greater part of its actions fall beneath even that low motive for instance several absurd gestures and tricks infinitely more foolish than what can be observed in the most ridiculous birds and beasts and which would persuade the beholder that the silly wretch was aiming at our contempt indeed its characteristic is affectation and this led and governed by whim only for as beauty wisdom wit goodnature politeness and health are sometimes affected by this creature so are ugliness folly nonsense illnature illbreeding and sickness likewise put on by it in their turn its life is one constant lie and the only rule by which you can form any judgment of them is that they are never what they seem if it was possible for a coquette to love as it is not for if ever it attains this passion the coquette ceases instantly it would wear the face of indifference if not of hatred to the beloved object you may therefore be assured when they endeavour to persuade you of their liking that they are indifferent to you at least and indeed this was the case of my sapphira who no sooner saw me in the number of her admirers than she gave me what is commonly called encouragement she would often look at me and when she perceived me meet her eyes would instantly take them off discovering at the same time as much surprize and emotion as possible these arts failed not of the success she intended and as i grew more particular to her than the rest of her admirers she advanced in proportion more directly to me than to the others she affected the low voice whisper lisp sigh start laugh and many other indications of passion which daily deceive thousands when i played at whist with her she would look earnestly at me and at the same time lose deal or revoke then burst into a ridiculous laugh and cry la i cant imagine what i was thinking of to detain you no longer after i had gone through a sufficient course of gallantry as i thought and was thoroughly convinced i had raised a violent passion in my mistress i sought an opportunity of coming to an eclaircissement with her she avoided this as much as possible however great assiduity at length presented me one i will not describe all the particulars of this interview let it suffice that when she could no longer pretend not to see my drift she first affected a violent surprize and immediately after as violent a passion she wondered what i had seen in her conduct which could induce me to affront her in this manner and breaking from me the first moment she could told me i had no other way to escape the consequence of her resentment than by never seeing or at least speaking to her more i was not contented with this answer i still pursued her but to no purpose and was at length convinced that her husband had the sole possession of her person and that neither he nor any other had made any impression on her heart i was taken off from following this ignis fatuus by some advances which were made me by the wife of a citizen who though neither very young nor handsome was yet too agreeable to be rejected by my amorous constitution i accordingly soon satisfied her that she had not cast away her hints on a barren or cold soil on the contrary they instantly produced her an eager and desiring lover nor did she give me any reason to complain she met the warmth she had raised with equal ardour i had no longer a coquette to deal with but one who was wiser than to prostitute the noble passion of love to the ridiculous lust of vanity we presently understood one another and as the pleasures we sought lay in a mutual gratification we soon found and enjoyed them i thought myself at first greatly happy in the possession of this new mistress whose fondness would have quickly surfeited a more sickly appetite but it had a different effect on mine she carried my passion higher by it than youth or beauty had been able but my happiness could not long continue uninterrupted the apprehensions we lay under from the jealousy of her husband gave us great uneasiness poor wretch i pity him cried adams he did indeed deserve it said the gentleman for he loved his wife with great tenderness and i assure you it is a great satisfaction to me that i was not the man who first seduced her affections from him these apprehensions appeared also too well grounded for in the end he discovered us and procured witnesses of our caresses he then prosecuted me at law and recovered £ 000 damages which much distressed my fortune to pay and what was worse his wife being divorced came upon my hands i led a very uneasy life with her for besides that my passion was now much abated her excessive jealousy was very troublesome at length death rid me of an inconvenience which the consideration of my having been the author of her misfortunes would never suffer me to take any other method of discarding  i now bad adieu to love and resolved to pursue other less dangerous and expensive pleasures i fell into the acquaintance of a set of jolly companions who slept all day and drank all night fellows who might rather be said to consume time than to live their best conversation was nothing but noise singing hollowing wrangling drinking toasting spwing smoaking were the chief ingredients of our entertainment and yet bad as these were they were more tolerable than our graver scenes which were either excessive tedious narratives of dull common matters of fact or hot disputes about trifling matters which commonly ended in a wager this way of life the first serious reflection put a period to and i became member of a club frequented by young men of great abilities the bottle was now only called in to the assistance of our conversation which rolled on the deepest points of philosophy these gentlemen were engaged in a search after truth in the pursuit of which they threw aside all the prejudices of education and governed themselves only by the infallible guide of human reason this great guide after having shown them the falsehood of that very ancient but simple tenet that there is such a being as a deity in the universe helped them to establish in his stead a certain rule of right by adhering to which they all arrived at the utmost purity of morals reflection made me as much delighted with this society as it had taught me to despise and detest the former i began now to esteem myself a being of a higher order than i had ever before conceived and was the more charmed with this rule of right as i really found in my own nature nothing repugnant to it i held in utter contempt all persons who wanted any other inducement to virtue besides her intrinsic beauty and excellence and had so high an opinion of my present companions with regard to their morality that i would have trusted them with whatever was nearest and dearest to me whilst i was engaged in this delightful dream two or three accidents happened successively which at first much surprized mefor one of our greatest philosophers or ruleofright men withdrew himself from us taking with him the wife of one of his most intimate friends secondly another of the same society left the club without remembering to take leave of his bail a third having borrowed a sum of money of me for which i received no security when i asked him to repay it absolutely denied the loan these several practices so inconsistent with our golden rule made me begin to suspect its infallibility but when i communicated my thoughts to one of the club he said there was nothing absolutely good or evil in itself that actions were denominated good or bad by the circumstances of the agent that possibly the man who ran away with his neighbours wife might be one of very good inclinations but overprevailed on by the violence of an unruly passion and in other particulars might be a very worthy member of society that if the beauty of any woman created in him an uneasiness he had a right from nature to relieve himselfwith many other things which i then detested so much that i took leave of the society that very evening and never returned to it again being now reduced to a state of solitude which i did not like i became a great frequenter of the playhouses which indeed was always my favourite diversion and most evenings passed away two or three hours behind the scenes where i met with several poets with whom i made engagements at the taverns some of the players were likewise of our parties at these meetings we were generally entertained by the poets with reading their performances and by the players with repeating their parts upon which occasions i observed the gentleman who furnished our entertainment was commonly the best pleased of the company who though they were pretty civil to him to his face seldom failed to take the first opportunity of his absence to ridicule him now i made some remarks which probably are too obvious to be worth relating sir says adams your remarks if you please first then says he i concluded that the general observation that wits are most inclined to vanity is not true men are equally vain of riches strength beauty honours c but these appear of themselves to the eyes of the beholders whereas the poor wit is obliged to produce his performance to show you his perfection and on his readiness to do this that vulgar opinion i have before mentioned is grounded but doth not the person who expends vast sums in the furniture of his house or the ornaments of his person who consumes much time and employs great pains in dressing himself or who thinks himself paid for selfdenial labour or even villany by a title or a ribbon sacrifice as much to vanity as the poor wit who is desirous to read you his poem or his play my second remark was that vanity is the worst of passions and more apt to contaminate the mind than any other for as selfishness is much more general than we please to allow it so it is natural to hate and envy those who stand between us and the good we desire now in lust and ambition these are few and even in avarice we find many who are no obstacles to our pursuits but the vain man seeks preeminence and everything which is excellent or praiseworthy in another renders him the mark of his antipathy adams now began to fumble in his pockets and soon cried out o la i have it not about me upon this the gentleman asking him what he was searching for he said he searched after a sermon which he thought his masterpiece against vanity fie upon it fie upon it cries he why do i ever leave that sermon out of my pocket i wish it was within five miles i would willingly fetch it to read it you the gentleman answered that there was no need for he was cured of the passion and for that very reason quoth adams i would read it for i am confident you would admire it indeed i have never been a greater enemy to any passion than that silly one of vanity the gentleman smiled and proceededfrom this society i easily passed to that of the gamesters where nothing remarkable happened but the finishing my fortune which those gentlemen soon helped me to the end of this opened scenes of life hitherto unknown poverty and distress with their horrid train of duns attorneys bailiffs haunted me day and night my clothes grew shabby my credit bad my friends and acquaintance of all kinds cold in this situation the strangest thought imaginable came into my head and what was this but to write a play for i had sufficient leisure fear of bailiffs confined me every day to my room and having always had a little inclination and something of a genius that way i set myself to work and within a few months produced a piece of five acts which was accepted of at the theatre i remembered to have formerly taken tickets of other poets for their benefits long before the appearance of their performances and resolving to follow a precedent which was so well suited to my present circumstances i immediately provided myself with a large number of little papers happy indeed would be the state of poetry would these tickets pass current at the bakehouse the alehouse and the chandlers shop but alas far otherwise no taylor will take them in payment for buckram canvas staytape nor no bailiff for civility money they are indeed no more than a passport to beg with a certificate that the owner wants five shillings which induces welldisposed christians to charity i now experienced what is worse than poverty or rather what is the worst consequence of povertyi mean attendance and dependance on the great many a morning have i waited hours in the cold parlours of men of quality where after seeing the lowest rascals in lace and embroidery the pimps and buffoons in fashion admitted i have been sometimes told on sending in my name that my lord could not possibly see me this morning a sufficient assurance that i should never more get entrance into that house sometimes i have been at last admitted and the great man hath thought proper to excuse himself by telling me he was tied up tied up says adams pray whats that sir says the gentleman the profit which booksellers allowed authors for the best works was so very small that certain men of birth and fortune some years ago who were the patrons of wit and learning thought fit to encourage them farther by entering into voluntary subscriptions for their encouragement thus prior rowe pope and some other men of genius received large sums for their labours from the public this seemed so easy a method of getting money that many of the lowest scribblers of the times ventured to publish their works in the same way and many had the assurance to take in subscriptions for what was not writ nor ever intended subscriptions in this manner growing infinite and a kind of tax on the publick some persons finding it not so easy a task to discern good from bad authors or to know what genius was worthy encouragement and what was not to prevent the expense of subscribing to so many invented a method to excuse themselves from all subscriptions whatever and this was to receive a small sum of money in consideration of giving a large one if ever they subscribed which many have done and many more have pretended to have done in order to silence all solicitation the same method was likewise taken with playhouse tickets which were no less a public grievance and this is what they call being tied up from subscribing i cant say but the term is apt enough and somewhat typical said adams for a man of large fortune who ties himself up as you call it from the encouragement of men of merit ought to be tied up in reality well sir says the gentleman to return to my story sometimes i have received a guinea from a man of quality given with as ill a grace as alms are generally to the meanest beggar and purchased too with as much time spent in attendance as if it had been spent in honest industry might have brought me more profit with infinitely more satisfaction after about two months spent in this disagreeable way with the utmost mortification when i was pluming my hopes on the prospect of a plentiful harvest from my play upon applying to the prompter to know when it came into rehearsal he informed me he had received orders from the managers to return me the play again for that they could not possibly act it that season but if i would take it and revise it against the next they would be glad to see it again i snatched it from him with great indignation and retired to my room where i threw myself on the bed in a fit of despair you should rather have thrown yourself on your knees says adams for despair is sinful as soon continued the gentleman as i had indulged the first tumult of my passion i began to consider coolly what course i should take in a situation without friends money credit or reputation of any kind after revolving many things in my mind i could see no other possibility of furnishing myself with the miserable necessaries of life than to retire to a garret near the temple and commence hackneywriter to the lawyers for which i was well qualified being an excellent penman this purpose i resolved on and immediately put it in execution i had an acquaintance with an attorney who had formerly transacted affairs for me and to him i applied but instead of furnishing me with any business he laughed at my undertaking and told me he was afraid i should turn his deeds into plays and he should expect to see them on the stage not to tire you with instances of this kind from others i found that plato himself did not hold poets in greater abhorrence than these men of business do whenever i durst venture to a coffeehouse which was on sundays only a whisper ran round the room which was constantly attended with a sneerthats poet wilson for i know not whether you have observed it but there is a malignity in the nature of man which when not weeded out or at least covered by a good education and politeness delights in making another uneasy or dissatisfied with himself this abundantly appears in all assemblies except those which are filled by people of fashion and especially among the younger people of both sexes whose birth and fortunes place them just without the polite circles i mean the lower class of the gentry and the higher of the mercantile world who are in reality the worstbred part of mankind well sir whilst i continued in this miserable state with scarce sufficient business to keep me from starving the reputation of a poet being my bane i accidentally became acquainted with a bookseller who told me it was a pity a man of my learning and genius should be obliged to such a method of getting his livelihood that he had a compassion for me and if i would engage with him he would undertake to provide handsomely for me a man in my circumstances as he very well knew had no choice i accordingly accepted his proposal with his conditions which were none of the most favourable and fell to translating with all my might i had no longer reason to lament the want of business for he furnished me with so much that in half a year i almost writ myself blind i likewise contracted a distemper by my sedentary life in which no part of my body was exercised but my right arm which rendered me incapable of writing for a long time this unluckily happening to delay the publication of a work and my last performance not having sold well the bookseller declined any further engagement and aspersed me to his brethren as a careless idle fellow i had however by having half worked and half starved myself to death during the time i was in his service saved a few guineas with which i bought a lotteryticket resolving to throw myself into fortunes lap and try if she would make me amends for the injuries she had done me at the gamingtable this purchase being made left me almost pennyless when as if i had not been sufficiently miserable a bailiff in womans clothes got admittance to my chamber whither he was directed by the bookseller he arrested me at my taylors suit for thirtyfive pounds a sum for which i could not procure bail and was therefore conveyed to his house where i was locked up in an upper chamber i had now neither health for i was scarce recovered from my indisposition liberty money or friends and had abandoned all hopes and even the desire of life but this could not last long said adams for doubtless the taylor released you the moment he was truly acquainted with your affairs and knew that your circumstances would not permit you to pay him oh sir answered the gentleman he knew that before he arrested me nay he knew that nothing but incapacity could prevent me paying my debts for i had been his customer many years had spent vast sums of money with him and had always paid most punctually in my prosperous days but when i reminded him of this with assurances that if he would not molest my endeavours i would pay him all the money i could by my utmost labour and industry procure reserving only what was sufficient to preserve me alive he answered his patience was worn out that i had put him off from time to time that he wanted the money that he had put it into a lawyers hands and if i did not pay him immediately or find security i must die in gaol and expect no mercy he may expect mercy cries adams starting from his chair where he will find none how can such a wretch repeat the lords prayer where the word which is translated i know not for what reason trespasses is in the original debts and as surely as we do not forgive others their debts when they are unable to pay them so surely shall we ourselves be unforgiven when we are in no condition of paying he ceased and the gentleman proceeded while i was in this deplorable situation a former acquaintance to whom i had communicated my lotteryticket found me out and making me a visit with great delight in his countenance shook me heartily by the hand and wished me joy of my good fortune for says he your ticket is come up a prize of £ 000 adams snapped his fingers at these words in an ecstasy of joy which however did not continue long for the gentleman thus proceededalas sir this was only a trick of fortune to sink me the deeper for i had disposed of this lotteryticket two days before to a relation who refused lending me a shilling without it in order to procure myself bread as soon as my friend was acquainted with my unfortunate sale he began to revile me and remind me of all the illconduct and miscarriages of my life he said i was one whom fortune could not save if she would that i was now ruined without any hopes of retrieval nor must expect any pity from my friends that it would be extreme weakness to compassionate the misfortunes of a man who ran headlong to his own destruction he then painted to me in as lively colours as he was able the happiness i should have now enjoyed had i not foolishly disposed of my ticket i urged the plea of necessity but he made no answer to that and began again to revile me till i could bear it no longer and desired him to finish his visit i soon exchanged the bailiffs house for a prison where as i had not money sufficient to procure me a separate apartment i was crouded in with a great number of miserable wretches in common with whom i was destitute of every convenience of life even that which all the brutes enjoy wholesome air in these dreadful circumstances i applied by letter to several of my old acquaintance and such to whom i had formerly lent money without any great prospect of its being returned for their assistance but in vain an excuse instead of a denial was the gentlest answer i received whilst i languished in a condition too horrible to be described and which in a land of humanity and what is much more christianity seems a strange punishment for a little inadvertency and indiscretion whilst i was in this condition a fellow came into the prison and enquiring me out delivered me the following letter      sirmy father to whom you sold your ticket in the last     lottery died the same day in which it came up a prize as you     have possibly heard and left me sole heiress of all his     fortune i am so much touched with your present circumstances     and the uneasiness you must feel at having been driven to     dispose of what might have made you happy that i must desire     your acceptance of the enclosed and am your humble servant      harriet hearty  and what do you think was enclosed i dont know cried adams not less than a guinea i hope sir it was a banknote for £ 00£ 00 says adams in a rapture no less i assure you answered the gentleman a sum i was not half so delighted with as with the dear name of the generous girl that sent it me and who was not only the best but the handsomest creature in the universe and for whom i had long had a passion which i never durst disclose to her i kissed her name a thousand times my eyes overflowing with tenderness and gratitude i repeatedbut not to detain you with these raptures i immediately acquired my liberty and having paid all my debts departed with upwards of fifty pounds in my pocket to thank my kind deliverer she happened to be then out of town a circumstance which upon reflection pleased me for by that means i had an opportunity to appear before her in a more decent dress at her return to town within a day or two i threw myself at her feet with the most ardent acknowledgments which she rejected with an unfeigned greatness of mind and told me i could not oblige her more than by never mentioning or if possible thinking on a circumstance which must bring to my mind an accident that might be grievous to me to think on she proceeded thus what i have done is in my own eyes a trifle and perhaps infinitely less than would have become me to do and if you think of engaging in any business where a larger sum may be serviceable to you i shall not be overrigid either as to the security or interest i endeavoured to express all the gratitude in my power to this profusion of goodness though perhaps it was my enemy and began to afflict my mind with more agonies than all the miseries i had underwent it affected me with severer reflections than poverty distress and prisons united had been able to make me feel for sir these acts and professions of kindness which were sufficient to have raised in a good heart the most violent passion of friendship to one of the same or to age and ugliness in a different sex came to me from a woman a young and beautiful woman one whose perfections i had long known and for whom i had long conceived a violent passion though with a despair which made me endeavour rather to curb and conceal than to nourish or acquaint her with it in short they came upon me united with beauty softness and tenderness such bewitching smileso mr adams in that moment i lost myself and forgetting our different situations nor considering what return i was making to her goodness by desiring her who had given me so much to bestow her all i laid gently hold on her hand and conveying it to my lips i prest it with inconceivable ardour then lifting up my swimming eyes i saw her face and neck overspread with one blush she offered to withdraw her hand yet not so as to deliver it from mine though i held it with the gentlest force we both stood trembling her eyes cast on the ground and mine stedfastly fixed on her good gd what was then the condition of my soul burning with love desire admiration gratitude and every tender passion all bent on one charming object passion at last got the better of both reason and respect and softly letting go her hand i offered madly to clasp her in my arms when a little recovering herself she started from me asking me with some show of anger if she had any reason to expect this treatment from me i then fell prostrate before her and told her if i had offended my life was absolutely in her power which i would in any manner lose for her sake nay madam said i you shall not be so ready to punish me as i to suffer i own my guilt i detest the reflection that i would have sacrificed your happiness to mine believe me i sincerely repent my ingratitude yet believe me too it was my passion my unbounded passion for you which hurried me so far i have loved you long and tenderly and the goodness you have shown me hath innocently weighed down a wretch undone before acquit me of all mean mercenary views and before i take my leave of you for ever which i am resolved instantly to do believe me that fortune could have raised me to no height to which i could not have gladly lifted you o curst be fortunedo not says she interrupting me with the sweetest voice do not curse fortune since she hath made me happy and if she hath put your happiness in my power i have told you you shall ask nothing in reason which i will refuse madam said i you mistake me if you imagine as you seem my happiness is in the power of fortune now you have obliged me too much already if i have any wish it is for some blest accident by which i may contribute with my life to the least augmentation of your felicity as for myself the only happiness i can ever have will be hearing of yours and if fortune will make that complete i will forgive her all her wrongs to me you may indeed answered she smiling for your own happiness must be included in mine i have long known your worth nay i must confess said she blushing i have long discovered that passion for me you profess notwithstanding those endeavours which i am convinced were unaffected to conceal it and if all i can give with reason will not suffice take reason away and now i believe you cannot ask me what i will denyshe uttered these words with a sweetness not to be imagined i immediately started my blood which lay freezing at my heart rushed tumultuously through every vein i stood for a moment silent then flying to her i caught her in my arms no longer resisting and softly told her she must give me then herself o sir can i describe her look she remained silent and almost motionless several minutes at last recovering herself a little she insisted on my leaving her and in such a manner that i instantly obeyed you may imagine however i soon saw her againbut i ask pardon i fear i have detained you too long in relating the particulars of the former interview so far otherwise said adams licking his lips that i could willingly hear it over again well sir continued the gentleman to be as concise as possible within a week she consented to make me the happiest of mankind we were married shortly after and when i came to examine the circumstances of my wifes fortune which i do assure you i was not presently at leisure enough to do i found it amounted to about six thousand pounds most part of which lay in effects for her father had been a winemerchant and she seemed willing if i liked it that i should carry on the same trade i readily and too inconsiderately undertook it for not having been bred up to the secrets of the business and endeavouring to deal with the utmost honesty and uprightness i soon found our fortune in a declining way and my trade decreasing by little and little for my wines which i never adulterated after their importation and were sold as neat as they came over were universally decried by the vintners to whom i could not allow them quite as cheap as those who gained double the profit by a less price i soon began to despair of improving our fortune by these means nor was i at all easy at the visits and familiarity of many who had been my acquaintance in my prosperity but had denied and shunned me in my adversity and now very forwardly renewed their acquaintance with me in short i had sufficiently seen that the pleasures of the world are chiefly folly and the business of it mostly knavery and both nothing better than vanity the men of pleasure tearing one another to pieces from the emulation of spending money and the men of business from envy in getting it my happiness consisted entirely in my wife whom i loved with an inexpressible fondness which was perfectly returned and my prospects were no other than to provide for our growing family for she was now big of her second child i therefore took an opportunity to ask her opinion of entering into a retired life which after hearing my reasons and perceiving my affection for it she readily embraced we soon put our small fortune now reduced under three thousand pounds into money with part of which we purchased this little place whither we retired soon after her delivery from a world full of bustle noise hatred envy and ingratitude to ease quiet and love we have here lived almost twenty years with little other conversation than our own most of the neighbourhood taking us for very strange people the squire of the parish representing me as a madman and the parson as a presbyterian because i will not hunt with the one nor drink with the other sir says adams fortune hath i think paid you all her debts in this sweet retirement sir replied the gentleman i am thankful to the great author of all things for the blessings i here enjoy i have the best of wives and three pretty children for whom i have the true tenderness of a parent but no blessings are pure in this world within three years of my arrival here i lost my eldest son here he sighed bitterly sir says adams we must submit to providence and consider death as common to all we must submit indeed answered the gentleman and if he had died i could have borne the loss with patience but alas sir he was stolen away from my door by some wicked travelling people whom they call gipsies nor could i ever with the most diligent search recover him poor child he had the sweetest lookthe exact picture of his mother at which some tears unwittingly dropt from his eyes as did likewise from those of adams who always sympathized with his friends on those occasions thus sir said the gentleman i have finished my story in which if i have been too particular i ask your pardon and now if you please i will fetch you another bottle which proposal the parson thankfully accepted    chapter iv  a description of mr wilsons way of living the tragical adventure of the dog and other grave matters   the gentleman returned with the bottle and adams and he sat some time silent when the former started up and cried no that wont do the gentleman inquired into his meaning he answered he had been considering that it was possible the late famous king theodore might have been that very son whom he had lost but added that his age could not answer that imagination however says he g disposes all things for the best and very probably he may be some great man or duke and may one day or other revisit you in that capacity the gentleman answered he should know him amongst ten thousand for he had a mark on his left breast of a strawberry which his mother had given him by longing for that fruit  that beautiful young lady the morning now rose from her bed and with a countenance blooming with fresh youth and sprightliness like miss a with soft dews hanging on her pouting lips began to take her early walk over the eastern hills and presently after that gallant person the sun stole softly from his wifes chamber to pay his addresses to her when the gentleman asked his guest if he would walk forth and survey his little garden which he readily agreed to and joseph at the same time awaking from a sleep in which he had been two hours buried went with them no parterres no fountains no statues embellished this little garden its only ornament was a short walk shaded on each side by a filberthedge with a small alcove at one end whither in hot weather the gentleman and his wife used to retire and divert themselves with their children who played in the walk before them but though vanity had no votary in this little spot here was variety of fruit and everything useful for the kitchen which was abundantly sufficient to catch the admiration of adams who told the gentleman he had certainly a good gardener sir answered he that gardener is now before you whatever you see here is the work solely of my own hands whilst i am providing necessaries for my table i likewise procure myself an appetite for them in fair seasons i seldom pass less than six hours of the twentyfour in this place where i am not idle and by these means i have been able to preserve my health ever since my arrival here without assistance from physic hither i generally repair at the dawn and exercise myself whilst my wife dresses her children and prepares our breakfast after which we are seldom asunder during the residue of the day for when the weather will not permit them to accompany me here i am usually within with them for i am neither ashamed of conversing with my wife nor of playing with my children to say the truth i do not perceive that inferiority of understanding which the levity of rakes the dulness of men of business or the austerity of the learned would persuade us of in women as for my woman i declare i have found none of my own sex capable of making juster observations on life or of delivering them more agreeably nor do i believe any one possessed of a faithfuller or braver friend and sure as this friendship is sweetened with more delicacy and tenderness so is it confirmed by dearer pledges than can attend the closest male alliance for what union can be so fast as our common interest in the fruits of our embraces perhaps sir you are not yourself a father if you are not be assured you cannot conceive the delight i have in my little ones would you not despise me if you saw me stretched on the ground and my children playing round me i should reverence the sight quoth adams i myself am now the father of six and have been of eleven and i can say i never scourged a child of my own unless as his schoolmaster and then have felt every stroke on my own posteriors and as to what you say concerning women i have often lamented my own wife did not understand greekthe gentleman smiled and answered he would not be apprehended to insinuate that his own had an understanding above the care of her family on the contrary says he my harriet i assure you is a notable housewife and few gentlemens housekeepers understand cookery or confectionery better but these are arts which she hath no great occasion for now however the wine you commended so much last night at supper was of her own making as is indeed all the liquor in my house except my beer which falls to my province and i assure you it is as excellent quoth adams as ever i tasted we formerly kept a maidservant but since my girls have been growing up she is unwilling to indulge them in idleness for as the fortunes i shall give them will be very small we intend not to breed them above the rank they are likely to fill hereafter nor to teach them to despise or ruin a plain husband indeed i could wish a man of my own temper and a retired life might fall to their lot for i have experienced that calm serene happiness which is seated in content is inconsistent with the hurry and bustle of the world he was proceeding thus when the little things being just risen ran eagerly towards him and asked him blessing they were shy to the strangers but the eldest acquainted her father that her mother and the young gentlewoman were up and that breakfast was ready they all went in where the gentleman was surprized at the beauty of fanny who had now recovered herself from her fatigue and was entirely clean drest for the rogues who had taken away her purse had left her her bundle but if he was so much amazed at the beauty of this young creature his guests were no less charmed at the tenderness which appeared in the behaviour of the husband and wife to each other and to their children and at the dutiful and affectionate behaviour of these to their parents these instances pleased the welldisposed mind of adams equally with the readiness which they exprest to oblige their guests and their forwardness to offer them the best of everything in their house and what delighted him still more was an instance or two of their charity for whilst they were at breakfast the good woman was called for to assist her sick neighbour which she did with some cordials made for the public use and the good man went into his garden at the same time to supply another with something which he wanted thence for they had nothing which those who wanted it were not welcome to these good people were in the utmost cheerfulness when they heard the report of a gun and immediately afterwards a little dog the favourite of the eldest daughter came limping in all bloody and laid himself at his mistresss feet the poor girl who was about eleven years old burst into tears at the sight and presently one of the neighbours came in and informed them that the young squire the son of the lord of the manor had shot him as he past by swearing at the same time he would prosecute the master of him for keeping a spaniel for that he had given notice he would not suffer one in the parish the dog whom his mistress had taken into her lap died in a few minutes licking her hand she exprest great agony at his loss and the other children began to cry for their sisters misfortune nor could fanny herself refrain whilst the father and mother attempted to comfort her adams grasped his crabstick and would have sallied out after the squire had not joseph withheld him he could not however bridle his tonguehe pronounced the word rascal with great emphasis said he deserved to be hanged more than a highwayman and wished he had the scourging him the mother took her child lamenting and carrying the dead favourite in her arms out of the room when the gentleman said this was the second time this squire had endeavoured to kill the little wretch and had wounded him smartly once before adding he could have no motive but illnature for the little thing which was not near as big as ones fist had never been twenty yards from the house in the six years his daughter had had it he said he had done nothing to deserve this usage but his father had too great a fortune to contend with that he was as absolute as any tyrant in the universe and had killed all the dogs and taken away all the guns in the neighbourhood and not only that but he trampled down hedges and rode over corn and gardens with no more regard than if they were the highway i wish i could catch him in my garden said adams though i would rather forgive him riding through my house than such an illnatured act as this  the cheerfulness of their conversation being interrupted by this accident in which the guests could be of no service to their kind entertainer and as the mother was taken up in administering consolation to the poor girl whose disposition was too good hastily to forget the sudden loss of her little favourite which had been fondling with her a few minutes before and as joseph and fanny were impatient to get home and begin those previous ceremonies to their happiness which adams had insisted on they now offered to take their leave the gentleman importuned them much to stay dinner but when he found their eagerness to depart he summoned his wife and accordingly having performed all the usual ceremonies of bows and curtsies more pleasant to be seen than to be related they took their leave the gentleman and his wife heartily wishing them a good journey and they as heartily thanking them for their kind entertainment they then departed adams declaring that this was the manner in which the people had lived in the golden age  a whoever the reader pleases    chapter v  a disputation on schools held on the road between mr abraham adams and joseph and a discovery not unwelcome to them both   our travellers having well refreshed themselves at the gentlemans house joseph and fanny with sleep and mr abraham adams with ale and tobacco renewed their journey with great alacrity and pursuing the road into which they were directed travelled many miles before they met with any adventure worth relating in this interval we shall present our readers with a very curious discourse as we apprehend it concerning public schools which passed between mr joseph andrews and mr abraham adams  they had not gone far before adams calling to joseph asked him if he had attended to the gentlemans story he answered to all the former partand dont you think says he he was a very unhappy man in his youtha very unhappy man indeed answered the other joseph cries adams screwing up his mouth i have found it i have discovered the cause of all the misfortunes which befel him a public school joseph was the cause of all the calamities which he afterwards suffered public schools are the nurseries of all vice and immorality all the wicked fellows whom i remember at the university were bred at themah lord i can remember as well as if it was but yesterday a knot of them they called them kings scholars i forget whyvery wicked fellows joseph you may thank the lord you were not bred at a public school you would never have preserved your virtue as you have the first care i always take is of a boys morals i had rather he should be a blockhead than an atheist or a presbyterian what is all the learning in the world compared to his immortal soul what shall a man take in exchange for his soul but the masters of great schools trouble themselves about no such thing i have known a lad of eighteen at the university who hath not been able to say his catechism but for my own part i always scourged a lad sooner for missing that than any other lesson believe me child all that gentlemans misfortunes arose from his being educated at a public school  it doth not become me answered joseph to dispute anything sir with you especially a matter of this kind for to be sure you must be allowed by all the world to be the best teacher of a school in all our county yes that says adams i believe is granted me that i may without much vanity pretend tonay i believe i may go to the next county toobut gloriari non est meumhowever sir as you are pleased to bid me speak says joseph you know my late master sir thomas booby was bred at a public school and he was the finest gentleman in all the neighbourhood and i have often heard him say if he had a hundred boys he would breed them all at the same place it was his opinion and i have often heard him deliver it that a boy taken from a public school and carried into the world will learn more in one year there than one of a private education will in five he used to say the school itself initiated him a great way i remember that was his very expression for great schools are little societies where a boy of any observation may see in epitome what he will afterwards find in the world at largehinc illae lachrymae for that very reason quoth adams i prefer a private school where boys may be kept in innocence and ignorance for according to that fine passage in the play of cato the only english tragedy i ever read      if knowledge of the world must make men villains     may juba ever live in ignorance  who would not rather preserve the purity of his child than wish him to attain the whole circle of arts and sciences which by the bye he may learn in the classes of a private school for i would not be vain but i esteem myself to be second to none nulli secundum in teaching these things so that a lad may have as much learning in a private as in a public educationand with submission answered joseph he may get as much vice witness several country gentlemen who were educated within five miles of their own houses and are as wicked as if they had known the world from their infancy i remember when i was in the stable if a young horse was vicious in his nature no correction would make him otherwise i take it to be equally the same among men if a boy be of a mischievous wicked inclination no school though ever so private will ever make him good on the contrary if he be of a righteous temper you may trust him to london or wherever else you pleasehe will be in no danger of being corrupted besides i have often heard my master say that the discipline practised in public schools was much better than that in privateyou talk like a jackanapes says adams and so did your master discipline indeed because one man scourges twenty or thirty boys more in a morning than another is he therefore a better disciplinarian i do presume to confer in this point with all who have taught from chirons time to this day and if i was master of six boys only i would preserve as good discipline amongst them as the master of the greatest school in the world i say nothing young man remember i say nothing but if sir thomas himself had been educated nearer home and under the tuition of somebodyremember i name nobodyit might have been better for himbut his father must institute him in the knowledge of the world nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit joseph seeing him run on in this manner asked pardon many times assuring him he had no intention to offend i believe you had not child said he and i am not angry with you but for maintaining good discipline in a school for thisand then he ran on as before named all the masters who are recorded in old books and preferred himself to them all indeed if this good man had an enthusiasm or what the vulgar call a blind side it was this he thought a schoolmaster the greatest character in the world and himself the greatest of all schoolmasters neither of which points he would have given up to alexander the great at the head of his army  adams continued his subject till they came to one of the beautifullest spots of ground in the universe it was a kind of natural amphitheatre formed by the winding of a small rivulet which was planted with thick woods and the trees rose gradually above each other by the natural ascent of the ground they stood on which ascent as they hid with their boughs they seemed to have been disposed by the design of the most skilful planter the soil was spread with a verdure which no paint could imitate and the whole place might have raised romantic ideas in elder minds than those of joseph and fanny without the assistance of love  here they arrived about noon and joseph proposed to adams that they should rest awhile in this delightful place and refresh themselves with some provisions which the goodnature of mrs wilson had provided them with adams made no objection to the proposal so down they sat and pulling out a cold fowl and a bottle of wine they made a repast with a cheerfulness which might have attracted the envy of more splendid tables i should not omit that they found among their provision a little paper containing a piece of gold which adams imagining had been put there by mistake would have returned back to restore it but he was at last convinced by joseph that mr wilson had taken this handsome way of furnishing them with a supply for their journey on his having related the distress which they had been in when they were relieved by the generosity of the pedlar adams said he was glad to see such an instance of goodness not so much for the conveniency which it brought them as for the sake of the doer whose reward would be great in heaven he likewise comforted himself with a reflection that he should shortly have an opportunity of returning it him for the gentleman was within a week to make a journey into somersetshire to pass through adamss parish and had faithfully promised to call on him a circumstance which we thought too immaterial to mention before but which those who have as great an affection for that gentleman as ourselves will rejoice at as it may give them hopes of seeing him again then joseph made a speech on charity which the reader if he is so disposed may see in the next chapter for we scorn to betray him into any such reading without first giving him warning    chapter vi  moral reflections by joseph andrews with the hunting adventure and parson adamss miraculous escape   i have often wondered sir said joseph to observe so few instances of charity among mankind for though the goodness of a mans heart did not incline him to relieve the distresses of his fellowcreatures methinks the desire of honour should move him to it what inspires a man to build fine houses to purchase fine furniture pictures clothes and other things at a great expense but an ambition to be respected more than other people now would not one great act of charity one instance of redeeming a poor family from all the miseries of poverty restoring an unfortunate tradesman by a sum of money to the means of procuring a livelihood by his industry discharging an undone debtor from his debts or a gaol or any suchlike example of goodness create a man more honour and respect than he could acquire by the finest house furniture pictures or clothes that were ever beheld for not only the object himself who was thus relieved but all who heard the name of such a person must i imagine reverence him infinitely more than the possessor of all those other things which when we so admire we rather praise the builder the workman the painter the lacemaker the taylor and the rest by whose ingenuity they are produced than the person who by his money makes them his own for my own part when i have waited behind my lady in a room hung with fine pictures while i have been looking at them i have never once thought of their owner nor hath any one else as i ever observed for when it hath been asked whose picture that was it was never once answered the masters of the house but ammyconni paul varnish hannibal scratchi or hogarthi which i suppose were the names of the painters but if it was askedwho redeemed such a one out of prison who lent such a ruined tradesman money to set up who clothed that family of poor small children it is very plain what must be the answer and besides these great folks are mistaken if they imagine they get any honour at all by these means for i do not remember i ever was with my lady at any house where she commended the house or furniture but i have heard her at her return home make sport and jeer at whatever she had before commended and i have been told by other gentlemen in livery that it is the same in their families but i defy the wisest man in the world to turn a true good action into ridicule i defy him to do it he who should endeavour it would be laughed at himself instead of making others laugh nobody scarce doth any good yet they all agree in praising those who do indeed it is strange that all men should consent in commending goodness and no man endeavour to deserve that commendation whilst on the contrary all rail at wickedness and all are as eager to be what they abuse this i know not the reason of but it is as plain as daylight to those who converse in the world as i have done these three years are all the great folks wicked then says fanny to be sure there are some exceptions answered joseph some gentlemen of our cloth report charitable actions done by their lords and masters and i have heard squire pope the great poet at my ladys table tell stories of a man that lived at a place called ross and another at the bath one alali forget his name but it is in the book of verses this gentleman hath built up a stately house too which the squire likes very well but his charity is seen farther than his house though it stands on a hillay and brings him more honour too it was his charity that put him in the book where the squire says he puts all those who deserve it and to be sure as he lives among all the great people if there were any such he would know them this was all of mr joseph andrewss speech which i could get him to recollect which i have delivered as near as was possible in his own words with a very small embellishment but i believe the reader hath not been a little surprized at the long silence of parson adams especially as so many occasions offered themselves to exert his curiosity and observation the truth is he was fast asleep and had so been from the beginning of the preceding narrative and indeed if the reader considers that so many hours had passed since he had closed his eyes he will not wonder at his repose though even henley himself or as great an orator if any such be had been in his rostrum or tub before him  joseph who whilst he was speaking had continued in one attitude with his head reclining on one side and his eyes cast on the ground no sooner perceived on looking up the position of adams who was stretched on his back and snored louder than the usual braying of the animal with long ears than he turned towards fanny and taking her by the hand began a dalliance which though consistent with the purest innocence and decency neither he would have attempted nor she permitted before any witness whilst they amused themselves in this harmless and delightful manner they heard a pack of hounds approaching in full cry towards them and presently afterwards saw a hare pop forth from the wood and crossing the water land within a few yards of them in the meadows the hare was no sooner on shore than it seated itself on its hinder legs and listened to the sound of the pursuers fanny was wonderfully pleased with the little wretch and eagerly longed to have it in her arms that she might preserve it from the dangers which seemed to threaten it but the rational part of the creation do not always aptly distinguish their friends from their foes what wonder then if this silly creature the moment it beheld her fled from the friend who would have protected it and traversing the meadows again passed the little rivulet on the opposite side it was however so spent and weak that it fell down twice or thrice in its way this affected the tender heart of fanny who exclaimed with tears in her eyes against the barbarity of worrying a poor innocent defenceless animal out of its life and putting it to the extremest torture for diversion she had not much time to make reflections of this kind for on a sudden the hounds rushed through the wood which resounded with their throats and the throats of their retinue who attended on them on horseback the dogs now past the rivulet and pursued the footsteps of the hare five horsemen attempted to leap over three of whom succeeded and two were in the attempt thrown from their saddles into the water their companions and their own horses too proceeded after their sport and left their friends and riders to invoke the assistance of fortune or employ the more active means of strength and agility for their deliverance joseph however was not so unconcerned on this occasion he left fanny for a moment to herself and ran to the gentlemen who were immediately on their legs shaking their ears and easily with the help of his hand obtained the bank for the rivulet was not at all deep and without staying to thank their kind assister ran dripping across the meadow calling to their brother sportsmen to stop their horses but they heard them not  the hounds were now very little behind their poor reeling staggering prey which fainting almost at every step crawled through the wood and had almost got round to the place where fanny stood when it was overtaken by its enemies and being driven out of the covert was caught and instantly tore to pieces before fannys face who was unable to assist it with any aid more powerful than pity nor could she prevail on joseph who had been himself a sportsman in his youth to attempt anything contrary to the laws of hunting in favour of the hare which he said was killed fairly  the hare was caught within a yard or two of adams who lay asleep at some distance from the lovers and the hounds in devouring it and pulling it backwards and forwards had drawn it so close to him that some of them by mistake perhaps for the hares skin laid hold of the skirts of his cassock others at the same time applying their teeth to his wig which he had with a handkerchief fastened to his head began to pull him about and had not the motion of his body had more effect on him than seemed to be wrought by the noise they must certainly have tasted his flesh which delicious flavour might have been fatal to him but being roused by these tuggings he instantly awaked and with a jerk delivering his head from his wig he with most admirable dexterity recovered his legs which now seemed the only members he could entrust his safety to having therefore escaped likewise from at least a third part of his cassock which he willingly left as his exuviae or spoils to the enemy he fled with the utmost speed he could summon to his assistance nor let this be any detraction from the bravery of his character let the number of the enemies and the surprize in which he was taken be considered and if there be any modern so outrageously brave that he cannot admit of flight in any circumstance whatever i say but i whisper that softly and i solemnly declare without any intention of giving offence to any brave man in the nation i say or rather i whisper that he is an ignorant fellow and hath never read homer nor virgil nor knows he anything of hector or turnus nay he is unacquainted with the history of some great men living who though as brave as lions ay as tigers have run away the lord knows how far and the lord knows why to the surprize of their friends and the entertainment of their enemies but if persons of such heroic disposition are a little offended at the behaviour of adams we assure them they shall be as much pleased with what we shall immediately relate of joseph andrews the master of the pack was just arrived or as the sportsmen call it come in when adams set out as we have before mentioned this gentleman was generally said to be a great lover of humour but not to mince the matter especially as we are upon this subject he was a great hunter of men indeed he had hitherto followed the sport only with dogs of his own species for he kept two or three couple of barking curs for that use only however as he thought he had now found a man nimble enough he was willing to indulge himself with other sport and accordingly crying out stole away encouraged the hounds to pursue mr adams swearing it was the largest jackhare he ever saw at the same time hallooing and hooping as if a conquered foe was flying before him in which he was imitated by these two or three couple of human or rather twolegged curs on horseback which we have mentioned before  now thou whoever thou art whether a muse or by what other name soever thou choosest to be called who presidest over biography and hast inspired all the writers of lives in these our times thou who didst infuse such wonderful humour into the pen of immortal gulliver who hast carefully guided the judgment whilst thou hast exalted the nervous manly style of thy mallet thou who hadst no hand in that dedication and preface or the translations which thou wouldst willingly have struck out of the life of cicero lastly thou who without the assistance of the least spice of literature and even against his inclination hast in some pages of his book forced colley cibber to write english do thou assist me in what i find myself unequal to do thou introduce on the plain the young the gay the brave joseph andrews whilst men shall view him with admiration and envy tender virgins with love and anxious concern for his safety  no sooner did joseph andrews perceive the distress of his friend when first the quickscenting dogs attacked him than he grasped his cudgel in his right handa cudgel which his father had of his grandfather to whom a mighty strong man of kent had given it for a present in that day when he broke three heads on the stage it was a cudgel of mighty strength and wonderful art made by one of mr deards best workmen whom no other artificer can equal and who hath made all those sticks which the beaus have lately walked with about the park in a morning but this was far his masterpiece on its head was engraved a nose and chin which might have been mistaken for a pair of nutcrackers the learned have imagined it designed to represent the gorgon but it was in fact copied from the face of a certain long english baronet of infinite wit humour and gravity he did intend to have engraved here many histories as the first night of captain bs play where you would have seen critics in embroidery transplanted from the boxes to the pit whose ancient inhabitants were exalted to the galleries where they played on catcalls he did intend to have painted an auction room where mr cock would have appeared aloft in his pulpit trumpeting forth the praises of a china basin and with astonishment wondering that nobody bids more for that fine that superb he did intend to have engraved many other things but was forced to leave all out for want of room  no sooner had joseph grasped his cudgel in his hands than lightning darted from his eyes and the heroick youth swift of foot ran with the utmost speed to his friends assistance he overtook him just as rockwood had laid hold of the skirt of his cassock which being torn hung to the ground reader we would make a simile on this occasion but for two reasons the first is it would interrupt the description which should be rapid in this part but that doth not weigh much many precedents occurring for such an interruption the second and much the greater reason is that we could find no simile adequate to our purpose for indeed what instance could we bring to set before our readers eyes at once the idea of friendship courage youth beauty strength and swiftness all which blazed in the person of joseph andrews let those therefore that describe lions and tigers and heroes fiercer than both raise their poems or plays with the simile of joseph andrews who is himself above the reach of any simile  now rockwood had laid fast hold on the parsons skirts and stopt his flight which joseph no sooner perceived than he levelled his cudgel at his head and laid him sprawling jowler and ringwood then fell on his greatcoat and had undoubtedly brought him to the ground had not joseph collecting all his force given jowler such a rap on the back that quitting his hold he ran howling over the plain a harder fate remained for thee o ringwood ringwood the best hound that ever pursued a hare who never threw his tongue but where the scent was undoubtedly true good at trailing and sure in a highway no babler no overrunner respected by the whole pack who whenever he opened knew the game was at hand he fell by the stroke of joseph thunder and plunder and wonder and blunder were the next victims of his wrath and measured their lengths on the ground then fairmaid a bitch which mr john temple had bred up in his house and fed at his own table and lately sent the squire fifty miles for a present ran fiercely at joseph and bit him by the leg no dog was ever fiercer than she being descended from an amazonian breed and had worried bulls in her own country but now waged an unequal fight and had shared the fate of those we have mentioned before had not diana the reader may believe it or not if he pleases in that instant interposed and in the shape of the huntsman snatched her favourite up in her arms  the parson now faced about and with his crabstick felled many to the earth and scattered others till he was attacked by caesar and pulled to the ground then joseph flew to his rescue and with such might fell on the victor that o eternal blot to his name caesar ran yelping away  the battle now raged with the most dreadful violence when lo the huntsman a man of years and dignity lifted his voice and called his hounds from the fight telling them in a language they understood that it was in vain to contend longer for that fate had decreed the victory to their enemies  thus far the muse hath with her usual dignity related this prodigious battle a battle we apprehend never equalled by any poet romance or life writer whatever and having brought it to a conclusion she ceased we shall therefore proceed in our ordinary style with the continuation of this history the squire and his companions whom the figure of adams and the gallantry of joseph had at first thrown into a violent fit of laughter and who had hitherto beheld the engagement with more delight than any chase shootingmatch race cockfighting bull or bear baiting had ever given them began now to apprehend the danger of their hounds many of which lay sprawling in the fields the squire therefore having first called his friends about him as guards for safety of his person rode manfully up to the combatants and summoning all the terror he was master of into his countenance demanded with an authoritative voice of joseph what he meant by assaulting his dogs in that manner joseph answered with great intrepidity that they had first fallen on his friend and if they had belonged to the greatest man in the kingdom he would have treated them in the same way for whilst his veins contained a single drop of blood he would not stand idle by and see that gentleman pointing to adams abused either by man or beast and having so said both he and adams brandished their wooden weapons and put themselves into such a posture that the squire and his company thought proper to preponderate before they offered to revenge the cause of their fourfooted allies  at this instant fanny whom the apprehension of josephs danger had alarmed so much that forgetting her own she had made the utmost expedition came up the squire and all the horsemen were so surprized with her beauty that they immediately fixed both their eyes and thoughts solely on her every one declaring he had never seen so charming a creature neither mirth nor anger engaged them a moment longer but all sat in silent amaze the huntsman only was free from her attraction who was busy in cutting the ears of the dogs and endeavouring to recover them to life in which he succeeded so well that only two of no great note remained slaughtered on the field of action upon this the huntsman declared twas well it was no worse for his part he could not blame the gentleman and wondered his master would encourage the dogs to hunt christians that it was the surest way to spoil them to make them follow vermin instead of sticking to a hare  the squire being informed of the little mischief that had been done and perhaps having more mischief of another kind in his head accosted mr adams with a more favourable aspect than before he told him he was sorry for what had happened that he had endeavoured all he could to prevent it the moment he was acquainted with his cloth and greatly commended the courage of his servant for so he imagined joseph to be he then invited mr adams to dinner and desired the young woman might come with him adams refused a long while but the invitation was repeated with so much earnestness and courtesy that at length he was forced to accept it his wig and hat and other spoils of the field being gathered together by joseph for otherwise probably they would have been forgotten he put himself into the best order he could and then the horse and foot moved forward in the same pace towards the squires house which stood at a very little distance  whilst they were on the road the lovely fanny attracted the eyes of all they endeavoured to outvie one another in encomiums on her beauty which the reader will pardon my not relating as they had not anything new or uncommon in them so must he likewise my not setting down the many curious jests which were made on adams some of them declaring that parsonhunting was the best sport in the world others commending his standing at bay which they said he had done as well as any badger with such like merriment which though it would ill become the dignity of this history afforded much laughter and diversion to the squire and his facetious companions    chapter vii  a scene of roasting very nicely adapted to the present taste and times   they arrived at the squires house just as his dinner was ready a little dispute arose on the account of fanny whom the squire who was a bachelor was desirous to place at his own table but she would not consent nor would mr adams permit her to be parted from joseph so that she was at length with him consigned over to the kitchen where the servants were ordered to make him drunk a favour which was likewise intended for adams which design being executed the squire thought he should easily accomplish what he had when he first saw her intended to perpetrate with fanny  it may not be improper before we proceed farther to open a little the character of this gentleman and that of his friends the master of this house then was a man of a very considerable fortune a bachelor as we have said and about forty years of age he had been educated if we may use the expression in the country and at his own home under the care of his mother and a tutor who had orders never to correct him nor to compel him to learn more than he liked which it seems was very little and that only in his childhood for from the age of fifteen he addicted himself entirely to hunting and other rural amusements for which his mother took care to equip him with horses hounds and all other necessaries and his tutor endeavouring to ingratiate himself with his young pupil who would he knew be able handsomely to provide for him became his companion not only at these exercises but likewise over a bottle which the young squire had a very early relish for at the age of twenty his mother began to think she had not fulfilled the duty of a parent she therefore resolved to persuade her son if possible to that which she imagined would well supply all that he might have learned at a public school or universitythis is what they commonly call travelling which with the help of the tutor who was fixed on to attend him she easily succeeded in he made in three years the tour of europe as they term it and returned home well furnished with french clothes phrases and servants with a hearty contempt for his own country especially what had any savour of the plain spirit and honesty of our ancestors his mother greatly applauded herself at his return and now being master of his own fortune he soon procured himself a seat in parliament and was in the common opinion one of the finest gentlemen of his age but what distinguished him chiefly was a strange delight which he took in everything which is ridiculous odious and absurd in his own species so that he never chose a companion without one or more of these ingredients and those who were marked by nature in the most eminent degree with them were most his favourites if he ever found a man who either had not or endeavoured to conceal these imperfections he took great pleasure in inventing methods of forcing him into absurdities which were not natural to him or in drawing forth and exposing those that were for which purpose he was always provided with a set of fellows whom we have before called curs and who did indeed no great honour to the canine kind their business was to hunt out and display everything that had any savour of the abovementioned qualities and especially in the gravest and best characters but if they failed in their search they were to turn even virtue and wisdom themselves into ridicule for the diversion of their master and feeder the gentlemen of curlike disposition who were now at his house and whom he had brought with him from london were an old halfpay officer a player a dull poet a quackdoctor a scraping fiddler and a lame german dancingmaster  as soon as dinner was served while mr adams was saying grace the captain conveyed his chair from behind him so that when he endeavoured to seat himself he fell down on the ground and this completed joke the first to the great entertainment of the whole company the second joke was performed by the poet who sat next him on the other side and took an opportunity while poor adams was respectfully drinking to the master of the house to overturn a plate of soup into his breeches which with the many apologies he made and the parsons gentle answers caused much mirth in the company joke the third was served up by one of the waitingmen who had been ordered to convey a quantity of gin into mr adamss ale which he declaring to be the best liquor he ever drank but rather too rich of the malt contributed again to their laughter mr adams from whom we had most of this relation could not recollect all the jests of this kind practised on him which the inoffensive disposition of his own heart made him slow in discovering and indeed had it not been for the information which we received from a servant of the family this part of our history which we take to be none of the least curious must have been deplorably imperfect though we must own it probable that some more jokes were as they call it cracked during their dinner but we have by no means been able to come at the knowledge of them when dinner was removed the poet began to repeat some verses which he said were made extempore the following is a copy of them procured with the greatest difficulty      an extempore poem on parson adams      did ever mortal such a parson view     his cassock old his wig not overnew     well might the hounds have him for fox mistaken     in smell more like to that than rusty bacona     but would it not make any mortal stare     to see this parson taken for a hare     could phoebus err thus grossly even he     for a good player might have taken thee  a all hounds that will hunt fox or other vermin will hunt a piece of     rusty bacon trailed on the ground  at which words the bard whipt off the players wig and received the approbation of the company rather perhaps for the dexterity of his hand than his head the player instead of retorting the jest on the poet began to display his talents on the same subject he repeated many scraps of wit out of plays reflecting on the whole body of the clergy which were received with great acclamations by all present it was now the dancingmasters turn to exhibit his talents he therefore addressing himself to adams in broken english told him he was a man ver well made for de dance and he suppose by his walk dat he had learn of some great master he said it was ver pretty quality in clergyman to dance and concluded with desiring him to dance a minuet telling him his cassock would serve for petticoats and that he would himself be his partner at which words without waiting for an answer he pulled out his gloves and the fiddler was preparing his fiddle the company all offered the dancingmaster wagers that the parson outdanced him which he refused saying he believed so too for he had never seen any man in his life who looked de dance so well as de gentleman he then stepped forwards to take adams by the hand which the latter hastily withdrew and at the same time clenching his fist advised him not to carry the jest too far for he would not endure being put upon the dancingmaster no sooner saw the fist than he prudently retired out of its reach and stood aloof mimicking adams whose eyes were fixed on him not guessing what he was at but to avoid his laying hold on him which he had once attempted in the meanwhile the captain perceiving an opportunity pinned a cracker or devil to the cassock and then lighted it with their little smokingcandle adams being a stranger to this sport and believing he had been blown up in reality started from his chair and jumped about the room to the infinite joy of the beholders who declared he was the best dancer in the universe as soon as the devil had done tormenting him and he had a little recovered his confusion he returned to the table standing up in the posture of one who intended to make a speech they all cried out hear him hear him and he then spoke in the following manner sir i am sorry to see one to whom providence hath been so bountiful in bestowing his favours make so ill and ungrateful a return for them for though you have not insulted me yourself it is visible you have delighted in those that do it nor have once discouraged the many rudenesses which have been shown towards me indeed towards yourself if you rightly understood them for i am your guest and by the laws of hospitality entitled to your protection one gentleman had thought proper to produce some poetry upon me of which i shall only say that i had rather be the subject than the composer he hath pleased to treat me with disrespect as a parson i apprehend my order is not the subject of scorn nor that i can become so unless by being a disgrace to it which i hope poverty will never be called another gentleman indeed hath repeated some sentences where the order itself is mentioned with contempt he says they are taken from plays i am sure such plays are a scandal to the government which permits them and cursed will be the nation where they are represented how others have treated me i need not observe they themselves when they reflect must allow the behaviour to be as improper to my years as to my cloth you found me sir travelling with two of my parishioners i omit your hounds falling on me for i have quite forgiven it whether it proceeded from the wantonness or negligence of the huntsman my appearance might very well persuade you that your invitation was an act of charity though in reality we were well provided yes sir if we had had an hundred miles to travel we had sufficient to bear our expenses in a noble manner at which words he produced the halfguinea which was found in the basket i do not show you this out of ostentation of riches but to convince you i speak truth your seating me at your table was an honour which i did not ambitiously affect when i was here i endeavoured to behave towards you with the utmost respect if i have failed it was not with design nor could i certainly so far be guilty as to deserve the insults i have suffered if they were meant therefore either to my order or my poverty and you see i am not very poor the shame doth not lie at my door and i heartily pray that the sin may be averted from yours he thus finished and received a general clap from the whole company then the gentleman of the house told him he was sorry for what had happened that he could not accuse him of any share in it that the verses were as himself had well observed so bad that he might easily answer them and for the serpent it was undoubtedly a very great affront done him by the dancingmaster for which if he well thrashed him as he deserved he should be very much pleased to see it in which probably he spoke truth adams answered whoever had done it it was not his profession to punish him that way but for the person whom he had accused i am a witness says he of his innocence for i had my eye on him all the while whoever he was god forgive him and bestow on him a little more sense as well as humanity the captain answered with a surly look and accent that he hoped he did not mean to reflect upon him dn him he had as much imanity as another and if any man said he had not he would convince him of his mistake by cutting his throat adams smiling said he believed he had spoke right by accident to which the captain returned what do you mean by my speaking right if you was not a parson i would not take these words but your gown protects you if any man who wears a sword had said so much i had pulled him by the nose before this adams replied if he attempted any rudeness to his person he would not find any protection for himself in his gown and clenching his fist declared he had thrashed many a stouter man the gentleman did all he could to encourage this warlike disposition in adams and was in hopes to have produced a battle but he was disappointed for the captain made no other answer than it is very well you are a parson and so drinking off a bumper to old mother church ended the dispute  then the doctor who had hitherto been silent and who was the gravest but most mischievous dog of all in a very pompous speech highly applauded what adams had said and as much discommended the behaviour to him he proceeded to encomiums on the church and poverty and lastly recommended forgiveness of what had passed to adams who immediately answered that everything was forgiven and in the warmth of his goodness he filled a bumper of strong beer a liquor he preferred to wine and drank a health to the whole company shaking the captain and the poet heartily by the hand and addressing himself with great respect to the doctor who indeed had not laughed outwardly at anything that past as he had a perfect command of his muscles and could laugh inwardly without betraying the least symptoms in his countenance the doctor now began a second formal speech in which he declaimed against all levity of conversation and what is usually called mirth he said there were amusements fitted for persons of all ages and degrees from the rattle to the discussing a point of philosophy and that men discovered themselves in nothing more than in the choice of their amusements for says he as it must greatly raise our expectation of the future conduct in life of boys whom in their tender years we perceive instead of taw or balls or other childish playthings to chuse at their leisure hours to exercise their genius in contentions of wit learning and such like so must it inspire one with equal contempt of a man if we should discover him playing at taw or other childish play adams highly commended the doctors opinion and said he had often wondered at some passages in ancient authors where scipio laelius and other great men were represented to have passed many hours in amusements of the most trifling kind the doctor replied he had by him an old greek manuscript where a favourite diversion of socrates was recorded ay says the parson eagerly i should be most infinitely obliged to you for the favour of perusing it the doctor promised to send it him and farther said that he believed he could describe it i think says he as near as i can remember it was this there was a throne erected on one side of which sat a king and on the other a queen with their guards and attendants ranged on both sides to them was introduced an ambassador which part socrates always used to perform himself and when he was led up to the footsteps of the throne he addressed himself to the monarchs in some grave speech full of virtue and goodness and morality and such like after which he was seated between the king and queen and royally entertained this i think was the chief part perhaps i may have forgot some particulars for it is long since i read it adams said it was indeed a diversion worthy the relaxation of so great a man and thought something resembling it should be instituted among our great men instead of cards and other idle pastime in which he was informed they trifled away too much of their lives he added the christian religion was a nobler subject for these speeches than any socrates could have invented the gentleman of the house approved what mr adams said and declared he was resolved to perform the ceremony this very evening to which the doctor objected as no one was prepared with a speech unless said he turning to adams with a gravity of countenance which would have deceived a more knowing man you have a sermon about you doctor sir said adams i never travel without one for fear of what may happen he was easily prevailed on by his worthy friend as he now called the doctor to undertake the part of the ambassador so that the gentleman sent immediate orders to have the throne erected which was performed before they had drank two bottles and perhaps the reader will hereafter have no great reason to admire the nimbleness of the servants indeed to confess the truth the throne was no more than this there was a great tub of water provided on each side of which were placed two stools raised higher than the surface of the tub and over the whole was laid a blanket on these stools were placed the king and queen namely the master of the house and the captain and now the ambassador was introduced between the poet and the doctor who having read his sermon to the great entertainment of all present was led up to his place and seated between their majesties they immediately rose up when the blanket wanting its supports at either end gave way and soused adams over head and ears in the water the captain made his escape but unluckily the gentleman himself not being as nimble as he ought adams caught hold of him before he descended from his throne and pulled him in with him to the entire secret satisfaction of all the company adams after ducking the squire twice or thrice leapt out of the tub and looked sharp for the doctor whom he would certainly have conveyed to the same place of honour but he had wisely withdrawn he then searched for his crabstick and having found that as well as his fellow travellers he declared he would not stay a moment longer in such a house he then departed without taking leave of his host whom he had exacted a more severe revenge on than he intended for as he did not use sufficient care to dry himself in time he caught a cold by the accident which threw him into a fever that had like to have cost him his life    chapter viii  which some readers will think too short and others too long   adams and joseph who was no less enraged than his friend at the treatment he met with went out with their sticks in their hands and carried off fanny notwithstanding the opposition of the servants who did all without proceeding to violence in their power to detain them they walked as fast as they could not so much from any apprehension of being pursued as that mr adams might by exercise prevent any harm from the water the gentleman who had given such orders to his servants concerning fanny that he did not in the least fear her getting away no sooner heard that she was gone than he began to rave and immediately despatched several with orders either to bring her back or never return the poet the player and all but the dancingmaster and doctor went on this errand  the night was very dark in which our friends began their journey however they made such expedition that they soon arrived at an inn which was at seven miles distance here they unanimously consented to pass the evening mr adams being now as dry as he was before he had set out on his embassy  this inn which indeed we might call an alehouse had not the words the new inn been writ on the sign afforded them no better provision than bread and cheese and ale on which however they made a very comfortable meal for hunger is better than a french cook  they had no sooner supped than adams returning thanks to the almighty for his food declared he had eat his homely commons with much greater satisfaction than his splendid dinner and expressed great contempt for the folly of mankind who sacrificed their hopes of heaven to the acquisition of vast wealth since so much comfort was to be found in the humblest state and the lowest provision very true sir says a grave man who sat smoaking his pipe by the fire and who was a traveller as well as himself i have often been as much surprized as you are when i consider the value which mankind in general set on riches since every days experience shows us how little is in their power for what indeed truly desirable can they bestow on us can they give beauty to the deformed strength to the weak or health to the infirm surely if they could we should not see so many illfavoured faces haunting the assemblies of the great nor would such numbers of feeble wretches languish in their coaches and palaces no not the wealth of a kingdom can purchase any paint to dress pale ugliness in the bloom of that young maiden nor any drugs to equip disease with the vigour of that young man do not riches bring us to solicitude instead of rest envy instead of affection and danger instead of safety can they prolong their own possession or lengthen his days who enjoys them so far otherwise that the sloth the luxury the care which attend them shorten the lives of millions and bring them with pain and misery to an untimely grave where then is their value if they can neither embellish nor strengthen our forms sweeten nor prolong our livesagain can they adorn the mind more than the body do they not rather swell the heart with vanity puff up the cheeks with pride shut our ears to every call of virtue and our bowels to every motive of compassion give me your hand brother said adams in a rapture for i suppose you are a clergymanno truly answered the other indeed he was a priest of the church of rome but those who understand our laws will not wonder he was not overready to own itwhatever you are cries adams you have spoken my sentiments i believe i have preached every syllable of your speech twenty times over for it hath always appeared to me easier for a cablerope which by the way is the true rendering of that word we have translated camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaventhat sir said the other will be easily granted you by divines and is deplorably true but as the prospect of our good at a distance doth not so forcibly affect us it might be of some service to mankind to be made thoroughly sensiblewhich i think they might be with very little serious attentionthat even the blessings of this world are not to be purchased with riches a doctrine in my opinion not only metaphysically but if i may so say mathematically demonstrable and which i have been always so perfectly convinced of that i have a contempt for nothing so much as for gold adams now began a long discourse but as most which he said occurs among many authors who have treated this subject i shall omit inserting it during its continuance joseph and fanny retired to rest and the host likewise left the room when the english parson had concluded the romish resumed the discourse which he continued with great bitterness and invective and at last ended by desiring adams to lend him eighteenpence to pay his reckoning promising if he never paid him he might be assured of his prayers the good man answered that eighteenpence would be too little to carry him any very long journey that he had half a guinea in his pocket which he would divide with him he then fell to searching his pockets but could find no money for indeed the company with whom he dined had passed one jest upon him which we did not then enumerate and had picked his pocket of all that treasure which he had so ostentatiously produced  bless me cried adams i have certainly lost it i can never have spent it sir as i am a christian i had a whole halfguinea in my pocket this morning and have not now a single halfpenny of it left sure the devil must have taken it from mesir answered the priest smiling you need make no excuses if you are not willing to lend me the money i am contentedsir cries adams if i had the greatest sum in the worldaye if i had ten pounds about mei would bestow it all to rescue any christian from distress i am more vexed at my loss on your account than my own was ever anything so unlucky because i have no money in my pocket i shall be suspected to be no christiani am more unlucky quoth the other if you are as generous as you say for really a crown would have made me happy and conveyed me in plenty to the place i am going which is not above twenty miles off and where i can arrive by tomorrow night i assure you i am not accustomed to travel pennyless i am but just arrived in england and we were forced by a storm in our passage to throw all we had overboard i dont suspect but this fellow will take my word for the trifle i owe him but i hate to appear so mean as to confess myself without a shilling to such people for these and indeed too many others know little difference in their estimation between a beggar and a thief however he thought he should deal better with the host that evening than the next morning he therefore resolved to set out immediately notwithstanding the darkness and accordingly as soon as the host returned he communicated to him the situation of his affairs upon which the host scratching his head answered why i do not know master if it be so and you have no money i must trust i think though i had rather always have ready money if i could but marry you look like so honest a gentleman that i dont fear your paying me if it was twenty times as much the priest made no reply but taking leave of him and adams as fast as he could not without confusion and perhaps with some distrust of adamss sincerity departed  he was no sooner gone than the host fell ashaking his head and declared if he had suspected the fellow had no money he would not have drawn him a single drop of drink saying he despaired of ever seeing his face again for that he looked like a confounded rogue  rabbit the fellow cries he i thought by his talking so much about riches that he had a hundred pounds at least in his pocket adams chid him for his suspicions which he said were not becoming a christian and then without reflecting on his loss or considering how he himself should depart in the morning he retired to a very homely bed as his companions had before however health and fatigue gave them a sweeter repose than is often in the power of velvet and down to bestow    chapter ix  containing as surprizing and bloody adventures as can be found in this or perhaps any other authentic history   it was almost morning when joseph andrews whose eyes the thoughts of his dear fanny had opened as he lay fondly meditating on that lovely creature heard a violent knocking at the door over which he lay he presently jumped out of bed and opening the window was asked if there were no travellers in the house and presently by another voice if two men and a woman had not taken up there their lodging that night though he knew not the voices he began to entertain a suspicion of the truthfor indeed he had received some information from one of the servants of the squires house of his designand answered in the negative one of the servants who knew the host well called out to him by his name just as he had opened another window and asked him the same question to which he answered in the affirmative o ho said another have we found you and ordered the host to come down and open his door fanny who was as wakeful as joseph no sooner heard all this than she leaped from her bed and hastily putting on her gown and petticoats ran as fast as possible to josephs room who then was almost drest he immediately let her in and embracing her with the most passionate tenderness bid her fear nothing for he would die in her defence is that a reason why i should not fear says she when i should lose what is dearer to me than the whole world joseph then kissing her hand said he could almost thank the occasion which had extorted from her a tenderness she would never indulge him with before he then ran and waked his bedfellow adams who was yet fast asleep notwithstanding many calls from joseph but was no sooner made sensible of their danger than he leaped from his bed without considering the presence of fanny who hastily turned her face from him and enjoyed a double benefit from the dark which as it would have prevented any offence to an innocence less pure or a modesty less delicate so it concealed even those blushes which were raised in her  adams had soon put on all his clothes but his breeches which in the hurry he forgot however they were pretty well supplied by the length of his other garments and now the housedoor being opened the captain the poet the player and three servants came in the captain told the host that two fellows who were in his house had run away with a young woman and desired to know in which room she lay the host who presently believed the story directed them and instantly the captain and poet justling one another ran up the poet who was the nimblest entering the chamber first searched the bed and every other part but to no purpose the bird was flown as the impatient reader who might otherwise have been in pain for her was before advertised they then enquired where the men lay and were approaching the chamber when joseph roared out in a loud voice that he would shoot the first man who offered to attack the door the captain enquired what firearms they had to which the host answered he believed they had none nay he was almost convinced of it for he had heard one ask the other in the evening what they should have done if they had been overtaken when they had no arms to which the other answered they would have defended themselves with their sticks as long as they were able and god would assist a just cause this satisfied the captain but not the poet who prudently retreated downstairs saying it was his business to record great actions and not to do them the captain was no sooner well satisfied that there were no firearms than bidding defiance to gunpowder and swearing he loved the smell of it he ordered the servants to follow him and marching boldly up immediately attempted to force the door which the servants soon helped him to accomplish when it was opened they discovered the enemy drawn up three deep adams in the front and fanny in the rear the captain told adams that if they would go all back to the house again they should be civilly treated but unless they consented he had orders to carry the young lady with him whom there was great reason to believe they had stolen from her parents for notwithstanding her disguise her air which she could not conceal sufficiently discovered her birth to be infinitely superior to theirs fanny bursting into tears solemnly assured him he was mistaken that she was a poor helpless foundling and had no relation in the world which she knew of and throwing herself on her knees begged that he would not attempt to take her from her friends who she was convinced would die before they would lose her which adams confirmed with words not far from amounting to an oath the captain swore he had no leisure to talk and bidding them thank themselves for what happened he ordered the servants to fall on at the same time endeavouring to pass by adams in order to lay hold on fanny but the parson interrupting him received a blow from one of them which without considering whence it came he returned to the captain and gave him so dexterous a knock in that part of the stomach which is vulgarly called the pit that he staggered some paces backwards the captain who was not accustomed to this kind of play and who wisely apprehended the consequence of such another blow two of them seeming to him equal to a thrust through the body drew forth his hanger as adams approached him and was levelling a blow at his head which would probably have silenced the preacher for ever had not joseph in that instant lifted up a certain huge stone pot of the chamber with one hand which six beaus could not have lifted with both and discharged it together with the contents full in the captains face the uplifted hanger dropped from his hand and he fell prostrated on the floor with a lumpish noise and his halfpence rattled in his pocket the red liquor which his veins contained and the white liquor which the pot contained ran in one stream down his face and his clothes nor had adams quite escaped some of the water having in its passage shed its honours on his head and began to trickle down the wrinkles or rather furrows of his cheeks when one of the servants snatching a mop out of a pail of water which had already done its duty in washing the house pushed it in the parsons face yet could not he bear him down for the parson wresting the mop from the fellow with one hand with the other brought his enemy as low as the earth having given him a stroke over that part of the face where in some men of pleasure the natural and artificial noses are conjoined  hitherto fortune seemed to incline the victory on the travellers side when according to her custom she began to show the fickleness of her disposition for now the host entering the field or rather chamber of battle flew directly at joseph and darting his head into his stomach for he was a stout fellow and an expert boxer almost staggered him but joseph stepping one leg back did with his left hand so chuck him under the chin that he reeled the youth was pursuing his blow with his right hand when he received from one of the servants such a stroke with a cudgel on his temples that it instantly deprived him of sense and he measured his length on the ground  fanny rent the air with her cries and adams was coming to the assistance of joseph but the two servingmen and the host now fell on him and soon subdued him though he fought like a madman and looked so black with the impressions he had received from the mop that don quixote would certainly have taken him for an inchanted moor but now follows the most tragical part for the captain was risen again and seeing joseph on the floor and adams secured he instantly laid hold on fanny and with the assistance of the poet and player who hearing the battle was over were now come up dragged her crying and tearing her hair from the sight of her joseph and with a perfect deafness to all her entreaties carried her downstairs by violence and fastened her on the players horse and the captain mounting his own and leading that on which this poor miserable wretch was departed without any more consideration of her cries than a butcher hath of those of a lamb for indeed his thoughts were entertained only with the degree of favour which he promised himself from the squire on the success of this adventure  the servants who were ordered to secure adams and joseph as safe as possible that the squire might receive no interruption to his design on poor fanny immediately by the poets advice tied adams to one of the bedposts as they did joseph on the other side as soon as they could bring him to himself and then leaving them together back to back and desiring the host not to set them at liberty nor to go near them till he had further orders they departed towards their master but happened to take a different road from that which the captain had fallen into    chapter x  a discourse between the poet and the player of no other use in this history but to divert the reader   before we proceed any farther in this tragedy we shall leave mr joseph and mr adams to themselves and imitate the wise conductors of the stage who in the midst of a grave action entertain you with some excellent piece of satire or humour called a dance which piece indeed is therefore danced and not spoke as it is delivered to the audience by persons whose thinking faculty is by most people held to lie in their heels and to whom as well as heroes who think with their hands nature hath only given heads for the sake of conformity and as they are of use in dancing to hang their hats on  the poet addressing the player proceeded thus as i was saying for they had been at this discourse all the time of the engagement abovestairs the reason you have no good new plays is evident it is from your discouragement of authors gentlemen will not write sir they will not write without the expectation of fame or profit or perhaps both plays are like trees which will not grow without nourishment but like mushrooms they shoot up spontaneously as it were in a rich soil the muses like vines may be pruned but not with a hatchet the town like a peevish child knows not what it desires and is always best pleased with a rattle a farcewriter hath indeed some chance for success but they have lost all taste for the sublime though i believe one reason of their depravity is the badness of the actors if a man writes like an angel sir those fellows know not how to give a sentiment utterancenot so fast says the player the modern actors are as good at least as their authors nay they come nearer their illustrious predecessors and i expect a booth on the stage again sooner than a shakespear or an otway and indeed i may turn your observation against you and with truth say that the reason no authors are encouraged is because we have no good new playsi have not affirmed the contrary said the poet but i am surprized you grow so warm you cannot imagine yourself interested in this dispute i hope you have a better opinion of my taste than to apprehend i squinted at yourself no sir if we had six such actors as you we should soon rival the bettertons and sandfords of former times for without a compliment to you i think it impossible for any one to have excelled you in most of your parts nay it is solemn truth and i have heard many and all great judges express as much and you will pardon me if i tell you i think every time i have seen you lately you have constantly acquired some new excellence like a snowball you have deceived me in my estimation of perfection and have outdone what i thought inimitableyou are as little interested answered the player in what i have said of other poets for dn me if there are not many strokes ay whole scenes in your last tragedy which at least equal shakespear there is a delicacy of sentiment a dignity of expression in it which i will own many of our gentlemen did not do adequate justice to to confess the truth they are bad enough and i pity an author who is present at the murder of his worksnay it is but seldom that it can happen returned the poet the works of most modern authors like deadborn children cannot be murdered it is such wretched halfbegotten halfwrit lifeless spiritless low grovelling stuff that i almost pity the actor who is obliged to get it by heart which must be almost as difficult to remember as words in a language you dont understandi am sure said the player if the sentences have little meaning when they are writ when they are spoken they have less i know scarce one who ever lays an emphasis right and much less adapts his action to his character i have seen a tender lover in an attitude of fighting with his mistress and a brave hero suing to his enemy with his sword in his hand i dont care to abuse my profession but rot me if in my heart i am not inclined to the poets sideit is rather generous in you than just said the poet and though i hate to speak ill of any persons productionnay i never do it nor willbut yet to do justice to the actors what could booth or betterton have made of such horrible stuff as fentons mariamne frowds philotas or mallets eurydice or those low dirty lastdyingspeeches which a fellow in the city of wapping your dillo or lillo what was his name called tragediesvery well says the player and pray what do you think of such fellows as quin and delane or that facemaking puppy young cibber that illlooked dog macklin or that saucy slut mrs clive what work would they make with your shakespears otways and lees how would those harmonious lines of the last come from their tongues      no more for i disdain     all pomp when thou art by far be the noise     of kings and crowns from us whose gentle souls     our kinder fates have steerd another way     free as the forest birds well pair together     without remembring who our fathers were     fly to the arbors grots and flowry meads     there in soft murmurs interchange our souls     together drink the crystal of the stream     or taste the yellow fruit which autumn yields     and when the golden evening calls us home     wing to our downy nests and sleep till morn  or how would this disdain of otway      whod be that foolish sordid thing calld man  hold hold hold said the poet do repeat that tender speech in the third act of my play which you made such a figure ini would willingly said the player but i have forgot itay you was not quite perfect in it when you played it cries the poet or you would have had such an applause as was never given on the stage an applause i was extremely concerned for your losingsure says the player if i remember that was hissed more than any passage in the whole playay your speaking it was hissed said the poetmy speaking it said the playeri mean your not speaking it said the poet you was out and then they hissedthey hissed and then i was out if i remember answered the player and i must say this for myself that the whole audience allowed i did your part justice so dont lay the damnation of your play to my accounti dont know what you mean by damnation replied the poetwhy you know it was acted but one night cried the playerno said the poet you and the whole town were enemies the pit were all my enemies fellows that would cut my throat if the fear of hanging did not restrain them all taylors sir all taylorswhy should the taylors be so angry with you cries the player i suppose you dont employ so many in making your clothesi admit your jest answered the poet but you remember the affair as well as myself you know there was a party in the pit and upper gallery that would not suffer it to be given out again though much ay infinitely the majority all the boxes in particular were desirous of it nay most of the ladies swore they never would come to the house till it was acted again indeed i must own their policy was good in not letting it be given out a second time for the rascals knew if it had gone a second night it would have run fifty for if ever there was distress in a tragedyi am not fond of my own performance but if i should tell you what the best judges said of itnor was it entirely owing to my enemies neither that it did not succeed on the stage as well as it hath since among the polite readers for you cant say it had justice done it by the performersi think answered the player the performers did the distress of it justice for i am sure we were in distress enough who were pelted with oranges all the last act we all imagined it would have been the last act of our lives  the poet whose fury was now raised had just attempted to answer when they were interrupted and an end put to their discourse by an accident which if the reader is impatient to know he must skip over the next chapter which is a sort of counterpart to this and contains some of the best and gravest matters in the whole book being a discourse between parson abraham adams and mr joseph andrews    chapter xi  containing the exhortations of parson adams to his friend in affliction calculated for the instruction and improvement of the reader   joseph no sooner came perfectly to himself than perceiving his mistress gone he bewailed her loss with groans which would have pierced any heart but those which are possessed by some people and are made of a certain composition not unlike flint in its hardness and other properties for you may strike fire from them which will dart through the eyes but they can never distil one drop of water the same way his own poor youth was of a softer composition and at those words o my dear fanny o my love shall i never never see thee more his eyes overflowed with tears which would have become any but a hero in a word his despair was more easy to be conceived than related  mr adams after many groans sitting with his back to joseph began thus in a sorrowful tone you cannot imagine my good child that i entirely blame these first agonies of your grief for when misfortunes attack us by surprize it must require infinitely more learning than you are master of to resist them but it is the business of a man and a christian to summon reason as quickly as he can to his aid and she will presently teach him patience and submission be comforted therefore child i say be comforted it is true you have lost the prettiest kindest loveliest sweetest young woman one with whom you might have expected to have lived in happiness virtue and innocence by whom you might have promised yourself many little darlings who would have been the delight of your youth and the comfort of your age you have not only lost her but have reason to fear the utmost violence which lust and power can inflict upon her now indeed you may easily raise ideas of horror which might drive you to despairo i shall run mad cries joseph o that i could but command my hands to tear my eyes out and my flesh offif you would use them to such purposes i am glad you cant answered adams i have stated your misfortune as strong as i possibly can but on the other side you are to consider you are a christian that no accident happens to us without the divine permission and that it is the duty of a man and a christian to submit we did not make ourselves but the same power which made us rules over us and we are absolutely at his disposal he may do with us what he pleases nor have we any right to complain a second reason against our complaint is our ignorance for as we know not future events so neither can we tell to what purpose any accident tends and that which at first threatens us with evil may in the end produce our good i should indeed have said our ignorance is twofold but i have not at present time to divide properly for as we know not to what purpose any event is ultimately directed so neither can we affirm from what cause it originally sprung you are a man and consequently a sinner and this may be a punishment to you for your sins indeed in this sense it may be esteemed as a good yea as the greatest good which satisfies the anger of heaven and averts that wrath which cannot continue without our destruction thirdly our impotency of relieving ourselves demonstrates the folly and absurdity of our complaints for whom do we resist or against whom do we complain but a power from whose shafts no armour can guard us no speed can flya power which leaves us no hope but in submission o sir cried joseph all this is very true and very fine and i could hear you all day if i was not so grieved at heart as now i amwould you take physic says adams when you are well and refuse it when you are sick is not comfort to be administered to the afflicted and not to those who rejoice or those who are at ease o you have not spoken one word of comfort to me yet returned joseph no cries adams what am i then doing what can i say to comfort you o tell me cries joseph that fanny will escape back to my arms that they shall again enclose that lovely creature with all her sweetness all her untainted innocence about her why perhaps you may cries adams but i cant promise you whats to come you must with perfect resignation wait the event if she be restored to you again it is your duty to be thankful and so it is if she be not joseph if you are wise and truly know your own interest you will peaceably and quietly submit to all the dispensations of providence being thoroughly assured that all the misfortunes how great soever which happen to the righteous happen to them for their own good nay it is not your interest only but your duty to abstain from immoderate grief which if you indulge you are not worthy the name of a christian he spoke these last words with an accent a little severer than usual upon which joseph begged him not to be angry saying he mistook him if he thought he denied it was his duty for he had known that long ago what signifies knowing your duty if you do not perform it answered adams your knowledge increases your guilt o joseph i never thought you had this stubbornness in your mind joseph replied he fancied he misunderstood him which i assure you says he you do if you imagine i endeavour to grieve upon my soul i dont adams rebuked him for swearing and then proceeded to enlarge on the folly of grief telling him all the wise men and philosophers even among the heathens had written against it quoting several passages from seneca and the consolation which though it was not ciceros was he said as good almost as any of his works and concluded all by hinting that immoderate grief in this case might incense that power which alone could restore him his fanny this reason or indeed rather the idea which it raised of the restoration of his mistress had more effect than all which the parson had said before and for a moment abated his agonies but when his fears sufficiently set before his eyes the danger that poor creature was in his grief returned again with repeated violence nor could adams in the least asswage it though it may be doubted in his behalf whether socrates himself could have prevailed any better  they remained some time in silence and groans and sighs issued from them both at length joseph burst out into the following soliloquy      yes i will bear my sorrows like a man     but i must also feel them as a man     i cannot but remember such things were     and were most dear to me  adams asked him what stuff that was he repeated to which he answered they were some lines he had gotten by heart out of a play ay there is nothing but heathenism to be learned from plays replied he i never heard of any plays fit for a christian to read but cato and the conscious lovers and i must own in the latter there are some things almost solemn enough for a sermon but we shall now leave them a little and enquire after the subject of their conversation    chapter xii  more adventures which we hope will as much please as surprize the reader   neither the facetious dialogue which passed between the poet and the player nor the grave and truly solemn discourse of mr adams will we conceive make the reader sufficient amends for the anxiety which he must have felt on the account of poor fanny whom we left in so deplorable a condition we shall therefore now proceed to the relation of what happened to that beautiful and innocent virgin after she fell into the wicked hands of the captain  the man of war having conveyed his charming prize out of the inn a little before day made the utmost expedition in his power towards the squires house where this delicate creature was to be offered up a sacrifice to the lust of a ravisher he was not only deaf to all her bewailings and entreaties on the road but accosted her ears with impurities which having been never before accustomed to them she happily for herself very little understood at last he changed his note and attempted to soothe and mollify her by setting forth the splendor and luxury which would be her fortune with a man who would have the inclination and power too to give her whatever her utmost wishes could desire and told her he doubted not but she would soon look kinder on him as the instrument of her happiness and despise that pitiful fellow whom her ignorance only could make her fond of she answered she knew not whom he meant she never was fond of any pitiful fellow are you affronted madam says he at my calling him so but what better can be said of one in a livery notwithstanding your fondness for him she returned that she did not understand him that the man had been her fellowservant and she believed was as honest a creature as any alive but as for fondness for meni warrant ye cries the captain we shall find means to persuade you to be fond and i advise you to yield to gentle ones for you may be assured that it is not in your power by any struggles whatever to preserve your virginity two hours longer it will be your interest to consent for the squire will be much kinder to you if he enjoys you willingly than by force at which words she began to call aloud for assistance for it was now open day but finding none she lifted her eyes to heaven and supplicated the divine assistance to preserve her innocence the captain told her if she persisted in her vociferation he would find a means of stopping her mouth and now the poor wretch perceiving no hopes of succour abandoned herself to despair and sighing out the name of joseph joseph a river of tears ran down her lovely cheeks and wet the handkerchief which covered her bosom a horseman now appeared in the road upon which the captain threatened her violently if she complained however the moment they approached each other she begged him with the utmost earnestness to relieve a distressed creature who was in the hands of a ravisher the fellow stopt at those words but the captain assured him it was his wife and that he was carrying her home from her adulterer which so satisfied the fellow who was an old one and perhaps a married one too that he wished him a good journey and rode on he was no sooner past than the captain abused her violently for breaking his commands and threatened to gagg her when two more horsemen armed with pistols came into the road just before them she again solicited their assistance and the captain told the same story as before upon which one said to the other thats a charming wench jack i wish i had been in the fellows place whoever he is but the other instead of answering him cried out zounds i know her and then turning to her said sure you are not fanny goodwillindeed indeed i am she criedo john i know you nowheaven hath sent you to my assistance to deliver me from this wicked man who is carrying me away for his vile purposeso for gods sake rescue me from him a fierce dialogue immediately ensued between the captain and these two men who being both armed with pistols and the chariot which they attended being now arrived the captain saw both force and stratagem were vain and endeavoured to make his escape in which however he could not succeed the gentleman who rode in the chariot ordered it to stop and with an air of authority examined into the merits of the cause of which being advertised by fanny whose credit was confirmed by the fellow who knew her he ordered the captain who was all bloody from his encounter at the inn to be conveyed as a prisoner behind the chariot and very gallantly took fanny into it for to say the truth this gentleman who was no other than the celebrated mr peter pounce and who preceded the lady booby only a few miles by setting out earlier in the morning was a very gallant person and loved a pretty girl better than anything besides his own money or the money of other people  the chariot now proceeded towards the inn which as fanny was informed lay in their way and where it arrived at that very time while the poet and player were disputing belowstairs and adams and joseph were discoursing back to back above just at that period to which we brought them both in the two preceding chapters the chariot stopt at the door and in an instant fanny leaping from it ran up to her josepho reader conceive if thou canst the joy which fired the breasts of these lovers on this meeting and if thy own heart doth not sympathetically assist thee in this conception i pity thee sincerely from my own for let the hardhearted villain know this that there is a pleasure in a tender sensation beyond any which he is capable of tasting  peter being informed by fanny of the presence of adams stopt to see him and receive his homage for as peter was an hypocrite a sort of people whom mr adams never saw through the one paid that respect to his seeming goodness which the other believed to be paid to his riches hence mr adams was so much his favourite that he once lent him four pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence to prevent his going to gaol on no greater security than a bond and judgment which probably he would have made no use of though the money had not been as it was paid exactly at the time  it is not perhaps easy to describe the figure of adams he had risen in such a hurry that he had on neither breeches garters nor stockings nor had he taken from his head a red spotted handkerchief which by night bound his wig turned inside out around his head he had on his torn cassock and his greatcoat but as the remainder of his cassock hung down below his greatcoat so did a small stripe of white or rather whitish linen appear below that to which we may add the several colours which appeared on his face where a long pissburnt beard served to retain the liquor of the stonepot and that of a blacker hue which distilled from the mopthis figure which fanny had delivered from his captivity was no sooner spied by peter than it disordered the composed gravity of his muscles however he advised him immediately to make himself clean nor would accept his homage in that pickle  the poet and player no sooner saw the captain in captivity than they began to consider of their own safety of which flight presented itself as the only means they therefore both of them mounted the poets horse and made the most expeditious retreat in their power  the host who well knew mr pounce and lady boobys livery was not a little surprized at this change of the scene nor was his confusion much helped by his wife who was now just risen and having heard from him the account of what had passed comforted him with a decent number of fools and blockheads asked him why he did not consult her and told him he would never leave following the nonsensical dictates of his own numskull till she and her family were ruined  joseph being informed of the captains arrival and seeing his fanny now in safety quitted her a moment and running downstairs went directly to him and stripping off his coat challenged him to fight but the captain refused saying he did not understand boxing he then grasped a cudgel in one hand and catching the captain by the collar with the other gave him a most severe drubbing and ended with telling him he had now had some revenge for what his dear fanny had suffered  when mr pounce had a little regaled himself with some provision which he had in his chariot and mr adams had put on the best appearance his clothes would allow him pounce ordered the captain into his presence for he said he was guilty of felony and the next justice of peace should commit him but the servants whose appetite for revenge is soon satisfied being sufficiently contented with the drubbing which joseph had inflicted on him and which was indeed of no very moderate kind had suffered him to go off which he did threatening a severe revenge against joseph which i have never heard he thought proper to take  the mistress of the house made her voluntary appearance before mr pounce and with a thousand curtsies told him she hoped his honour would pardon her husband who was a very nonsense man for the sake of his poor family that indeed if he could be ruined alone she should be very willing of it for because as why his worship very well knew he deserved it but she had three poor small children who were not capable to get their own living and if her husband was sent to gaol they must all come to the parish for she was a poor weak woman continually abreeding and had no time to work for them she therefore hoped his honour would take it into his worships consideration and forgive her husband this time for she was sure he never intended any harm to man woman or child and if it was not for that blockhead of his own the man in some things was well enough for she had had three children by him in less than three years and was almost ready to cry out the fourth time she would have proceeded in this manner much longer had not peter stopt her tongue by telling her he had nothing to say to her husband nor her neither so as adams and the rest had assured her of forgiveness she cried and curtsied out of the room  mr pounce was desirous that fanny should continue her journey with him in the chariot but she absolutely refused saying she would ride behind joseph on a horse which one of lady boobys servants had equipped him with but alas when the horse appeared it was found to be no other than that identical beast which mr adams had left behind him at the inn and which these honest fellows who knew him had redeemed indeed whatever horse they had provided for joseph they would have prevailed with him to mount none no not even to ride before his beloved fanny till the parson was supplied much less would he deprive his friend of the beast which belonged to him and which he knew the moment he saw though adams did not however when he was reminded of the affair and told that they had brought the horse with them which he left behind he answeredbless me and so i did  adams was very desirous that joseph and fanny should mount this horse and declared he could very easily walk home if i walked alone says he i would wage a shilling that the pedestrian outstripped the equestrian travellers but as i intend to take the company of a pipe peradventure i may be an hour later one of the servants whispered joseph to take him at his word and suffer the old put to walk if he would this proposal was answered with an angry look and a peremptory refusal by joseph who catching fanny up in his arms averred he would rather carry her home in that manner than take away mr adamss horse and permit him to walk on foot  perhaps reader thou hast seen a contest between two gentlemen or two ladies quickly decided though they have both asserted they would not eat such a nice morsel and each insisted on the others accepting it but in reality both were very desirous to swallow it themselves do not therefore conclude hence that this dispute would have come to a speedy decision for here both parties were heartily in earnest and it is very probable they would have remained in the innyard to this day had not the good peter pounce put a stop to it for finding he had no longer hopes of satisfying his old appetite with fanny and being desirous of having some one to whom he might communicate his grandeur he told the parson he would convey him home in his chariot this favour was by adams with many bows and acknowledgments accepted though he afterwards said he ascended the chariot rather that he might not offend than from any desire of riding in it for that in his heart he preferred the pedestrian even to the vehicular expedition all matters being now settled the chariot in which rode adams and pounce moved forwards and joseph having borrowed a pillion from the host fanny had just seated herself thereon and had laid hold of the girdle which her lover wore for that purpose when the wise beast who concluded that one at a time was sufficient that two to one were odds c discovered much uneasiness at his double load and began to consider his hinder as his fore legs moving the direct contrary way to that which is called forwards nor could joseph with all his horsemanship persuade him to advance but without having any regard to the lovely part of the lovely girl which was on his back he used such agitations that had not one of the men come immediately to her assistance she had in plain english tumbled backwards on the ground this inconvenience was presently remedied by an exchange of horses and then fanny being again placed on her pillion on a betternatured and somewhat a betterfed beast the parsons horse finding he had no longer odds to contend with agreed to march and the whole procession set forwards for boobyhall where they arrived in a few hours without anything remarkable happening on the road unless it was a curious dialogue between the parson and the steward which to use the language of a late apologist a pattern to all biographers waits for the reader in the next chapter    chapter xiii  a curious dialogue which passed between mr abraham adams and mr peter pounce better worth reading than all the works of colley cibber and many others   the chariot had not proceeded far before mr adams observed it was a very fine day ay and a very fine country too answered pouncei should think so more returned adams if i had not lately travelled over the downs which i take to exceed this and all other prospects in the universea fig for prospects answered pounce one acre here is worth ten there and for my own part i have no delight in the prospect of any land but my ownsir said adams you can indulge yourself with many fine prospects of that kindi thank god i have a little replied the other with which i am content and envy no man i have a little mr adams with which i do as much good as i can adams answered that riches without charity were nothing worth for that they were a blessing only to him who made them a blessing to othersyou and i said peter have different notions of charity i own as it is generally used i do not like the word nor do i think it becomes one of us gentlemen it is a mean parsonlike quality though i would not infer many parsons have it neithersir said adams my definition of charity is a generous disposition to relieve the distressedthere is something in that definition answered peter which i like well enough it is as you say a disposition and does not so much consist in the act as in the disposition to do it but alas mr adams who are meant by the distressed believe me the distresses of mankind are mostly imaginary and it would be rather folly than goodness to relieve themsure sir replied adams hunger and thirst cold and nakedness and other distresses which attend the poor can never be said to be imaginary evilshow can any man complain of hunger said peter in a country where such excellent salads are to be gathered in almost every field or of thirst where every river and stream produces such delicious potations and as for cold and nakedness they are evils introduced by luxury and custom a man naturally wants clothes no more than a horse or any other animal and there are whole nations who go without them but these are things perhaps which you who do not know the worldyou will pardon me sir returned adams i have read of the gymnosophistsa plague of your jehosaphats cried peter the greatest fault in our constitution is the provision made for the poor except that perhaps made for some others sir i have not an estate which doth not contribute almost as much again to the poor as to the landtax and i do assure you i expect to come myself to the parish in the end to which adams giving a dissenting smile peter thus proceeded i fancy mr adams you are one of those who imagine i am a lump of money for there are many who i fancy believe that not only my pockets but my whole clothes are lined with bankbills but i assure you you are all mistaken i am not the man the world esteems me if i can hold my head above water it is all i can i have injured myself by purchasing i have been too liberal of my money indeed i fear my heir will find my affairs in a worse situation than they are reputed to be ah he will have reason to wish i had loved money more and land less pray my good neighbour where should i have that quantity of riches the world is so liberal to bestow on me where could i possibly without i had stole it acquire such a treasure why truly says adams i have been always of your opinion i have wondered as well as yourself with what confidence they could report such things of you which have to me appeared as mere impossibilities for you know sir and i have often heard you say it that your wealth is of your own acquisition and can it be credible that in your short time you should have amassed such a heap of treasure as these people will have you worth indeed had you inherited an estate like sir thomas booby which had descended in your family for many generations they might have had a colour for their assertions why what do they say i am worth cries peter with a malicious sneer sir answered adams i have heard some aver you are not worth less than twenty thousand pounds at which peter frowned nay sir said adams you ask me only the opinion of others for my own part i have always denied it nor did i ever believe you could possibly be worth half that sum however mr adams said he squeezing him by the hand i would not sell them all i am worth for double that sum and as to what you believe or they believe i care not a fig no not a fart i am not poor because you think me so nor because you attempt to undervalue me in the country i know the envy of mankind very well but i thank heaven i am above them it is true my wealth is of my own acquisition i have not an estate like sir thomas booby that has descended in my family through many generations but i know heirs of such estates who are forced to travel about the country like some people in torn cassocks and might be glad to accept of a pitiful curacy for what i know yes sir as shabby fellows as yourself whom no man of my figure without that vice of goodnature about him would suffer to ride in a chariot with him sir said adams i value not your chariot of a rush and if i had known you had intended to affront me i would have walked to the worlds end on foot ere i would have accepted a place in it however sir i will soon rid you of that inconvenience and so saying he opened the chariot door without calling to the coachman and leapt out into the highway forgetting to take his hat along with him which however mr pounce threw after him with great violence joseph and fanny stopt to bear him company the rest of the way which was not above a mile     book iv    chapter i  the arrival of lady booby and the rest at boobyhall   the coach and six in which lady booby rode overtook the other travellers as they entered the parish she no sooner saw joseph than her cheeks glowed with red and immediately after became as totally pale she had in her surprize almost stopt her coach but recollected herself timely enough to prevent it she entered the parish amidst the ringing of bells and the acclamations of the poor who were rejoiced to see their patroness returned after so long an absence during which time all her rents had been drafted to london without a shilling being spent among them which tended not a little to their utter impoverishing for if the court would be severely missed in such a city as london how much more must the absence of a person of great fortune be felt in a little country village for whose inhabitants such a family finds a constant employment and supply and with the offals of whose table the infirm aged and infant poor are abundantly fed with a generosity which hath scarce a visible effect on their benefactors pockets  but if their interest inspired so public a joy into every countenance how much more forcibly did the affection which they bore parson adams operate upon all who beheld his return they flocked about him like dutiful children round an indulgent parent and vyed with each other in demonstrations of duty and love the parson on his side shook every one by the hand enquired heartily after the healths of all that were absent of their children and relations and exprest a satisfaction in his face which nothing but benevolence made happy by its objects could infuse  nor did joseph and fanny want a hearty welcome from all who saw them in short no three persons could be more kindly received as indeed none ever more deserved to be universally beloved  adams carried his fellowtravellers home to his house where he insisted on their partaking whatever his wife whom with his children he found in health and joy could providewhere we shall leave them enjoying perfect happiness over a homely meal to view scenes of greater splendour but infinitely less bliss  our more intelligent readers will doubtless suspect by this second appearance of lady booby on the stage that all was not ended by the dismission of joseph and to be honest with them they are in the right the arrow had pierced deeper than she imagined nor was the wound so easily to be cured the removal of the object soon cooled her rage but it had a different effect on her love that departed with his person but this remained lurking in her mind with his image restless interrupted slumbers and confused horrible dreams were her portion the first night in the morning fancy painted her a more delicious scene but to delude not delight her for before she could reach the promised happiness it vanished and left her to curse not bless the vision  she started from her sleep her imagination being all on fire with the phantom when her eyes accidentally glancing towards the spot where yesterday the real joseph had stood that little circumstance raised his idea in the liveliest colours in her memory each look each word each gesture rushed back on her mind with charms which all his coldness could not abate nay she imputed that to his youth his folly his awe his religion to everything but what would instantly have produced contempt want of passion for the sex or that which would have roused her hatred want of liking to her  reflection then hurried her farther and told her she must see this beautiful youth no more nay suggested to her that she herself had dismissed him for no other fault than probably that of too violent an awe and respect for herself and which she ought rather to have esteemed a merit the effects of which were besides so easily and surely to have been removed she then blamed she cursed the hasty rashness of her temper her fury was vented all on herself and joseph appeared innocent in her eyes her passion at length grew so violent that it forced her on seeking relief and now she thought of recalling him but pride forbad that pride which soon drove all softer passions from her soul and represented to her the meanness of him she was fond of that thought soon began to obscure his beauties contempt succeeded next and then disdain which presently introduced her hatred of the creature who had given her so much uneasiness these enemies of joseph had no sooner taken possession of her mind than they insinuated to her a thousand things in his disfavour everything but dislike of her person a thought which as it would have been intolerable to bear she checked the moment it endeavoured to arise revenge came now to her assistance and she considered her dismission of him stript and without a character with the utmost pleasure she rioted in the several kinds of misery which her imagination suggested to her might be his fate and with a smile composed of anger mirth and scorn viewed him in the rags in which her fancy had drest him  mrs slipslop being summoned attended her mistress who had now in her own opinion totally subdued this passion whilst she was dressing she asked if that fellow had been turned away according to her orders slipslop answered she had told her ladyship so as indeed she hadand how did he behave replied the lady truly madam cries slipslop in such a manner that infected everybody who saw him the poor lad had but little wages to receive for he constantly allowed his father and mother half his income so that when your ladyships livery was stript off he had not wherewithal to buy a coat and must have gone naked if one of the footmen had not incommodated him with one and whilst he was standing in his shirt and to say truth he was an amorous figure being told your ladyship would not give him a character he sighed and said he had done nothing willingly to offend that for his part he should always give your ladyship a good character wherever he went and he prayed god to bless you for you was the best of ladies though his enemies had set you against him i wish you had not turned him away for i believe you have not a faithfuller servant in the househow came you then replied the lady to advise me to turn him awayi madam said slipslop i am sure you will do me the justice to say i did all in my power to prevent it but i saw your ladyship was angry and it is not the business of us upper servants to hinterfear on these occasions and was it not you audacious wretch cried the lady who made me angry was it not your tittletattle in which i believe you belyed the poor fellow which incensed me against him he may thank you for all that hath happened and so may i for the loss of a good servant and one who probably had more merit than all of you poor fellow i am charmed with his goodness to his parents why did not you tell me of that but suffer me to dismiss so good a creature without a character i see the reason of your whole behaviour now as well as your complaint you was jealous of the wenches i jealous said slipslop i assure you i look upon myself as his betters i am not meat for a footman i hope these words threw the lady into a violent passion and she sent slipslop from her presence who departed tossing her nose and crying marry come up there are some people more jealous than i i believe her lady affected not to hear the words though in reality she did and understood them too now ensued a second conflict so like the former that it might savour of repetition to relate it minutely it may suffice to say that lady booby found good reason to doubt whether she had so absolutely conquered her passion as she had flattered herself and in order to accomplish it quite took a resolution more common than wise to retire immediately into the country the reader hath long ago seen the arrival of mrs slipslop whom no pertness could make her mistress resolve to part with lately that of mr pounce her forerunners and lastly that of the lady herself  the morning after her arrival being sunday she went to church to the great surprize of everybody who wondered to see her ladyship being no very constant churchwoman there so suddenly upon her journey joseph was likewise there and i have heard it was remarked that she fixed her eyes on him much more than on the parson but this i believe to be only a malicious rumour when the prayers were ended mr adams stood up and with a loud voice pronounced i publish the banns of marriage between joseph andrews and frances goodwill both of this parish c whether this had any effect on lady booby or no who was then in her pew which the congregation could not see into i could never discover but certain it is that in about a quarter of an hour she stood up and directed her eyes to that part of the church where the women sat and persisted in looking that way during the remainder of the sermon in so scrutinizing a manner and with so angry a countenance that most of the women were afraid she was offended at them the moment she returned home she sent for slipslop into her chamber and told her she wondered what that impudent fellow joseph did in that parish upon which slipslop gave her an account of her meeting adams with him on the road and likewise the adventure with fanny at the relation of which the lady often changed her countenance and when she had heard all she ordered mr adams into her presence to whom she behaved as the reader will see in the next chapter    chapter ii  a dialogue between mr abraham adams and the lady booby   mr adams was not far off for he was drinking her ladyships health below in a cup of her ale he no sooner came before her than she began in the following manner i wonder sir after the many great obligations you have had to this family with all which the reader hath in the course of this history been minutely acquainted that you will ungratefully show any respect to a fellow who hath been turned out of it for his misdeeds nor doth it i can tell you sir become a man of your character to run about the country with an idle fellow and wench indeed as for the girl i know no harm of her slipslop tells me she was formerly bred up in my house and behaved as she ought till she hankered after this fellow and he spoiled her nay she may still perhaps do very well if he will let her alone you are therefore doing a monstrous thing in endeavouring to procure a match between these two people which will be to the ruin of them bothmadam said adams if your ladyship will but hear me speak i protest i never heard any harm of mr joseph andrews if i had i should have corrected him for it for i never have nor will encourage the faults of those under my care as for the young woman i assure your ladyship i have as good an opinion of her as your ladyship yourself or any other can have she is the sweetesttempered honestest worthiest young creature indeed as to her beauty i do not commend her on that account though all men allow she is the handsomest woman gentle or simple that ever appeared in the parishyou are very impertinent says she to talk such fulsome stuff to me it is mighty becoming truly in a clergyman to trouble himself about handsome women and you are a delicate judge of beauty no doubt a man who hath lived all his life in such a parish as this is a rare judge of beauty ridiculous beauty indeed a country wench a beauty i shall be sick whenever i hear beauty mentioned again and so this wench is to stock the parish with beauties i hope but sir our poor is numerous enough already i will have no more vagabonds settled heremadam says adams your ladyship is offended with me i protest without any reason this couple were desirous to consummate long ago and i dissuaded them from it nay i may venture to say i believe i was the sole cause of their delaying itwell says she and you did very wisely and honestly too notwithstanding she is the greatest beauty in the parishand now madam continued he i only perform my office to mr josephpray dont mister such fellows to me cries the lady he said the parson with the consent of fanny before my face put in the banns yes answered the lady i suppose the slut is forward enough slipslop tells me how her head runs upon fellows that is one of her beauties i suppose but if they have put in the banns i desire you will publish them no more without my ordersmadam cries adams if any one puts in a sufficient caution and assigns a proper reason against them i am willing to surceasei tell you a reason says she he is a vagabond and he shall not settle here and bring a nest of beggars into the parish it will make us but little amends that they will be beautiesmadam answered adams with the utmost submission to your ladyship i have been informed by lawyer scout that any person who serves a year gains a settlement in the parish where he serveslawyer scout replied the lady is an impudent coxcomb i will have no lawyer scout interfere with me i repeat to you again i will have no more incumbrances brought on us so i desire you will proceed no farthermadam returned adams i would obey your ladyship in everything that is lawful but surely the parties being poor is no reason against their marrying god forbid there should be any such law the poor have little share enough of this world already it would be barbarous indeed to deny them the common privileges and innocent enjoyments which nature indulges to the animal creationsince you understand yourself no better cries the lady nor the respect due from such as you to a woman of my distinction than to affront my ears by such loose discourse i shall mention but one short word it is my orders to you that you publish these banns no more and if you dare i will recommend it to your master the doctor to discard you from his service i will sir notwithstanding your poor family and then you and the greatest beauty in the parish may go and beg togethermadam answered adams i know not what your ladyship means by the terms master and service i am in the service of a master who will never discard me for doing my duty and if the doctor for indeed i have never been able to pay for a licence thinks proper to turn me from my cure god will provide me i hope another at least my family as well as myself have hands and he will prosper i doubt not our endeavours to get our bread honestly with them whilst my conscience is pure i shall never fear what man can do unto mei condemn my humility said the lady for demeaning myself to converse with you so long i shall take other measures for i see you are a confederate with them but the sooner you leave me the better and i shall give orders that my doors may no longer be open to you i will suffer no parsons who run about the country with beauties to be entertained heremadam said adams i shall enter into no persons doors against their will but i am assured when you have enquired farther into this matter you will applaud not blame my proceeding and so i humbly take my leave which he did with many bows or at least many attempts at a bow    chapter iii  what passed between the lady and lawyer scout   in the afternoon the lady sent for mr scout whom she attacked most violently for intermeddling with her servants which he denied and indeed with truth for he had only asserted accidentally and perhaps rightly that a years service gained a settlement and so far he owned he might have formerly informed the parson and believed it was law i am resolved said the lady to have no discarded servants of mine settled here and so if this be your law i shall send to another lawyer scout said if she sent to a hundred lawyers not one or all of them could alter the law the utmost that was in the power of a lawyer was to prevent the laws taking effect and that he himself could do for her ladyship as well as any other and i believe says he madam your ladyship not being conversant in these matters hath mistaken a difference for i asserted only that a man who served a year was settled now there is a material difference between being settled in law and settled in fact and as i affirmed generally he was settled and law is preferable to fact my settlement must be understood in law and not in fact and suppose madam we admit he was settled in law what use will they make of it how doth that relate to fact he is not settled in fact and if he be not settled in fact he is not an inhabitant and if he is not an inhabitant he is not of this parish and then undoubtedly he ought not to be published here for mr adams hath told me your ladyships pleasure and the reason which is a very good one to prevent burdening us with the poor we have too many already and i think we ought to have an act to hang or transport half of them if we can prove in evidence that he is not settled in fact it is another matter what i said to mr adams was on a supposition that he was settled in fact and indeed if that was the case i should doubtdont tell me your facts and your ifs said the lady i dont understand your gibberish you take too much upon you and are very impertinent in pretending to direct in this parish and you shall be taught better i assure you you shall but as to the wench i am resolved she shall not settle here i will not suffer such beauties as these to produce children for us to keepbeauties indeed your ladyship is pleased to be merry answered scoutmr adams described her so to me said the lady pray what sort of dowdy is it mr scoutthe ugliest creature almost i ever beheld a poor dirty drab your ladyship never saw such a wretchwell but dear mr scout let her be what she will these ugly women will bring children you know so that we must prevent the marriagetrue madam replied scout for the subsequent marriage cooperating with the law will carry law into fact when a man is married he is settled in fact and then he is not removable i will see mr adams and i make no doubt of prevailing with him his only objection is doubtless that he shall lose his fee but that being once made easy as it shall be i am confident no farther objection will remain no no it is impossible but your ladyship cant discommend his unwillingness to depart from his fee every man ought to have a proper value for his fee as to the matter in question if your ladyship pleases to employ me in it i will venture to promise you success the laws of this land are not so vulgar to permit a mean fellow to contend with one of your ladyships fortune we have one sure card which is to carry him before justice frolick who upon hearing your ladyships name will commit him without any farther questions as for the dirty slut we shall have nothing to do with her for if we get rid of the fellow the ugly jade willtake what measures you please good mr scout answered the lady but i wish you could rid the parish of both for slipslop tells me such stories of this wench that i abhor the thoughts of her and though you say she is such an ugly slut yet you know dear mr scout these forward creatures who run after men will always find some as forward as themselves so that to prevent the increase of beggars we must get rid of heryour ladyship is very much in the right answered scout but i am afraid the law is a little deficient in giving us any such power of prevention however the justice will stretch it as far as he is able to oblige your ladyship to say truth it is a great blessing to the country that he is in the commission for he hath taken several poor off our hands that the law would never lay hold on i know some justices who think as much of committing a man to bridewell as his lordship at size would of hanging him but it would do a man good to see his worship our justice commit a fellow to bridewell he takes so much pleasure in it and when once we haum there we seldom hear any more oum hes either starved or eat up by vermin in a months timehere the arrival of a visitor put an end to the conversation and mr scout having undertaken the cause and promised it success departed  this scout was one of those fellows who without any knowledge of the law or being bred to it take upon them in defiance of an act of parliament to act as lawyers in the country and are called so they are the pests of society and a scandal to a profession to which indeed they do not belong and which owes to such kind of rascallions the illwill which weak persons bear towards it with this fellow to whom a little before she would not have condescended to have spoken did a certain passion for joseph and the jealousy and the disdain of poor innocent fanny betray the lady booby into a familiar discourse in which she inadvertently confirmed many hints with which slipslop whose gallant he was had preacquainted him and whence he had taken an opportunity to assert those severe falsehoods of little fanny which possibly the reader might not have been well able to account for if we had not thought proper to give him this information    chapter iv  a short chapter but very full of matter particularly the arrival of mr booby and his lady   all that night and the next day the lady booby past with the utmost anxiety her mind was distracted and her soul tossed up and down by many turbulent and opposite passions she loved hated pitied scorned admired despised the same person by fits which changed in a very short interval on tuesday morning which happened to be a holiday she went to church where to her surprize mr adams published the banns again with as audible a voice as before it was lucky for her that as there was no sermon she had an immediate opportunity of returning home to vent her rage which she could not have concealed from the congregation five minutes indeed it was not then very numerous the assembly consisting of no more than adams his clerk his wife the lady and one of her servants at her return she met slipslop who accosted her in these wordso meam what doth your ladyship think to be sure lawyer scout hath carried joseph and fanny both before the justice all the parish are in tears and say they will certainly be hanged for nobody knows what it is fori suppose they deserve it says the lady what dost thou mention such wretches to meo dear madam answered slipslop is it not a pity such a graceless young man should die a virulent death i hope the judge will take commensuration on his youth as for fanny i dont think it signifies much what becomes of her and if poor joseph hath done anything i could venture to swear she traduced him to it few men ever come to a fragrant punishment but by those nasty creatures who are a scandal to our sect the lady was no more pleased at this news after a moments reflection than slipslop herself for though she wished fanny far enough she did not desire the removal of joseph especially with her she was puzzled how to act or what to say on this occasion when a coach and six drove into the court and a servant acquainted her with the arrival of her nephew booby and his lady she ordered them to be conducted into a drawingroom whither she presently repaired having composed her countenance as well as she could and being a little satisfied that the wedding would by these means be at least interrupted and that she should have an opportunity to execute any resolution she might take for which she saw herself provided with an excellent instrument in scout  the lady booby apprehended her servant had made a mistake when he mentioned mr boobys lady for she had never heard of his marriage but how great was her surprize when at her entering the room her nephew presented his wife to her saying madam this is that charming pamela of whom i am convinced you have heard so much the lady received her with more civility than he expected indeed with the utmost for she was perfectly polite nor had any vice inconsistent with goodbreeding they past some little time in ordinary discourse when a servant came and whispered mr booby who presently told the ladies he must desert them a little on some business of consequence and as their discourse during his absence would afford little improvement or entertainment to the reader we will leave them for a while to attend mr booby    chapter v  containing justice business curious precedents of depositions and other matters necessary to be perused by all justices of the peace and their clerks   the young squire and his lady were no sooner alighted from their coach than the servants began to inquire after mr joseph from whom they said their lady had not heard a word to her great surprize since he had left lady boobys upon this they were instantly informed of what had lately happened with which they hastily acquainted their master who took an immediate resolution to go himself and endeavour to restore his pamela her brother before she even knew she had lost him  the justice before whom the criminals were carried and who lived within a short mile of the ladys house was luckily mr boobys acquaintance by his having an estate in his neighbourhood ordering therefore his horses to his coach he set out for the judgmentseat and arrived when the justice had almost finished his business he was conducted into a hall where he was acquainted that his worship would wait on him in a moment for he had only a man and a woman to commit to bridewell first as he was now convinced he had not a minute to lose he insisted on the servants introducing him directly into the room where the justice was then executing his office as he called it being brought thither and the first compliments being passed between the squire and his worship the former asked the latter what crime those two young people had been guilty of no great crime answered the justice i have only ordered them to bridewell for a month but what is their crime repeated the squire larceny ant please your honour said scout ay says the justice a kind of felonious larcenous thing i believe i must order them a little correction too a little stripping and whipping poor fanny who had hitherto supported all with the thoughts of josephs company trembled at that sound but indeed without reason for none but the devil himself would have executed such a sentence on her still said the squire i am ignorant of the crimethe fact i mean why there it is in peaper answered the justice showing him a deposition which in the absence of his clerk he had writ himself of which we have with great difficulty procured an authentic copy and here it follows verbatim et literatim      the depusition of james scout layer and thomas trotter     yeoman taken before mee one of his magestys justasses of the     piece for zumersetshire      these deponants saith and first thomas trotter for himself     saith that on the  of this instant october being     sabbathday betwin the ours of   and   in the afternoon he     zeed joseph andrews and francis goodwill walk akross a certane     felde belunging to layer scout and out of the path which ledes     thru the said felde and there he zede joseph andrews with a     nife cut one hassel twig of the value as he believes of     three halfpence or thereabouts and he saith that the said     francis goodwill was likewise walking on the grass out of the     said path in the said felde and did receive and karry in her     hand the said twig and so was cumfarting eading and abatting     to the said joseph therein and the said james scout for     himself says that he verily believes the said twig to be his     own proper twig c  jesu said the squire would you commit two persons to bridewell for a twig yes said the lawyer and with great lenity too for if we had called it a young tree they would have been both hanged harkee says the justice taking aside the squire i should not have been so severe on this occasion but lady booby desires to get them out of the parish so lawyer scout will give the constable orders to let them run away if they please but it seems they intend to marry together and the lady hath no other means as they are legally settled there to prevent their bringing an incumbrance on her own parish well said the squire i will take care my aunt shall be satisfied in this point and likewise i promise you joseph here shall never be any incumbrance on her i shall be obliged to you therefore if instead of bridewell you will commit them to my custody o to be sure sir if you desire it answered the justice and without more ado joseph and fanny were delivered over to squire booby whom joseph very well knew but little guessed how nearly he was related to him the justice burnt his mittimus the constable was sent about his business the lawyer made no complaint for want of justice and the prisoners with exulting hearts gave a thousand thanks to his honour mr booby who did not intend their obligations to him should cease here for ordering his man to produce a cloakbag which he had caused to be brought from lady boobys on purpose he desired the justice that he might have joseph with him into a room where ordering his servant to take out a suit of his own clothes with linnen and other necessaries he left joseph to dress himself who not yet knowing the cause of all this civility excused his accepting such a favour as long as decently he could whilst joseph was dressing the squire repaired to the justice whom he found talking with fanny for during the examination she had flopped her hat over her eyes which were also bathed in tears and had by that means concealed from his worship what might perhaps have rendered the arrival of mr booby unnecessary at least for herself the justice no sooner saw her countenance cleared up and her bright eyes shining through her tears than he secretly cursed himself for having once thought of bridewell for her he would willingly have sent his own wife thither to have had fanny in her place and conceiving almost at the same instant desires and schemes to accomplish them he employed the minutes whilst the squire was absent with joseph in assuring her how sorry he was for having treated her so roughly before he knew her merit and told her that since lady booby was unwilling that she should settle in her parish she was heartily welcome to his where he promised her his protection adding that he would take joseph and her into his own family if she liked it which assurance he confirmed with a squeeze by the hand she thanked him very kindly and said she would acquaint joseph with the offer which he would certainly be glad to accept for that lady booby was angry with them both though she did not know either had done anything to offend her but imputed it to madam slipslop who had always been her enemy  the squire now returned and prevented any farther continuance of this conversation and the justice out of a pretended respect to his guest but in reality from an apprehension of a rival for he knew nothing of his marriage ordered fanny into the kitchen whither she gladly retired nor did the squire who declined the trouble of explaining the whole matter oppose it  it would be unnecessary if i was able which indeed i am not to relate the conversation between these two gentlemen which rolled as i have been informed entirely on the subject of horseracing joseph was soon drest in the plainest dress he could find which was a blue coat and breeches with a gold edging and a red waistcoat with the same and as this suit which was rather too large for the squire exactly fitted him so he became it so well and looked so genteel that no person would have doubted its being as well adapted to his quality as his shape nor have suspected as one might when my lord  or sir  or mr  appear in lace or embroidery that the taylors man wore those clothes home on his back which he should have carried under his arm  the squire now took leave of the justice and calling for fanny made her and joseph against their wills get into the coach with him which he then ordered to drive to lady boobys it had moved a few yards only when the squire asked joseph if he knew who that man was crossing the field for added he i never saw one take such strides before joseph answered eagerly o sir it is parson adams o la indeed and so it is said fanny poor man he is coming to do what he could for us well he is the worthiest bestnatured creatureay said joseph god bless him for there is not such another in the universe the best creature living sure cries fanny is he says the squire then i am resolved to have the best creature living in my coach and so saying he ordered it to stop whilst joseph at his request hallowed to the parson who well knowing his voice made all the haste imaginable and soon came up with them he was desired by the master who could scarce refrain from laughter at his figure to mount into the coach which he with many thanks refused saying he could walk by its side and hed warrant he kept up with it but he was at length overprevailed on the squire now acquainted joseph with his marriage but he might have spared himself that labour for his servant whilst joseph was dressing had performed that office before he continued to express the vast happiness he enjoyed in his sister and the value he had for all who belonged to her joseph made many bows and exprest as many acknowledgments and parson adams who now first perceived josephs new apparel burst into tears with joy and fell to rubbing his hands and snapping his fingers as if he had been mad  they were now arrived at the lady boobys and the squire desiring them to wait a moment in the court walked in to his aunt and calling her out from his wife acquainted her with josephs arrival saying madam as i have married a virtuous and worthy woman i am resolved to own her relations and show them all a proper respect i shall think myself therefore infinitely obliged to all mine who will do the same it is true her brother hath been your servant but he is now become my brother and i have one happiness that neither his character his behaviour or appearance give me any reason to be ashamed of calling him so in short he is now below dressed like a gentleman in which light i intend he shall hereafter be seen and you will oblige me beyond expression if you will admit him to be of our party for i know it will give great pleasure to my wife though she will not mention it  this was a stroke of fortune beyond the lady boobys hopes or expectation she answered him eagerly nephew you know how easily i am prevailed on to do anything which joseph andrews desiresphoo i mean which you desire me and as he is now your relation i cannot refuse to entertain him as such the squire told her he knew his obligation to her for her compliance and going three steps returned and told herhe had one more favour which he believed she would easily grant as she had accorded him the former there is a young womannephew says she dont let my goodnature make you desire as is too commonly the case to impose on me nor think because i have with so much condescension agreed to suffer your brotherinlaw to come to my table that i will submit to the company of all my own servants and all the dirty trollops in the country madam answered the squire i believe you never saw this young creature i never beheld such sweetness and innocence joined with such beauty and withal so genteel upon my soul i wont admit her replied the lady in a passion the whole world shant prevail on me i resent even the desire as an affront and the squire who knew her inflexibility interrupted her by asking pardon and promising not to mention it more he then returned to joseph and she to pamela he took joseph aside and told him he would carry him to his sister but could not prevail as yet for fanny joseph begged that he might see his sister alone and then be with his fanny but the squire knowing the pleasure his wife would have in her brothers company would not admit it telling joseph there would be nothing in so short an absence from fanny whilst he was assured of her safety adding he hoped he could not so easily quit a sister whom he had not seen so long and who so tenderly loved him joseph immediately complied for indeed no brother could love a sister more and recommending fanny who rejoiced that she was not to go before lady booby to the care of mr adams he attended the squire upstairs whilst fanny repaired with the parson to his house where she thought herself secure of a kind reception    chapter vi  of which you are desired to read no more than you like   the meeting between joseph and pamela was not without tears of joy on both sides and their embraces were full of tenderness and affection they were however regarded with much more pleasure by the nephew than by the aunt to whose flame they were fuel only and this was increased by the addition of dress which was indeed not wanted to set off the lively colours in which nature had drawn health strength comeliness and youth in the afternoon joseph at their request entertained them with an account of his adventures nor could lady booby conceal her dissatisfaction at those parts in which fanny was concerned especially when mr booby launched forth into such rapturous praises of her beauty she said applying to her niece that she wondered her nephew who had pretended to marry for love should think such a subject proper to amuse his wife with adding that for her part she should be jealous of a husband who spoke so warmly in praise of another woman pamela answered indeed she thought she had cause but it was an instance of mr boobys aptness to see more beauty in women than they were mistresses of at which words both the women fixed their eyes on two lookingglasses and lady booby replied that men were in the general very ill judges of beauty and then whilst both contemplated only their own faces they paid a cross compliment to each others charms when the hour of rest approached which the lady of the house deferred as long as decently she could she informed joseph whom for the future we shall call mr joseph he having as good a title to that appellation as many othersi mean that incontested one of good clothes that she had ordered a bed to be provided for him he declined this favour to his utmost for his heart had long been with his fanny but she insisted on his accepting it alledging that the parish had no proper accommodation for such a person as he was now to esteem himself the squire and his lady both joining with her mr joseph was at last forced to give over his design of visiting fanny that evening who on her side as impatiently expected him till midnight when in complacence to mr adamss family who had sat up two hours out of respect to her she retired to bed but not to sleep the thoughts of her love kept her waking and his not returning according to his promise filled her with uneasiness of which however she could not assign any other cause than merely that of being absent from him  mr joseph rose early in the morning and visited her in whom his soul delighted she no sooner heard his voice in the parsons parlour than she leapt from her bed and dressing herself in a few minutes went down to him they passed two hours with inexpressible happiness together and then having appointed monday by mr adamss permission for their marriage mr joseph returned according to his promise to breakfast at the lady boobys with whose behaviour since the evening we shall now acquaint the reader  she was no sooner retired to her chamber than she asked slipslop what she thought of this wonderful creature her nephew had married madam said slipslop not yet sufficiently understanding what answer she was to make i ask you answered the lady what you think of the dowdy my niece i think i am to call her slipslop wanting no further hint began to pull her to pieces and so miserably defaced her that it would have been impossible for any one to have known the person the lady gave her all the assistance she could and ended with saying i think slipslop you have done her justice but yet bad as she is she is an angel compared to this fanny slipslop then fell on fanny whom she hacked and hewed in the like barbarous manner concluding with an observation that there was always something in those lowlife creatures which must eternally extinguish them from their betters really said the lady i think there is one exception to your rule i am certain you may guess who i meannot i upon my word madam said slipslop i mean a young fellow sure you are the dullest wretch said the lady o la i am indeed yes truly madam he is an accession answered slipslop ay is he not slipslop returned the lady is he not so genteel that a prince might without a blush acknowledge him for his son his behaviour is such that would not shame the best education he borrows from his station a condescension in everything to his superiors yet unattended by that mean servility which is called good behaviour in such persons everything he doth hath no mark of the base motive of fear but visibly shows some respect and gratitude and carries with it the persuasion of love and then for his virtues such piety to his parents such tender affection to his sister such integrity in his friendship such bravery such goodness that if he had been born a gentleman his wife would have possessed the most invaluable blessingto be sure maam says slipslop but as he is answered the lady if he had a thousand more good qualities it must render a woman of fashion contemptible even to be suspected of thinking of him yes i should despise myself for such a thoughtto be sure maam said slipslop and why to be sure replied the lady thou art always ones echo is he not more worthy of affection than a dirty country clown though born of a family as old as the flood or an idle worthless rake or little puisny beau of quality and yet these we must condemn ourselves to in order to avoid the censure of the world to shun the contempt of others we must ally ourselves to those we despise we must prefer birth title and fortune to real merit it is a tyranny of custom a tyranny we must comply with for we people of fashion are the slaves of custommarry come up said slipslop who now knew well which party to take if i was a woman of your ladyships fortune and quality i would be a slave to nobodyme said the lady i am speaking if a young woman of fashion who had seen nothing of the world should happen to like such a fellowme indeed i hope thou dost not imagineno maam to be sure cries slipslop no what no cried the lady thou art always ready to answer before thou hast heard one so far i must allow he is a charming fellow me indeed no slipslop all thoughts of men are over with me i have lost a husband whobut if i should reflect i should run mad my future ease must depend upon forgetfulness slipslop let me hear some of thy nonsense to turn my thoughts another way what dost thou think of mr andrewswhy i think says slipslop he is the handsomest most properest man i ever saw and if i was a lady of the greatest degree it would be well for some folks your ladyship may talk of custom if you please but i am confidous there is no more comparison between young mr andrews and most of the young gentlemen who come to your ladyships house in london a parcel of whippersnapper sparks i would sooner marry our old parson adams never tell me what people say whilst i am happy in the arms of him i love some folks rail against other folks because other folks have what some folks would be glad ofand so answered the lady if you was a woman of condition you would really marry mr andrewsyes i assure your ladyship replied slipslop if he would have mefool idiot cries the lady if he would have a woman of fashion is that a questionno truly madam said slipslop i believe it would be none if fanny was out of the way and i am confidous if i was in your ladyships place and liked mr joseph andrews she should not stay in the parish a moment i am sure lawyer scout would send her packing if your ladyship would but say the word this last speech of slipslop raised a tempest in the mind of her mistress she feared scout had betrayed her or rather that she had betrayed herself after some silence and a double change of her complexion first to pale and then to red she thus spoke i am astonished at the liberty you give your tongue would you insinuate that i employed scout against this wench on account of the fellowla maam said slipslop frighted out of her wits i assassinate such a thingi think you dare not answered the lady i believe my conduct may defy malice itself to assert so cursed a slander if i had ever discovered any wantonness any lightness in my behaviour if i had followed the example of some whom thou hast i believe seen in allowing myself indecent liberties even with a husband but the dear man who is gone here she began to sob was he alive again then she produced tears could not upbraid me with any one act of tenderness or passion no slipslop all the time i cohabited with him he never obtained even a kiss from me without my expressing reluctance in the granting it i am sure he himself never suspected how much i loved him since his death thou knowest though it is almost six weeks it wants but a day ago i have not admitted one visitor till this fool my nephew arrived i have confined myself quite to one party of friends and can such a conduct as this fear to be arraigned to be accused not only of a passion which i have always despised but of fixing it on such an object a creature so much beneath my noticeupon my word maam says slipslop i do not understand your ladyship nor know i anything of the matteri believe indeed thou dost not understand me those are delicacies which exist only in superior minds thy coarse ideas cannot comprehend them thou art a low creature of the andrews breed a reptile of a lower order a weed that grows in the common garden of the creationi assure your ladyship says slipslop whose passions were almost of as high an order as her ladys i have no more to do with common garden than other folks really your ladyship talks of servants as if they were not born of the christian specious servants have flesh and blood as well as quality and mr andrews himself is a proof that they have as good if not better and for my own part i cant perceive my dearsa are coarser than other peoples and i am sure if mr andrews was a dear of mine i should not be ashamed of him in company with gentlemen for whoever hath seen him in his new clothes must confess he looks as much like a gentleman as anybody coarse quotha i cant bear to hear the poor young fellow run down neither for i will say this i never heard him say an ill word of anybody in his life i am sure his coarseness doth not lie in his heart for he is the bestnatured man in the world and as for his skin it is no coarser than other peoples i am sure his bosom when a boy was as white as driven snow and where it is not covered with hairs is so still ifakins if i was mrs andrews with a hundred a year i should not envy the best she who wears a head a woman that could not be happy with such a man ought never to be so for if he cant make a woman happy i never yet beheld the man who could i say again i wish i was a great lady for his sake i believe when i had made a gentleman of him hed behave so that nobody should deprecate what i had done and i fancy few would venture to tell him he was no gentleman to his face nor to mine neither at which words taking up the candles she asked her mistress who had been some time in her bed if she had any farther commands who mildly answered she had none and telling her she was a comical creature bid her goodnight  a meaning perhaps ideas    chapter vii  philosophical reflections the like not to be found in any light french romance mr boobys grave advice to joseph and fannys encounter with a beau   habit my good reader hath so vast a prevalence over the human mind that there is scarce anything too strange or too strong to be asserted of it the story of the miser who from long accustoming to cheat others came at last to cheat himself and with great delight and triumph picked his own pocket of a guinea to convey to his hoard is not impossible or improbable in like manner it fares with the practisers of deceit who from having long deceived their acquaintance gain at last a power of deceiving themselves and acquire that very opinion however false of their own abilities excellencies and virtues into which they have for years perhaps endeavoured to betray their neighbours now reader to apply this observation to my present purpose thou must know that as the passion generally called love exercises most of the talents of the female or fair world so in this they now and then discover a small inclination to deceit for which thou wilt not be angry with the beautiful creatures when thou hast considered that at the age of seven or something earlier miss is instructed by her mother that master is a very monstrous kind of animal who will if she suffers him to come too near her infallibly eat her up and grind her to pieces that so far from kissing or toying with him of her own accord she must not admit him to kiss or toy with her and lastly that she must never have any affection towards him for if she should all her friends in petticoats would esteem her a traitress point at her and hunt her out of their society these impressions being first received are farther and deeper inculcated by their schoolmistresses and companions so that by the age of ten they have contracted such a dread and abhorrence of the abovenamed monster that whenever they see him they fly from him as the innocent hare doth from the greyhound hence to the age of fourteen or fifteen they entertain a mighty antipathy to master they resolve and frequently profess that they will never have any commerce with him and entertain fond hopes of passing their lives out of his reach of the possibility of which they have so visible an example in their good maiden aunt but when they arrive at this period and have now passed their second climacteric when their wisdom grown riper begins to see a little farther and from almost daily falling in masters way to apprehend the great difficulty of keeping out of it and when they observe him look often at them and sometimes very eagerly and earnestly too for the monster seldom takes any notice of them till at this age they then begin to think of their danger and as they perceive they cannot easily avoid him the wiser part bethink themselves of providing by other means for their security they endeavour by all methods they can invent to render themselves so amiable in his eyes that he may have no inclination to hurt them in which they generally succeed so well that his eyes by frequent languishing soon lessen their idea of his fierceness and so far abate their fears that they venture to parley with him and when they perceive him so different from what he hath been described all gentleness softness kindness tenderness fondness their dreadful apprehensions vanish in a moment and now it being usual with the human mind to skip from one extreme to its opposite as easily and almost as suddenly as a bird from one bough to another love instantly succeeds to fear but as it happens to persons who have in their infancy been thoroughly frightened with certain nopersons called ghosts that they retain their dread of those beings after they are convinced that there are no such things so these young ladies though they no longer apprehend devouring cannot so entirely shake off all that hath been instilled into them they still entertain the idea of that censure which was so strongly imprinted on their tender minds to which the declarations of abhorrence they every day hear from their companions greatly contribute to avoid this censure therefore is now their only care for which purpose they still pretend the same aversion to the monster and the more they love him the more ardently they counterfeit the antipathy by the continual and constant practice of which deceit on others they at length impose on themselves and really believe they hate what they love thus indeed it happened to lady booby who loved joseph long before she knew it and now loved him much more than she suspected she had indeed from the time of his sisters arrival in the quality of her niece and from the instant she viewed him in the dress and character of a gentleman began to conceive secretly a design which love had concealed from herself till a dream betrayed it to her  she had no sooner risen than she sent for her nephew when he came to her after many compliments on his choice she told him he might perceive in her condescension to admit her own servant to her table that she looked on the family of andrews as his relations and indeed hers that as he had married into such a family it became him to endeavour by all methods to raise it as much as possible at length she advised him to use all his heart to dissuade joseph from his intended match which would still enlarge their relation to meanness and poverty concluding that by a commission in the army or some other genteel employment he might soon put young mr andrews on the foot of a gentleman and that being once done his accomplishments might quickly gain him an alliance which would not be to their discredit  her nephew heartily embraced this proposal and finding mr joseph with his wife at his return to her chamber he immediately began thus my love to my dear pamela brother will extend to all her relations nor shall i show them less respect than if i had married into the family of a duke i hope i have given you some early testimonies of this and shall continue to give you daily more you will excuse me therefore brother if my concern for your interest makes me mention what may be perhaps disagreeable to you to hear but i must insist upon it that if you have any value for my alliance or my friendship you will decline any thoughts of engaging farther with a girl who is as you are a relation of mine so much beneath you i know there may be at first some difficulty in your compliance but that will daily diminish and you will in the end sincerely thank me for my advice i own indeed the girl is handsome but beauty alone is a poor ingredient and will make but an uncomfortable marriagesir said joseph i assure you her beauty is her least perfection nor do i know a virtue which that young creature is not possesst ofas to her virtues answered mr booby you can be yet but a slender judge of them but if she had never so many you will find her equal in these among her superiors in birth and fortune which now you are to esteem on a footing with yourself at least i will take care they shall shortly be so unless you prevent me by degrading yourself with such a match a match i have hardly patience to think of and which would break the hearts of your parents who now rejoice in the expectation of seeing you make a figure in the worldi know not replied joseph that my parents have any power over my inclinations nor am i obliged to sacrifice my happiness to their whim or ambition besides i shall be very sorry to see that the unexpected advancement of my sister should so suddenly inspire them with this wicked pride and make them despise their equals i am resolved on no account to quit my dear fanny no though i could raise her as high above her present station as you have raised my sisteryour sister as well as myself said booby are greatly obliged to you for the comparison but sir she is not worthy to be compared in beauty to my pamela nor hath she half her merit and besides sir as you civilly throw my marriage with your sister in my teeth i must teach you the wide difference between us my fortune enabled me to please myself and it would have been as overgrown a folly in me to have omitted it as in you to do itmy fortune enables me to please myself likewise said joseph for all my pleasure is centered in fanny and whilst i have health i shall be able to support her with my labour in that station to which she was born and with which she is contentbrother said pamela mr booby advises you as a friend and no doubt my papa and mamma will be of his opinion and will have great reason to be angry with you for destroying what his goodness hath done and throwing down our family again after he hath raised it it would become you better brother to pray for the assistance of grace against such a passion than to indulge itsure sister you are not in earnest i am sure she is your equal at leastshe was my equal answered pamela but i am no longer pamela andrews i am now this gentlemans lady and as such am above heri hope i shall never behave with an unbecoming pride but at the same time i shall always endeavour to know myself and question not the assistance of grace to that purpose they were now summoned to breakfast and thus ended their discourse for the present very little to the satisfaction of any of the parties  fanny was now walking in an avenue at some distance from the house where joseph had promised to take the first opportunity of coming to her she had not a shilling in the world and had subsisted ever since her return entirely on the charity of parson adams a young gentleman attended by many servants came up to her and asked her if that was not the lady boobys house before him this indeed he well knew but had framed the question for no other reason than to make her look up and discover if her face was equal to the delicacy of her shape he no sooner saw it than he was struck with amazement he stopt his horse and swore she was the most beautiful creature he ever beheld then instantly alighting and delivering his horse to his servant he rapt out halfadozen oaths that he would kiss her to which she at first submitted begging he would not be rude but he was not satisfied with the civility of a salute nor even with the rudest attack he could make on her lips but caught her in his arms and endeavoured to kiss her breasts which with all her strength she resisted and as our spark was not of the herculean race with some difficulty prevented the young gentleman being soon out of breath in the struggle quitted her and remounting his horse called one of his servants to him whom he ordered to stay behind with her and make her any offers whatever to prevail on her to return home with him in the evening and to assure her he would take her into keeping he then rode on with his other servants and arrived at the ladys house to whom he was a distant relation and was come to pay a visit  the trusty fellow who was employed in an office he had been long accustomed to discharged his part with all the fidelity and dexterity imaginable but to no purpose she was entirely deaf to his offers and rejected them with the utmost disdain at last the pimp who had perhaps more warm blood about him than his master began to sollicit for himself he told her though he was a servant he was a man of some fortune which he would make her mistress of and this without any insult to her virtue for that he would marry her she answered if his master himself or the greatest lord in the land would marry her she would refuse him at last being weary with persuasions and on fire with charms which would have almost kindled a flame in the bosom of an ancient philosopher or modern divine he fastened his horse to the ground and attacked her with much more force than the gentleman had exerted poor fanny would not have been able to resist his rudeness a short time but the deity who presides over chaste love sent her joseph to her assistance he no sooner came within sight and perceived her struggling with a man than like a cannonball or like lightning or anything that is swifter if anything be he ran towards her and coming up just as the ravisher had torn her handkerchief from her breast before his lips had touched that seat of innocence and bliss he dealt him so lusty a blow in that part of his neck which a rope would have become with the utmost propriety that the fellow staggered backwards and perceiving he had to do with something rougher than the little tender trembling hand of fanny he quitted her and turning about saw his rival with fire flashing from his eyes again ready to assail him and indeed before he could well defend himself or return the first blow he received a second which had it fallen on that part of the stomach to which it was directed would have been probably the last he would have had any occasion for but the ravisher lifting up his hand drove the blow upwards to his mouth whence it dislodged three of his teeth and now not conceiving any extraordinary affection for the beauty of josephs person nor being extremely pleased with this method of salutation he collected all his force and aimed a blow at josephs breast which he artfully parried with one fist so that it lost its force entirely in air and stepping one foot backward he darted his fist so fiercely at his enemy that had he not caught it in his hand for he was a boxer of no inferior fame it must have tumbled him on the ground and now the ravisher meditated another blow which he aimed at that part of the breast where the heart is lodged joseph did not catch it as before yet so prevented its aim that it fell directly on his nose but with abated force joseph then moving both fist and foot forwards at the same time threw his head so dexterously into the stomach of the ravisher that he fell a lifeless lump on the field where he lay many minutes breathless and motionless  when fanny saw her joseph receive a blow in his face and blood running in a stream from him she began to tear her hair and invoke all human and divine power to his assistance she was not however long under this affliction before joseph having conquered his enemy ran to her and assured her he was not hurt she then instantly fell on her knees and thanked god that he had made joseph the means of her rescue and at the same time preserved him from being injured in attempting it she offered with her handkerchief to wipe his blood from his face but he seeing his rival attempting to recover his legs turned to him and asked him if he had enough to which the other answered he had for he believed he had fought with the devil instead of a man and loosening his horse said he should not have attempted the wench if he had known she had been so well provided for  fanny now begged joseph to return with her to parson adams and to promise that he would leave her no more these were propositions so agreeable to joseph that had he heard them he would have given an immediate assent but indeed his eyes were now his only sense for you may remember reader that the ravisher had tore her handkerchief from fannys neck by which he had discovered such a sight that joseph hath declared all the statues he ever beheld were so much inferior to it in beauty that it was more capable of converting a man into a statue than of being imitated by the greatest master of that art this modest creature whom no warmth in summer could ever induce to expose her charms to the wanton sun a modesty to which perhaps they owed their inconceivable whiteness had stood many minutes barenecked in the presence of joseph before her apprehension of his danger and the horror of seeing his blood would suffer her once to reflect on what concerned herself till at last when the cause of her concern had vanished an admiration at his silence together with observing the fixed position of his eyes produced an idea in the lovely maid which brought more blood into her face than had flowed from josephs nostrils the snowy hue of her bosom was likewise changed to vermilion at the instant when she clapped her handkerchief round her neck joseph saw the uneasiness she suffered and immediately removed his eyes from an object in surveying which he had felt the greatest delight which the organs of sight were capable of conveying to his soulso great was his fear of offending her and so truly did his passion for her deserve the noble name of love  fanny being recovered from her confusion which was almost equalled by what joseph had felt from observing it again mentioned her request this was instantly and gladly complied with and together they crossed two or three fields which brought them to the habitation of mr adams    chapter viii  a discourse which happened between mr adams mrs adams joseph and fanny with some behaviour of mr adams which will be called by some few readers very low absurd and unnatural   the parson and his wife had just ended a long dispute when the lovers came to the door indeed this young couple had been the subject of the dispute for mrs adams was one of those prudent people who never do anything to injure their families or perhaps one of those good mothers who would even stretch their conscience to serve their children she had long entertained hopes of seeing her eldest daughter succeed mrs slipslop and of making her second son an exciseman by lady boobys interest these were expectations she could not endure the thoughts of quitting and was therefore very uneasy to see her husband so resolute to oppose the ladys intention in fannys affair she told him it behoved every man to take the first care of his family that he had a wife and six children the maintaining and providing for whom would be business enough for him without intermeddling in other folks affairs that he had always preached up submission to superiors and would do ill to give an example of the contrary behaviour in his own conduct that if lady booby did wrong she must answer for it herself and the sin would not lie at their door that fanny had been a servant and bred up in the ladys own family and consequently she must have known more of her than they did and it was very improbable if she had behaved herself well that the lady would have been so bitterly her enemy that perhaps he was too much inclined to think well of her because she was handsome but handsome women were often no better than they should be that g made ugly women as well as handsome ones and that if a woman had virtue it signified nothing whether she had beauty or no for all which reasons she concluded he should oblige the lady and stop the future publication of the banns but all these excellent arguments had no effect on the parson who persisted in doing his duty without regarding the consequence it might have on his worldly interest he endeavoured to answer her as well as he could to which she had just finished her reply for she had always the last word everywhere but at church when joseph and fanny entered their kitchen where the parson and his wife then sat at breakfast over some bacon and cabbage there was a coldness in the civility of mrs adams which persons of accurate speculation might have observed but escaped her present guests indeed it was a good deal covered by the heartiness of adams who no sooner heard that fanny had neither eat nor drank that morning than he presented her a bone of bacon he had just been gnawing being the only remains of his provision and then ran nimbly to the tap and produced a mug of small beer which he called ale however it was the best in his house joseph addressing himself to the parson told him the discourse which had past between squire booby his sister and himself concerning fanny he then acquainted him with the dangers whence he had rescued her and communicated some apprehensions on her account he concluded that he should never have an easy moment till fanny was absolutely his and begged that he might be suffered to fetch a licence saying he could easily borrow the money the parson answered that he had already given his sentiments concerning a licence and that a very few days would make it unnecessary joseph says he i wish this haste doth not arise rather from your impatience than your fear but as it certainly springs from one of these causes i will examine both of each of these therefore in their turn and first for the first of these namely impatience now child i must inform you that if in your purposed marriage with this young woman you have no intention but the indulgence of carnal appetites you are guilty of a very heinous sin marriage was ordained for nobler purposes as you will learn when you hear the service provided on that occasion read to you nay perhaps if you are a good lad i child shall give you a sermon gratis wherein i shall demonstrate how little regard ought to be had to the flesh on such occasions the text will be matthew the  th and part of the   th versewhosoever looketh on a woman so as to lust after her the latter part i shall omit as foreign to my purpose indeed all such brutal lusts and affections are to be greatly subdued if not totally eradicated before the vessel can be said to be consecrated to honour to marry with a view of gratifying those inclinations is a prostitution of that holy ceremony and must entail a curse on all who so lightly undertake it if therefore this haste arises from impatience you are to correct and not give way to it now as to the second head which i proposed to speak to namely fear it argues a diffidence highly criminal of that power in which alone we should put our trust seeing we may be well assured that he is able not only to defeat the designs of our enemies but even to turn their hearts instead of taking therefore any unjustifiable or desperate means to rid ourselves of fear we should resort to prayer only on these occasions and we may be then certain of obtaining what is best for us when any accident threatens us we are not to despair nor when it overtakes us to grieve we must submit in all things to the will of providence and set our affections so much on nothing here that we cannot quit it without reluctance you are a young man and can know but little of this world i am older and have seen a great deal all passions are criminal in their excess and even love itself if it is not subservient to our duty may render us blind to it had abraham so loved his son isaac as to refuse the sacrifice required is there any of us who would not condemn him joseph i know your many good qualities and value you for them but as i am to render an account of your soul which is committed to my cure i cannot see any fault without reminding you of it you are too much inclined to passion child and have set your affections so absolutely on this young woman that if g required her at your hands i fear you would reluctantly part with her now believe me no christian ought so to set his heart on any person or thing in this world but that whenever it shall be required or taken from him in any manner by divine providence he may be able peaceably quietly and contentedly to resign it at which words one came hastily in and acquainted mr adams that his youngest son was drowned he stood silent a moment and soon began to stamp about the room and deplore his loss with the bitterest agony joseph who was overwhelmed with concern likewise recovered himself sufficiently to endeavour to comfort the parson in which attempt he used many arguments that he had at several times remembered out of his own discourses both in private and public for he was a great enemy to the passions and preached nothing more than the conquest of them by reason and grace but he was not at leisure now to hearken to his advice child child said he do not go about impossibilities had it been any other of my children i could have borne it with patience but my little prattler the darling and comfort of my old agethe little wretch to be snatched out of life just at his entrance into it the sweetest besttempered boy who never did a thing to offend me it was but this morning i gave him his first lesson in que genus this was the very book he learnt poor child it is of no further use to thee now he would have made the best scholar and have been an ornament to the churchsuch parts and such goodness never met in one so young and the handsomest lad too says mrs adams recovering from a swoon in fannys arms my poor jacky shall i never see thee more cries the parson yes surely says joseph and in a better place you will meet again never to part more i believe the parson did not hear these words for he paid little regard to them but went on lamenting whilst the tears trickled down into his bosom at last he cried out where is my little darling and was sallying out when to his great surprize and joy in which i hope the reader will sympathize he met his son in a wet condition indeed but alive and running towards him the person who brought the news of his misfortune had been a little too eager as people sometimes are from i believe no very good principle to relate ill news and seeing him fall into the river instead of running to his assistance directly ran to acquaint his father of a fate which he had concluded to be inevitable but whence the child was relieved by the same poor pedlar who had relieved his father before from a less distress the parsons joy was now as extravagant as his grief had been before he kissed and embraced his son a thousand times and danced about the room like one frantic but as soon as he discovered the face of his old friend the pedlar and heard the fresh obligation he had to him what were his sensations not those which two courtiers feel in one anothers embraces not those with which a great man receives the vile treacherous engines of his wicked purposes not those with which a worthless younger brother wishes his elder joy of a son or a man congratulates his rival on his obtaining a mistress a place or an honourno reader he felt the ebullition the overflowings of a full honest open heart towards the person who had conferred a real obligation and of which if thou canst not conceive an idea within i will not vainly endeavour to assist thee  when these tumults were over the parson taking joseph aside proceeded thusno joseph do not give too much way to thy passions if thou dost expect happiness the patience of joseph nor perhaps of job could bear no longer he interrupted the parson saying it was easier to give advice than take it nor did he perceive he could so entirely conquer himself when he apprehended he had lost his son or when he found him recoveredboy replied adams raising his voice it doth not become green heads to advise grey hairsthou art ignorant of the tenderness of fatherly affection when thou art a father thou wilt be capable then only of knowing what a father can feel no man is obliged to impossibilities and the loss of a child is one of those great trials where our grief may be allowed to become immoderatewell sir cries joseph and if i love a mistress as well as you your child surely her loss would grieve me equallyyes but such love is foolishness and wrong in itself and ought to be conquered answered adams it savours too much of the fleshsure sir says joseph it is not sinful to love my wife no not even to doat on her to distractionindeed but it is says adams every man ought to love his wife no doubt we are commanded so to do but we ought to love her with moderation and discretioni am afraid i shall be guilty of some sin in spite of all my endeavours says joseph for i shall love without any moderation i am sureyou talk foolishly and childishly cries adamsindeed says mrs adams who had listened to the latter part of their conversation you talk more foolishly yourself i hope my dear you will never preach any such doctrine as that husbands can love their wives too well if i knew you had such a sermon in the house i am sure i would burn it and i declare if i had not been convinced you had loved me as well as you could i can answer for myself i should have hated and despised you marry come up fine doctrine indeed a wife hath a right to insist on her husbands loving her as much as ever he can and he is a sinful villain who doth not doth he not promise to love her and to comfort her and to cherish her and all that i am sure i remember it all as well as if i had repeated it over but yesterday and shall never forget it besides i am certain you do not preach as you practise for you have been a loving and a cherishing husband to me thats the truth ont and why you should endeavour to put such wicked nonsense into this young mans head i cannot devise dont hearken to him mr joseph be as good a husband as you are able and love your wife with all your body and soul too here a violent rap at the door put an end to their discourse and produced a scene which the reader will find in the next chapter    chapter ix  a visit which the polite lady booby and her polite friend paid to the parson   the lady booby had no sooner had an account from the gentleman of his meeting a wonderful beauty near her house and perceived the raptures with which he spoke of her than immediately concluding it must be fanny she began to meditate a design of bringing them better acquainted and to entertain hopes that the fine clothes presents and promises of this youth would prevail on her to abandon joseph she therefore proposed to her company a walk in the fields before dinner when she led them towards mr adamss house and as she approached it told them if they pleased she would divert them with one of the most ridiculous sights they had ever seen which was an old foolish parson who she said laughing kept a wife and six brats on a salary of about twenty pounds a year adding that there was not such another ragged family in the parish they all readily agreed to this visit and arrived whilst mrs adams was declaiming as in the last chapter beau didapper which was the name of the young gentleman we have seen riding towards lady boobys with his cane mimicked the rap of a london footman at the door the people within namely adams his wife and three children joseph fanny and the pedlar were all thrown into confusion by this knock but adams went directly to the door which being opened the lady booby and her company walked in and were received by the parson with about two hundred bows and by his wife with as many curtsies the latter telling the lady she was ashamed to be seen in such a pickle and that her house was in such a litter but that if she had expected such an honour from her ladyship she should have found her in a better manner the parson made no apologies though he was in his halfcassock and a flannel nightcap he said they were heartily welcome to his poor cottage and turning to mr didapper cried out non mea renidet in domo lacunar the beau answered he did not understand welsh at which the parson stared and made no reply  mr didapper or beau didapper was a young gentleman of about four foot five inches in height he wore his own hair though the scarcity of it might have given him sufficient excuse for a periwig his face was thin and pale the shape of his body and legs none of the best for he had very narrow shoulders and no calf and his gait might more properly be called hopping than walking the qualifications of his mind were well adapted to his person we shall handle them first negatively he was not entirely ignorant for he could talk a little french and sing two or three italian songs he had lived too much in the world to be bashful and too much at court to be proud he seemed not much inclined to avarice for he was profuse in his expenses nor had he all the features of prodigality for he never gave a shilling no hater of women for he always dangled after them yet so little subject to lust that he had among those who knew him best the character of great moderation in his pleasures no drinker of wine nor so addicted to passion but that a hot word or two from an adversary made him immediately cool  now to give him only a dash or two on the affirmative side though he was born to an immense fortune he chose for the pitiful and dirty consideration of a place of little consequence to depend entirely on the will of a fellow whom they call a great man who treated him with the utmost disrespect and exacted of him a plenary obedience to his commands which he implicitly submitted to at the expense of his conscience his honour and of his country in which he had himself so very large a share and to finish his character as he was entirely well satisfied with his own person and parts so he was very apt to ridicule and laugh at any imperfection in another such was the little person or rather thing that hopped after lady booby into mr adamss kitchen  the parson and his company retreated from the chimneyside where they had been seated to give room to the lady and hers instead of returning any of the curtsies or extraordinary civility of mrs adams the lady turning to mr booby cried out quelle bête quel animal and presently after discovering fanny for she did not need the circumstance of her standing by joseph to assure the identity of her person she asked the beau whether he did not think her a pretty girlbegad madam answered he tis the very same i met i did not imagine replied the lady you had so good a tastebecause i never liked you i warrant cries the beau ridiculous said she you know you was always my aversion i would never mention aversion answered the beau with that facea dear lady booby wash your face before you mention aversion i beseech you he then laughed and turned about to coquet it with fanny  a lest this should appear unnatural to some readers we think proper     to acquaint them that it is taken verbatim from very polite     conversation  mrs adams had been all this time begging and praying the ladies to sit down a favour which she at last obtained the little boy to whom the accident had happened still keeping his place by the fire was chid by his mother for not being more mannerly but lady booby took his part and commending his beauty told the parson he was his very picture she then seeing a book in his hand asked if he could readyes cried adams a little latin madam he is just got into quae genusa fig for quere genius answered she let me hear him read a little englishlege dick lege said adams but the boy made no answer till he saw the parson knit his brows and then cried i dont understand you fatherhow boy says adams what doth lego make in the imperative mood legito doth it notyes answered dickand what besides  says the father lege quoth the son after some hesitation a good boy says the father and now child what is the english of legoto which the boy after long puzzling answered he could not tell how cries adams in a passionwhat hath the water washed away your learning why what is latin for the english verb read consider before you speak the child considered some time and then the parson cried twice or thrice le le dick answered legovery welland then what is the english says the parson of the verb legoto read cried dickvery well said the parson a good boy you can do well if you will take painsi assure your ladyship he is not much above eight years old and is out of his propria quae maribus alreadycome dick read to her ladyshipwhich she again desiring in order to give the beau time and opportunity with fanny dick began as in the following chapter    chapter x  the history of two friends which may afford an useful lesson to all those persons who happen to take up their residence in married families   leonard and paul were two friendspronounce it lennard child cried the parsonpray mr adams says lady booby let your son read without interruption dick then proceeded lennard and paul were two friends who having been educated together at the same school commenced a friendship which they preserved a long time for each other it was so deeply fixed in both their minds that a long absence during which they had maintained no correspondence did not eradicate nor lessen it but it revived in all its force at their first meeting which was not till after fifteen years absence most of which time lennard had spent in the east indiespronounce it short indies says adamspray sir be quiet says the ladythe boy repeatedin the east indies whilst paul had served his king and country in the army in which different services they had found such different success that lennard was now married and retired with a fortune of thirty thousand pounds and paul was arrived to the degree of a lieutenant of foot and was not worth a single shilling  the regiment in which paul was stationed happened to be ordered into quarters within a small distance from the estate which lennard had purchased and where he was settled this latter who was now become a country gentleman and a justice of peace came to attend the quarter sessions in the town where his old friend was quartered soon after his arrival some affair in which a soldier was concerned occasioned paul to attend the justices manhood and time and the change of climate had so much altered lennard that paul did not immediately recollect the features of his old acquaintance but it was otherwise with lennard he knew paul the moment he saw him nor could he contain himself from quitting the bench and running hastily to embrace him paul stood at first a little surprized but had soon sufficient information from his friend whom he no sooner remembered than he returned his embrace with a passion which made many of the spectators laugh and gave to some few a much higher and more agreeable sensation  not to detain the reader with minute circumstances lennard insisted on his friends returning with him to his house that evening which request was complied with and leave for a months absence for paul obtained of the commanding officer  if it was possible for any circumstance to give any addition to the happiness which paul proposed in this visit he received that additional pleasure by finding on his arrival at his friends house that his lady was an old acquaintance which he had formerly contracted at his quarters and who had always appeared to be of a most agreeable temper a character she had ever maintained among her intimates being of that number every individual of which is called quite the best sort of woman in the world  but good as this lady was she was still a woman that is to say an angel and not an angelyou must mistake child cries the parson for you read nonsenseit is so in the book answered the son mr adams was then silenced by authority and dick proceededfor though her person was of that kind to which men attribute the name of angel yet in her mind she was perfectly woman of which a great degree of obstinacy gave the most remarkable and perhaps most pernicious instance  a day or two passed after pauls arrival before any instances of this appeared but it was impossible to conceal it long both she and her husband soon lost all apprehension from their friends presence and fell to their disputes with as much vigour as ever these were still pursued with the utmost ardour and eagerness however trifling the causes were whence they first arose nay however incredible it may seem the little consequence of the matter in debate was frequently given as a reason for the fierceness of the contention as thus if you loved me sure you would never dispute with me such a trifle as this the answer to which is very obvious for the argument would hold equally on both sides and was constantly retorted with some addition asi am sure i have much more reason to say so who am in the right during all these disputes paul always kept strict silence and preserved an even countenance without showing the least visible inclination to either party one day however when madam had left the room in a violent fury lennard could not refrain from referring his cause to his friend was ever anything so unreasonable says he as this woman what shall i do with her i doat on her to distraction nor have i any cause to complain of more than this obstinacy in her temper whatever she asserts she will maintain against all the reason and conviction in the world pray give me your advicefirst says paul i will give my opinion which is flatly that you are in the wrong for supposing she is in the wrong was the subject of your contention any ways material what signified it whether you was married in a red or a yellow waistcoat for that was your dispute now suppose she was mistaken as you love her you say so tenderly and i believe she deserves it would it not have been wiser to have yielded though you certainly knew yourself in the right than to give either her or yourself any uneasiness for my own part if ever i marry i am resolved to enter into an agreement with my wife that in all disputes especially about trifles that party who is most convinced they are right shall always surrender the victory by which means we shall both be forward to give up the cause i own said lennard my dear friend shaking him by the hand there is great truth and reason in what you say and i will for the future endeavour to follow your advice they soon after broke up the conversation and lennard going to his wife asked her pardon and told her his friend had convinced him he had been in the wrong she immediately began a vast encomium on paul in which he seconded her and both agreed he was the worthiest and wisest man upon earth when next they met which was at supper though she had promised not to mention what her husband told her she could not forbear casting the kindest and most affectionate looks on paul and asked him with the sweetest voice whether she should help him to some potted woodcock potted partridge my dear you mean says the husband my dear says she i ask your friend if he will eat any potted woodcock and i am sure i must know who potted it i think i should know too who shot them replied the husband and i am convinced that i have not seen a woodcock this year however though i know i am in the right i submit and the potted partridge is potted woodcock if you desire to have it so it is equal to me says she whether it is one or the other but you would persuade one out of ones senses to be sure you are always in the right in your own opinion but your friend i believe knows which he is eating paul answered nothing and the dispute continued as usual the greatest part of the evening the next morning the lady accidentally meeting paul and being convinced he was her friend and of her side accosted him thusi am certain sir you have long since wondered at the unreasonableness of my husband he is indeed in other respects a good sort of man but so positive that no woman but one of my complying temper could possibly live with him why last night now was ever any creature so unreasonable i am certain you must condemn him pray answer me was he not in the wrong paul after a short silence spoke as follows i am sorry madam that as good manners obliges me to answer against my will so an adherence to truth forces me to declare myself of a different opinion to be plain and honest you was entirely in the wrong the cause i own not worth disputing but the bird was undoubtedly a partridge o sir replyed the lady i cannot possibly help your taste madam returned paul that is very little material for had it been otherwise a husband might have expected submissionindeed sir says she i assure youyes madam cryed he he might from a person of your excellent understanding and pardon me for saying such a condescension would have shown a superiority of sense even to your husband himselfbut dear sir said she why should i submit when i am in the rightfor that very reason answered he it would be the greatest instance of affection imaginable for can anything be a greater object of our compassion than a person we love in the wrong ay but i should endeavour said she to set him right pardon me madam answered paul i will apply to your own experience if you ever found your arguments had that effect the more our judgments err the less we are willing to own it for my own part i have always observed the persons who maintain the worst side in any contest are the warmest why says she i must confess there is truth in what you say and i will endeavour to practise it the husband then coming in paul departed and leonard approaching his wife with an air of good humour told her he was sorry for their foolish dispute the last night but he was now convinced of his error she answered smiling she believed she owed his condescension to his complacence that she was ashamed to think a word had passed on so silly an occasion especially as she was satisfyed she had been mistaken a little contention followed but with the utmost goodwill to each other and was concluded by her asserting that paul had thoroughly convinced her she had been in the wrong upon which they both united in the praises of their common friend  paul now passed his time with great satisfaction these disputes being much less frequent as well as shorter than usual but the devil or some unlucky accident in which perhaps the devil had no hand shortly put an end to his happiness he was now eternally the private referee of every difference in which after having perfectly as he thought established the doctrine of submission he never scrupled to assure both privately that they were in the right in every argument as before he had followed the contrary method one day a violent litigation happened in his absence and both parties agreed to refer it to his decision the husband professing himself sure the decision would be in his favour the wife answered he might be mistaken for she believed his friend was convinced how seldom she was to blame and that if he knew allthe husband replied my dear i have no desire of any retrospect but i believe if you knew all too you would not imagine my friend so entirely on your side nay says she since you provoke me i will mention one instance you may remember our dispute about sending jackey to school in cold weather which point i gave up to you from mere compassion knowing myself to be in the right and paul himself told me afterwards he thought me so my dear replied the husband i will not scruple your veracity but i assure you solemnly on my applying to him he gave it absolutely on my side and said he would have acted in the same manner they then proceeded to produce numberless other instances in all which paul had on vows of secresy given his opinion on both sides in the conclusion both believing each other they fell severely on the treachery of paul and agreed that he had been the occasion of almost every dispute which had fallen out between them they then became extremely loving and so full of condescension on both sides that they vyed with each other in censuring their own conduct and jointly vented their indignation on paul whom the wife fearing a bloody consequence earnestly entreated her husband to suffer quietly to depart the next day which was the time fixed for his return to quarters and then drop his acquaintance  however ungenerous this behaviour in lennard may be esteemed his wife obtained a promise from him though with difficulty to follow her advice but they both expressed such unusual coldness that day to paul that he who was quick of apprehension taking lennard aside pressed him so home that he at last discovered the secret paul acknowledged the truth but told him the design with which he had done itto which the other answered he would have acted more friendly to have let him into the whole design for that he might have assured himself of his secresy paul replyed with some indignation he had given him a sufficient proof how capable he was of concealing a secret from his wife lennard returned with some warmthhe had more reason to upbraid him for that he had caused most of the quarrels between them by his strange conduct and might if they had not discovered the affair to each other have been the occasion of their separation paul then saidbut something now happened which put a stop to dicks reading and of which we shall treat in the next chapter    chapter xi  in which the history is continued   joseph andrews had borne with great uneasiness the impertinence of beau didapper to fanny who had been talking pretty freely to her and offering her settlements but the respect to the company had restrained him from interfering whilst the beau confined himself to the use of his tongue only but the said beau watching an opportunity whilst the ladies eyes were disposed another way offered a rudeness to her with his hands which joseph no sooner perceived than he presented him with so sound a box on the ear that it conveyed him several paces from where he stood the ladies immediately screamed out rose from their chairs and the beau as soon as he recovered himself drew his hanger which adams observing snatched up the lid of a pot in his left hand and covering himself with it as with a shield without any weapon of offence in his other hand stept in before joseph and exposed himself to the enraged beau who threatened such perdition and destruction that it frighted the women who were all got in a huddle together out of their wits even to hear his denunciations of vengeance joseph was of a different complexion and begged adams to let his rival come on for he had a good cudgel in his hand and did not fear him fanny now fainted into mrs adamss arms and the whole room was in confusion when mr booby passing by adams who lay snug under the potlid came up to didapper and insisted on his sheathing the hanger promising he should have satisfaction which joseph declared he would give him and fight him at any weapon whatever the beau now sheathed his hanger and taking out a pocketglass and vowing vengeance all the time readjusted his hair the parson deposited his shield and joseph running to fanny soon brought her back to life lady booby chid joseph for his insult on didapper but he answered he would have attacked an army in the same cause what cause said the lady madam answered joseph he was rude to that young womanwhat says the lady i suppose he would have kissed the wench and is a gentleman to be struck for such an offer i must tell you joseph these airs do not become youmadam said mr booby i saw the whole affair and i do not commend my brother for i cannot perceive why he should take upon him to be this girls championi can commend him says adams he is a brave lad and it becomes any man to be the champion of the innocent and he must be the basest coward who would not vindicate a woman with whom he is on the brink of marriagesir says mr booby my brother is not a proper match for such a young woman as thisno says lady booby nor do you mr adams act in your proper character by encouraging any such doings and i am very much surprized you should concern yourself in it i think your wife and family your properer careindeed madam your ladyship says very true answered mrs adams he talks a pack of nonsense that the whole parish are his children i am sure i dont understand what he means by it it would make some women suspect he had gone astray but i acquit him of that i can read scripture as well as he and i never found that the parson was obliged to provide for other folks children and besides he is but a poor curate and hath little enough as your ladyship knows for me and mineyou say very well mrs adams quoth the lady booby who had not spoke a word to her before you seem to be a very sensible woman and i assure you your husband is acting a very foolish part and opposing his own interest seeing my nephew is violently set against this match and indeed i cant blame him it is by no means one suitable to our family in this manner the lady proceeded with mrs adams whilst the beau hopped about the room shaking his head partly from pain and partly from anger and pamela was chiding fanny for her assurance in aiming at such a match as her brother poor fanny answered only with her tears which had long since begun to wet her handkerchief which joseph perceiving took her by the arm and wrapping it in his carried her off swearing he would own no relation to any one who was an enemy to her he loved more than all the world he went out with fanny under his left arm brandishing a cudgel in his right and neither mr booby nor the beau thought proper to oppose him lady booby and her company made a very short stay behind him for the ladys bell now summoned them to dress for which they had just time before dinner  adams seemed now very much dejected which his wife perceiving began to apply some matrimonial balsam she told him he had reason to be concerned for that he had probably ruined his family with his tricks almost but perhaps he was grieved for the loss of his two children joseph and fanny his eldest daughter went on indeed father it is very hard to bring strangers here to eat your childrens bread out of their mouths you have kept them ever since they came home and for anything i see to the contrary may keep them a month longer are you obliged to give her meat thof she was never so handsome but i dont see she is so much handsomer than other people if people were to be kept for their beauty she would scarce fare better than her neighbours i believe as for mr joseph i have nothing to say he is a young man of honest principles and will pay some time or other for what he hath but for the girlwhy doth she not return to her place she ran away from i would not give such a vagabond slut a halfpenny though i had a million of money no though she was starving indeed but i would cries little dick and father rather than poor fanny shall be starved i will give her all this bread and cheeseoffering what he held in his hand adams smiled on the boy and told him he rejoiced to see he was a christian and that if he had a halfpenny in his pocket he would have given it him telling him it was his duty to look upon all his neighbours as his brothers and sisters and love them accordingly yes papa says he i love her better than my sisters for she is handsomer than any of them is she so saucebox says the sister giving him a box on the ear which the father would probably have resented had not joseph fanny and the pedlar at that instant returned together adams bid his wife prepare some food for their dinner she said truly she could not she had something else to do adams rebuked her for disputing his commands and quoted many texts of scripture to prove that the husband is the head of the wife and she is to submit and obey the wife answered it was blasphemy to talk scripture out of church that such things were very proper to be said in the pulpit but that it was profane to talk them in common discourse joseph told mr adams he was not come with any design to give him or mrs adams any trouble but to desire the favour of all their company to the george an alehouse in the parish where he had bespoke a piece of bacon and greens for their dinner mrs adams who was a very good sort of woman only rather too strict in oeconomies readily accepted this invitation as did the parson himself by her example and away they all walked together not omitting little dick to whom joseph gave a shilling when he heard of his intended liberality to fanny    chapter xii  where the goodnatured reader will see something which will give him no great pleasure   the pedlar had been very inquisitive from the time he had first heard that the great house in this parish belonged to the lady booby and had learnt that she was the widow of sir thomas and that sir thomas had bought fanny at about the age of three or four years of a travelling woman and now their homely but hearty meal was ended he told fanny he believed he could acquaint her with her parents the whole company especially she herself started at this offer of the pedlars he then proceeded thus while they all lent their strictest attentionthough i am now contented with this humble way of getting my livelihood i was formerly a gentleman for so all those of my profession are called in a word i was a drummer in an irish regiment of foot whilst i was in this honourable station i attended an officer of our regiment into england arecruiting in our march from bristol to froome for since the decay of the woollen trade the clothing towns have furnished the army with a great number of recruits we overtook on the road a woman who seemed to be about thirty years old or thereabouts not very handsome but well enough for a soldier as we came up to her she mended her pace and falling into discourse with our ladies for every man of the party namely a serjeant two private men and a drum were provided with their woman except myself she continued to travel on with us i perceiving she must fall to my lot advanced presently to her made love to her in our military way and quickly succeeded to my wishes we struck a bargain within a mile and lived together as man and wife to her dying day i suppose says adams interrupting him you were married with a licence for i dont see how you could contrive to have the banns published while you were marching from place to place no sir said the pedlar we took a licence to go to bed together without any banns ay ay said the parson ex necessitate a licence may be allowable enough but surely surely the other is the more regular and eligible way the pedlar proceeded thus she returned with me to our regiment and removed with us from quarters to quarters till at last whilst we lay at galloway she fell ill of a fever and died when she was on her deathbed she called me to her and crying bitterly declared she could not depart this world without discovering a secret to me which she said was the only sin which sat heavy on her heart she said she had formerly travelled in a company of gypsies who had made a practice of stealing away children that for her own part she had been only once guilty of the crime which she said she lamented more than all the rest of her sins since probably it might have occasioned the death of the parents for added she it is almost impossible to describe the beauty of the young creature which was about a year and a half old when i kidnapped it we kept her for she was a girl above two years in our company when i sold her myself for three guineas to sir thomas booby in somersetshire now you know whether there are any more of that name in this county yes says adams there are several boobys who are squires but i believe no baronet now alive besides it answers so exactly in every point there is no room for doubt but you have forgot to tell us the parents from whom the child was stolen their name answered the pedlar was andrews they lived about thirty miles from the squire and she told me that i might be sure to find them out by one circumstance for that they had a daughter of a very strange name pamela or pamela some pronounced it one way and some the other fanny who had changed colour at the first mention of the name now fainted away joseph turned pale and poor dicky began to roar the parson fell on his knees and ejaculated many thanksgivings that this discovery had been made before the dreadful sin of incest was committed and the pedlar was struck with amazement not being able to account for all this confusion the cause of which was presently opened by the parsons daughter who was the only unconcerned person for the mother was chafing fannys temples and taking the utmost care of her and indeed fanny was the only creature whom the daughter would not have pitied in her situation wherein though we compassionate her ourselves we shall leave her for a little while and pay a short visit to lady booby    chapter xiii  the history returning to the lady booby gives some account of the terrible conflict in her breast between love and pride with what happened on the present discovery   the lady sat down with her company to dinner but eat nothing as soon as her cloth was removed she whispered pamela that she was taken a little ill and desired her to entertain her husband and beau didapper she then went up into her chamber sent for slipslop threw herself on the bed in the agonies of love rage and despair nor could she conceal these boiling passions longer without bursting slipslop now approached her bed and asked how her ladyship did but instead of revealing her disorder as she intended she entered into a long encomium on the beauty and virtues of joseph andrews ending at last with expressing her concern that so much tenderness should be thrown away on so despicable an object as fanny slipslop well knowing how to humour her mistresss frenzy proceeded to repeat with exaggeration if possible all her mistress had said and concluded with a wish that joseph had been a gentleman and that she could see her lady in the arms of such a husband the lady then started from the bed and taking a turn or two across the room cryed out with a deep sigh sure he would make any woman happyyour ladyship says she would be the happiest woman in the world with him a fig for custom and nonsense what vails what people say shall i be afraid of eating sweetmeats because people may say i have a sweet tooth if i had a mind to marry a man all the world should not hinder me your ladyship hath no parents to tutelar your infections besides he is of your ladyships family now and as good a gentleman as any in the country and why should not a woman follow her mind as well as man why should not your ladyship marry the brother as well as your nephew the sister i am sure if it was a fragrant crime i would not persuade your ladyship to itbut dear slipslop answered the lady if i could prevail on myself to commit such a weakness there is that cursed fanny in the way whom the idioto how i hate and despise himshe a little ugly mynx cries slipslop leave her to me i suppose your ladyship hath heard of josephs fitting with one of mr didappers servants about her and his master hath ordered them to carry her away by force this evening ill take care they shall not want assistance i was talking with this gentleman who was below just when your ladyship sent for mego back says the lady booby this instant for i expect mr didapper will soon be going do all you can for i am resolved this wench shall not be in our family i will endeavour to return to the company but let me know as soon as she is carried off slipslop went away and her mistress began to arraign her own conduct in the following manner  what am i doing how do i suffer this passion to creep imperceptibly upon me how many days are past since i could have submitted to ask myself the questionmarry a footman distraction can i afterwards bear the eyes of my acquaintance but i can retire from them retire with one in whom i propose more happiness than the world without him can give me retireto feed continually on beauties which my inflamed imagination sickens with eagerly gazing on to satisfy every appetite every desire with their utmost wish ha and do i doat thus on a footman i despise i detest my passionyet why is he not generous gentle kindkind to whom to the meanest wretch a creature below my consideration doth he notyes he doth prefer her curse his beauties and the little low heart that possesses them which can basely descend to this despicable wench and be ungratefully deaf to all the honours i do him and can i then love this monster no i will tear his image from my bosom tread on him spurn him i will have those pitiful charms which now i despise mangled in my sight for i will not suffer the little jade i hate to riot in the beauties i contemn no though i despise him myself though i would spurn him from my feet was he to languish at them no other should taste the happiness i scorn why do i say happiness to me it would be misery to sacrifice my reputation my character my rank in life to the indulgence of a mean and a vile appetite how i detest the thought how much more exquisite is the pleasure resulting from the reflection of virtue and prudence than the faint relish of what flows from vice and folly whither did i suffer this improper this mad passion to hurry me only by neglecting to summon the aids of reason to my assistance reason which hath now set before me my desires in their proper colours and immediately helped me to expel them yes i thank heaven and my pride i have now perfectly conquered this unworthy passion and if there was no obstacle in its way my pride would disdain any pleasures which could be the consequence of so base so mean so vulgar slipslop returned at this instant in a violent hurry and with the utmost eagerness cryed out o madam i have strange news tom the footman is just come from the george where it seems joseph and the rest of them are a jinketting and he says there is a strange man who hath discovered that fanny and joseph are brother and sisterhow slipslop cries the lady in a surprizei had not time madam cries slipslop to enquire about particles but tom says it is most certainly true  this unexpected account entirely obliterated all those admirable reflections which the supreme power of reason had so wisely made just before in short when despair which had more share in producing the resolutions of hatred we have seen taken began to retreat the lady hesitated a moment and then forgetting all the purport of her soliloquy dismissed her woman again with orders to bid tom attend her in the parlour whither she now hastened to acquaint pamela with the news pamela said she could not believe it for she had never heard that her mother had lost any child or that she had ever had any more than joseph and herself the lady flew into a violent rage with her and talked of upstarts and disowning relations who had so lately been on a level with her pamela made no answer but her husband taking up her cause severely reprimanded his aunt for her behaviour to his wife he told her if it had been earlier in the evening she should not have staid a moment longer in her house that he was convinced if this young woman could be proved her sister she would readily embrace her as such and he himself would do the same he then desired the fellow might be sent for and the young woman with him which lady booby immediately ordered and thinking proper to make some apology to pamela for what she had said it was readily accepted and all things reconciled  the pedlar now attended as did fanny and joseph who would not quit her the parson likewise was induced not only by curiosity of which he had no small portion but his duty as he apprehended it to follow them for he continued all the way to exhort them who were now breaking their hearts to offer up thanksgivings and be joyful for so miraculous an escape  when they arrived at boobyhall they were presently called into the parlour where the pedlar repeated the same story he had told before and insisted on the truth of every circumstance so that all who heard him were extremely well satisfied of the truth except pamela who imagined as she had never heard either of her parents mention such an accident that it must be certainly false and except the lady booby who suspected the falsehood of the story from her ardent desire that it should be true and joseph who feared its truth from his earnest wishes that it might prove false  mr booby now desired them all to suspend their curiosity and absolute belief or disbelief till the next morning when he expected old mr andrews and his wife to fetch himself and pamela home in his coach and then they might be certain of certainly knowing the truth or falsehood of this relation in which he said as there were many strong circumstances to induce their credit so he could not perceive any interest the pedlar could have in inventing it or in endeavouring to impose such a falsehood on them  the lady booby who was very little used to such company entertained them allviz her nephew his wife her brother and sister the beau and the parson with great good humour at her own table as to the pedlar she ordered him to be made as welcome as possible by her servants all the company in the parlour except the disappointed lovers who sat sullen and silent were full of mirth for mr booby had prevailed on joseph to ask mr didappers pardon with which he was perfectly satisfied many jokes passed between the beau and the parson chiefly on each others dress these afforded much diversion to the company pamela chid her brother joseph for the concern which he exprest at discovering a new sister she said if he loved fanny as he ought with a pure affection he had no reason to lament being related to herupon which adams began to discourse on platonic love whence he made a quick transition to the joys in the next world and concluded with strongly asserting that there was no such thing as pleasure in this at which pamela and her husband smiled on one another  this happy pair proposing to retire for no other person gave the least symptom of desiring rest they all repaired to several beds provided for them in the same house nor was adams himself suffered to go home it being a stormy night fanny indeed often begged she might go home with the parson but her stay was so strongly insisted on that she at last by josephs advice consented    chapter xiv  containing several curious nightadventures in which mr adams fell into many hairbreadth scapes partly owing to his goodness and partly to his inadvertency   about an hour after they had all separated it being now past three in the morning beau didapper whose passion for fanny permitted him not to close his eyes but had employed his imagination in contrivances how to satisfy his desires at last hit on a method by which he hoped to effect it he had ordered his servant to bring him word where fanny lay and had received his information he therefore arose put on his breeches and nightgown and stole softly along the gallery which led to her apartment and being come to the door as he imagined it he opened it with the least noise possible and entered the chamber a savour now invaded his nostrils which he did not expect in the room of so sweet a young creature and which might have probably had no good effect on a cooler lover however he groped out the bed with difficulty for there was not a glimpse of light and opening the curtains he whispered in josephs voice for he was an excellent mimic fanny my angel i am come to inform thee that i have discovered the falsehood of the story we last night heard i am no longer thy brother but the lover nor will i be delayed the enjoyment of thee one moment longer you have sufficient assurances of my constancy not to doubt my marrying you and it would be want of love to deny me the possession of thy charmsso saying he disencumbered himself from the little clothes he had on and leaping into bed embraced his angel as he conceived her with great rapture if he was surprized at receiving no answer he was no less pleased to find his hug returned with equal ardour he remained not long in this sweet confusion for both he and his paramour presently discovered their error indeed it was no other than the accomplished slipslop whom he had engaged but though she immediately knew the person whom she had mistaken for joseph he was at a loss to guess at the representative of fanny he had so little seen or taken notice of this gentlewoman that light itself would have afforded him no assistance in his conjecture beau didapper no sooner had perceived his mistake than he attempted to escape from the bed with much greater haste than he had made to it but the watchful slipslop prevented him for that prudent woman being disappointed of those delicious offerings which her fancy had promised her pleasure resolved to make an immediate sacrifice to her virtue indeed she wanted an opportunity to heal some wounds which her late conduct had she feared given her reputation and as she had a wonderful presence of mind she conceived the person of the unfortunate beau to be luckily thrown in her way to restore her ladys opinion of her impregnable chastity at that instant therefore when he offered to leap from the bed she caught fast hold of his shirt at the same time roaring out o thou villain who hast attacked my chastity and i believe ruined me in my sleep i will swear a rape against thee i will prosecute thee with the utmost vengeance the beau attempted to get loose but she held him fast and when he struggled she cried out murder murder rape robbery ruin at which words parson adams who lay in the next chamber wakeful and meditating on the pedlars discovery jumped out of bed and without staying to put a rag of clothes on hastened into the apartment whence the cries proceeded he made directly to the bed in the dark where laying hold of the beaus skin for slipslop had torn his shirt almost off and finding his skin extremely soft and hearing him in a low voice begging slipslop to let him go he no longer doubted but this was the young woman in danger of ravishing and immediately falling on the bed and laying hold on slipslops chin where he found a rough beard his belief was confirmed he therefore rescued the beau who presently made his escape and then turning towards slipslop received such a cuff on his chops that his wrath kindling instantly he offered to return the favour so stoutly that had poor slipslop received the fist which in the dark passed by her and fell on the pillow she would most probably have given up the ghost adams missing his blow fell directly on slipslop who cuffed and scratched as well as she could nor was he behindhand with her in his endeavours but happily the darkness of the night befriended her she then cried she was a woman but adams answered she was rather the devil and if she was he would grapple with him and being again irritated by another stroke on his chops he gave her such a remembrance in the guts that she began to roar loud enough to be heard all over the house adams then seizing her by the hair for her doubleclout had fallen off in the scuffle pinned her head down to the bolster and then both called for lights together the lady booby who was as wakeful as any of her guests had been alarmed from the beginning and being a woman of a bold spirit she slipt on a nightgown petticoat and slippers and taking a candle which always burnt in her chamber in her hand she walked undauntedly to slipslops room where she entered just at the instant as adams had discovered by the two mountains which slipslop carried before her that he was concerned with a female he then concluded her to be a witch and said he fancied those breasts gave suck to a legion of devils slipslop seeing lady booby enter the room cried help or i am ravished with a most audible voice and adams perceiving the light turned hastily and saw the lady as she did him just as she came to the feet of the bed nor did her modesty when she found the naked condition of adams suffer her to approach farther she then began to revile the parson as the wickedest of all men and particularly railed at his impudence in chusing her house for the scene of his debaucheries and her own woman for the object of his bestiality poor adams had before discovered the countenance of his bedfellow and now first recollecting he was naked he was no less confounded than lady booby herself and immediately whipt under the bedclothes whence the chaste slipslop endeavoured in vain to shut him out then putting forth his head on which by way of ornament he wore a flannel nightcap he protested his innocence and asked ten thousand pardons of mrs slipslop for the blows he had struck her vowing he had mistaken her for a witch lady booby then casting her eyes on the ground observed something sparkle with great lustre which when she had taken it up appeared to be a very fine pair of diamond buttons for the sleeves a little farther she saw lie the sleeve itself of a shirt with laced ruffles heyday says she what is the meaning of this o madam says slipslop i dont know what hath happened i have been so terrified here may have been a dozen men in the room to whom belongs this laced shirt and jewels says the lady undoubtedly cries the parson to the young gentleman whom i mistook for a woman on coming into the room whence proceeded all the subsequent mistakes for if i had suspected him for a man i would have seized him had he been another hercules though indeed he seems rather to resemble hylas he then gave an account of the reason of his rising from bed and the rest till the lady came into the room at which and the figures of slipslop and her gallant whose heads only were visible at the opposite corners of the bed she could not refrain from laughter nor did slipslop persist in accusing the parson of any motions towards a rape the lady therefore desired him to return to his bed as soon as she was departed and then ordering slipslop to rise and attend her in her own room she returned herself thither when she was gone adams renewed his petitions for pardon to mrs slipslop who with a most christian temper not only forgave but began to move with much courtesy towards him which he taking as a hint to begin immediately quitted the bed and made the best of his way towards his own but unluckily instead of turning to the right he turned to the left and went to the apartment where fanny lay who as the reader may remember had not slept a wink the preceding night and who was so hagged out with what had happened to her in the day that notwithstanding all thoughts of her joseph she was fallen into so profound a sleep that all the noise in the adjoining room had not been able to disturb her adams groped out the bed and turning the clothes down softly a custom mrs adams had long accustomed him to crept in and deposited his carcase on the bedpost a place which that good woman had always assigned him  as the cat or lapdog of some lovely nymph for whom ten thousand lovers languish lies quietly by the side of the charming maid and ignorant of the scene of delight on which they repose meditates the future capture of a mouse or surprisal of a plate of bread and butter so adams lay by the side of fanny ignorant of the paradise to which he was so near nor could the emanation of sweets which flowed from her breath overpower the fumes of tobacco which played in the parsons nostrils and now sleep had not overtaken the good man when joseph who had secretly appointed fanny to come to her at the break of day rapped softly at the chamberdoor which when he had repeated twice adams cryed come in whoever you are joseph thought he had mistaken the door though she had given him the most exact directions however knowing his friends voice he opened it and saw some female vestments lying on a chair fanny waking at the same instant and stretching out her hand on adamss beard she cried outo heavens where am i bless me where am i said the parson then fanny screamed adams leapt out of bed and joseph stood as the tragedians call it like the statue of surprize how came she into my room cryed adams how came you into hers cryed joseph in an astonishment i know nothing of the matter answered adams but that she is a vestal for me as i am a christian i know not whether she is a man or woman he is an infidel who doth not believe in witchcraft they as surely exist now as in the days of saul my clothes are bewitched away too and fannys brought into their place for he still insisted he was in his own apartment but fanny denied it vehemently and said his attempting to persuade joseph of such a falsehood convinced her of his wicked designs how said joseph in a rage hath he offered any rudeness to you she answeredshe could not accuse him of any more than villanously stealing to bed to her which she thought rudeness sufficient and what no man would do without a wicked intention  josephs great opinion of adams was not easily to be staggered and when he heard from fanny that no harm had happened he grew a little cooler yet still he was confounded and as he knew the house and that the womens apartments were on this side mrs slipslops room and the mens on the other he was convinced that he was in fannys chamber assuring adams therefore of this truth he begged him to give some account how he came there adams then standing in his shirt which did not offend fanny as the curtains of the bed were drawn related all that had happened and when he had ended joseph told himit was plain he had mistaken by turning to the right instead of the left odso cries adams thats true as sure as sixpence you have hit on the very thing he then traversed the room rubbing his hands and begged fannys pardon assuring her he did not know whether she was man or woman that innocent creature firmly believing all he said told him she was no longer angry and begged joseph to conduct him into his own apartment where he should stay himself till she had put her clothes on joseph and adams accordingly departed and the latter soon was convinced of the mistake he had committed however whilst he was dressing himself he often asserted he believed in the power of witchcraft notwithstanding and did not see how a christian could deny it    chapter xv  the arrival of gaffar and gammar andrews with another person not much expected and a perfect solution of the difficulties raised by the pedlar   as soon as fanny was drest joseph returned to her and they had a long conversation together the conclusion of which was that if they found themselves to be really brother and sister they vowed a perpetual celibacy and to live together all their days and indulge a platonic friendship for each other  the company were all very merry at breakfast and joseph and fanny rather more chearful than the preceding night the lady booby produced the diamond button which the beau most readily owned and alledged that he was very subject to walk in his sleep indeed he was far from being ashamed of his amour and rather endeavoured to insinuate that more than was really true had passed between him and the fair slipslop  their tea was scarce over when news came of the arrival of old mr andrews and his wife they were immediately introduced and kindly received by the lady booby whose heart went now pitapat as did those of joseph and fanny they felt perhaps little less anxiety in this interval than oedipus himself whilst his fate was revealing  mr booby first opened the cause by informing the old gentleman that he had a child in the company more than he knew of and taking fanny by the hand told him this was that daughter of his who had been stolen away by gypsies in her infancy mr andrews after expressing some astonishment assured his honour that he had never lost a daughter by gypsies nor ever had any other children than joseph and pamela these words were a cordial to the two lovers but had a different effect on lady booby she ordered the pedlar to be called who recounted his story as he had done beforeat the end of which old mrs andrews running to fanny embraced her crying out she is she is my child the company were all amazed at this disagreement between the man and his wife and the blood had now forsaken the cheeks of the lovers when the old woman turning to her husband who was more surprized than all the rest and having a little recovered her own spirits delivered herself as follows you may remember my dear when you went a serjeant to gibraltar you left me big with child you stayed abroad you know upwards of three years in your absence i was brought to bed i verily believe of this daughter whom i am sure i have reason to remember for i suckled her at this very breast till the day she was stolen from me one afternoon when the child was about a year or a year and a half old or thereabouts two gypsywomen came to the door and offered to tell my fortune one of them had a child in her lap i showed them my hand and desired to know if you was ever to come home again which i remember as well as if it was but yesterday they faithfully promised me you shouldi left the girl in the cradle and went to draw them a cup of liquor the best i had when i returned with the pot i am sure i was not absent longer than whilst i am telling it to you the women were gone i was afraid they had stolen something and looked and looked but to no purpose and heaven knows i had very little for them to steal at last hearing the child cry in the cradle i went to take it upbut o the living how was i surprized to find instead of my own girl that i had put into the cradle who was as fine a fat thriving child as you shall see in a summers day a poor sickly boy that did not seem to have an hour to live i ran out pulling my hair off and crying like any mad after the women but never could hear a word of them from that day to this when i came back the poor infant which is our joseph there as stout as he now stands lifted up its eyes upon me so piteously that to be sure notwithstanding my passion i could not find in my heart to do it any mischief a neighbour of mine happening to come in at the same time and hearing the case advised me to take care of this poor child and god would perhaps one day restore me my own upon which i took the child up and suckled it to be sure all the world as if it had been born of my own natural body and as true as i am alive in a little time i loved the boy all to nothing as if it had been my own girlwell as i was saying times growing very hard i having two children and nothing but my own work which was little enough god knows to maintain them was obliged to ask relief of the parish but instead of giving it me they removed me by justices warrants fifteen miles to the place where i now live where i had not been long settled before you came home joseph for that was the name i gave him myselfthe lord knows whether he was baptized or no or by what name joseph i say seemed to me about five years old when you returned for i believe he is two or three years older than our daughter here for i am thoroughly convinced she is the same and when you saw him you said he was a chopping boy without ever minding his age and so i seeing you did not suspect anything of the matter thought i might een as well keep it to myself for fear you should not love him as well as i did and all this is veritably true and i will take my oath of it before any justice in the kingdom  the pedlar who had been summoned by the order of lady booby listened with the utmost attention to gammar andrewss story and when she had finished asked her if the supposititious child had no mark on its breast to which she answered yes he had as fine a strawberry as ever grew in a garden this joseph acknowledged and unbuttoning his coat at the intercession of the company showed to them well says gaffar andrews who was a comical sly old fellow and very likely desired to have no more children than he could keep you have proved i think very plainly that this boy doth not belong to us but how are you certain that the girl is ours the parson then brought the pedlar forward and desired him to repeat the story which he had communicated to him the preceding day at the alehouse which he complied with and related what the reader as well as mr adams hath seen before he then confirmed from his wifes report all the circumstances of the exchange and of the strawberry on josephs breast at the repetition of the word strawberry adams who had seen it without any emotion started and cried bless me something comes into my head but before he had time to bring anything out a servant called him forth when he was gone the pedlar assured joseph that his parents were persons of much greater circumstances than those he had hitherto mistaken for such for that he had been stolen from a gentlemans house by those whom they call gypsies and had been kept by them during a whole year when looking on him as in a dying condition they had exchanged him for the other healthier child in the manner before related he said as to the name of his father his wife had either never known or forgot it but that she had acquainted him he lived about forty miles from the place where the exchange had been made and which way promising to spare no pains in endeavouring with him to discover the place  but fortune which seldom doth good or ill or makes men happy or miserable by halves resolved to spare him this labour the reader may please to recollect that mr wilson had intended a journey to the west in which he was to pass through mr adamss parish and had promised to call on him he was now arrived at the lady boobys gates for that purpose being directed thither from the parsons house and had sent in the servant whom we have above seen call mr adams forth this had no sooner mentioned the discovery of a stolen child and had uttered the word strawberry than mr wilson with wildness in his looks and the utmost eagerness in his words begged to be shewed into the room where he entered without the least regard to any of the company but joseph and embracing him with a complexion all pale and trembling desired to see the mark on his breast the parson followed him capering rubbing his hands and crying out hic est quem quaeris inventus est c joseph complied with the request of mr wilson who no sooner saw the mark than abandoning himself to the most extravagant rapture of passion he embraced joseph with inexpressible ecstasy and cried out in tears of joy i have discovered my son i have him again in my arms joseph was not sufficiently apprized yet to taste the same delight with his father for so in reality he was however he returned some warmth to his embraces but he no sooner perceived from his fathers account the agreement of every circumstance of person time and place than he threw himself at his feet and embracing his knees with tears begged his blessing which was given with much affection and received with such respect mixed with such tenderness on both sides that it affected all present but none so much as lady booby who left the room in an agony which was but too much perceived and not very charitably accounted for by some of the company    chapter xvi  being the last in which this true history is brought to a happy conclusion   fanny was very little behind her joseph in the duty she exprest towards her parents and the joy she evidenced in discovering them gammar andrews kissed her and said she was heartily glad to see her but for her part she could never love any one better than joseph gaffar andrews testified no remarkable emotion he blessed and kissed her but complained bitterly that he wanted his pipe not having had a whiff that morning  mr booby who knew nothing of his aunts fondness imputed her abrupt departure to her pride and disdain of the family into which he was married he was therefore desirous to be gone with the utmost celerity and now having congratulated mr wilson and joseph on the discovery he saluted fanny called her sister and introduced her as such to pamela who behaved with great decency on the occasion  he now sent a message to his aunt who returned that she wished him a good journey but was too disordered to see any company he therefore prepared to set out having invited mr wilson to his house and pamela and joseph both so insisted on his complying that he at last consented having first obtained a messenger from mr booby to acquaint his wife with the news which as he knew it would render her completely happy he could not prevail on himself to delay a moment in acquainting her with  the company were ranged in this manner the two old people with their two daughters rode in the coach the squire mr wilson joseph parson adams and the pedlar proceeded on horseback  in their way joseph informed his father of his intended match with fanny to which though he expressed some reluctance at first on the eagerness of his sons instances he consented saying if she was so good a creature as she appeared and he described her he thought the disadvantages of birth and fortune might be compensated he however insisted on the match being deferred till he had seen his mother in which joseph perceiving him positive with great duty obeyed him to the great delight of parson adams who by these means saw an opportunity of fulfilling the church forms and marrying his parishioners without a licence  mr adams greatly exulting on this occasion for such ceremonies were matters of no small moment with him accidentally gave spurs to his horse which the generous beast disdainingfor he was of high mettle and had been used to more expert riders than the gentleman who at present bestrode him for whose horsemanship he had perhaps some contemptimmediately ran away full speed and played so many antic tricks that he tumbled the parson from his back which joseph perceiving came to his relief  this accident afforded infinite merriment to the servants and no less frighted poor fanny who beheld him as he passed by the coach but the mirth of the one and terror of the other were soon determined when the parson declared he had received no damage  the horse having freed himself from his unworthy rider as he probably thought him proceeded to make the best of his way but was stopped by a gentleman and his servants who were travelling the opposite way and were now at a little distance from the coach they soon met and as one of the servants delivered adams his horse his master hailed him and adams looking up presently recollected he was the justice of peace before whom he and fanny had made their appearance the parson presently saluted him very kindly and the justice informed him that he had found the fellow who attempted to swear against him and the young woman the very next day and had committed him to salisbury gaol where he was charged with many robberies  many compliments having passed between the parson and the justice the latter proceeded on his journey and the former having with some disdain refused josephs offer of changing horses and declared he was as able a horseman as any in the kingdom remounted his beast and now the company again proceeded and happily arrived at their journeys end mr adams by good luck rather than by good riding escaping a second fall  the company arriving at mr boobys house were all received by him in the most courteous and entertained in the most splendid manner after the custom of the old english hospitality which is still preserved in some very few families in the remote parts of england they all passed that day with the utmost satisfaction it being perhaps impossible to find any set of people more solidly and sincerely happy joseph and fanny found means to be alone upwards of two hours which were the shortest but the sweetest imaginable  in the morning mr wilson proposed to his son to make a visit with him to his mother which notwithstanding his dutiful inclinations and a longing desire he had to see her a little concerned him as he must be obliged to leave his fanny but the goodness of mr booby relieved him for he proposed to send his own coach and six for mrs wilson whom pamela so very earnestly invited that mr wilson at length agreed with the entreaties of mr booby and joseph and suffered the coach to go empty for his wife  on saturday night the coach returned with mrs wilson who added one more to this happy assembly the reader may imagine much better and quicker too than i can describe the many embraces and tears of joy which succeeded her arrival it is sufficient to say she was easily prevailed with to follow her husbands example in consenting to the match  on sunday mr adams performed the service at the squires parish church the curate of which very kindly exchanged duty and rode twenty miles to the lady boobys parish so to do being particularly charged not to omit publishing the banns being the third and last time  at length the happy day arrived which was to put joseph in the possession of all his wishes he arose and drest himself in a neat but plain suit of mr boobys which exactly fitted him for he refused all finery as did fanny likewise who could be prevailed on by pamela to attire herself in nothing richer than a white dimity nightgown her shift indeed which pamela presented her was of the finest kind and had an edging of lace round the bosom she likewise equipped her with a pair of fine white thread stockings which were all she would accept for she wore one of her own short roundeared caps and over it a little straw hat lined with cherrycoloured silk and tied with a cherrycoloured ribbon in this dress she came forth from her chamber blushing and breathing sweets and was by joseph whose eyes sparkled fire led to church the whole family attending where mr adams performed the ceremony at which nothing was so remarkable as the extraordinary and unaffected modesty of fanny unless the true christian piety of adams who publickly rebuked mr booby and pamela for laughing in so sacred a place and on so solemn an occasion our parson would have done no less to the highest prince on earth for though he paid all submission and deference to his superiors in other matters where the least spice of religion intervened he immediately lost all respect of persons it was his maxim that he was a servant of the highest and could not without departing from his duty give up the least article of his honour or of his cause to the greatest earthly potentate indeed he always asserted that mr adams at church with his surplice on and mr adams without that ornament in any other place were two very different persons  when the church rites were over joseph led his blooming bride back to mr boobys for the distance was so very little they did not think proper to use a coach the whole company attended them likewise on foot and now a most magnificent entertainment was provided at which parson adams demonstrated an appetite surprizing as well as surpassing every one present indeed the only persons who betrayed any deficiency on this occasion were those on whose account the feast was provided they pampered their imaginations with the much more exquisite repast which the approach of night promised them the thoughts of which filled both their minds though with different sensations the one all desire while the other had her wishes tempered with fears  at length after a day passed with the utmost merriment corrected by the strictest decency in which however parson adams being well filled with ale and pudding had given a loose to more facetiousness than was usual to him the happy the blest moment arrived when fanny retired with her mother her motherinlaw and her sister  she was soon undrest for she had no jewels to deposit in their caskets nor fine laces to fold with the nicest exactness undressing to her was properly discovering not putting off ornaments for as all her charms were the gifts of nature she could divest herself of none how reader shall i give thee an adequate idea of this lovely young creature the bloom of roses and lilies might a little illustrate her complexion or their smell her sweetness but to comprehend her entirely conceive youth health bloom neatness and innocence in her bridal bed conceive all these in their utmost perfection and you may place the charming fannys picture before your eyes  joseph no sooner heard she was in bed than he fled with the utmost eagerness to her a minute carried him into her arms where we shall leave this happy couple to enjoy the private rewards of their constancy rewards so great and sweet that i apprehend joseph neither envied the noblest duke nor fanny the finest duchess that night  the third day mr wilson and his wife with their son and daughter returned home where they now live together in a state of bliss scarce ever equalled mr booby hath with unprecedented generosity given fanny a fortune of two thousand pounds which joseph hath laid out in a little estate in the same parish with his father which he now occupies his father having stocked it for him and fanny presides with most excellent management in his dairy where however she is not at present very able to bustle much being as mr wilson informs me in his last letter extremely big with her first child  mr booby hath presented mr adams with a living of one hundred and thirty pounds a year he at first refused it resolving not to quit his parishioners with whom he had lived so long but on recollecting he might keep a curate at this living he hath been lately inducted into it  the pedlar besides several handsome presents both from mr wilson and mr booby is by the latters interest made an exciseman a trust which he discharges with such justice that he is greatly beloved in his neighbourhood  as for the lady booby she returned to london in a few days where a young captain of dragoons together with eternal parties at cards soon obliterated the memory of joseph  joseph remains blest with his fanny whom he doats on with the utmost tenderness which is all returned on her side the happiness of this couple is a perpetual fountain of pleasure to their fond parents and what is particularly remarkable he declares he will imitate them in their retirement nor will be prevailed on by any booksellers or their authors to make his appearance in high life    the end
