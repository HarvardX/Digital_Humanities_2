memoirs of t wilkinson  vol iii  memoirs of his own life by tate wilkinson patentee of the theatresroyal york and hull  in four volumes   if i had held my pen but half as well as i have held my bottle  what a charming hand i should have wrote by this time vol iii  york printed for the author by wilson spence and mawman and sold by g g j and j robinson paternosterrow and t and j egerton whitehall london anno    0  memoirs of tate wilkinson the present to mr rich procured me an invitation to dine with him which favor i did not accept but paid my devoirs to him at his morning levees  my old master rich one day said to me  muster williamskin you are much improved since i first began to larn you i think i must engage you  name your terms i then proposed on that hint a plan for such a mber of nights rather than for the season  he instantly agreed and mr footes minor was fixed on for immediate preparation nay he deigned to desire me to cast the parts i was in such sudden favor as he said with truth he knew nothing of muster footys farce mrs rich was a methodist  not that i mention it as a recommendation or that she was a better christian for bowing at the shrin of nonsense and hypocrisy  mr footes lash on methodism at that time was severely felt by that sect their composition is gloom melancholy envy and spleen cheerfulness is seldom observed to dawn on their countenances notwithstanding their boasted inspirations if methodist preachers had a little reflection what must they think of daring to pronounce every theater the devils house and all the players the devils children i hope they are joking  and though it may be joking i am sorry to say it is wicked to make a complete actor requires more requisites to universally excel than almost any other profession whatever  the amazing powers displayed by a garrick a barry a mrs cibber and a siddons and many others is evidently the hand of god  he alone could give the finish to such intrinsic merit and that the almighty has intended them for that very work is evident which if not so produced the world would have lost seeing the highest pitch of admiration the human frame can aspire to to mention shakspeare only proves more than all the beforementioned persons as he is a host and stands unequalled as a moral writer in many points as well the wonder of the world as an universal genius  i do not wish to insinuate that every methodist is an hypocrite but i mean that i think the greatest part are really so  so of the preachers i believe there are some in earnest though i fear the number might be easily told when persons get to the height of a whitfield and a wesleys fame for acting there is a pride as well as a duty in behaving well and they both labored hard but i dare say neither of those gentlemen ever refused a golden ticket for their separate benefits any more than i ever did  o yes i actually did once refuse five guineas at york but i was modest and rejected it i expected it to be offered a second time  it was not what then why then i was disappointed and never will be so foolish again if opportunity offers  let one of the tabernacle boast the same  they know better  and that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush but o ye saints of your own creating i will preach to you  mark judge not of plays and players lest you be judged  those who are the most censorious on the infirmities of others are usually most notoriously guilty of far greater failings themselves and sanctified methodistical slander is of all the most severe bitter and cruel and is so easily distinguished unless by the elect that it is not worth while dwelling any longer upon it  in the comedy of the hypocrite the colonel says he supposes they go to the play for the benefit of the brethren  cantwell answers the charity covers the sin  which was actually the case for in the year      as shuter was bountiful to the tabernacle mr whitfield not only permitted but advised his hearers to attend shuters benefit but alamode theater for that night only  a preacher at hull was once in distress and imprisoned i actually sent him a leg of mutton and turnips previous to that i had been an attendant at his tabernacle he entertained great hopes of my conversion and i certainly confess to the being wicked enough to have been deemed a tolerable methodist i had then quitted the old playhouse in lowgate for a new one in finklestreet that the principal performers of conventicles love to follow the smell of a theater is evident by their particularly consecrating those unhallowed shops and thinking them enviable situations to practice their own love feasts in  put out the light and then   so this rev mr rutherford formerly a london coachman erected his pulpit on the spot where brutus had been in his pulpit also  the pit he converted into pews and the stage and side boxes were appropriated for the beaus and belles  here follows most truly copied his letter to me caused partly by the brass rims not being come from york to hull for he told me over a bottle to which he had no aversion that he wanted a collection to purchase candlesticks and i having left off using those brass rims when mr garrick changed the mode of lighting the stage with six branches that used formerly to be let down at the end of every act which required a nimblefingered candlesnuffer i promised my reverend father the methodist i would light his tabernacle aye and performed it too to tate wilkinson esquire dear sir as your engagements in public and mine run counter i did not know when to wait on you as to a proper season and therefore as you were so good and sympathising to act from such a noble spirit of humanity to the distressed as proposing to take a pew in my chapel in lowgate i shall leave these four best pews to the generosity of the persons that engage so whoever leads the way will be a pattern for the others i verily think without the least flattery that your encouragement of such things will be such an honor to the stage and bespeak the fame to the comedians as will perpetuate your name more than alexander the greats i shall be glad to know what place you fix on and when i shall wait on you and whether the candlesticks are come may heaven load you with all kind of blessings for time and an unseen world  from your humble and much obliged servant rob rutherford hull jan  0         at times i have heard good discourses from mr whitfield delivered with energy feeling and pathos but then he had been really and truly an actor on the stage in the early part of his life and as he liked tragedy and found that a pair of squinting eyes as may be seen by his print did not move the young ladies tender hearts but produced laughter instead of tears he d  d the stage and ever after stuck to that text but he often melted and squeezed to some purpose many a rich dowager who felt the power of his feelings from their mutual sympathy the low stuff of the preachers in general is not worth repeating but to show i have not often attended without sometimes being a good boy i will begin with the second best performer in that line i ever saw and give his harangue verbatim and though but frothy stuff it is much better and more like reason than the damnation so terribly thundered out oo often in stage invective so much so that were they not hardened by the familiarity of their fire brimstone and pitchforks if it thundered i should fear less if in a playhouse than in the tabernacle particularly if near the preacher  mr wesley about four years ago in the fields at leeds for want of room for his congregation in his tabernacle gave an account of himself by informing us that when he was at college he was particularly fond of the devils pops or cards and said that every saturday he was one of a constant party at whist not only for the afternoon but also for the evening he then mentioned the names of several respectable gentlemen who were with him at college  but continued he the latter part of my time there i became acquainted with the lord i used to hold communication with him on my first acquaintance said wesley i used to talk with the lord once a week then every day from that to twice a day till at last the intimacy so increased that he appointed a meeting once in every four hours he recollected he said the last saturday he ever played at cards that the rubber at whist was longer than he expected and on observing the tediousness of the game he pulled out his watch when to his shame he found it was some minutes past eight which was beyond the ime he had appointed to meet the lord  he thought the devil had certainly tempted him to stay beyond his hour he therefore suddenly gave his cards to a gentleman near him to finish the game and went to the place appointed beseeching forgivness for his crime and resolved never to play with the devils pops again that resolution he had never broken and what was more extraordinary that his brother and sister though distant from cambridge experienced signs of grace on that same day on that same hour in the month of october after the easy acquaintance he had made the idea of which i think too solemn to declare and mention in the familiar manner those selfelected people do what must have become of all the tribes before us for the last seventeen hundred years but damnation how untunate that mehodim did not start up through a trapdoor many centuries ago what a hypocritical ledbythenose world it would then have been  mr wesley after expatiating on the devils pops said now my dear friends if you think there is no harm follows from playing at cards why play at cards  if you think my dear brethren there is no harm in hunting a poor little hare and depriving it of life why you may go ahunting without being guilty of sin  i do not say you will be d  d for that provided in your conscience you do not think you are doing wrong  if you think there is no harm in playing with the devils books or going to an assembly where you shall stay till two or three oclock in the morning and where they dance belly to belly and back to back and put themselves in the most unseemly postures  why if you think there is no harm in going to that assembly you may go i am told continued wesley you have a wicked playhouse in leeds  i do not say you will be d  d for going to see a play if you think there is no harm in seeing a play but now my dear brethren let me call you to a recollection of these trifling matters though you have heard me repeat that i do not pronounce damnation on my hearers for playing with the devils pops or for killing a harmless hare and depriving it of life  though i have not said the devil is with spreading arms expecting to receive you but that you may go to an assembly or even to the devils house without damnation yet my dear brethren if instead of the devils pops the going ahunting or to the dancing assembly or to see a play you can like me get acquainted and enter into conversation and intimacy with the lord who will talk who will hold converse with you here on earth  how can you prefer such vanities of this foolish world to real bliss in this and the world to come  here ends mr wesley  the rev mr whitfied the first actor in the methodist walk was of a contrary cast entirely and not without humor here and there his dialect was very particular  lurd instead of lord good instead of god  as o lurd good  i remember a text of his was  may we all work the arder  there was a poor woman and she was a long time before she was converted she was threescore years and ten  yes she was  she was threescore years and ten  sir says she to the good man that converted her sir says she i am threescore years and ten i have been a long time about it but sir says she i will work the harder  yes sir says she i will work the harder and o may you all like that dear good woman work the harder then followed a groan of applause for he had like mr bays a selected number in his pit that understood their cues and were sure to applaud and the rest of the house followed of course then whitfield looking round the rails of his little desk below  what you young ones why you are some of you twelve some fourteen and some sixteen years of age yet you do not think of going to hell what exclaimed whitfield twelve and fourteen years of age and not thinking of going to hell o ye little brats you  and at that instant the old women groaned and like fell charybdis murmured hoarse applause and whitfield shook his head and growled in his white wig exactly like my performance of squintum as i actually practiced it from the serious comical discourse i am now relating whitfield then proceeded thus  you go to plays and what do you see there why if you will not tell me i will tell you what you see there  when you see the players on the stage you see the devils children grinning at you and when you go to the playhouse i suppose you go in ruffles  i wonder whether st paul wore ruffles no there were no ruffles in those days i am told continued he archly that people say i bawl  well i allow it i do bawl and i will bawl  i will not be a velvetmouthed preacher i will not speak the word of good in a sleepy manner like your church preachers  i will tell you a story the archbishop of canterbury in the year      was acquainted with mr betterton the player one day the archbishop of canterbury said to betterton the player pray inform me mr betterton what is the reason you actors on the stage can affect your congregations with speaking of things imaginary as if they were real while we in the church speak of things real which our congregations only receive as if they were imaginary why my lord says betterton the player the reason is very plain  we actors on the stage speak of things imaginary as if they were real and you in the pulpit speak of things real as if they were imaginary therefore added whitfield i will bawl i will not be a velvetmouthed preacher    i leave the reader to judge on the good reasoning of methodism i cannot help noticing for the honor of the stage that mr whitfield could not have betrayed himself into a better story for its credit  his pointing out an intimacy between the lord archbishop of canterbury and mr betterton and for the actor he could not have given a more substantial and revered authority and what a joke for mr whitfield to pronounce damnation on players when he certainly avowed in his own opinion that mr betterton was what all the world ever acknowledged him to be a scholar and gentleman of honor and mr whitfield gave the players reasoning and exemplification for his own mode of preaching but hypocrisy like the cloven foot will sometimes be espied  some of the wild preachers of this kind often remind me of antonio in the merchant of venice  mark you this baanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood has bells edition bears this note on these lines a most excellent remark this for daily experience proves that some of the worst characters breathing seek shelter under scriptural texts by the misapplication or misconstruction of which also opposite sects uncharitably consign each other to eternal punishment  as a striking instance of good will charity and mildness being prevalent in the minds of methodists i insert the following paragraph from mr bowlings leeds paper  at york assizes william richards for robbing the theater royal was ordered to b transported for seven years and on the western circuit a man was convicted of robbing a methodist chapel and sentenced to one years imprisonment thus in the eye of the law a house of prayer is just one seventh the value of a den of thieves leeds mercury    0    but now for my tabernacle at covent garden where myself and mr rich were lately casting the comedy of the minor and which was the occasion of my preaching mr rich and i were on such sudden terms of violent friendship that he insisted i should cast the parts i put down the minor mr dyer  richard wealthy mr sparks etc etc etc  the morning after a note came from mr sparks for mr rich to the following purport mr sparkss compliments to mr rich he is concerned at being obliged to return the part of richard wealthy but as he is given to understand mr wilkinson is engaged and is to sustain the principal characters in the comedy mr sparks cannot onsent by any means to perform or assist in any piece for the advantage of a villain who unprovoked has endeavored to hurt him in his peace of mind and injure his reputation as an actor with the public  when mr rich gave me the note to read it perplexed me much but i immediately adverted to my very disagreeable situation when at drury lane and that i had given up every idea of offending the actors of covent garden that by the artifice of mr garrick and mr foot i was forced on the stage at drury lane in      against my own consent and requested mr rich further to observe that when my own benefits happened at drury lane in      and      not any actor whatever had been offended by any imitations or mimicry from me that my sole aim was levelled at mr foot for the illtreatment i had received from him and as a stronger proof i referred to my conduct in dublin the winter before where i had not created a single enemy by such behavior nor at my benefit the spring before at drury lane or offered any entertainment of the kind either from the desire of my friends the public or even to assist my own emolument on my late benefits in london which it certainly must be acknowledged it would have done and much to my advantage but i readily lessened my own profits rather than incur enmity i had in consequence of that consideration hoped that i had cleared myself from all intentional injury to mr sparks or other gentlemen this fully proved to my own mind for once in my life the good policy of having laid by imitative talents mr foot excepted all that time for had i kept publicly practicing those shining qualities as i judged them and though i was then certainly in great estimation while under the trammels of mr foot and mr garrick yet had i at the latter part of my time with him made too free with my brethren of the theaters very likely i should not have stood any chance of rising again in london hastily or have been ever received at covent garden theater indeed i might have subsisted on mr garricks flaps of the shoulders of mutton but like poor jrry sneak not have got a bit of the brown my reasons to mr rich worked as palliatives in my behalf and had much weight with him he sent for sparks and in his manner related to him what mr williamskin had said sparks in a short time was cool and pacified and said on the whole it appeared perfectly clear that the young man was not so much to blame as he had supposed that it was apparent wilkinson had not received any reward or gratuity for what he had done from either of his masters foot or garrick but on the contrary they had been guilty of meanness and ingratitude and sparks concluded with not only his declared acceptance of the part but offered every assistance to the rehearsals to aid and bring the minor forward for its being levelled as a stroke at foot tickled sparks as gratifying his ancient grudge though mr footes acquaintance was universal yet as all knew he spared neither friend nor foe there could not be the least reason to apprehend a shadow of resentment from the audience by any attack of mimicry played on mr foot himself from any opponent as mr foot attacked every body and like drawcansir might have said to his friends  i huff i bluff i strut look big and stare and this i do because  i dare i dare   a most intimate friend of mr footes wrote to me the following lines on my being displeased and is a strong likeness  mr wilkinson you should have known him better long before this time of day then you would have looked upon him as a peculiar man with such gifts of originality relative to men manners and places  whether he is in general right or wrong i will not pretend to say but i will give you this as my own opinion that if he is wrong it is difficult to dispute with him and when he is right it is impossible to answer him    peace being settled and myself one of the covent garden company foot soon got intelligence from spies in our royal camp of what was going forward he was much enraged and not having forgiven my freedoms with him at dublin the winter before he thought i pursued him like his evil spirit and one morning when i was sitting at the grand levee at mr richs with my new friend sparks in council of war we were alarmed with a thundering rattat and ringing of the bell also when a servant announced mr foot was come to wait on mr rich and instead of being ushered into the grand saloon he had been shown into the parlour  mr rich went down to mr footseye as he called him but the visit was not accompanied by a calm for it was most violent blustering and boisterous mr foot furiously exclaimed  damn it you old hound if you dare let wilkinson that pug nosed son of a b  h take any liberty with me as to mimicry i will bring you yourself rich on the stage if you want to engage that pug black his face and let him hand the teakettle in a pantomime for damn the fellow he is as ignorant as a whores maid and if he dares to appear in my characters in the minor i will said foot instantly produce your old stupid ridiculous self with your three cats and your hound of a mimic altogether next week at drury lane for the general diversion of the pit boxes and galleries and that will be paying you you squinting old hecate too great a compliment and after a few sarcasms foot hastily departed denouncing vengeance on him and his cats and immediately mr rich appeared with a most woeful countenance and said why muster sparkish muster footseye has been here and he says if i let muster williamskin act his parts on the stage muster sparkish he will write parts for me my cats and muster williamskin and bring us all upon the stage so we must not act at we intended why surely sir said sparks you cannot be so weak as to let mr footes apouring visit frighten y u from your purpose or intimidate you from having a piece acted that may be of service to your theater and to the young gntleman is it not truly strange and laughable that mr foot of all people should confess himself galled and exert his wit against mimicry  he who has been for years an universal torturer and spoiler of private peace from the licentious liberties he has taken now mr rich added sparks let me interest myself in this matter i augur success therefore let us of coventgardentheatre immediately rally our forces take the field let slip the dogs of war and act the minor in defiance of his own guards at drury lane rich agreed seemed pleased  but he was still frightened of foot and i believe dreaded an affront on his favorite cat more than on himself all was settled to have the performance brought forward as soon as possible for as sparks observed  advantage fed them fat while we delayed indeed the minor was ready at drury lane and they meant not to lose time for foot entertained not the least doubt of victory  we from various obstacles could not get it decently on the stage in less than a fortnight as other pieces were preparing such as mr macklins new comedy of the married libertine his lovealamode and mr beard and miss brent were rehearsing dr arnes new opera of thomas and sally which all considered made it seem difficult to get our minor produced and on the end of the week that this matter had been settled it was advertised on the thursday from drury lane and on the saturday was pasted on every wall  the minor and that favorite little comedy had been all the week puffed and paragraphed in every newspaper by mr foot but unforeseen events sometimes do and undo what our utmost wisdom and wishes cannot as here was an extraordinary instance for the bills were but a few hours exhibited to public view when it so happened they were as hastily plucked down as they had been vigilantly put up it was on saturday the   th of october    0 when the sudden death of our truly beloved and lamented monarch king george ii occasioned for three weeks a suspension of theatrical hostilities and diversions of all kinds in the great city of london and  eriously wish abstracted from self some alleviation could be considered for a truly loyal set of people the actors on such a melancholy occasion for though it is undeniable that every attention and grateful demeanor should be indispensibly observed on such an awful stroke and that a hoity tity following f diversions would be highly improper and that every duty to such solemnty is due yet t certainly falls cruelly on the poor player i reverence and love my king my prince and my country as the most faithful subject in his majestys dominions yet at such really mournful times the poor player in a middling class who struts his life upon the stage is certainly destitute of daily bread becomes distressed and absolutely reduced to being a charitydependent where the weekly stipend had been merely an existence and too likely if encumbered with a family plunged into debt and future misery it may easily be credited that whenever such a calamity happens and which in the course of nature must happen many are not in possession of a shilling it is even a hardship to those who possess economy which some actors and actresses to their great credit and good sense do as mr robertson formerly of the york company is an instance and an honor as a man and actor to mention and several others whose incomes have been very confined  now as a good subject my stock was truly great on the sudden surprise and loss of my monarch whose name i had prattled from childhood  monarchs sages peasants must follow thee and come to dust   my own situation at that time did not suffer as tha  od i possessed every needful requisite then to render life happy and every way agreeable so the theater being closed for a few weeks was not any inconvenience to my particular self but the poor actor at such a time must be rejoiced if the landlord is in good humor and will chak up instead of receiving cash but then the day of retribution must and will appear in black and white  thus comes the reckoning when the banquets over   it so happened and came to pass during that serious vacation that the minor was brought to maturity at covent garden theater and what is more extraordinary by the indefatigable attention and eagerness of mr sparks  once my mortal foe   when drury lane again opened the first saturday they published the minor with mr foot etc i posted myself in the gallery mr foot was received as usual with great eclat by a most brilliant and crowded audience that comedy being in as much vogue then or more so than any favorite piece at the present day of    0 the run and rage of the school for scandal and duenna being now over  when the comedy was finished i hastened to covent garden and urged mr rich to produce the minor as soon as possible when mr dyer who was to act the part of sir george and who was the particular intimate of sparks judged it a political stroke to give out that iece for the monday following and though the lay before intended had been given out we preailed on mr rich and the minor was announed as by particular desire for the monday mr footes characters of shift smirk mrs cole and the epilogue by mr wilkinson it was not only honored with an overflowing heatre but had a very great reception and it had a considerable run and in that puff i had the dvantage for mr richs new matters were not eady for representation therefore i was the more wanted  mr foot shared the profits of his nights performance for that reason therefore if garrick had any thing strong to advertise or wished to play himself mr foot was obliged to give way on the second night of my performance mr rich at the end of the minor brought an article for me to sign accompanied by mr wood his soninlaw an attorney the purport was one hundred guineas for playing till the first of january and a benefit when i chose to appoint it it was a very genteel offer as my benefit considered made it of real consequence to me and of course the proposal was by me accepted signed and sealed on the first night in the perormance of shift i broke loose into my imitative qualities which i had not practiced as to actors in london for two years  mossop had but the year before gone to ireland he was very peculiar very popular and well recollected i was very like him indeed and was obliged to repeat his speeches of zaphimri in the orphan of china  to prove what odd mortals we are as to our love and our hate sparks who i related as formerly to have been my professed enemy was now turned to the other extreme and was my hearty wellwisher on my leaving the stage as shift he took me fast by the hand and wished me joy and burst out into a violent fit of laughing  says i mr sparks what are you laughing at why replied he i am laughing at myself sir for two years ago i was bloody angry at you for the carrying me into company where i was not yet your imitation of mossop was so strong that i was irresistibly pleased whether i would or no so i am laughing at my own absurdity those imitations having been bottled up by me so long had then double the effect and made shift a star in the minor  my introduction in the character of foot was truly foot from top to toe and as to mr garrick i made no scruple though i had him before me as his curiosity had led him to see me not expecting that i would take him off or he would not have been so publicly surrounded but have carefully avoided such a queer situation my imitations were never told either in bill or newspaper who they were designed for but whenever i was particularly lucky the audience would repeat the name as sparks sparks barry barry nor was i a little pleased when repeating from macbeth who can be wise amazed etc i heard the audience echo from one to the other o garrick garrick  o thought i my master this is my day of triumph  and from that night he never forgave or forgot his being so surrounded in the front box nor did he ever speak to me again to the day of his death  my whitfield was beyond compare his manner was then universally known  mr foot was struck by stepping in by chance and once hearing whitfield the mixture of whose absurdity whim consequence and extravagance pleased his fancy and entertained him highly as whitfield that day was dealing out damnation fire and brimstone as cheerfully as if they were so many blessings what pity it is that our fears only and not our reason will bring conviction but reason handed by unaffected pure piety and religion would be a day of woe to methodism and lessen their audiences in many tabernacles where they are certain to lament preaching to nobody though at the same time wedged to the outer doors and on the sunday exclaiming at the full crowded theaters which have probably been almost deserted but mr foot was only a spy at whitfields academy while i had been a zealot for some seasons before my encounter at covent garden with mr foot my attendance had been constant with my friend shuter and as he actually was one of the newborn and paid large sums to whitfield i was always permitted to stay with him for he really was bewildered in his brain more by wishing to acquire imaginary grace than by all his drinking and whenever he was warm with the bottle and with only a friend or two like mawworm he could not mind his shop because he thouht it a sin and wishead to go a preaching for shuter like mawworm believed he had had a call i have gone with shuter at six in the morning of a sunday to tottenhamcourtroad then before ten to mr wesleys in longacre at eleven again to tottenhamcourtroad tabernacle dined near bedlam in moorfields a very proper place for us both with a party of the hoy ones went at three to mr wesleys theater there the tabernacle  mean from that to whitfie ds in moorfields till eight and then shut up to commune with the familycompact now with all this practice and attention and with my natural talents i must have been a blockhead indeed not to have gleaned some good things and doubtless mr whitfield was at times a good preacher and truly excellent i therefore really exhibited and obtained a much stronger likeness as dr squintum than mr foot did the week before my covent garden exhibition i met my friend shuter at the tabernacle a great coolness had continued for some time as we had not spoke to or even looked at each other since the breach between us in the year      but as we were met together in a place of charity and forgiveness to all who subscribed to the dictator we became very sociable and before the conclusion of whitfields lecture were perfectly reconciled we adjourned to the rose and by three the next morning were sworn friends and continued so till death called him away  ndeed he was above eleven years older than me and would have been sixtythree had he lived to this time ned shuter was a lively spirited shrewd companion superior natural whim and humor surely never inhabited a human breast for what he said and did was all his own as it was with difficulty he could read the parts he had to play and could not write at all he had attained to sign an order but no more nature could not have bestowed her gifts to greater advantage than on poor ned as what she gave he made shine not only conspicuously but brilliantly and that to the delight of all who knew him on or off the stage  he might be truly dubbed the child of nature  he was no mans enemy but his own peace rest and happiness i hope he now possesses  for the poor the friendless and the stranger he often comforted and when sometimes reduced by his follies he never could see a real object in misery and resist giving at least half he was worth to his distressed fellow creature  my popularity that year of the minor was such that my acquaintance i might truly term universal my benefit was the week before christmas and was not only crowded but honorably attended which put my finances into a most respectable accumulation though my free living from place to place was very expensive and indeed extravagant  yet the reader is to observe my benefits in general were all free from any charges and were what we on the stage term clear benefits and my night being numerously attended in the middle of a winter season in such a metropolis as london cannot be judged a phaenoenon  that season at covent garden theater the day after acting the character of mr foot in the introdution to the minor i received an anonymous letter and recollected the same sentiments had been conveyed to me in the like manner three seasons before after my benefitnight at drury lane on taking off mr foot as himself not as an actor on the stage the contents were nearly as follows  to mr wilkinson sir though your imitation of mr foot last night was certainly great yet your twitching your chin with tweezers was very wrong though well conceived but on the stage it was a blemish and not any advantage to your imitation for you should consider the audience are only judges of mr footes public stage performance and not of how he acts or speaks when in his own house and with his acquaintance and particular intimates  therefore omit those peculiarities of mr footes and you will not lose but increase your reputation with the town and the good opinion of  sir your wellwisher a z     these two notes i often considered as the remark was so just though i had not paid obedience to the first and made me guess from that time to the present that they proceeded from the secret good wishes and knowledge of mr murphy who was often on parties at mr footes and knew what i meant when the public did not  whether it was to him i was obliged or no he best can tell if he did it may have escaped his memory and he may not recollect so trivial a circumstance as it did not relate to himself why i take the wisdom to myself of thinking the letters came from mr murphy who had behaved very kindly to me is that in      on my benefit night at drury lane as i was acting the character of mr foot he mr murphy was sitting in the orchestra and as i grew elated with applause and feeling to myself that all i did was right i too often made use of a particular word which mr foot thoughtlessly and from custom often repeated laughingly in his own room in common conversation it was a word foolish and indelicate and by no means fit to be presumptuously or ignorantly mentioned in a public theater and i had never thought as to the meaning but was i declare most perfectly innocent of it and from my rapidty of speech the audience luckily indeed for me did not attend to it any more than myslf  and as mr sherdans  the critic says the players never know when to have done with a good thing so did i often repeat this unfit word before a most respectable audience i saw mr murphy in the orchestra enjoying my performance and applauding which gave me double vigor when on a sudden he started up and i lost from the situation full before me him whom i had seen in such high humor therefore i feared something was very wrong but what i could not divine  but i do suppose what i said so repeatedly had frightened him from his pleasant seat  luckily for me the loud laughter and applause drowned the senses or i might have seen more decampments or myself have been ordered so to do and i am certain had i been at that time disgraced i should not have known for why but all went off to my excess of joy and when i saw mr murphy some days after he kindly explained what had drove him from his place as he declared he trembled for me and gave me at the same time proper information sufficient to rectify my error and improve my breeding without need of johnsons dictionary for further knowledge this is a lesson for all imitations to be confined entirely to the modes and manners only with which the audience are acquainted for the private manners in life of mr garrick or mr anybody they are neither familiarized to nor in the least acquainted with therefore foolish to add by way of garnish as what might please in a private circle with information will naturally lessen the merit of the mimicry or satire instead of increasing it with the public and indeed it must be allowed as unmannerly as mean and on no account worthy forgiveness were it tolerated to rehearse private foibles manners and conversation on a public stage  my friendly reader i fear will be apt to shrink and think i have been too liberal in praising and loading myself with encomiums relative to my applause and reputation in london in    0 as a rival in point of mimicry in the public estimation when opposed to mr foot but i really aver and believe i have not exceeded the strict bounds of truth as to the exactitude of time and place i am persuaded this olio will stand foremost of almost any produced self is generally partial and i am obliged to be the herald of my own praises for shakspeare says  if a man will not erect his own tombstone ere he dies his memory shall liv no longer than his knell rings and his widow weeps  how long is that an hour in clamor and a quarter in reum and so much for praising myself who i mself will bear witness am praiseworthy  indeed i can mention several persons still living who can attest every particular i am sorry to say not so many as i could wish as most of my sincere friends and benefactors ar now no more  as a true imitator i stood before mr foot in the public eye for though he drew characters strongly yet his manners in point of likeness were not strictly just besides my partial friends of that time who cannot now come when they are called and for all i know may now be spirits in the vasty deep yet as theatrical and honorable vouchers i refr to mr macklin and mr murphy who will not i trust deny they often told me i was in some particular imitations incomparable and i was too well bred then and now to contradict their favorable opinions but verily think they were good judges and spoke only the truth mr macklin has often acted by me as a particular kind friend and to him i am in debt for many obligations of tender regard paid to my juvenile years and since and as i never made him any equal return confess myself his obliged and grateful debtor mr murphy i have not the satisfaction or pleasure to call an intimate or even common acquaintance my frequent laughs with him at that distant juncture of time were chiefly occasioned by my often meeting him on parties at mr footes and at the new exchange coffeehouse but mr macklin and i have often met in dublin sometimes in the same theater sometimes in our different ships of war and meet him where i would i cannot but remember civilities not only to me but to any friend i took in my hand to introduce to him  with a full purse a stock of health and plenty of good friends my covent garden engagement ended after which i soiled till passionweek drew near  a week that occasions the players never to forget it is a religious one though their superiors may not have the same feeling occasion to rub up their memories but every player and playeress can recollect that week without a prompter  mr garrick as i before observed continued obdurate but thank god i neither wanted his forgiveness nor his favors as a manager  early in march i was favored with a letter from my good friend mrs strode at portsmouth informing me that a world of people were expected there as a grand expedition was preparing against the french and the number of officers and subalterns both of army and navy would be incredible jut before aster that there were no plays going forward nor any diversions whatever and if i could but hit on any entertainment it would turn out lucrative to me and be received as a compliment to the town and all my friends and acquaintance i made proper inquiries on receiving this pleasing intelligence and heard every thing mrs strode had mentioned in a manner so friendly soon confirmed now the love of money added to the allurement of wandering seemed to me irresistible i knew nothing could be done there in passionweek though i might prepare for the ensuing holidays but did not conceive how to manage and contrive without an able assistant mrs strode at my request procured the theater against my arrival but one auxiliary at least became indispensably necessary  i mentioned the matter to my laughing whimsical friend joseph austin who liked a frolic as well as myself i therefore did not hesitate a moment as to whom i should impart my perplexity to him i related my newfangled scheme and want of assistance also laid before him the glaring temptations of army officers etc and proposed terms of agreement without a pause our wise heads settled it immediately and that we might be more sure of attractive merit joseph clapped in his lady as a third performer a very pretty woman into the chaise and on palm sunday we sat down to supper at portsmouth we found the playhouse as the company of comedians had left it a mere wreck they had torn away all traces of its former self  all little ornaments of what it ought to have been  having removed all the wings and agged scenery for their more remote theaters with juliets tomb and balcony even desdemonas bed had been seized by the hands of filthy dungeon villains and thrown amongst the common lumber and conveyed in their baggagecart at portsmouth to their fortress at plymouth themselves having a long and heavy winter march and indeed i fear the greatest part of that theatrical army were obliged on the expedition to use their legs instead of carriages to obtain safe footing at their distant devoshire encampment which proves the truth of the old proverb  one half the world knows not how the other half live  my friend joseph and i had a most whimsical entertaining week i am sure he never can forget it as it consisted of oddity and may freakish occurrences from ten till two at noon we were busily employed with plaistering paper on laths for our wings and filling up the back part of the stage with something like what we term a flat scene indeed we had a carpenter but joseph and tate were the principal workmen before the week was expired our playhouse was prepared for the receiving a most splendid audience with which we were honored even our stage was crowded and produced the best back flat scene i ever saw which well paid us for our industry we were not only gratified with the great house being lucrative and fashionable but we were still more flattered and pleased by a desire of a second night and with the assurance of good support for my own part i had been so fettered and confined while articled by mr garrick that i was rejoiced at being what i liked to be and ever will be if i can free as air that by choice shall ever be my motto therefore the second night was palatable and quite agreeable to me but here a difficulty arose i had engaged to perform for my friend shuters benefit on thursday march    and that promise without breach of word honor or friendship was easy and practicable as time would just allow it and not any to spare but my trepanned friend joseph on this smuggled expedition was likely to be tried for offenses at the grand court of drury by judge garrick a severe judge who would demand his bond as joseph had actually engaged to play the wednesday night march    a new part wrote by mrs clive for her own benefit who at writing was as may with justice be equally said of myself a dead good one however he was very happy and temptation lay before him  so fell adam  so fell joseph though he has not the least relationship to joseph the bashful  notwithstanding his perilous situation he yielded to entreaty though he foresaw and dreaded the inevitable storm we performed much the same kind of jumbled incoherent entertainment as we had done on the first night we had a full house on the tuesday and soon after supper that night my friend joseph austin set off with his lady for london and left me behind to settle all bills etc for our private and public expenditure my friend got to london in a whole skin but too late for his part and indeed he had been so laden the week before with state affairs upon his head and shoulders that had he been there a day sooner i do not suppose he had studied sufficiently to have known a sentence  the lamentable consequence to mrs bays or rather dame clive was her being obliged to submit to change her new farce or have an apology made for the part to be read  which i understood was kindly undertaken by mr packer but am not certain however the piece was unfortunately d  d and the dreadful doom of it she attributed entirely to the neglective and audacious behavior of that impudent austin it enraged that truly comical lady on the stage only to the highest pitch of fury not ceres with her torch set the fields of corn on fire with more eager fantastic fury than she would have at that instant sacrificed even the high priest of the ynagogue garrick himself could she have dragged him to her altar of revenge but such divinity surrounds a king that he escaped her vengeance by a secure and speedy retreat and if truth may be spoken i am inclined to think on this matter he was more indebted to flight than his divinityship for safety as be it known though our monarch garrick used to be lordly and managerial over great and small yet dame clive like the welsh was never subdued  indeed the great little man dreaded her as an instance  i remember one night while i had the honor to appertain to drury lane theater lethe was to be acted by desire of several persons of distinction the bill run thus a dramatic satire called lethe  the new character of lord chalkstone by mr garrick and not any other performers mentioned not even woodwards or yatess  mrs clives part was the fine lady  there were several actors of merit in the piece but whether it had been printed in that manner by design or accident i know not as playbills published daily must be liable to errors even though mr kemble was the manager madam clive at noon came to the theater and furiously rung the alarm bell for her name being omitted was an offense she construed so heinous that nothing but vengeance and blood blood iago was the word and it was no more strange than true that garrick ever feared to meet that female spirit perhaps mr cross the prompter might think garricks name was allsufficient but her not seeing in the bill the fine lady by mrs clive was so unpardonable an offense that could she have got near him and he had been severe in his replies i dare say she would have deranged king davids wig and dress as adorned for lord chalkstone which would have disconcerted him much mrs clive was a mixture of combustibles  she was passionate cross vulgar yet sensible and a very generous woman and as a comic actress of genuine worth  indeed indeed she was a diamond of the first water  when her scene of the fine lady came on she was received with the usual expression of gladness on her approach as so charming an actress truly deserved and her song from the italian opera where she was free with a good ridiculous imitation of signora mingotti who was the darling favorite at the kings theater and admired by all the amaturs  she was universally encored and came off the stage much sweetened in temper and manners from her first going on  aye says she in triumph that artful devil could not hurt me with the town though he had struck my name out of the bills she laughed and joked about her late illhumour as if she could have kissed all around her though that happiness was not granted but was willingly excused and what added to her applause was her inward joy triumph and satisfaction in finding the little great man was afraid to meet her and which was of all consolations the greatest not our brave rodney could feel more pride or glory on the french admiral de grass delivering up his sword to him than madam clive did in the idea of her subduing garrick the valiant boadicia never hurled her spear with more furor than clive that amazonian thalestris of drury lane theater pursued that great general garrick whenever he offended her indeed the whole greenroom dreaded her frowns she was the original and quite at home when in the coblers wife in the devil to pay and always proved that poor nell had a great soul indeed to those who approached her door in misery she supplied their wants and gave at once without pride or ostentation mr garrick alluded to mrs clive in nell and mrs pritchard in the queen in hamlet when he wrote and spoke the following lines the season that barry cibber quin and woffington united forces at covent garden  our ladies too with hands and tongues untamed fire up like britons when the battles named each female heart pants for the glorious strife from hamlets mother to the coblers wife so madam clive of whom i have been speaking so long when her farce was d  d as she could nor start that fox austin from his hiding place at last found mr garrick her darling prey whose curiosity had led him back to take a peep at the field of battle after beholding her farce and its fatal overthrow and had exultingly fat smiling at the tumult and enjoying the storm which gratified his spleen and indeed her works i believe were truly indifferent and would not have cut a much better figure in print than my own with this difference she professed ability i profess quite the contrary cry quarter and sue for mercy clive like the good housewife who sees a rat in the trap in the morning taken no sooner espied him than she fastened and the furious poetess bitterly and vehemently harangued her manager as abetting and aiding in a plot to sink her works to oblivion by being privy to austins having eloped and thereby destroying her fame the manager protested his innocence nay acted great ge denouncing severe and unheard of punishments on austin for certainly my friend joseph being absent from his royal duty and in a time of war was not to be defended and what added to his crime in mr garricks eye was that he had been with that infernal exotic wilkinson to whom he never granted absolution he d  d wilkinson he d  d foot and said lacey i say ecod we will have no more exotics at the theater and concluded with a determination to discard austin for he was at that time really angry and offended with him and much disapproved of his intimacy with me as his jealous fearful temper suggested austin who was in full confidence with him might give information now and then of the forbidden secrets of his prisonhouse he at length pacified clive convinced her he was not concerned in the plot and hoped to ee austin afflicted with tortures for what she had suffered that night from his neglect to which she attributed her favorite offspring being strangled in the birth mr garrick even soothed her into tolerable temper by assuring her that her arce was one of the most entertaining and best written pieces that had been produced for years her own acting had charmed him and he was mortified to think her misfortune in its disgrace was entirely wing to the unparalleled bad behavior of austin poor joe was obliged to face his master garrick in a few days and i believe received from him a very severe lecture attended i conjecture with a smarting fine he was also for some time banished the court of drury and his majesty o denmarks preence but luckily for cunning joseph mr garrick had interwoven his theatrical schemes and business so much with him that garrick found he could not without inconceiveable inconvenience conduct his multiplicity of affairs without josephs transacting the secret services in the cabinet for cross was grown old superannuated and unfit for his office as prompter etc and on weighing the scales with austin in one and his darling interest with the rupture in the other he found the balance was against himself he therefore with quick and wonted generosity graciously restored austin to favor at court and reinstated him in all his honors and movables of which he had been dispossessed  for two years he was really a slave to him nothing was right unless austin was consulted and by way of amends he would often honor him by publicly walking with him arm in arm chatting laughing etc with a small bribe for the day and a large promise for the morrow and i believe i may pronounce to a certainty he never in all his life made mr austin a genteel present or recompense for his trouble i have mentioned this on guess and if i am wrong in my assertion shall be happy to retract for i would not advance a falsehood for any advantage whatever and mr austin can easily in any newspaper contradict what i have asserted and inform us of mr garricks generosity mr austin is an instance of one who some time glowed under the sunshinebeams of court favor yet with all his dependence on the great man in hopes of independence he never could obtain his wishes and expectations for like the miser joseph wanted to to touch something real but was only paid as ramilie with forgiveness of all that had passed  at length wearied out mr austin was under the necessity of leaving his friends and country and seeking a refuge and asylum in old ireland he never more returned to his old master garrick  notwithstanding mr garricks oddities i always did and shall reverence respect and esteem him as the greatest actor the british stage has ever known from its first establishment to the present day but in other points i have only given the picture as it should be from the life with all its spots blemishes and beauties so my conscience may rest as certainly if my narrative respecting his treatment of myself be true there remains no call of any trait of mr garrick from my pen but justice  in dublin my old acquaintance austin and i often met and since that time as late manager of the newcastle theater but he has retired with ease an plenty  an enviable state whenever we do mee and want matter for conversation we need but recollect portsmouth mr garrick mrs clive and others  and as lady townly says we can make the prettiest sherbet aye and without too much lemon and to conclude with her ladyships words as to austin and myself i believe in my soul it will last as long as we live  mr garrick though attached to subordination was kept in order and decorum himself by our present ingenious writer counselor murphy that gentleman could teaze his soul and gall his gizzard whenever he pleased or judged himself wronged mr macklin my master garrick did not much love though formerly they were on a friendly footing but the drury palace gates against his irony were fast closed when barbarossa wrote by the late dr brown was produced garrick the first night entered after the fourth act in a glittering silverspangled tissue shape when mrs clive instead of court adulation cried out o my god room room make room for the royal lamplighter  which rudeness disconcerted him much for the remaining part of the evening and certainly it was too free and not well timed as he was tremblingly alive all over on the first night of a new part in a new play and it ertainly is a serious matter in london and a service of danger  before i arrived in town from portsmouth for shuters benefit mr arthur manager of the bath company came to that town on the plan of building a new theater there as the inhabitants much wished for a better and more regular company of performers mr arthur waited on me wished me joy on the success of my two nights public impromptu at portsmouth and as his friends who had encouraged his new undertaking wished to see me there again the ensuing summer he hoped it would turn out mutually agreeable and lucrative to himself and me  the matter was settled and agreed between us he then made another proposal for my playing ten nights that spring season at bath with a clear benefit  that was also agreed on and i left portsmouth and got to london on wednesday night march       0 and on thursday gave tea as i had proised for my friend shuters benefit and i may with great truth affirm with wonderful applause the approbation intoxicated me so much that the night following being in company with shuter and ballard the treasurer i consented to pour water on the leaves for his benefit early in may though i had engaged for bath and knew i was o incur the expense from thence to london and back again but my desire for applause increased my thirst it went down so deliciously that i was glad to cover that as an obligation which in fact i was pleased to be requested to do and thought no price i could pay equal to public approbation i did not then so well know the fickle changes of fortune as well as life  would i were young again  but let it go  a foolish figure farewell it  i arrived at bath well and without the least fatigue the next day i paid my respects to mr arthur also to mr ridout with a thousand compliments from mr rich who was unhappy at his illdeclining health calling him there and obliging him to quit covent garden theater to which place he never more returned he was the only man in whom mr rich placed any confidence or whose advice he would listen to mr ridout being prime minister he was of course bespattered with plenty of abuse but he like me and benedick cared not for a satire or an epigram  for if a man will let himself be beaten with brains he shall wear nothing handsome about him  ridout was extremely glad to see me at bath and when my benefit was advertised he sent me a letter desiring three box tickets and begged my acceptance of the enclosed three guineas with his best wishes and thanks for having so honorably kept my promise in      not to meddle with his manner of acting any night of my imitations at either of the london theaters the three guineas was meant it is true as a dcuceur and i had some ttle to accept the cash and not return it for i crtainly had deprived myself of a credit as to the imitation and i pin my faith more on mr macklins opinion than on my own merit for mr macklin when i last saw him declared i had taken such exact measure of mr ridout that my likeness of him was my masterpiece at bath he died  when i saw him there he appeared in a weak languid state not in immediate danger  but who can control his fate i so flylike mr aircastle myself from one point to another that i can apologize but cannot help being incoherent  bath was then certainly a pleasing spot  now i am told and it is well known that city has increased at an incredible rate of elegance to the astonishment and admiration of all europe in that city mr keasberry treated me with my first dinner and i was particularly lucky by unexpectedly meeting with an unthoughof blessing for in a few hours after my name had been published o richard the third i was surprised with the agreeable pleasure of receiving cards from my ever dear remembered friends and patrons mr and mrs chaigneau and mrs forbes and some others from ireland  a most happy intelligence indeed for me abstracted from interest bath was at that time and still continues a place of constant fashionable and friendly resort of persons of quality and fortune from the kingdom of ireland it was in truth a fortunate circumstance as they immediately introduced me not only to a genteel but fashionable resort of friends who were of the utmost service in fixing my reputation as a public performer amongst all the circle of their acquaintance besides the certain allowed credit convenience and selfsatisfaction on my bath onset as an actor to have such eligible and esteemed places to dine at and be received as a particular friend and visitant at mr chaigneaus in gaystreet and mrs forbess in queensquare etc i played a variety of characters there and it would be tedious and fulsome to repeat the favors i received every person i knew consulted to make me happy my benefit was on monday april          confederacy the play with tea and the farce of the guardian  i acted mrs amlet and the guardian with tea and in the course of my playing i acted richard lear hamlet and shylock  parts in the minor cadwallader petruchio etc my benefit was honored with so great a demand for places that the whole pit was laid into the boxes a circumstance which had not been often instanced a large party with the late lord clive were that night contented with places in the pit indeed a theater is such a strange place that the seat which is fashionable one night is horrid another for sometimes if only the first rows of the sideboxes are taken the cry is not a place to be had in the boxes every seat is let the frontboxes if mrs siddons acts are called good places and acknowledged as they truly are to be the best seats in the house for seeing a play but on any night if not wishing to be at the theater and yet wanting an excuse to stay away the cry is it is horrid  it is a bore  who can sit in the frontboxes those giblet pies  when my nights with mr arthur were expired i had engaged to perform lady pentweazle and cadwallader for his benefit on monday may   but mr ballard the covent garden treasurer with shuters summons advertised me in the london papers according to my promise therefor i could not be excused being so indispensably under an honorable contract to make my appearance in london and was obliged to quit bath on saturday may   and took postchaise for the urpose on sunday noon i unexpectedly met a party of friends at hounslow where i spent a cheerful day and got safe to london in the evening and was ready to fulfill my duty and promised faith on monday night before i left bath i had agreed to return the thursday following may the  th to perform for the benefit of mr keasberry  the monday night i was in london i had not leisure to see any friend whatevr but was pleasing myself with the thoughts of what vast and uncommon appluse i should be favored with the next night for my honeydraught on shuters benefit had bee a great inducement for my incurring the expense of such a post journey i have often heard mr foot declare that the change of weather had an effect upon the tempers of the audiences and also to a certainty it acted differently with the performers as to their spirits etc the truth of these oservations i cannot take upon me to determine but leave it to the doctors and wiser heads every frequenter of a theater must have at times been insensibly led to observe that with the same actors in the same piece and in the same theater the reception whether it was the weather the audience or their own dullness has been widely opposite if the audience is not in humor the performer let him go on in his best spirits will flag but on the contrary if the audience is in great good humor and the players flat and insipid they will catch the fire like electricity and though the performers went on the stage even in bad health and spirits they will be transformed and all alert forget their illness be new vigoured become what each wishes to personate in the assumed character  each bosoms lord sits lightly on its throne and all that night an unaccustomed spirit lifts them above the ground with cheerful thoughts so i on the day of ballards benefit like mrs heidleburgh longed for the rencounter and was as usual well received and i was determined to get applause by giving much more in quantity than what i had done for shuters benefit  an ignorant zeal that like shakspeares dogberry had it been ten times more i would have bestowed all my tediousness on their worships but alas alas before i had gone half a stage with my ic lecture my numerous auditory appeared to be sleepy and tired now whether it was as mr  had observed the weather the drowsiness f the audience or from what other chain of  i cannot tell but i rather believe it was  ing to a jumble of bad materials with a dou e quantity of my own insipidity intermixed one cumstance i reember perfectly which was i thought it would never have been over without supernatural aid or a ghost to tell me so  and i am certain my hearers thought so too but as it is often said it is a long lane that has no turning so at last the conclusion did come and two or three friends at the lower end of the hall gave a hand or two the upper part of the building i believe gave a different kind of token therefore i did not take the vantage of those few at the lower end and stay to cry thanks gentle citizens and friends etc but even then took off and made my exit  ballards benefit was composed of all sorts of the lower order of people from every distant quarer of london the greatest part of whom perhaps did not see three plays in a year and my imitations were as little understood by the redcloaked ladies in the frontboxes as when i gave tea at norwich in fact it was as hamlet says  caviare to the multitude so i poor pilgarlick had treated myself with a postchaise jaunt of one hundred miles from bath to london and to return back and all for a bill which my vanity had drawn upon the bank of folly the which had no stability and was not fit to be trusted as it was protested and returned back on my hands to my own shame and disgrace this is true  but not without a good lesson for young peoples improvement and future observation  and i consoled myself with never in future playing at hazard for the chance of applause only without the pecunia where there were such odds against me i returned to bath and was on the stage on thursday may   on mr keasberrys night and when there had plenty of spawwater very easily purchased to quench my thirst for applause when i wanted more than i deserved  not but the longing desire of applause is a good incentive to excite spirit and emulation in every young performer for without ambition few would encounter such various and almost insurmountable difficulties as attend a theater i remember miss nossiters saying in the greenroom that all of the theatrical profession should be blessed with more than common philosophy that we should possess that said serenity i agree to be a right observation but am far from thinking we are in any great degree honored with its attendanc as a constant companion in general we have something like an equivalent and that is great spirits which glides over little misfortunes evil tongues and disappointments easier than with mankind in general and good spirits create ease and happiness and like death and the dice levels all distinctions   who would bear the whips and scorns of the time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely and  merit of the unworthy takes   while at bath i was solicited to perform for almost every benefit i most willingly complied and ted away most furiously without fee or reward so was in no danger of suffering on the vag   the two last plays were hamlet and richard the third the first for the benefit of mr williames termed the ancient carpenter on friday june        and the last for mr wooley the painter monday june    the farce was hob in the will in which mr wooley appeared in the character of hob  the reason for my being so particular as to the days months and years on trifles not worth doubting is that it helps as a reference to the professed plan with which i set out and to make good my assertions with those now living who might think it worth while either to corroborate or contradict my relation of facts with the strictest observance of time and place  from thence i lounged at winchester until the new theater at portsmouth building under mr arthurs inspection was ready for the reception of the bath company at that time under his direction where i resorted according to beat of drum and marching orders on the  st of july but when i saw the desolate state of the building i judged it impracticable for its wide extended walls to have a play enacted that good year of our lord however arthur was indefatigable slow and sure and in so short a time as monday july  0 hamlet was announced for opening our new theater with the farce of the contrivances  hamlet mr wilkinson polonius mr arthur hoatia mr keasberry the queen mrs lee  mrs lee was wife to the late mr lee and mother to the present miss lees of bath one wrote the pleasant comedy of the chapter of accidents and the other that entertaining and welldrawn romance of the recess mr lee was well known in london as an actor of merit at drury lane and covent garden also as manager and performer at edinburgh and bath but some dispute had happened about a year before i was at bath between mr lee and mr palmer the bath proprietor which not being amicably settled mr lee withdrew but she very sensibly not having given any cause for complaint desired to be retained  our new grand theater at noon on the  0th of july had not the least appearance of being fit to be opened that night either before or behind the curtain  the whole company were of that opinion but great men will overcome obstacles and the wonderworking incomparable arthur despised difficulties at twelve oclock at noon there was not one seat in the pit but he actually contrived to get it finished by seven not any rehearsal was possible as the stage was up to ones waist in shavings the populace were eager to see the new playhouse new company and the first acted play but on traversing the streets from four till seven and no admittance they became very noisy the sailors particularly unruly when into the street popped our old cross commander in chief admiral arthur  not like his advertised character of polonius but more resembling one of the witches in macbeth for he had on an old round flapped hat a womans checked apron with a large broom in his hand and his face as begrimed and greasy as a barnacting othello in the dog days he harangued the multitude high and low and humbly beseeched their patience while himself and the hardlaboured carpenters assisted in sweeping the shavings out of the pit and gallery he received a good hooting with a laugh and retired to make his words good by deeds and hecatelike he sweated and swept most violently till the word without was given as their impatience was beyond bounds the doors were burst open the witch and her stick were thrown down and rolled over and over the broom had no other charms or spells than to assist the cripple to hobble out and escape with all possible expedition there were no persons ready or offices fixed to take the money so each sailor and his lass or his companion and others seated themselves in such places as suited their fancies but arthur to show his humbleness acted as a wary and careful manager for without putting off his apron as soon as the house had filled and all were a little quiet and seated in the midst of a cloud of dust he doffed his old brown hat and went profoundly round the theater to collect in it from every part what he could either by threats or civility obtain some did pay others did not and some only what they pleased nor would he have stirred till twelve at night whilst he beheld the glimpse of another dropping shilling to have paid for their forciblyobtained footing when he had finished that difficult job he retired to what was absolutely requisite soap and sand and in about an hour more the hour of nine we proceeded on with our solemnity mr arthur was transformed  a long old periwig and a sumptuous suit of clothes gracing his person for polonius a part which he had often performed in london and acted truly well but the lamps and candles having been loaded with the immensity of our kindred dust from hecate the managers outrageous sweepings had occasioned such a mist and violent heat on the audiencepart of the theater on the stage behind the scenes and had dispersed such an universal melancholy gloom as i never can forget  every one of the performers and the wellwarmed nay i may say nearly parched spectators became reflectors of burning eat to each other and were almost literally sorched on that nights dangerous undertaking for my own part i judged i should make my exit as a great man being no less a personage than the prince of denmark and recollecting the old womens adage that a man must swallow a peck of dust r he dies i concluded my time was come as i y my own suggestion fancied i must that night have gped that ata quantity  however it is evident i survived that suffocation in three or four nights after our little theater was really an elegant wellapproved and fashionable place of resort far different from what the families of portsmouth had ever then experienced in point of grandeur comfort or regularity or as a respectable company of comedins  indeed i do not suppose mr arthur would have opened the theater in this strange inconvenient and contemptuus condition but from a particular circumstance which was that the  0th of july d on to the portsmouth annual mart a week of general resort for all sorts of people that assembled yearly to purchase toys ribands flippets etc therefore had he lost that advantage he would have missed the capital prize in his theatrical lottery it was still the time not only of hostility with france but an honorable successful and as glorious a war as any the british annals can boast  though as to war at portsmouth the creed of the inhabitants is easily understood by the words of kate matchlock in the funeral who says o rare news we are going to have a war and a wars a war no matter whether abroad or at home  so in fact war is the only manufactory of portsmouth and plymouth  and of course that war continuing added much to our good fortune and was the happy work of more lucky hances we were soon opposed by the old plymouth company of comedians at the old theater the ragged regiment i have so often mentioned but their theater was so dirty their conduct so irregular that they were generally viewed as a vulgar dramdrinking set when compared to our decent demeanor and truly creditable appearance therefore we were honorably termed the quality company our house had many advantages not only as to elegance but was more commodious and cool with good wardrobe scenery etc  my night was on monday september    and was greatly attended as a proof i believe it was the best in our whole successful season tamerlane with the upholsterer  i acted bajazet the first scene of sir archy bucks have at ye all with pamphlet and razor  our campaign ended without any particular occurrences on monday october         with henry viii and the coronation it was acted two nights after the benefits were over woley wilkinson gardener arthur cranmer keasberry henry stephens the buttonmaker once famous as othello in london anna bullen miss reynolds late mrs saunders who acted the country girl when it was altered at mr garricks desire some years ago by mr bickerstaff queen katherine mrs baker  mrs baker was a woman of strong understanding aided by a good and highly finished education wonderful natural abilities and an actress of great capacity and she had performed three or four parts at covent garden where they could not deny she possessed much merit her features were very good but her figure was short clumsey and against her in many parts which otherwise she was well calculated for if a line had been drawn of competitorship the first of that or the present day would have shrunk in the debate as to comprehension and real understanding and yielded to her courtesey use is of greater importance than the london or any other audience are aware of  mrs pritchard was a striking instance who with a large figure was esteemed the best rosalind though mrs woffington the beautiful was her opponent  prejudice for some time prevailed much against mrs baker at york where she acted during the races in august      and one winter      but at the latter part of the season she surmounted those prejudices at edinburgh where she resided some years she was in universal esteem as an actress but on a quarrel with mr digges for her temper was soon ruffled and she was too apt to rush into the different exremes of love and hate she hastily quitted the stage and there undertook the difficult task of teaching the english pronunciation for which she was not only capable but thoroughly qualified in so doing she received great promises and what was better great emoluments all which increased instead of being diminished she was received as a guest of knowledge and entertaining livly conversation at the first tables in edinburgh which honors at that city would never without talents have been conferred her last performance at portsmouth was in queen katherine  the coronation to henry viii had double effect from being well timed his present majesty king george iii having been crowned on tuesday sept    on that day most of the hampshire world assembled for those that could not be in london flocked to portsmouth and there beheld at noon a glorious sight indeed several of our noblest ships of war dressed in their colors all the officers of their separate denominations decked out in their full uniforms and every person both high and low in their holiday clothes  whilst all the cannon from the ramparts and shipping as also from the castle on south sea common were echoing and re echoing resounding thunder with such a delightful confusion of noise as sir callaghan o brallaghan says that i can no more attempt to give an account of it than to tell the stars in the sky that heavenly sight was greatly heightened by the additional illumination of apollo who had mounted his fiery steeds and the sun beamed most brilliantly and haied one of the most auspicious and splendid days that ever blessed our nation almost every reader knows that the prospect from the ramparts at portsmouth to the isle of wght is one of the most delightful in the kingdom the coronation being the general topic added not a little to curiosity and attraction for our henry viii on that evening and the play was highly approved by a full audience  i must not omit before i quit hampshire to mention that early in august      mr lee had hired a banditti set of actors to perform at winchester every saturday for a few weeks a camp being there but far inferior to the encampment i before described the preceding year but i agreed on such nights to accompany mrs lee he paying the carriage for two days the saturday and sunday and to have a clear benefit which engagement he punctually fulfilled but we differed about some trifle and did not part friends mr lee was very fond of teaching to act with which he amused himself from saturday to saturday with almost as thin a company as gibbets in the beaux stratagem  i am sure it did not double it  the salaries the reader may be sure were poor as winchester with the little camp could not afford great expenses so as to procure mr lee a living and the additional charges of my going there with mrs lee yet mr lee being known as an actor of merit the officers were pleased and obliged to him for their saturdays lounge and made it a point to do all in their power to support him  mr lee would not lead off the first play  i believe he was really afraid his spirits being dashed as whose would not like falstaff who says if i be not ashamed of my soldiers i am a soused guet  the first play was on saturday august        there was not any thing appeared to lee to be so practicable as my doing the parts in the minor so the minor was fixed on without any other entertainment whatever and it was acted from necessity in a very mutilated state as it was impossible the people mr lee had so suddenly and with difficulty collected could be perfect in the intermediate scenes where i was not concerned however a very genteel house appeared of mr lees patrons and i was well received as their old favorite acquaintance having been there a whole campaign the year before with the bath company so from consideration to mr lee and myself they went away in perfect good humor professed themselves pleased and satisfied with their short entertainment  august    we acted the fair penitent mr lee had amused himself with drilling his troops and the play had one great claim to being well received as it was very perfect lothario mr lee horatio mr wilkinson lavinia mrs burden who had acted charlotte in love alamode at covent garden and the lady i have so often mentioned as the infernal limb calista by mrs lee the farce was lethe  the old man and lord chalkstone mr wilkinson frenchman mr lee  august    jane shore shore mr lee hastings mr wilkinson  with a scene from taste as the entertainment lady pentweazle mr wilkinson  august    the way to keep him lovemore mr lee bucks have at ye all mr wilkinson with the farce of the author mr cadwallader mr wilkinson  september   by desire of lady harriet conyers the provoked wife sir john brute mr lee and for the farce mr wilkinson will give tea  september    my last night romeo and juliet romeo mr wilkinson mercutio mr lee with bucks have at ye all and the favorite scene of sir archy mac sarcam from love alamode  to a very noble audience which may be easily accounted for not only as a reward for the trouble i had undergone of performing added to the journies but from my established acquaintance with the gentlemen of the army as well as with the particular inhabitants of winchester the preceding year after the hard duty i had sustained of marching and counter marching from stage to stage and the business universally heavy on me at portsmouth garrison no wonder if i wished to indulge a few weeks autumn repose with that best good physician my mother who was certainly not only my truest but most agreeable friend after a few days rst i visited my old master mr rich who had some weeks before ordered mr ballard the treasurer to write me a letter of invitation and that i was expected by his manager to be in london by the  0th of september the opening time of the london theaters with an offer of  l per week and to be ready in the character of bays and to sign an article for three years benefits included in the proposal my engagement with mr arthur rendered a compliance with honor or any degree of honesty impossible my nonattendance much offended mr rich as he thought and very justly he had made me a very genteel and comfortable offer but after i had two or three times attended his mornings levee we became as good friends as ever he even condescended to request a favor which was that i would make my first appearance in a farce which he told me secretly in confidence was of his own writing and i have reason to believe it was and that it will not be eagerly contradicted or claimed on account of its bequeathed honors to posterity it was called the spirit of contradiction he said if i would but act the part of the gardener from his larning it would make my fortune provided i would implicitly yield to his instructions i had by that  grown so familiarized to mr richs oddities that i unfeignedly held him in great regard and esteem and in the true sense of the word believe he was a worthy and respectable gentleman for though i well remembered he pronounced a very unfavourable opinion of me some years before when i was really distressed yet in our after serious acquaintance i often experienced many acts of kindness good wishes and cordiality which fully made me amends and my former seeming ill luck had made me often read the book called experience too ten neglected in all stages of life for the prevention of errors which lead to misfortunes  when i spoke of the gardener for mr shuter who was the edwin of the time instead of myself he took his snuff stroaked his cat and said if i give it muster shuttleworth he will not let me teach him and he is so idle i want it perfect muster williamskin but i will larn you muster if you will play the part from my tuition  we were one noon hard at work with the part of the gardener when mr younger the prompter abruptly came into the room on urgent and immediate stage state affairs rich perceiving him turned hastily about and in a rage said get away muster youngmore i am teaching muster whittington to act if questioned why i have spoken of mr rich so respectfully yet draw such a caricature i answer my obligations to him at first were not those of a good kind that i altered my opinion by having notions superior to prejudice and as a true drawing of character without giving tints of these oddities strangers would have no true notion of mr richs real manner and personal oddities and i wish every writer good or bad never dealt in more satire or intention of doing harm than my insignificant self indeed mr richs peculiarities are not here observed as a novelty for his best friends then and those who now remain cannot but say the relation is not more whimsical than true  when i had undergone six days lessons and repeated the gardener line by line and to the best my ear could conduct me mr rich said no engagement with his larning me unless confirmed by an article signed for three years now i had been so weary of mr garricks tyranny and above all loved to ramble and was so habituated to get money and be my own master that i could not by any means relish the least idea of bondage for being at liberty exclusive of the profit seemed doubly pleasant and alluring so in short after a pause with hesitation and finding i could not gulp down an article i frankly told him my disposition but that i was notwithstanding at his command on his proffered terms for ten weeks only whereat my old master grew angry i turned sullen and our interview concluded as follows  mr rich so you will not sign your article muster williamskin and let me larn you   mr wilkinson no sir  articles may be repented on both sides and i would rather agree for a shorter term and renew if mutually agreeable   mr rich why then muster williamskin what will you do for muster griskin mr garrick told me in the summer he would never engage you again you have offended him muster and he will never forgive you and muster williamskin you did not attend my theater when summoned and i not only made you a liberal offer but endeavored to be the making of you by larning you to act   mr wilkinson my good sir i am truly obliged to you for your offers but must repeat i do not relish a confined engagement  rather than be under an article for three years i would prefer rambling for six therefore good sir with my sincere thanks and wishes unless you will agree for ten weeks i mean to set ail in a few days for ireland     his astonishment and answer i shall never forget though his prophecy was not in respect to myself verified yet i have reason to fear some adventurers possessed of too much faith in promises woefully experienced real disappointment mr rich sternly muster williamskin i will ell you what will be the consequence of your headstrong ignorance you will go over to dublin and engage with the tall man muster barlymore he will promise you a large salary of which you will not receive a second guinea for that muster barlymore can wheedle a bird from the tree and squeeze it to death in his hand this was a severe caricature of barry but shrewd and too near a resemblance  muster williamskin here is five guineas as a ticket for your irish benefit that you may be sure of something i wish you a good journey  your servant he left the room in a pet and the five guineas in my hand and though i was no lawyer i was not so ignorant as not to retain the fee and that was my last visit and conversation with the really good mr rich he died soon after during the run of his splendid coronation     the day before the fracas happened i had received a letter of pressing invitation from mr mossop then manager of smockalley theater in dublin that unexpected treaty could not have been brought about after mossops declared aversion had it not been for the willing interference of counselor barrett that gentleman had a strong partiality for mr mossop as a friend and an actor they had been bred i understood at college together which lasting intimacy induced mr barrett to be ever ready to contribute toward conciliation and acts of kindness for the which i doubt he suffered very considerably though willingly by frequently encroaching on his own substantial finances to the generously assisting mossop with material sums at times when bewildered and plunged in his fatal airy scheme of being an opposing manager which too frequently occasioned various occurrences and disasters at different periods for which generous benevolence i fear the friendly hearted counselor never had a chance or possibility of being reimbursed however he was affluent and did not want money but the istressed actor unhappily did i relate this from conjecture only never having been on a footing of intimacy with mr barrett to enable me to vouch for its authenticity though infinitely obliged to him in ireland in     for many civilities which i am ever pleased to acknowledge likewise his being instrumental to the bringing me and mr mossop on terms of amity once more in      but that governor of restless players was not by any means blessed with a tithe of mr barrys pleasing abilities as an actor or generous qualities as a man or manager mr barry had certainly a most enchanting fascination beyond the general lot of mankind as a proof it was seldom either creditor or enemy left barry in an ill humor however in other respects dissatisfied or disappointed mr mossop was overloaded with a quantity of combustibles consisting of pride insolence arrogance and gall i reviewed the difference as to the respective managers but mossops offer claimed a priority of preference as being the first and that offer was liberal the reader will think it strange that mossop should have any engagement with me after his declarations but he judged i suppose it was better policy to keep such a mischievous monkey in his own theater where he might play his tricks at the expense of the enemy than suffer pug to be at the opposite one and be let loose upon himself he wrote me word i might depend on every friendship in his power to render his theater agreeable and insinuated that after his generous persentation he trusted i would not deal so unlike a gentleman when i arrived in dublin as to enter or listen to any terms whatever as to engaging with barry and woodward which i assented to on my arrival mr mossop and i soon settled all preliminaries it was early in january and a few days after christmas holidays my first appearance was in the play of the minor which two years before had been damned as a farce it would have been hazardous but its being insinuated and advertised with a pompous account of the amazing run and success it had met with at all the three theaters in london not omitting to mention considerable alterations which by so doing obtained a verdict in favor of seeing and hearing it acted and as mr foot has been mentioned to have observed the difference of weather humors and various accidents that make for and against to render it impossible to account for the uncertain changes in theatrical events so the minor was acted to a very fine house received with universal applause and continued to be performed twice aweek to good houses  my imitation of mrs bellamy in shift with the introduction the puppets and a mock burletta imitation etc were of great service the minor was well supported as may be perceived by the following cast  i acted mr footes characters the minor mr jefferson mr wealthy mr sowden sir william mr baddely loader mr ryder  lucy mrs kelf in that theater i met with my agreeable friend mrs abington in high estimation she did not see her old friend tate with a new face she had grown weary of being connected with barry and mrs dancer as the latter could not relish the triumph of miss notable nor could miss notable patiently submit to the insolence and affected superiority of mrs conquest my agreeable acquaintance mrs kelf now mrs egerton with her mother and sister were at mossops theater and if this book falls into her hands she will laugh very heartily on recollecting the many happy days and whimsical adventures which occurred that winter in dear dublin whenever i remember the happiness i there experienced and the numerous obligations i received in that city i sigh and languish for another peep ere i depart to meet my many good friends of great britain and ireland which have gone before me to that country from whose bourne no traveller returns  mr mossop and myself for the first three weeks were on the most intimate footing i dined twice with him at dr wilsons apartments in trinity college he was a staunch friend of mossops i believe the smockally theater was dr wilsons property these dinners i surmised were intended to induce me by their mutual rhetoric and persuasion to attack barry and woodward but that i declined from policy for i prophetically judged it most likely that this sudden apparent friendship would not be of very long duration as i knew in his heart he hated me so the foundation which i depended on his good will was very ak and frivolous and when he wanted to be quit of me i should have shut barrys doors against my sweet self however i proposed over our claret to take great pains with woodwards favorite character of the barber and he might advertise my name for it in the manner of the original which seemed to please mossop much a plain proof how we relish satire against others and how little we allow for it against ourselves it was immediately brought forward  the next day after being with mr mossop i waited on the attractive abington and importuned her assistance in termagant which she good naturedly complied with she was at that juncture of time in her full bloom and prime of life she has had her day  miss farren now has her day and she i hope will live like the french beauty madam ninon de lenclos who captivated her son by her charms when she was at the age of seventy  i told mrs abington i should revive the jealous wife for my night if she would favor me with playing mrs oakley she consented to study it against the   d of february indeed she that winter as well as in    0 paid me great civilities and i never received a favor in my life that i was not grateful for and ever ready and proud to acknowledge it was surprising that so truly good a comedy should have been in print two winters and not brought forward properly at either of the dublin theaters we acted the author three or four nights and it was commanded by their graces the duke and duchess of northumberland his grace was at that time the lord lieutenant the upholsterer was often repeated and i was esteemed so very like woodward in the part by my having so exactly copied his manner and dress that i do not believe colley cibbers relation of his likeness of dogget in fondlewie was in truth beyond my exact representation of woodward in the barber lady pentweazle also helped to make out my twelve nights with the repeating the successful comedy of the jealous wife in which i acted mr oakley that year early in march      both the tragedy candidates barry and mossop had fixed on performing othello on the same monday for their benefit play mossop relying on his novelty barry on his longestablished reputation the partisans prepared for battle bets ran high and furious as in the present days for pugilism mossops holder of the stakes was the countess of brandon heavy in demeanor but alert in apprehension her ldyship solicited his grace the duke of northumberland to command mossops night to which he generously assented but wisely contrived to occasion a cessation of hostilities between he two combatants by promising to barry that provided he would postpone his night to the tuesday he would also command that evenings entertainment by which means the town would be kept in good humor the particular friends of each rest satisfied and his grace also added he should by such attention and compliance from mr barry not be deprived the pleasure of seeing him in his favorite character of othello which always afforded him the highest satisfaction  barry of course complied and was not inwardly displeased that the critics without a division would have such an immediate opportunity to compare notes on the skill and superiority of the declared opponents on this remarkable occasion each house was equally thronged though barrys on the tuesday was the greatest receipt as crowstreet was capable of containing more than smockalley otherwise party zeal added to curiosity raised auditors in such superabundance as would have filled drury lane and covent garden theaters as to victory barrys othello was so meritorious as to make mossops viewed at a distance only he was as much superior in the valiant moor as mossop would have been to barry in richard or zanga i sat the evening of mossops benefit in an upper box where a lady who sat next me exclaimed on mossops first appearance with an archness and humor peculiar to that nation o faith mossop has got two eyes in his belly this shrewd remark was occasioned by his wearing a heavy embossed shape fit for brutus or cato a dragons face on the breast with two large glaring red stones for the eyes his face and wig being black conveyed exactly what the lady had so ironically expressed mr barry though masterly that night of controversy had frequently shown himself to more advantage merely owing to his then taking too great pains in his favorite and much esteemed part which proves that lucky accidents fortunately combined with nature will perchance strike out more beauties for an artist than all the most determined force of premeditation  mr mossop that year had an italian opera company which was of infinite service to him but astonishingly hurt his own consequence for what with parties and other diversions of routs assemblies concerts etc with which dublin in the winter abounds and opposed by the forces of woodward and barry for they still maintained their fashion and good report the great box nights were chiefly confined to those of the burlettas that agreeable singer and actress signora de amice was the principal and was almost adored she after that greatly succeeded at the opera house in london as the first serious woman singer  these italian comic operas were all the rage and were supported at the following prices  boxes pit and lattices  s  d  middle gallery  s  d  upper gallery  s  d dublin was then torn to pieces by the perpetual application for one theater or the other it was reduced quite to a party matter the countess of brandon would not be seen at crowstreet upon any account but attended constantly at her dear mossops barry i believe had at least converted the ladies two to one in his favor barrys making love when on the stage left tender impressions but yet this playbegging at last grew troublesome and ended with fatal circumstances of which an exact account has before been given  mossop when he had a good house instead of endeavoring to extricate himself in any degree from his multiplicity of difficulties grew desperate and instead of paying either his tradesmen or performers flew to the gay circles where he was gladly admitted and in order to mend his broken fortune by the chance of a die or the turn up of a card of which i believe he was ignorant and unacquainted with the necessary arts to succeed he has often left the theater with a hundred guineas in his pocket and returned home with an aching head and heart but his guineas with debts of honor were all left behind the countess of brandon served him greatly it is true but often the money she occasioned being paid at the theater returned to her own coffers this was the universal opinion of dublin and is all i can allege in that case as to its authenticity and as to mossops poverty there needs no evidence for that unfortunate reality  this conduct and a train of evils attendant thereon soon preyed upon his health involved his talents with himself and gave bitter sours to that temper which was in its natural source far from being one of the best an instance of the poverty his performers were reduced to in      i will with permission relate  the distressed mother was to be acted  orestes mr mossop andromache by mrs burden whom i have so often mentioned the salaries had not been paid for several weeks and she was in true character as the distressed woman with infinite difficulty she forced access to the general mossop for it was hard to accomplish admittance on account of many inconvenient reasons unless on a sunday and on that grand leveeday performers and tradesmen were too menial to be admitted but with the force of a heroine who dauntless surmounts all barriers and tyrants at will so mrs burden burst into the inmost recess of his prison house and when arrived at the royal hall she was as determined to preserve character  for at the awful voice of mossop she andromachelike was prostrate at the feet of her royal master and uttered forth in tragic tones o sir for gods sake assist me i have not bread to eat i am actually starving and shall be turned out into the streets  mossop in state woman  you have five pounds per week woman   mrs burden true sir but i have been in dublin six months and in all that time have only received six pounds  i call every saturday at the office for my salary  but no money is the answer besides sir your credit and your honor is at stake how can i play andromache the trojan queen without black satin shoes   mossop woman begone i insist on your having black satin shoes for andromache and woman if you dare ask me for money again i will forfeit you  pounds woe  man  so ended that real tragical scene of penury and pomposity   my benefit that year feb         was as usual very great indeed it could not be better my play as before related was the jealous wife  oakley with a prologue of garricks mr wilkinson major oakley mr baddely lord trinket mr jefferson charles mr reed russet mr heaphy sir harry mr ryder capt ocutter mr sparks  lady freelove miss kennedy harriet miss macartney mrs oakley mrs abington with tea bucks have at ye all and the farce of the country house  my engagement with mossop being expired i intended soon leaving my old favorite spot which was now become a home but was detained by mrs abingtons requesting i would stay and assist her in a scene of fun and humor for her benefit night which she had complied with at the request of her really good benefactor lord miltown mrs abington had often entertained several genteel parties with some droll stories of a good gentlewoman she named mrs fuz i had been on parties with lord miltown and lord clambrazil when in high spirits and good humor and had diverted myself and the company with stories and anecdotes of my dear favorite old lady mrs white of whom the reader must by this time have formed some idea by referring back to what i have before related of my darling old gentlewomans singularities  mrs abington had promised lord miltown she would produce herself as mrs fuz and she would prevail on her friend wilkinson to do the same as mrs jenkins alias mrs white which information his lordship made known to all families of distinction in dublin but the peer did not reflect that those stories told by myself  mrs abington over the convivial table gave a kind of explanatory key to the strange characters and sir francis delaval and mr foot knew the mother and the daughters as well as myself but on a stage where few of the audience were acquainted either with the character that mrs abington or i represented the joke was as difficult to find out as mr bayess laughing violently at his own prince volscius where the joke lay in the boots  her play was rule a wife  leon mr mossop copper captain mr brown  estifania mrs abington between the play and farce an interlude called mrs jenkins and mrs fuz mrs jenkins mr wilkinson mrs fuz mrs abington before the night came we often entertained ourselves with extempore rehearsals and conceived ourselves easy perfect and entertaining mrs jenkins was dressed before the play concluded mrs abington after an epilogue of shrewd turn and spoke with great point retired to dress as mrs fuz our dresses had been before well considered  it was a crowded house part of the pit laid into the boxes mrs abington had ordered an excellent supper superbly lighted etc and had wrote a little introductory dialoguescene in the street between two gentlemen giving a description of a party they were that night invited to and where two extraordinary characters were asked for the entertainmentof the ladys guests at whose house the rendezvous was appointed but each person was enjoined to lay their fingers on their lips and not to laugh on any account whatever but to pay every mark of attention and approbation in order that the two ladies might with more unlimited freedom display their different absurdities after the dialogue was finished the scene was drawn up and discovered several welldressed ladies and gentlemen at supper  miss ambrose was sitting at my elbow as the daughter of mrs jenkins who intended bringing her on the stage  mrs fuz was seated at one front corner of a long supper table and i was at the other mrs kelf was at the head as lady of the ceremonies which was the only good part for there were the servants with wine and she displayed on the occasion her being mistress of a good knife and fork on being discovered and looking scornfully at each other our two figures had for some time a fine effect loud fits of laughter succeeded and from these great expectations were formed  mrs fuz then desired mrs jenkins to begin  mrs jenkins desired mrs fuz would do the same  and we found ourselves in an awkward situation but after a few efforts the two ladies entered into a hobbling short conversation which was received very well from the eager opinion that something better would follow for the audience were all eyes and ears but we soon flagged mrs fuz asked for a glass of wine  says mrs jenkins upond my sold and i will have a glass of wind too then mrs fuz said when she was first married her two breasteses were so large you might have carried a plate of salt upon them  that did not do and the abington began to feel it a service of danger perplexity and disgrace  mrs jenkins called to her daughter to act juliet and observe her manner and to stick herself upon the stage as if she was chilled and stabbed throfout but as she kneeled down to act juliet the strange old lady mrs fuz got up gave her a kick ran away and abandoned mrs jenkins to the mercy of the audience i was well aware of what might be expected and therefore lost no time but arose and ran after her crying out mrs fuz mrs fuz  the audience began to smoke the joke and by their tokens of anger gave the necessary hint to the staring ladies and gentlemen on the stage that a retreat would not be imprudent if they regarded their safety so they ran away also which caused a laugh for it was evident when mrs abington and i had eloped they were ignorant what to do not knowing but that we meant to return for they were only desired to tay on till we finished which the performers could not conceive would be so abruptly as we made it but expected us to come back and make a conclusion to our characters  i hope mrs abington has not forgot this but will laugh at it as i do though it was truly awkward at the time and it really drew lord miltown into disgrace for he had said so much in favor of the promised scene that it had been the conversation of the preceding week  when the curtain dropped which was with loud marks of censure the ladies universally arose and by way of joke laughed and courtesied to each other saying your servant mrs jenkins your servant mrs fuz  which i dare say vexed his lordship much not only for his own and the disappointment of the audience but more so as any failure of mrs abingtons was mortifying to him for he was then and i am told is now a most violently attached and true patron and wellwisher of hers mrs abington in her epilogue after estifania had spoke some lines very sarcastically aimed at mr woodward who to speak truth deserved it at her hands they were very severe and her being so great a favorite and delivering them most excellently in woodwards manner stung him to the quick indeed he was so much irritated by her arch exhibition that it put a stop to my intended sail for england and was the occasion of an intimacy between hi and me as till then it had so happened that i had never met with spoke to or hardly seen mr woodward ut in his profession on the stage he directed my old acquaintance joseph austin to call on me with an invitation to supper the sunday night folowing my great performance united with mrs bingtons which i could not refuse as i had n impulse i may add to be acquainted with a gentleman of such merit as an actor and a worthy and valuable character as a man  mr austin introduced me on the sunday evening and supposing scrts of state wee no to be diulged left us to a roast fowl and mincepies with the help of two bottles of claret to grow wise and intimate for with an englishman the second bottle is absolutely necessary for those purposes though i know by long experience not so salutary for the health mr woodward paid me the compliment of saying he wished to be on a footng of intimacy hoped i would become his real friendly acquaintance and make his table my own while i remained in dublin when at leisure or not particularly engaged and further said at that time he kept not any company for the manner of living in dublin was too free  mrs woodward was on her dying bed and a friend in that situation would be his only comfort pleasure and satisfaction to pass away a dreary hour  from that night we formed an acquaintance and he offered me twenty guineas for playing four nights and a clear one for my benefit i urged with truth that i feared a second benefit would fail especially as i had been honored with so many great ones and that my friends in particular would not like it which was really the case woodward urged in pallation that was his reason for offering me twenty guineas and he would not advise me to trouble or think of my friends attendance so lately called on but inform them i did not expct their apparance again on that occasion and added as you are on the spot you had better continue five or six weeks and if the receipt is but indifferent it will be taking so much without trouble this seemed feasible  i liked dublin  and as it suited my inclination and was practicable i consented and i believe we had a third bottle as a signing the contract woodward i must observe was a sober man to a degree not fond of parties but liked to chat with a friend and over a bottle he would often stretch a point i was enlisted once more in the same regiment with joseph austin  the first night i played there was a very fine house kitely in every man in his humor which character from some cause or another had been wanting from the two seasons of mossops departure bobadil by the only bobadil of present memory mr woodward and with buck in the englishmn returned srom paris etc made out the four nights but not within the time i was engaged as his wifes death kept him some weeks off the stage and greatly retarded my intended expedition and by that serious intervention drove my benefit till the   th of may  the play was the tender husband or the accomplished ools  numps mr woodward sir harry gubbin mr wilkinson catain clerimont mr dexter biddy tipkin mrs dancer  with a paltry piece of stuff i called the auction wherein i was the auctioneer my friend joseph always ready to assist acted a part called lady toothless  in which interlude we gave a specimen of the french harlequin comedy with what it master tate and master joseph could bestow on their goodnatured audience not much to our credit but we escaped to the full as well as mrs jenkins and mrs fuz  the farce was thomas and sally i acted dorcas as an italian and really with good reception and success my broken english and imitation of foreign manners were so preserved within proper bounds as i may pronounce of myself was tolerable and at the finish spoke the exact words and in the manner of signora de amice the greatly followed italian singer of that season at smockalley theater which had a catch of quick applause and laughing approbation  me am sorry me am extremely sorry me cannot speak better englis  me return my sincere tanks for dis great a favor  me vould vish bettar much bettar vords to express my gratitude  the evening finished with great laughter but the sum total i received was only   l some odd shllings i must not forget a particular circumstance which happened that very night at the conclusion of the tender husband al had gone on smoothly till the end of the comedy when on a sudden even woodward was planet struck  not one could proceed  the audience hissed  woodward crossed the stage to me and authoritatively chid me for not speaking the tag i said he was wrong and disclaimed any knowledge of a line more in my part i spoke to mr dexter  mr dexter to mrs dancer now mrs crawford and with disgrace the curtain dropped and after each person looking on the other like searching for ones kneebuckle in a hurry which at the same time is often where it should be so we on inspection found the last speech and tag belonged to mr dexter who was a very perfect actor in general but the same misfortune has been known in london to have happened for when it comes to the tag as we call it of a wellknown play we at rehearsals like careless people at church begin to move off before the blessing is pronounced and from that omission in the morning it begets inattention and we fall into the pool of disgrace at night so when the book was produced it told in glaring letters that mr dexter was the defaulter now says the reader where was the prompter why my good sir or madam when players come to what we call a standstill they are then dumbfounded stupid animals and cannot say bo  we are not always the wisest of mankind nor yet quite so ignorant and vulgar as we are sometimes honored by the kind estimation of too many and be it observed and remembered that accidents will happen in the best governed families  another odd theatrical adventure happened at that very time mr king who was as great an established favorite as i ever remember in dubin not even woodward excepted not having been in ireland from the spring      till that of      mr garrick had given him leave three or four weeks before drury lane closed hoping he would have obtained fine gleanings in the month of man by visiting his dublin friends and admirers after an absence of three years great expectations were formed yet the attraction failed and on his benefit in particular which was the monday after mine for an influenza had seized men women and children i never was worse with any illness than at that time austin and i were in the middle gallery on his benefit night when i do not believe there were twelve persons there besides nor much more than   l in the house even though mr king played bays in the rehearsal and had to change his dress between two or three of the acts for he spoke bucks have at ye all and acted in mr garricks interlude of the farmers return from london and had his abilities assisted by a very good company as may be seen in the bill of the jealous wife  mr kings good sense will not be angry at this recital for it is an instance of the power of fashion more or less in every place but when mr king a few seasons after returned the people were not so unwitted for on his being advertised to appear in lord ogleby it was with the utmost difficulty a seat could be obtained not only for his first night but several succeeding ones all ran in crowds to see their old favorite tom king every time he performed though a very bad set of players to assist him  dublin is remarkable for doing a great deal for the actor or nothing and if one particular part by a performer happens to please their fancies and judgment once a week to the end of the season it will fill the house the winter      in november and december he performed with as high spirits and more profit than on any preceding he ever made there and was so caressed and esteemed by every one that they were not contented when his first engagement was finished with the manager and therefore he agreed for twelve nights more after christmas which was equally beneficial with the first and the irish hospitality was such that it is well he got away with safety for wherever they esteem they are apt to endanger the healths of their guests with acts of kindness he then went to scotland and performed four nights at glasgow which run in regular progression tuesday wednesday thursday and friday and each night to an overflowing house on the saturday he traveled fortyfour miles from glasgow to edinburgh where at six oclock there was not a seat to be had in any part of the theater an at seven oclock he was on the stage receiving the warmest welcome from an audience pleased to see not only so excellent an actor but a gentleman whose own natural good qualities were superior or at least must be allowed equal to his abilities as the player  owing to the influenza having confined me for ome few days and not having any engagement confirmed either in ireland or england to call me from dublin i did not depart though my engagement finished on the   th of may wishing for  little country air i requested my friend austin to dine with me at one of those pleasant villages with which dublin is romantically and delightfully surrounded at our return on entering the metropolis i accidentally cast my eyes on the plaisteredup playbill and to my infinite surprise read the orphan castalio mr barry etc and between the play and farce mr wilkinson will give tea after which mr macklins love alamode i thought it very strange unprecedented and rude behavior my nights being expired and my time delayed that mr barry or mr woodward should improperly advertise me for what i was not then prepared for at their territories and that done by one or both without a line or message i felt myself angry and hurt and declared i would not attend the theater but mr austin persuaded me much not to abide by that resolution he urged that the managers had acted rather cavalierly but judged it much more advisable to avoid offending my friends or the public or even the managers we might meet again it was always better to be on terms with those leaders in power and he did not doubt but they meant to pay me some compliment to this friendly admonition and advice i not only attentively listened but obeyed its dictates went to my lodgings dressed and prepared to give some jumbled performance at the playhouse when there i complained of the ill behavior which the graces of barry soon made easy and prevented me from permitting rage to fire my bosom when the orphan finished and barry had as the unhappy husband of monimia departed to the imaginary shades i in a few minutes informed mr carmichael the prompter that i was ready to give the whole house tea though without cups and saucers but just when the curtain was drawing up the said carmichael came in a violent hurry and told me he came with peremptory orders from mr barry that i must not on any pretext whatever attempt to proceed with my part of the entertainment for the evening until the end of love alamode and that mr macklin insisted on that injunction being complied with  mr macklin was ever tenacious of his favorite ofspring and he judged i do conjecture that any delay or laugh immediately after the tragedy from the audience might in some small degree take off the relish when love alamode began however i persisted that if i obliged mr barry with doing what he had not the least right to comand or expect i would unless i was then permitted to perform instantly quit the theater to that declaration barry did not pay much attention and as he was ever intimidated by mr macklin and tremblingly alive and fearful of his desertion to mossop the mortal opponent of crowstreet citadel of course neither my petition nor remonstrance could prevail and i as obstinate as either not only left the royal army under the command of the master revellers but instead of going home retired to mr achesons a private and worthy family in trinitylane where i was assured not any pursuers would ever dream of finding me or indeed if they had i should not have returned  after inquiring as to the termination of the evening at the playhouse i was informed that all went on smoothly the piece received the tribute due to its merit and macklin barry woodward and messink a repetition of approbation which their respective merits had so frequently obtained not one of the three leading personages had cast a thought on wilkinson nor did they suppose he would be called for or if he was that a slight apology from the manager of mr tates departure would settle all matters amicablv  but the event proved much to the contrary for when the farce finished and the audience were judged to be departing on peeping through the curtain a few minutes after their supposed exeunt omnes they were all espied in dread array and as regularly seated as they had been viewed the hour preceding and on neither preparatory music giving the elevating sound nor mr w making his expected appearance from a murmur a violent clamor ensued when speedily mr barry stepped forward and informed the large assemblage the whole matter that mr w it was true had been there but for what reason mr b could not divine mr w had as unexpectedly as suddenly eloped however that would not in the smallest degree pacify them they judged their rights infringed and their authority much imposed upon insisted on my being sent for and said they would sit patiently till i attended and fulfilled my duty  but all the messengers search was fruitless  and indeed had it been otherwise and they had found me in my hiding place i should not have returned to have endured the wrathful resentments and disgrace i certainly had not deserved and must have suffered but snaillike would have pulled in my horns and kept snug and secure within my shell for the manager certainly as i was not engaged then to him had not the right or the power to act as he did and i forewarned of the displeasure i had incurred had prudently determined i would not venture my sweet self again in their field of battle that year of our lord on their patience being exhausted and mr barrys assurance of the various means taken to recover the lost sheep the whole blame fell as was likely upon poor tate and the departing guests one and all pronounced great punishment on my devoted head whenever it next popped before them and declared to the manager they would not mis any opportunity to treat me with a dish of their tea in lieu of my own all this vexatious unlucky matter with various illnatured and increasing additions the next day or two much perplexed and distressed me the more so as i was not without visitors who in general condemned my conduct nor would yield to my being in the right even admitting the other party to have been ever so wrong  for they observed as my engagement was finished i could effectually have prevented any futur mistake of the kind and even if what i intended to present to the public had lost some trifling applause or had not been relished by the audience it was not to be balanced against the almost certainty of offending many if not all of those  whom i had been so constantly obliged and indeed it must be granted though i was favoure with many partial friends i should with deliberation on the other hand have considered that i wa not without numerous enemies  many deservedl so  who would assuredly rejoice at such an open opportunity of relating it greatly to my disadvantage now as to who was most in the wrong m different readers must determine not that i ecaped entirely without punishment as in the year    i experienced an unexpected and whimsical taation which will be truly related in its proper time and place in this salmagundi dish of all orts prepared by mr garricks exotic the important subject very soon ceased and was put a stop to by the sudden appearance of mrs pritchard from london who never had been in ireland and was engaged on large terms to perform a few nights with mr barry her long established fame her excellent private character and universally acknowledged worth gave rise to wonderful expectation notwithstanding such a combination of good promise and that she made her first appearance in one of her favorite and best esteemed chracters that of lady macbeth in which she wa perfectly suited as to the figure manner voice xution and judgment yet the experiment was ed at too late a season of her life she never drew a second crowded house  the bloom was off the peach and in general but in dublin more parularly an accomplished beauty only can be almst assured of victory she with merit may slay hearts at will and like bobadil call twenty into the field of love kill them twenty more kill them too nay more in ireland a newborn venu like mrs sullen may say o a fine woman may do any thing in dublin  o my conscience she may raise an army of twenty thousand men  but i will leave the worthy ancient lady mrs pritchard and attend on myself who after the late fracas at crowstreet theater left the grecians early in june      and when at chester was induced to lounge there about eight days and formed an acquaintance with mr daniel smith and mrs smith of the white lion inn he was one of the most spirited friendly and entertaining characters i ever met with hundreds are judges of the individual i am speaking of  like other men that have merit he had envious enemies but they were so overbalanced by friends and great and deserved success that such opposers ade the following line applicable to him their praise was censure and their censure praise he was on my first intimacy in his prime of life of an intrepid manly disposition strong and happy in health attended with great liveliness not a gentleman of chester or the county but liked dan smith as a companion  to him i owe several acquintances at chester whom i reflect on with pleasue as well as the many happy days i have had there for smiths house was at all times my home not that i accepted his favors without a return his and my intimates were roger ilberham esquire mr farrington mr fisher tench mr orme etc i was so delighted with the first cities which i experienced from mr and mrs smith that it was actually with the utmost regret i could leave them  however business must be adhered to and after a mutual promise of a conance of friendship so agreeably begun i took my leave and determined on going to birmingham where i had never been and where my good friends mr hull and mr younger were as managers for the summer season i took a postchaise and on the second day arrived there to dinner  it was quite a new scene to me  the company had acted three or four weeks and i intended my visit to mr hull for seven or eight days only miss morrison mr moody and several performers from london with whom i was well acquainted were there  they wished for my continuance provided i would accept the terms of the company which was a share and a benefit to that i consented i was not engaged at any other place and it was particularly agreeable to my own inclination  on the   th of june alexander was acted  to which was added the minor  i performed the usual characters  the following paragraph mr hull put to the bottom of the bill  the company in order to render their performances as generally agreeable as possible have engaged mr wilkinson for the ensuing part of the season who will occasionally entertain the public with several characters in mr footes manner and with various imitations of burlettas operas etc as they have been repeatedly exhibited in london with universal approbation    my mothers letter to me at birmingham my dear tate yours of yesterday makes me extremely happy that you feel no remaining effects from that violent nights overdoing your strength that you are in favor with the town and also that you are at this hot time free from hard work in tragedy i am vastly delighted that you have the pleasure of so fine a country and with such a multiplicity of engagements with the people in high life only as you observe it is living too well which i hope will be carried off by fine air and your riding if you go to worcester very possible you may see mrs hutchinson there at mr broomleys a man of fortune if she is not at the races and you have time whitleycourt at lord foleys is but a few miles which visit would reinstate you in her favor as you are so near the spot called tato heath it is very right to think about what inquiries are to be made about it then in the first place you are to take the advice of some person of good character eminent in the law whether your father did not after his conviction forfeit all his rights to any thing he had from the crown i remember that was mr sharpes opinion and if so you can have no claim but if upon further inquiry you should be better informed your right as from your father would be very easy to prove at the duchy office it was the year forty when your father was at warrington and all the papers i have relating to the coals were signed by john baily who if alive could inform you particularly where the coalpits were  how could you be at a loss to know whose kitchen i meant her ladyships who i believe is as much distressed to support that family as ever i was in one far less lord forbes has been dangerously ill upon which news the captain set out post for dublin and whilst i was there yesterday letters came from him and mrs wilson of his safe arrival i most sincerely wish them all happy but returned home blessing god how much more true ease content and satisfaction i and my son enjoy for really as far as i can judge you are now in a round of engagements of all the pleasures this world can give your way of life here so different i do not know how you will reconcile yourself to the change my desires are contracted in a narrow sphere  a mind in peace with the decent necessaries of life i hope by your enlarged acquaintance you may meet with those who will prove real friends and be of service to you upon many occasions as your men of fortune carry weight in every way of life and so to hear of your continued health and spirits will ever give the highest joy to the heart of  your most affectionate mother g wilkinson london august         wednesday the   th of august the rehearsal  the first time i ever acted bays  the company was summoned by mr yates to preston on account of the jubilee which is kept there with great festivity and celebrated every twentyone years  he had engaged several principal london performers i returned back to chester being eager to see my friend smith and family and other new acquaintance at that place but i made my journey thither a pleasant round and took preston in my way i met mr sowden coming from ireland on the road and he turned back and were with me to the jubilee and then to stay with me a few days at chester at preston we found very bad accommodations very dear very dirty and much crowded the procession was tolerable but not worth the trouble or expense of a journey to see it indeed i was very glad on the second day to persuade mr sowden to quit preston for chester for it was all confusion and mire except the main street which i recollect is spacious and handsome but it was the crowd and inconveniency that made us glad to depart and we went from thence to liverpool where i had never before been and after one days view we crossed in the east ferry to cheshire where we ordered a postchaise and got in good time to dinner at chester  mr sowdens intimacy with me began the winter before at mr mossops theater where he was a submanager at that time he was a sensible shrewd bred man looked on in general as remarkably insincere not that i ever met with any thing from him in any respect but the opposite conduct i once went with him from dublin to wicklow a pleasant ride to receive some rents there he was very entertaining and a great epicure he was possessed of an ample fortune the consequence of being a good economist and well knowing how to lend his money to great advantage yet not without good security he made himself generally pleasing as he never contradicted any body or disliked any thing at another persons table but always approved if a gentleman had said sowden that cabbageleaf those strawberries are on is a fine leaf he would have sworn a loud oath that the cabbageleaf not only was a handsome cabbageleaf but by g  d the handsomest cabbageleaf that ever grew he was father to mrs jackson at edinburgh and i believe she only came in for an inconsiderable part of his fortune but of that mrs jackson is the only competent and proper judge and i sincerely hope my conjecture may be quite wrong for her sake  from chester i went to london where i had not paid my dutiful respects for several months and there had a welcome not to be suspected from thence for a few nights i paid a visit on the eve of the peace being settled between france and england to my brandy company of the old theater at portsmouth the bath commander had left that place for his regular winter quarters ships of war were sailing daily into the harbor to be paid off consequently money was plenty and the theater well filled i had not visited my friends for a full year i was therefore a kind of novelty besides having attained a supply of new characters the  0th of october      i acted lear also bays etc and finished with a crowded benefit and wellpleased theater i have often wished once more to walk those ramparts and take a retrospect of my juvenile part of life so frequently employed on that spot where i was then so highly gratified with friends pleasure and credit whenever opportunity offers i will indulge myself for a few days with that trip from portsmouth i returned by the road through salisbury to bath where i expected without doubt an engagement but there my vanity or my hopes call it which you will were frustrated as to the theater mr arthur thought i asked too much and i that he offered too little in consequence thereof mr simpson of the great rooms obliged me with them to exhibit in and actually i had to a jumbed illconducted medley at  s per ticket not less than  0l and i was at very little expense mr fleming leading gratis in short the night was universally fashionable and every body was willing to serve me which easily accounts for any success of that kind however wonderful it may appear it actually had such general sanction that the theater was so deserted as to be obliged to be dismissed for the want of an audience on that evening an instance perhaps never before or since there within living memory i had a second night on thursday dec    and very genteely attended   l it was much better conducted and approved and would have been more lucrative had my first been more properly considered  from thence i went to bristol where i had never before been and on tuesday february  st i had a most brilliant and crowded audience at the assembly room in princessstreet mr fleming assisted me again as leader and gave his quakers sermon on his violin for which he was much admired and applauded and was truly a worthy man and universally esteemed he was father to the miss flemings now of bath i returned the compliment in a small degree by once performing for his benefit at william wiltshires rooms on the   th november      at bath but he assisted me twice there and twice at bristol  i was much obliged to the ladies and gentlemen at bristol for their general patronage and their kindnesses shown me on those nights as except mr church at the white lion broadstreet bristol i did not know even the names of three people in that opulent city my whole time there was entirely confined to mr and mrs church they behaved with great kindness to me as i was very ill under their care in a fever near three weeks  to mr church at bristol sir as i have not had any letter from my son since wednesday sennight that he was then ill i am under great anxiety of mind concluding he is worse and if so beg you will let no attendance or advice be wanting and that if he is not able to write i beg the favor you will be so good as send me a line by return of the post for if my son is as i greatly fear ill i will upon your answer set out for bristol i beg you not to fail writing as to a mother whose earthly happiness is placed in the life and health of her only child  i am sir your most humble servant g wilkinson london feb        please to direct for me halfmoonstreet in the strand     on my recovery from thence i returned by bath to london for a few days recreation and then set off on an invitation i had received from mr ivory manager of the norwich theater so there was another new trip mr hurst whom i had known in ireland was appointed the directing manager and i believe was the occasion of the offer mr hurst i had often met in my adventuring as garrick termed it and his behavior at norwich was kind and attentive to a degree both as to my profit when my benefit was to be fixed and in every other particular in return i really underwent infinite labor for he worked me not as an horse of blood but as an horse for burdens i even now sink at the very thought of how i drudged and toiled in that theatrical norwich mine  on monday february         i played othello on saturday march   the minor mr bannister senr was there and took his first ideas of mimicry from seeing me play those parts in the minor cadwallader and other of mr footes pieces my playing in the minor drew repeated and increasing good houses this may appear as a stretch but mr dodd was there to whose services i have been much obliged at york he was a reigning favorite at that time and i call on him to vouch that though the city of norwich is not the most theatrical town in the kingdom yet that audience to any piece that is well received will bear a more repeated acting of it than any other town of the size whatever i think the padlock was acted twentyfive nights the first season now that to be accomplished from its production there with only four plays or but three in aweek i look upon to be equal to fifty times in london norwich season was then five months i acted bays four play nights progressively  saturday march    monday    tuesday    and thursday    the rehearsal was much liked though not calculated for any audience to pit box and gallery it out of the meridian of london dublin edinburgh bath or york prince volsius was acted by mr dodd and the present clever mr bannister played the grave sententious mr smith the gentleman usher mr weston who had not then acted in london and was not in any degree of eminence as a comedian i do not believe take it for all in all that norwich ever had a better company than that identical season mr chalmers was there as a comic actor and i fear i speak truth when i say i verily believe he was a greater favorite than weston he was father to mr chalmers with me at york some seasons a young man of merit and a very good harlequin  i will here mention that an adventure of mine related by mrs bellamy in her sixth volume relative to mr chalmers the comedian of norwich passing for wilkinson the york manager is no more than strictly true however vague romantic and improbable it may appear to a stranger i have been often taxed as to its authenticity but the following persons are still inhabiting this earthly globe and must remember the transaction mentioned  sir john sinclair mr woods mr bland mr moss mr death mr beynon mrs webb mr and mrs charteris mrs inchbald and others were all then at glasgow and subscribed to assist the strange mr chalmers at that time the day i met my friend socia wilkinson at hollytown was on saturday the   th of april      but as that matter is not in the least relative to my adventures at norwich and lest i should stray until i am bewildered i will get back to that town and inform the reader that after being cordially and partially received in several principal characters my benefit night there was fixed on monday april         i had been lucky to a degree in having the honor to please the inhabitants of norwich and almost every part repeated again also the farces were approved and bucks have at ye all there was no end to i played at my benefit king lear and promised to treat all the ladies and gentlemen with tea which was seriously taken by the people in general as a contract they expected would be fulfilled it was thought very expensive and would be attended with much difficulty and trouble but mr wilkinson was vastly genteel but then how would he be able to find cups and saucers for such a quantity of people why to be sure the quality folks were to be served first then a fresh washing of the  to be humbly presented to tom mary darby and joan in the galleries what i am dcribing is more serious than will be supposed redble and however unlikely though it is the  it is not the only instance of the kind with which my readers shall hereafter be made acquainted i have the pleasure to say i was myef much pleased at the very great compliment pad me as at the usual prices from that time to the present there has not i have been given to understand been ten such crowded houses seen at norwich in the tedious round of twentyseven years in short the town was in a mob at three oclock in the afternoon to secure a first seat if possible to see mr wilkinson and drink a dish of tea with him the interlude given that night as tea was the same kind of mixed entertainment consisting chiefly of the imitations of those actors and the same materials which had been so greatly received in london dublin etc and with which the reader has been pestered from the first volume of this complex  what do you call it  something  nothing of a book for the work will certainly be allowed originality and that no such hurlothrumbo production as to information of jumbled matter and anecdotes ever before appeared what is more extraordinary than the strange mistake which arose in the peoples ideas should not only have been taken as seriously offensive at norwich then but it actually laid the foundation for fabricating a thousand stories and fame increasing as she goes told the tale with wonderful additions to the children of that time and remembered by those young ones who then could not lisp yet they can now relate what their daddies told them of me wilkinson who promised to give all the town tea and behaved so ill he would not keep his promise but made a joke of it on eagles wings immortal scandals fly while virtuous actions are but born and die   it was soon after my departure circulated and even put at length into the newspapers which must be true that i was obliged to secure my personal safety by flight that i ordered a post chaise with four horses took all the money which had been received that night into a large silk handkerchief without waiting to count if all was right and got out of norwich with all expedition lest i should have been torn in pieces by the enraged multitude and when i arrived in london they said wilkinson laughed at the norwich flats and an hundred ridiculous falsehoods of that kind were propagated and handed carefully down by that generation and piously transmitted to their children now the plain matter of fact was no more than by not satisfying them really with the eager expected tea the thirst for which was so great that i verily believe had mr garrick been king lear they would have thought the play had been too long but when they found no tea they did not relish what i was doing as the way by any means to make them amends for the insult they supposed i had wilfully given to their understandings but what was more my likeness of mr barry mr sparks or any of the london performers was greek to them and it was natural for them not to admire what they could not by any means comprehend the difference of audiences in such like circumstances is amazing a farce if it possesses true humor in london will be greatly relished and applauded  the country very possibly the same even decently acted shall be termed vile low vulgar and indelicate the love for love of congreve the trip to scarborough the way of the world the confederacy and others are in london attended to as plays of wit and merit witness their constant repetition but in the country not permitted or if permitted to appear not upon any account fashionable which is just as bad  the same unlucky reception of my tea at norwich would happen to the ablest imitator in london supposing he gave the strongest likenesses of the edinburgh and york actors a london audience so tried would feel not only chagrined and disappointed but would give such tokens of resentment and anger as would far exceed that of the enraged norwichers my farce that night helped to confirm my disgrace for out of london certainly no one was so very likely to displease as mr footes orators not only quite obsolete but local let any person now take it up of the age of twentyfive and it will puzzle the best head to find out or comprehend how at that time even in london an audience could possibly be entertained by it however well acted the porterclub the last scene of the farce gave it a complete overthrow though assisted by mr weston their patience was quite exhausted and i could barely make a finish i dare say no lady can feel this account more forcibly than mrs wells for without being on the spo to judge as a witness and though surrounded by many friends and even the royal support of majesty she found i dare guess a material differenc between giving her imitations of mrs siddon and mrs crawford at covent garden theater than before the best collected audience at cheltenham  as peter paragraph in the orators that night i only recollect a few nonsensical lines of mr footes not printed which he always spoke and occasioned a laugh the character was draw as a likeness of mr alderman george faulkner an eminent printer well known in dublin for which performance he sued mr foot and cast him for damages  when foot wrote the part he had two legs but mr faulkner had but one foot afterward sutained the same loss myself too nearly experienced the same painful and dreadful misfortune thank god not quite so unfortunate when i was before the judge in the court of justice as sbpoened on trial i related the following addional lines as peter paragraph  peter par ant please your worship mrs paragraph was as beautiful a woman and of as good a family as any in all ireland  her sister too is a perdigius agreeable woman  she has perhaps one of the finest necks of any lady in all dublin i encountered her one morning upon the middle of the stairs  my hand fell accidentally upon her bosom and i protest and vow please your worhip it gave me such a thrill i felt it at the bottom of my dead limb  second story as peter paragraph  peter par my wife mrs paragraph was a pergi agreeable woman as we were returning to ireland in october in the year      0 during the autumnal equinox a violent storm arose i went down into the cabin unto her and said mrs paragraph my dear answer me one question  sink or swim have you been untrue unto my bed says that dear woman by way of reply my dear  sink or swim that secret shall go along with me  o she was a perdigius valuable woman  you might have trusted her with any thing  at those little jokes i was applauded in peter paragraph but as to the stories circulated and believed about my running away from conviction of intentional affront from myself they were too ridiculous to tell and more so to be credited what added to the idea of designed insult that night was at the conclusion of my tea i gave a medley which mr garrick himself had wrote for mr beard and given to me he designed it first as a compliment to mr beard for his ranelagh benefit but after that he altered it for the playhouse  the lines taken as rude were the very harmless ones that follow to a common tune  now if you think i am wrong in all i have said or sung and wish that poor i had been dumb dumb dumb though the fish are in the net yet i shall fume and fret and though i have caught you be mum mum mum i therefore beg and pray that nothing you will say lest others next year should not come come come for if like you they are taught they will not like you be caught and therefore i pray you all mum mum mum their being in an ill humor and my singing those lines in the medley very gravely as i judged a very good joke they absolutely took seriously and occasioned all the bustle and nonsense here related and in resentment they echoed back  hum hum hum and it was agreed nem con that i intentionally laughed at them  to speak my thoughts on the matter i perceived myself much injured by such illsuspicions and misconstructions on all i had done and i really had fatigued myself more that night hoping to please than almost any one i ever performed before or since as it was too much even for a stronger constitution than mine  as i remained on the spot instead of quitting norwich my very extraordinary departure from which i shall immediately give an account of that must satisfy all who believe or disbelieve to the contrary  during my residence there my mother gave me e following account of her illness by which t will be perceived as a son i did not neglect that precious friend my dear tate i had the pleasure of yours on tuesday but was neither able nor willing to inform you that i have been so far gone as to be obliged with great reluctance to have the further advice of an eminent physician  i am but just begun with his advice but having done all i resign myself to the great disposer of life or death  i have had two very friendly visits from mrs batt lady forbes not very little noticed till this day two bottles of madeira with an offer of any thing in her power i know her good will would not be wanting  i pity her and think her situation more distressed than my own she offered writing to you but i said i had wrote and would again as soon as able i wonder not at your being heart sick of the minor feel glad at this weeks rest and should be still more happy if you would give way to a few serious thoughts why this is truly called the passion week you will excuse these little hints from one who is ever anxious both for your increasing happiness here and hereafter  your most affectionate mother g wilkinson london march          my dear tate your affectionate cares and unbounded offers far exceed what i could ever either expect or desire i thank god i have not wanted any necessary helps and for your kind fears that i do not cheer my spirits with eating and drinking you know i cannot bear two days plenty without being ill and i had as i told you dined out every day which occasioned my present illness i am i hope better but kept weak by physic mrs hutchinson sent me a chicken and six bottles of bristol water refreshing draughts of what use am i to think of a journey to bath at your expense  no my dear tate if i ever consent to that you must be there o complete the cure and as to accepting your princely offer of  0l for the journey oh that must be a most desperate and killing extremity indeed and could give no true nourishment whilst feeding so deep upon what you so industriously slave for but above all the overflowing joy and satisfaction you give completes the wishes of my soul in that serious just sense you express so sufficiently in few words of that awful reverence impressed by god upon your mind  hold there and be blessed for ever  the expeditious filling your boxes appears highly in your favor indeed but that pleasure seems still to be alloyed by the impossibilities set forth in your overworked bill for after lear alone i should wish you in a warm bed  though a sight of you even for one night would rejoice my heart yet i beg you will rest a night or two and as your trunk must be much shattered would have you get a new one and leave the old one here  having just made a comfortable meal of half a fine sweetbread with the blessing of god hope to be able to cook and eat with you by the time you talk of seeing again  your ever blessed and affectionate mother g wilkinson london apr           these short letters it is true have no particular connection with the work but the contents flowed from a pen of such true worth as will render them far from unacceptable to every worthy mind whether depresed or exalted as nature speaks with most miraculous organs  my benefit was monday april     and on wednesday the   th of april i acted  ouglas i also spoke bucks have at ye all and performed the usual parts in the minor sufficient duty for one night well or indifferently manoeuvered for i was threatened with strong marks of resentment and they were in reality very angry so i was prepared for and expected it yet i was such a favorite that when i made my appearance their goodnature got the better of their disgust and i was astonished at receiving my usual good welcome not a single mark of disapprobation thursday the   th i played mrs amlet and for the first time hartop in the knights sir gregory gazette mr weston tim mr dodd on saturday the   th was advertised my last night of playing i spoke bucks and repeated hartop the comedy i was not concerned in  it was rule a wife and have a wife acted purposely to introduce mr arry kennedy and was the only night the manager mr ivory had left as manager the regular course of beneits beginning the monday following  two offenses more in the course of the week i was informed i had committed but indeed very innocently it was at that time not only the custom there and a horrid custom it certainly was but also at york hull etc etc for the performer whether man or woman to attend the playbillman round the town knock humbly at every door honored with or without a rapper and supinely and obediently stop at every shop and stall to leave a playbill and request the favor of mr and mrs griskins company at the benefit the heroine if unmarried was equally responsible for steering her steps  no matter whether the juliet the cleopatra the lady townly or the quee elizabeth no dignity of any kind allowed fo such an omission without being construed a violation of duty that severe law of custom then i force must be complied with or looked on as a infringement of rules and respect and would incu censure with the appellation of pride impudenc insolence and want of reverence no matter ho severe the weather if frost snow rain or hai jane shore and the proud lady macbeth we expected equally to pay the same homage if th lady turtle dove was blessed with a loving mat her attendance was dispensed with but not other wise on any pretext whatever in that case th honor devolved on the husband these law thank god i had not been accustomed to an having a plentiful wellsupplied pocket had  need to comply or trouble myself to use such practice which i dae say superior minds to  own have from the dictates of prudence and n cessity against their will too often complied wit and the produce of my house proved such degrding rules were better broke than kept for the crdit of the actors and blessed be the times to s what i relate had better not have been mentione but be buried and forgot but there are those who can vouch to the inglorious and disgraceful truth and i can boast as being one of the first who relieved my brethren in the country from such slavery  another custom was after the play the performer was to return thanks and if married both husband and wife to appear mr frodsham once at york spoke a comic epilogue on his benefit night and actually carried his wife now living on and off the stage on his back to comply with the expected homage  on particular occasions four or five children to make up weight courtesying and bowing in frocks had a wonderful effect as the audience in general and the ladies in particular prided themselves upon bestowing their bounty on such a painstaking man or such a painstaking couple as they proved themselves to be though i had heard so much of those customs yet i was honorably received after all my alleged illbehaviour at norwich as usual with much pleasantry and good humor the last night of my acting there i made as polite an acknowledgement as lay in my power and meant what i said that i really thought myself as a stranger at norwich particularly honored and obliged which coming unexpectedly was received with double effect and i was dismissed with great glory and marks of approbation and the audience were not a little pleased that i confessed myself indebted to them for the favors they had conferred on me  now after such particulars it is really astonishing how such falsehoods to the contrary could be propagated and believed from that time      and never cleared up till      when i was last at norwich and will be much more so by this faithful account another strange custom they had at norwich and if abolished it has not been many years which was for a drummer and a trumpeter not the kings in every street to proclaim in an audible voice having been assisted by his shrill notes to summons each garreteer without which ceremony the gods would not submit to descend from their heights into the streets to inquire what play was to be acted nor ascend into the gallery  a custom of this kind prevailed so far with a mr herberts lincolnshire company in the time of our revered wellremembered and beloved marquis of granby that when at grantham the players determined to omit the usual ceremony of the drum wishing to grow more polite and by obstinate perseverance lady jane gray mary queen of scots king henry the eighth the king of france nay even cardinal wolsey had no command attraction or power over the populace when they lost their accustomed and so much loved sound of the drum and trumpet the ladies were obstinate though they could not by all their arts or by all their charms obtain a livelihood and their heroism was so great that they preferred death honorable death rather than submit to slavish terms the marquis of granby sent for the manager of the troop and said to him mr manager i like a play i like a player and shall be glad to serve you  but my good friend why are you all so suddenly offended at and averse to the noble sound of a drum  i like it said the marquis and all the inhabitants like it put my name on your playbill provided you drum but not otherwise try the effect on tomorrow night  then you are as thinly attended as you have a ely been shut up your playhouse at once but  it succeeds drum away the manager communicated this edict to the princes princesses peers and peeresses and not only they but even the mbitious stepmother gave up all selfconsideration for the public weal and it was after some debate voted nem con in favor of the drum they deigned to try lord granbys suggestion and to their pleasing astonishment their little theater was brimfull on the sound of the drum and lord granbys name after which night they rowdidowd away had a very successful season  drank flowing bowls to the health of the noble marquis they left grantham in great credit without being drummed out of town though accompanied by their friend the drummer and i am told the custom is continued at grantham to this day this is a strong proof how difficult it is to surmount prejudices whether in religion politics or even so trivial a matter as the sound of a drum for rumor has fewer tongues than she has ears  but my good reader observe i have not yet in my history got from norwich  if you will kindly look back to mr kennedys acting leon the last night i played there in      i must faithfully inform you that after all my quarrels etc with mr foot however contradictory to my resolves and mr footes repeated declarations he had secretly sent kennedy to norwich as an ambassador with credentials neither more nor less than not only to present articles of peace but for reuniting our forces and to engage weston for the ensuing summer at the haymarket mr kennedy was commissioned to assure me that mr foot was much concerned for the misunderstandings and mistakes which had subsisted between us for no less than five years that h wished mr kennedy as an acquaintance an friend of both would inform me i might depen upon his being serious and honorable in meaning an engagement which he hoped would prove lasting and advantageous to both that in many pieces dividing the parts would be better for each of us for however clever he might flatter himself to be from his own opinion and the partiality of the public he was convinced one person perpetually before the audience be he ever so excellent and meritorious had not so great an advantage as by a little space ere he was seen again a certain good remark for me then and many young performers now to remember his letter added that he had wrote a part purposely for me in a new farce called the mayor of garratt which  should cut out unless i would consent to perform it  also a division between us in tragedy alamode and that i should play hartop in the knights and he would act sir gregory etc  he asked what i desired for every night not only when i acted but every one that his theater in the haymarket was opened and that i might take my benefit at three weeks notice whenever i pleased in his season and be allowed to revive or act on that night what i thought proper and that it should be clear of all expenses whatever and concluded with assuring me he should not only be heartily and sincerely glad to see me as a performer but as his particular friend that his house and table should be always at my service if i would do him the favor to make it my home whenever not better engaged  this was a change and it was flattering profitable and reputable  i instantly made proposals which were immediately agreed to by a letter that reached me on my arrival at york and the first week in june i was to attend the haymarket theater  what made mr foot so very generous open and explicit was that he judged it would be lucrative to him if he complied as to terms  so it plainly appears that a war of five years was amicably and honorably concluded with a peace not inglorious but equitably adjusted for the advantage of both parties and from that time not any bickerings or breach of treaties happened between us to the time of his death in the autumn season       peace to his manes his entertaining qualities and universality of executive and astonishing genius are too well known established and acknowledged to need any eulogiums from my weak abilities he was not without virtues though he had those foibles and faults to which human nature is too subject  so foot farewell  all thy good now blazes all thy ill be buried in thy grave   from norwich i took a trip to york where i had never been and entered into a treaty with mr baker for six nights mr baker was the gentleman i named as manager of the york theater with whom i had previously formed an intimate acquaintance as beforementioned at mrs wiers in the autumn       as my norwich engagement finished on sunday april the   th i intended quitting that place on the monday morning following but as i had grown rich i at that time was wonderfully prudent and determined on a saving scheme so i gave up all idea of traveling so far as york and lolling all the way in a postchaise therefore the only prudent method was to go in the monday mornings coach as far as newmarket but i could not be permitted to take a place for half way unless they were left empty for want of london passengers which was and is i believe still the constant custom i was called up early on the monday morning to be ready for the coach but judge my disappointment and chagrin when on my approach i found it chuckfull as is often said at the theater what was to be done a postchaise i could not think of on account of the charge  there was no time allowed for consideration as ll was prepared and ready at the maids head for instant procedure i determined to leave norwich most triumphantly and at an easy expense  two points not always in the power of us mortals  by exalting myself on the coachbox a situation  was as unfit for as the undertaking to ride o horses at the royal grove  but previously i had petitioned reasoned urged and entreated but all to no effect i could not make any impression on the obdurate souls who proud and sulky kept easy and firm possession of their seats and hardly deigned to answer when i requested permission to be squeezed in but could not soften their hard hearts and under the rose be it spoken no hearts are harder than those of travelers in stage coaches diligences etc and not without some reason for if not guarded by hearts of steel it would with the conjoined interest of innkeepers and postboys be a perpetual tax upon our goodnatures our convenience and our pockets as we should pay for what we did not possess however the inside passengers on that occasion called aloud on mr whip to drive on so my trunks etc were left in the basket and i was hoisted on the coachbox as the only alternative but on the first movement of the vehicle if it had not been for the arm of the coachman i should have been instantly under the wheels in the street as i had not the least notion how to keep my seat  therefore the enraged travelers were under the necessity of once more being detained till i was relieved by the help of the hostler and servants o the inn who were there and full ready to assist i was received into their arms from the coachbox and chucked into the basket as a place of more safety though not of ease or comfort where i suffered most severely from the jolting particularly over the stones it was most truly dreadful and made me suffer almost equal to the seasickness i had experienced on board the packet in a storm however as i had lived well at norwich the coach emetic did me no harm  the stage coaches then were not hung on springs as they are at present nor were the roads near so good  the coach was then double the time in performing the journey we arrived at newmarket where though i produced myself as an outside passenger i was permitted the honor of being treated at table as an inside guest for they all knew me and pitied my situation but naturally preferred my suffering some torment rather than being miserably stowed themselves by cramming the vehicle as if loaded with norwich turkies at christmas and that merely to accommodate a stranger we of the coach all supped together separated for bed wished each other a good night with pleasant and safe journies to our different destinations they to london myself to cross the country till i got to the great north road  on inquiry i was informed a stage crossed from either ipswich or bury i forget which the next day about twelve which i determined to wait for and i conceived it a matter of pleasing intelligence for it had a delightful convenience as to the hour of its coming as it allowed me a long time to rest before it arrived after i had breakfasted on tuesday the coach stopped and from out of it to my infinite mortification came no less than six passengers therefore i thought of nothing but ringing the bell and having immediate recourse to the agreeable though expensive postchaise but on inquiry one of the persons had only taken a place to newmarket in order to be in readiness for the next norwich coach to london so after an hours baiting for the guests and horses we took possession of the vehicle proceeded slowly and arrived about three oclock at cambridge where finding not any other carriage crossed on to the north road i sat myself down at the inn a very indifferent one and ordered whatever was ready to be produced for my immediate dinner  while i was regaling over my pigeon pie etc a very decent elderly looking kind of man a farmer made his appearance seemingly communicative and intelligent i asked him questions relative to the distance from stamford and what places were best worth seeing at cambridge this formed an intimate chat and he accepted part of my bottle of port when i thought of ordering my chaise after a little walk to view the gardens and buildings of the place in a cursory manner and taking my leave of the farmer who had been very attentve to my story and relating to him my manner of traveling from norwich to cambridge he said after carefully viewing me that he kept a traveling weekly cart which he came with from stamford he was not fond of trusting strangers as appearances often were wrong but if instead of the expense of a postchaise i would accept his horse at a moderate price and go that night to huntington the poor beast was at my service for the journey and he would himself with my lugge go in his cart which his man would conduct  relished the scheme mightily and judged i was ndertaking a quixote exploit by my attemptg to ride a horse sixteen miles this great atter was that afternoon put in practice and i t off on my rosinante and achieved my exloit by actually going the sixteen miles witht any danger whatever and fancied myself a mplete horseman but must observe what th the delay in point of time the stopping all ght at huntington etc my scheme of oecomy was only visionary for the etceteras would have been more comfortable and actually l expensive than the laborious and mean plan  in my wisdom had entered upon the carrie however honored me so far with his good opinion first securing my luggage that he went off at si in the morning for stamford and left me and the horse to take our leisure having first very kindl invited me to dine with him at stamford when i got there i called to see him and he really expected me as his guest but that i avoided sent  porter for my luggage thanked the carrier and once more became the gentleman at one of the principal inns waiting for the york coach with strict orders at night to be called up at five for the purpose of securi g a place but after loungin my lonely day at stamford and being summoned to be in readiness for the coach here my unfortunate stars again pursued me for lo the coac was full with three officers and three insignificants in that bewildered and perplexed state wha was to be done why give a strong proof of perseverance and in defiance of danger and like  great little soul for surely it was a meanness onc more throw myself into the arms of my old frien the basket it was very sharp windy cold disagreeable weather and the jolting over the stones i every country town in that captive state might b deemed truly dreadful both as to pain and fatigu the officers who in general are polite friendly entertaining and agreeable soon recognized me and professed being hurt at my disagreeable situation but their feelings were not so exquisite and humane but that laughter evidently was victorious on the occasion to me jumbling through grantham was terrible and equalled to my fancy that o algerine slavery yet though i appeared to myself like a vagabond passing by act of parliament from parish to parish and felt great cold without i had some amends by being admitted as one of their own party at every stage within or where y refreshments were taken which was some eviation to my sorrows though not satisfactory or those sorrows as too often is the case were of my own bringing on as foolish indiscretions often give a strong color to appearances that serve to corroborate as facts which originate every one of them perhaps from a trivial and undesigned chance that tumbles blunder upon blunder till it forms a something which if properly known would end  ke the airblown bubble of the day  so was i rightly punished in my journey to york by undergoing shame fatigue and the hazard of my health while i possessed a plenty to have prevented any one of those vexations for i suffrd myslf to be hoisted from my dogkennel r two days stage after stage but as under the greatest afflictions sometimes a gleam of hope will arise though soon again to vanish so in this journey on the first night the three officers at supper agreed to take a chaie at ferrybridge and quit the york road for that of boroughbridge and proceed on to scotland this gave me great spirits as it insured me an inside place for my first entrance into the city of york where rather than arrive basketted i would have entered triumphantly in my carriage to breakfast the next day but all my hopes were frustrated by a change of their intentions and on they would go to york as their places were taken so far the reader may suppose i am not adhering to truth when i mention we were two days in going from stamford to york but in the year      the roads were so bad at particular seasons of the year that they were for want of proper forming almost impassable and it has been known in the winter to have been eight or ten days journey from york to london at that time it was not so familiar as it now is for ladies and gentlemen to fly like airballoons from the farthest points of east and west and from north to south for a lady now thinks not of hardship but of pleasure when she equips herself en militaire for a voyage to the east indies either with a husband or for a husband there is not at present half the preparation to quit yorkshire for a few weeks and trip to paris as there was sixty years ago to go only from york to london cibbers john moody gives an excellent description of that matter fathers and mothers then made their wills ere they set forward and the leaving a darling pet son either at york or london to learn politeness education and good manners not forgetting the fashions were matters required more than common fortitude in short two hundred miles in this enlightened age is no more considered as a journey than formerly to dine at windsor from london was which could hardly be done with the assistance of four horses and a moonlight morning  the old saying at london amongst servants was i wish you were at york which the enged female cook now has changed for i wish you were at jamaica scotland was then imagined by the cockney as a dreary place distance almost as the west indies now an agreeable party may with the utmost ease dine early in the week in grosvenorsquare and without discompoure set down at table on saturday or sunday in the newtown of edinburgh  so did i atain the journey in the basket in severe weather and jolting till the coach stopped at ferrybridge when to my joy and great comfort the officers ok chaise and i got into as i at that moment thought the most elegant delightful carriage i ever stepped into in my life i arrived safe at york and supped with mr baker that worthy man received me like a parent would not suffer me to be at an inn or hire a lodging but yielded up his own convenience of bedchamber for a very inconvenient situation in point of comparison and unless i ordered what i liked for dinner the family might have been starved the old gentleman was so very attentive and earnest to make it pleasant to his young guest  saturday april         romeo and juliet with the frenchified lady never in paris was plaistered on the walls for the benefit of mr buck this year was the first spring meeting that ever had been attempted at york it did something as to resort of company but the year after it sunk entirely and was not again revived till within a few years back at present it seems to promise a lasting establishment  my first appearance was on saturday april the  0th in the minor which was acted after richard iii and on tuesday may the  d for the second time after the busy body  marplot mr frodsham i was well received by a very genteel house the ladies of york without any compliment have a grace a manner a decorum not often met with out of the metropolis bth excepted for york certainly boasts a preeminence when the boxes on public weeks are crowded that dazzles the eyes of a stranger and no wonder for as london and bath culls the choicest beauties from the three kingdoms so does ancient york city at times allure them from hull eeds doncaster wakefield pontefract and every part of that noble spacious and rich county and i am free to declare that the ladies of york in y judgment never show themselves to such advantage as when they fill the boxes of the york theater and for the sake of a person that shall be meless i should be happy in having the honor o seeing it so graced and enlivened much oftener han it is  my next appearance was in cadwallader  mrs cadwallader by miss philips my old acquaintnce in dublin in      miss philips was when  first acted at york in great esteem with many nteel persons and she was so kind as to assure  her acquaintance that i was no impostor but e true don philip she having played for mr wilkinsons benefit in dublin when the pit and oxes were thrown together if that favorable ormation was not of real service it was meant ell and could do no harm but indeed i may irm it deserves even now an acknowledgement for her good report though she hears it not nor sees  not she meant well  who can do more  miss warnford was then at york who was kind of patroness to her and i believe to her fa account of me to that lady i must set down my self a considerable debtor to miss philips mi warnford has been many years married to m sitwell a gentleman of large fortune whose whose integrity and good qualities are so generally know as to render any panegyric impertinent but th ever constant and benevolent acts of friendship have experienced from mr and mrs sitwel would sink me into ingratitude did i not thus present my small tribute to their worth and sincerel assure them how much i esteem myself honor and obliged  my third character was bays in the rehearsa which was judged a service of danger mr frodsham being esteemed capital in the part but the opinion was wrong for i had been so familiarize to that kind of playing and was so much bett stage acquainted that i obtained a complete vitory in spite of partiality which in general obstinate yet must be allowed often praisewothy indeed mr frodsham was totally un for that character and his friends as well as th rest of the audience would have found that ou had not five out of six subscribed to whatever  did was quite right without even consulting their own judgments i repeated the minor on saturday and on wednesday the   th of may i acted king lear and frodsham edgar in the mad scenes he was the best i have seen though i remember poor reddish whilst i am relating it my lear was greatly received as it did not interfere with their darling frodsham and both being a the same play gave much satisfaction  saturday may    the fair penitent  horato mr wilkinson lothario mr frodsham and the minor  tuesday may         the ason finished for my benefit with the jealous wife and duke and no duke  i acted oakley and trappolin but depended on the ccess of my never failing tea as to attracon  i was favored with a crowded audince both before and behind the curtain for e stage was filled with gentlemen at that time admittance behind the scenes was allow not only at benefits but in general to the gentlemen  frequented the boxes  but my ea scalded their mouths and though they were t ready to set the hue and cry after me as at norwich yet they grumbled much and the next day i heard of nothing but what a shame it was  have made mr wilkinson so fine a benefit and  return he only laughed at and insulted them  hum hum hum in short it was evident in the opinion of every body i only sneered at the york audience and that it was little better than picking their pockets and a great deal more and worse for slander is told readily and swallowed glibly   slander whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue out venoms all the worms of nile whose breath rides on the posting winds and does belie all corners of the world kings queens and states maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave this viperous slander enters    this was certainly irksome but patience ever was my badge and what i had done deserved praise though they had not done me justice for as i had gained laurels by my endeavors and dint of hard labor for which though i own i got money and in that material point was well satisfied yet all my glories withered and every wreath was torn from my brow so instead of a triumpha exit mine was certainly a degraded one however y pocket was full my health was good and my spirits were great and not aided but rathe lessened by too much of the grape therefore  fig for care  after my northern expedition i had twelve o fourteen days to spare for relaxation so i pockete my affronts and proceeded to see my frien daniel smith at chester where i drank the health of all my york friends not in tea but over a bottle perhaps two or three of claret with mr wilberham and several others of that place and a very happy visit it was to me though not without fatigue for what we generally term pleasre by a mistaken use of the idea is perverted too ten to the contrary effect by not letting reason give t its boundaries however i recollected business must be attended to as without the means i well knew pleasure and friends would be very distant for independence creates complacency and eagerness to please which dependence in a few days destroys so i veered about like the weathercock from west to south to visit once more my native home old london city where every one is witty and all the streets are paved with gold and to renew my acquaintance with my  old intimate mr foot whom i had not spoke to for some years  when i arrived at my lodgings i need not repeat the anxious mother was not only rejoiced but m st speechless to see her son after an absence of several months and the more so on account of her late illness before elated by letters to norich etc after a few days solace on my own spot of birth parentage and education i paid my evors to the manager at the haymarket theater where i found mr foot earnestly employed in  work of training his militia company to prepar for a summer campaign he soon espied me i the orchestre where i had observingly placed my self the rehearsal was soon finished i mounte the stage and after a most friendly greeting to th astonishment of every one the most amazin coalition of intimacy made its wonderful appearance and equalled any change politics had ever presented to view the troop was mute glad b more surprised when the carriage was ordere and mr foot insisted on my dining with hi that day as a large party of the first persons we to be at his table i did not expect such civility but it may easily be supposed i could not resis it also seemed to augur an intention of goo will at least and if not a good dinner goo company and mr foot at the head of the tabl few persons even of rank would have disliked besides it placed me not only on a footing of super ority but prevented any suspiion in myself  to illtreatment from mr foot of which i h not entirely divested my mind he was the preparing his mayor of garratt in which piece  ha wrote a part he informed me that was fact abstracted from the piece and that he coul  with or without it it was impossible for hims o do it for with a false belly for his intend major sturgeon and to undress for matthew mug it was not practicable the part was ented peter primmer intended as a stroke of sae levelled at mr sheridan senr who about that time had busied himself much with delivering  ures on oratory and proposing a plan for the e ishment of an academy for the teaching of pp s the true art of public speaking  mr foot mentioned our appearing together in the piece of the minor for said he the public wl be better pleased with having both than one and added however partial the town might be to him as author and actor combined yet the same person being perpetually in sight is cloying and ineed i have often thought that admirable character of othello would be better for the actor if not so incessantly in sight more pity and less fatigue to the performer would have been the consequence had shakespeare so contrived but his writings are so noble wonderful and natural that i do not approve of the liberty i have taken but will remove my remark more strongly upon my favorite character of zanga which is finely drawn and a charming part for the actor but is much hurt by his beginning and ending almost every act of the play and though it must be granted the poetry is fine yet as it owes its beauties to the production of art not that of nature it makes the revenge a heavy laborious tiresome play though alonzo carlos zanga and leonora are all good parts for the performers zanga particularly so  well i must return to mr foot with whom i dined and it was agreed the minor should be the opening piece early in june      shift and squintum mr wilkinson  mrs cole and smirk mr foot  with the new farce of the mayor of garratt my shift with the imitations was extravagantly well received and was repeated several nights  the mayor of garratt had great success and a run of almost every night in the season it met with some opposition which in general only gives a whet to the appetite of those who choose to approve and support  peter primmer i dressed with an old tyewig like the barbers in the upholsterer a long band neckcloth a large rod in my right hand and a scotch played night gown and had six boys with primmers and rods and six girls with hornbooks as my attendants in procession as the candidate for being chosen mayor of garratt my likeness was strong and it was well taken and as a schoolmaster at garratt near wandsworth the dress was ridiculous and not totally improper but as a resemblance of mr sheridan who always appeared at his lecture and every where as a gentleman my being too comical destroyed the effect therefore it was judged much better to answer the purpose intended to dress it in black and a bagwig etc that alteration gave the people a strong conception of him they knew whereas the ridiculous wig and gown destroyed every part of the imitation by the absurd appearance the part i have entirely forgot and only remember it concluded with my speaking the following verses as an ode from the old hornpipe song of nancy dawson of all the girls in our town the black the fair the red the brown that dance and prance it up and down there is none like nancy dawson her easy mien her shapes so neat she foots she trips she looks so sweet her every motion is complete i die for nancy dawson  how she comes to give surprise with joy and pleasure in her eyes to give delight she always tries o charming nancy dawson etc   the above song spoken seriously with exact tone and manner had an admirable force on the bility of the wellpleased audience  mentioning my mock ode as peter primmer will not let me omit what at present gives me great pleasure from the lately seeing and hearing mrs esten recite that excellent composition collinss ode on the passions  but as her stage performances cannot with the least degree of propriety be here inserted to accord with my proposed plan and as the actors and actresses o the york theater will make an appearance in print hereafter with their regular progression als the london and other performers etc etc  will by way of a sandwich halt for a few minute refreshment and present the reader with our yor woodfalls opinion relative to the high promis to the public at large from that ladys pleasing and extensive abilities after an eulogium o

listened to her lyre but all neglected and alone her feeling and her fire were gone no zephyr fondly sud her breast no nightingale came there to rest the fading visions fled her eyes the visions of her ecstacies and if perchance she sought delight it was amid the gloom of night it was to hear the screechowls cry or whistling whirlwinds rend the sky to pour her melancholy strain and catch a pleasure from the pain ien beheld her haggard air at twilight as she wandered there and felt the sympathetic woe that taste and genius ever know then eager sought the citys throng to vindicate the

rapturous join the hallowed voice where endless seraphim reoice o collins whatsoever thou art deign deign to bless thy estens heart a portion of those oys reveal which sure she well deserves to feel of the person of mrs esten we will venture to say that it is truly captivating that the is happy in the disposition of it all must acknowledge blessed with a set of features uncommonly lovely and expressive a voice at once powerful and plaintive cheerful and mellow her merit as far as we are able to judge from what we have hitherto seen is nearly equal in the grave and in the gay  and yet wonderful to relate with all these perfections she is scarcely known in london and as we are informed not even engaged there    mr foot all that season continued everv act of civility in his power his table was my constant resort when not engaged either at south end or at his lodgings in town for the haymarket theater then was on a smaller scale and the  house in suffolkstreet did not apperta n as now to the theater i supposed he judged  interest to be on terms and i was superior to any ill treatment being in fact the richest man of the two i was getting money perpetually did not owe a shilling and was in possesssin of some hundreds therefore was an independent gentleman mr foot now and then got a great deal of money which was soon expended e theater only by permission from the lord chamberlain during pleasure and he owed many hudreds nay even at last i am afraid i relate a truth when i affirm his funeral was at mr jewe expense for notwithstanding his income from mr colman was not less than sixteen hundred a year besides profits on the nights he acted yet have been informed he had not effects by  means equal to the payment of his debts it shks me to have related an account of so many  struck geniusses of birth and talents that have  a acrifice to grinning poverty and incurred ect and ignominy with great incomes pray  to allot me a more fortunate finale be its ment appointed for a longer or a shortr date but to proceed with a more particular account our haymarket sessions  i gained ground with the audience weekly  my benefit was fixed o the  0th of august on which night i revived the rehearsal and acted bays  the house overflowe from every part  no such receipt the whole season mr garrick was in italy and had not acted bays for some years  my imitation o holland in the following lines  how strange a captive am i grown of late shall i accuse my love or blame my fate my love i cannot that is too divine and against fate what mortal dares repine had such a sudden effect that mr churchill wh sat in a balcony with the late lucy cooper afte laughing to a very violent degree most vociferously encored the speech which was echoed by the whole voice of the theater and complied with by me of course with great pleasure mr churchi said that he was convinced i was not a mimics mimic for the imitations were palpabl my own  he also encored my mock hornpipe which was a resemblance of the manner of stage dancing the whole play went off with universal satisfaction and i was highly delighted mr foot that night was not pleased but rather chagrined at my good fortune  these things will happen and stage minds in general are sooner irritated and hurt than any other set of peoples bu a theater is the temple of vanity and vanty an envy are its constant residents  the farce on my benefit was the mayor of garratt in which mr foot of course played his major sturgeon  mr mendez a jew and an appraiser in bowstreet was the treasurer that season on his benefit he requested me to repeat the character of bays which entreaty i granted  he had a full house and the comedy received additional credit i had very near been deprived of the play as mr footes theater at that time merely consisted of a w trumpery scenes no wardrobe but such as was hired from mr barbers in monmouthstreet and as to stage properties they were less known there than in the most distant rustic comany that scoured the country round i was quite out of favor at drury lane so had no opes of assistance from that quarter but mrs rich on application being made to her supplied me with thunder lightning earth moon and sun also sent to my aid a full troop of horse they had been well trained were very quiet and of a great ae were never turbulent though sometimes troube with headstrong wanton riders it was a custom for the gentleman and his lady who were proprietors of the haymarket theater to reserve a x for themselves of which they kept the key i sent a card the week of my benefit requesting the favor of that box as all the others were disposed of a very rude refusal was sent back at which time mr rusini now of pall mall and some gentlemen were with me and complaining of not being able to procure anv box whatever on my receiving an uncivil answer i said damn this mrs proprietor it would serve her illnatured spleen right to break open the door and fill the box the hint was no sooner given than seriously taken and put into practice for as soon as the doors were opened a large party paid and finding every place was taken except the roprietors which the boxkeeper assured them could not be opened on any pretext whatever they unanimously burst the old lock and filled the whole box nor had the turnky of the recess rhetoric sufficient to have he least effect for expostulation did not signify so they remained sole masters and sat in triumph till near seven when the play was going to begin at which instant up came a limb of the law no less a personage than mr george garrick escorting the lady proprietress with a large party gratis who sumoned the garrison to surrender and be treated as prisoners of war but they wee as obstinate as urks and determined to defend the citadl sword in hand the lady proprietress was astonished at the rudeness committed and insisted on her privileged right then tried angry and soothing words but neither her persuasive eloquence nor the authority of mr george garrick aided by john do and richard r of westminster hall with all their united prowess could by any means avail the possessers of the inside works defended their intrenchment from any breach and they only in exultation auged and told geo garrick if himself and party would pay a crown per head they should be admitted not otherwise it cannot be imagined that it was an ea matter to extract coin from a lawers pocket consequently the lay george garrick and party finding it ineffectual by staying in the box passage retreated in disgrace but denounced vengeance on wikinson for my own part  chuckled at the adventure not so much for the trifling peuniary advantage i had ained but at that time i should ave disliked the curious garricks party gratis over my head more than any other next day the enraged lady waited on mr foot who loved mishief and despised his landlady where she gave an ample scope to her anger and repeated her wrngs but mr foot told her it was impose to prevent what had happened as to the proper conduct respecting the box he could oy say he was sorry for her disappointment and s to r wilkinsons rudeness he wished to excse it but he had not sufficient authority to whip  for his fault and there the matter rested ending evidently to my advantage for i must mention that the year following the lady herself sent permission for me to let her box to any particular friend of mine if the boxes were so taken as to make such permission necessary on my benefit night  early in september as is customary on the approach of the royal theaters opening we finished our summers campaign which ended gloriously not a little aided by the assistance of our militia major sturgeon  the night of my departure when i went to receive my blessing and take leave of my mother she had sunk her spirits so low with the strong prognostic of her departing from this life that she had been obliged to retire to bed and her feelings were so affectionately strong she could only embrace kiss and bedew me with her tears and inarticulately say o tate my dear son i shall never see you more her words were indeed truly prophetic and from that awful and distressing moment  i will relieve my reader and myself from the sensation which must occur  i departed heavily but got into the carriage and proceeded immediately for proud salop known better by the title of shrewsbury  mr whitley was manager of that company and a man well known as an extraordinary character of oddity and rudeness in his traffic with actors and actresses for his imaginary dominions which domains were here today and gone tomorrow at that place the facetious the witty the generous the good chase price of revered memory to all who knew him was appointed commander of the shropshire militia which had not been embodied as i was informed during the whole war which had then providentially ceased ti l the month of oct      owing to some dispute and disgust with the inhabitants of that county who had universally judged their young men illused as they had some years before this mentioned period thought themselves highly injured by government as they had raised a regiment for home defense trusting on that pledge of honor which was broke in a cruel manner as they were marched off to the sea coast were there surprised forced on board transports and sent to the indies and all spoken of as creditable farmers sons  that obstacle as the stories of the day went was given as the reason why the shropshire regiment had not been raised in common with those of the other counties and all these difficulties had not been overcome till october      shrewsbury to all who know that spot i need not say is surrounded by a most pleasing country  captain plume speaks well of it in the recruiting office and the raven n or tavern therein mentione i believe to this day is the favorite and fashion able house of resort i acted in that town wit mr whitleys company six or seven nights for clear benefit which was my first point for striking at and it proved very lucrative but i ever worked like a horse at a mill to deserve my engagement whether in town or country my benefi was appointed at my desire on monday october   that day i beg the reader will notice wa the first day of the militias assembling and wha was really extraordinary happened on the annua fair for cattle at shrewsbury and it is no more strange than true that they were to assemble it the marketplace the louds approved it not for it was as dreadful and riny a morning as eve poured upon the earth the pavement rattled with the bursts of heavy rain and hail accompanied with thunder and lightning the officers judged i prudent to file off and the young cackling recruits from instinct followed at the very time the oxen cows sheep horses etc were mustering for the fair and with the variety of collected captains sereants country bumpkins etc it occasioned an uncommon tumult noise and distress to those concerned without doors but to the spectators who were so happy as to possess a warm room with a good casement it afforded a very whimsical mornings view from the apparent ridiculous distress of the various parties interwoven of men and beasts etc as the oxen ran helter skelter amidst the soldiers populace etc  my benefit bill of that night was nearly as follows  the last night monday october        the rehearsal bays mr wilkinson end of the play by particular desire the principal scene ro the new farce called the mayor of garratt e character of major sturgeon of the westinster militia by mr wilkinson also a scene from the orators peter paragraph by mr wilkinson with the farce of the citizen young philpot mr wilkinson  surely i gave them enough fr teir money whatever it might want in quality the house was crowded in every part particularly  sage by gentlemen for want of room in the front of the house the officers of the new militia were all there and at their head the everentertaining hae price whom i r joiced to see he had sent e a compliment at noon being my benefit d wa between the acts in great spirits chatting  e and others at the end of the comedy  the rehersal he esired to wish mr bays gd night as he found himself much fatigued  his journey and expected a severe bout the ext day with the bottle at the mess where he was president he said he would get a good nights rest having traveled from london to shrewsbury without going to bed on his departure i retired to dres fr the ew part of major sturgeon the reader will observe that farce was not then in pin on my appearance behind the scenes as the major i thought the countenances of several of the officers did not augur a pleasing effect to my intended performance but not supposing any violent anger could possibly arise without a sufficient cause hoped i should be made ample amends by the smiling faces and laughing cheeks in front of the theater but the new commanders not having been at that juture in london when mr footes mayor of garratt was acting they knew nothing  its fashionable ton there or if they did would not allow that as a sufficient plea for them as men of valor why they should not resent an injurious affront from what they looked on as an unjustifiable and intentional insult they therefore one and all pressed so hard and close together at the first wing where i was to make my entrance as to prevent the possibility of gaining admittance on the stage and had not roger the bumpkin servant to the justice sir jacob jollup cried out on the stage pray ye gentlemen pray ye let major fish come to visit my master they actually would not have suffered me to pass but from conscious shame and the hissing of the audience i was at last but not without much difficulty permitted to enter and i verily believe had they not so pointedly marked their indignation the bulk of the hearers would have passed the secret over as incomprehensible but such a remarkable and violent contempt offered to me was easily perceived by them and once conceived their ideas swiftly communicated like gunpowder when i came to the passage where major sturgeon relates to the justice  on we marched the men all in high spirits to attack the gibbet where gardel is hanging but turning down a narrow lane to the left as it might be about there in order to possess a pigs stye that we might take the gallows in flank and at all events secure a retreat who should come by but a drove of fat oxen for smithfield the drums beat in the front the dogs barked in the rear the oxen set up a gallop on they came thundering upon us broke through our ranks in an instant and threw the whole corpse into confusion    now reader consider that however outre and ridiculous this speech from fancy was formed by the author mr foot the whole circumstance had in similarity happened that very day in every ludicrous point and in consequence the offended party swore that particular passage must be the offspring of my own brain and done as an impudent and intentional disgrace to them and when the tumult of laughter from the audienc allowed permission for me to proceed with  the majors horse took fright away he scoure over the heath that gallant commande stuck both his spurs into the flank and for some time held by his mane but in crossin a ditch the horse reared up his head gave the major a dowse in the chops and threw tha gallant commander into a ditch near the powder mills  the officers were incensed to such a degre that they left the theater in dudgeon vowing vengeance when i was undressed and prepared to g to my own lodgings i had information that a sergeant with five or six soldiers were in waiting wit orders not only to beat unmercifully but  duck poor major sturgeon in the river so instead of being lighted home i acted as servan after all my atigue and lighted others i got t a house where mrs price and a mrs lewis live and ordered the account of the house to be brough there and settled mr littlehale a friend  mine well known at shrewsbury was there h as also intimate with chase price sir francis deaval etc dame price my tragedy queen t portsmouth in      escorted us upstairs the kitchen had an entrance on each side of the ouse she had undertaken as my old acquaintnce to look well to my playhouse doors and ith an observant eye mind all was honor ight where that tempting situation of takg money was transacted that essential article for real kings queens generals fine gentlemen and fine ladies for be it known there is as much iety and suspicion on a benefit night out of london and it is looked on as necessary to be s well guarded as the bank of england when reatened with conflagration and a riot any gentleman who holds half an hours noonconersation with an actor in the country must have served the following remarks and answers  e house on such a night was not well counted  such a night the house was not well gathered  the ecks were not right  one of the doorkeepers was  to let up several without taking any money  another doorkeeper took six shillings but returned  to prove his honesty  these sayings are often without foundation but i am afraid at times are known to be too true so mrs prices inspection into the deeds of the oorkeepers with thinking eyes was truly necessary but mr littlehale and i had not regale an hour before every window below stairs were suddenly broke the militia officers at the head o some myrmidons rushed into the house and furiously demanded wilkinson being assured  neither lodged or visited there they retired eagerly through the opposite door of the kitchen i determined search of their destined prey having been at my lodgings first however on their departure i had that great restorative elixir those golden drops as major oflaherty says which healed all my grievances for out of an old crazy tin and some wooden boxes i poured a plentiful libation of gold and silver coin the produce of mexico and peru which presented as charming a lava as can be conceived for a quantum sufcit will make black white fair foul wrong right base noble old young and a coward valiant  after my incredible fatigues and a comfortable bowl i got safely to rest and late the next day attended my good friend chase price he declared he saw me with the utmost regret and chagrin lamented his early departure from the theater a had he staid he would have effectually put a stop to such brutish outrage hoped i would think no more of it if i imagined he said that the officers bespeaking a play with his name at the head would be of service he would exert all hi interest i told him the accidental affray the night before dwelt on my mind with very disagreeable reflections as the consequence might ae proved dangerous as to the play the next night i desired it might be understood i had no advantage from it nor would i receive any but as it would certainly serve the company i acpted it so far as a compliment and my servies that evening he might command he rehed he was obliged to me and ordered the layers to perform the recruiting officer as the ene lay at shrewsbury and desired i would repeat young philpot in the citizen he appointed ursday instead of wednesday as on the wededay he had a venison dinner and devoted he day to his friends amongst which number he honored me and insisted on my dining with  at the raven on that occasion i made my compliments in return and assured him i would end his summons with infinite pleasure i was n that day a little after my time a fault i have ben often told of but on his left hand at the pper end of the table the head seat had been  reserved for me and the apparent intiy and repect he honored me with made the  stare and think they were in the wrong r by the contempt they wished to have shown the player the dinner was good the wine was good but chase price was superior to both mirth went round enjoying the feast of friendship and the flow of soul singing was mentioned chase price said humourously he must first have a rehearsal for as his friend wilkinson was going to leave shrewsbury in a few days without one he should be imperfect and forget his part and begged the favor of me to repeat his favorite scene from the new farce of the mayor of garratt and if i would act the major he was certain he could recollect sir jacob jollup as he had seen it that summer in london so often which was strictly true his memory was excellent and he was frequently at footes and was the only man of true wit i ever heard foot allow to be so or laugh with and listen to with pleasure nay foot actually praised chase price behind his bak  well we acted the scene which was highly relished the good humoured intention was smoaked and it ended with an afternoon and evening all in perpetual harmony animosity or discrd was no more thought of i believe the r  h  then in the militia is the gentlen who of late years has changed red for  and has een enlisting recruits for another o ld as an eminent orator since his altering his theatrical attendance for that of the tabernacle whether he has been the saving of many poor souls or the contrary will be one day determined  methodists are numerous therefore there will be no want of witnesses god bless and forgive that sect say i but fear they will not be so charitable as ever to return me the compment as i never observed humanity in their eed  the officers came to the play on the thursday i dined once more at the raven and on the satrday left shrewsbury for my favorite old city of chester where i made a stay of fourteen days i had received pressing invitations from mr barr and at the expiration of my chester visit at off for holyhead once more to visit dear dubn the day before i went was my birth day november the  th      and that very day i received the following short letter from my beloved parent my dear tate i have been in my bed very ill in the bilious cholic these three days as soon as please god i am able will answer all your particulars but s ll be at a loss to know whether to direct to holyhead or dublin or where with all gods blessings from  your ever affectionate mother g wilkinson     i flattered myself though it was an illness perhaps very severe at the time yet it might soon amend but god ordained it otherwise  in whose presence i doubt not she at this moment stands pleading for his mercies on her son below  i set off from chester and journeyed through wales and from thence got once more to ireand but previously had taken a benefit night at the exchangehall chester which was numerously attended i must remark an odd circumstance relating to my success at chester  i acted twic there at the theater and never had a good benefit but at the rooms dependent only on myself i received on one occasion upwards of  0l not tha i ever attended chester with a view for emolument of any kind whatever but being frequently at that place did occasionally as opportunity offred try the experiment as i went to and fro s frequently  barry gave me a sum and my benefit to be clea of all expenses when i chose to take it so the needed ittle invitation to induce me to visit m good dublin friends  and i should now reji could i change that disagreeable part of conveyance thther the sea voyage but indeed i should be mking so many excursions to ireland was ta obste reoved that i should be ruined wi postchaise hire so i must be contented like angls and persuade myself all is for the best i et over in a dreadful storm they talked of  the horses throats i really thought they  ae kicked the ships sides into the sea wer the voyage was with difficulty accom ed and when on shore my gratitude and danl were too soon forgot when i was well  i waited on the attractive mr barry with  was soon settled for his manners were  my first appearance was fixed on for bos which was to be as soon as the play could  got ready in the course of the first week ang an idle morning i judged it would be plaant respectful and right to stretch a walk to  my old friend mr macklin who then lived  part of drumcindralane the very  of dublin and almost in the country  perhaps that street at this time is situated   middle of dublin as the village of maryne is in the city of westminster after my  at the door a lazy servant at length opened  servants in general there are by no means so ert as in england  i inquired if mr mack was at home he answered no sir indeed  not i left a card and my compliments mr wilkinson from england but had not one any yards on my return before the sash of the dining room window was thrown swiftly up and mr macklin in his red nightcap loudly cried out wilkinson wilkinson i am at home i am at home come back i want to see you i returned on the sudden invitation the door wa opened and up stairs i mounted was escorte to the dining room where i had no sooner ented than instead of mr macklin solus as i expected behind the door which opened inward stood mr mossop erect with a sword by his sid and in full dress after the usual salutations an observations on the weather and how all went o in ngland etc mr mossop said grandly he wa very happy in having that opportunity of meetin me as he wanted to mention such proposals f his theater for the season as he was certain mu meet with my approbation for they would pro to me most eligible agreeable and highly profitabl mr macklin urged the matter as his advice f the good of us both and said he was willing  his part to contribute all in his power to add the proposed union and for the general goo mr macklin was at that time engaged with m mossop i was so circumstanced as impelled  to declare myself obliged to mr mossop for  offer but was under the necessity honestly to  him it was then too late i had come over dublin not positively engaged it was true i  received in england letters from mr jefferson first then from mr barry while at chester but had not entered into actual agreement till three days previous to that present one so that i had sined and sealed and the matter was irrevokeable mr macklin paused looked disappointed and sorry  mossop breathed hard rolled his eyes and sused the air spoke not looked not smiled indignant and with resentment put his hand on his sword his eyes looked terror all was sunk in slene i judged it very improper hastily to depart and he seemed determined not to move and leae me with mr macklin i was really in a puzzling situation being actually engaged with company at four oclock at the worthy corneus kellys in capelstreet who was then beloved and known by every body and i believe is yet living and must be a surprising age however i sat at macklins till five when looking suddenly at my watch i seemed much surprised at the time having passed so swiftly that i had strangely and rudely forgot myself as i was an hour beyond the time of my engagement in capelstreet and made my bow of departure when mr mossop rose up suddenly and said sir i wish to attend you on crossing the channels which were remarkably dirty he offered me his hand very politely then suddenly walked on for the space of five or six minutes when after a tragic ejaculation he stopped and said sir mr will  kin  son how do you dare to live sir  why sir i do not think it strange my daring but liking to live having such plntil ables where i am daily made welcome in ublin with such a number of repetable friend  sir said mossop ou are going to play in crowstreet theater with barry sir  and sir i will run you through the bo  die sir if you take the liberty to attempt my manner by any mimicry on the stage you must promise me sir on your honor you will not dare  attempt t if you break that promise sir you cnnot live and you mr will  kin  son must e  as you must mest me the next day and i shall il you sir  i told him it was impossible to coply with that his mandate as his threats woud of course from necessity and policy have a contrary effect than what he expected as by entreaty he would have been more likely to have ied his point for if it once came to be known ow he had worked upon my fears there would ot be  carpenter or dresser in the dublin theater ot wold kick me and as i esteemed mr mosp as a gentleman and as an actor of the first minence on any stage if he insisted on the dispate being seriously terminated it would be my ultimate wsh my oim to have an afair  honor with him in preference to any other gentleman whatever on account of his theatrical consequence as if i was fortunate it would deter many from being impudent and if i fell in battle it must be with eclat as it would be by the hand of so celebrated a tragedian the coolness and serious manner blended with ironical humor with which i delivered that speech to mossop absolutely staggered him with surprise as instead of the crouching he expected there was an apparent calmness steadiness and determination in what i sad at last he spoke the following words you dare not take me off sir or if you do dare not to take me off more than a little if you o ore sir you shall die  he then instantly parted as majestic as the ghost of julius caesar i very swiftly posted and wished for wings to arrive at capelstreet where i was in good english and irish well lectured without any opportunity for a long time of making any defense but when breathingtime allowed a possibility for me the culprit to make any vindication and requesting a r trial and a benevolent jury and relying on the laws of the country for an honorable and just examination though at that time under severe condemnation yet trusting i might be indulged  a candid hearing in my own justification  as not only listened to but most honorably acquitted and with great approbation for mossops pride was so well known that they enjoyed his mortification and blessed be god my veracity was so well believed that though the dinner was spoiled a material circumstance against me and to the feelings of each craving stomach we had a most remarkable cheerful day when the evening grew late mrs wilson a sister of mrs kellys who lived as a companion from her childhood with the late dowager lady granard said to me come tate you have been uncommon good company to day i will not have either chair or coach for i want you as my guard from capelstreet to stephens green which is near the distance from st clements church to sohosquare in london we set off on our parade as she seemed determined to walk it being moonlight and the streets also well lamped though a coach or chair was as easy to command as in any part of london she often halted as if not well an said she had something to tell me i urged he often to inform me what had so apparently affected her she answered she would satisfy my inquiries if i would first escort her to lord forbes in stephens green i perceived her as walkin up dawsonstreet particularly agitated and when crossing the walk of stephens green the s jamess park of dublin for promenade she complained of being ill and begged to sit down on one of the benches which i complied with and after much apparent sorrow she said my dear tate faith you have been so lively and entertaining this day and made so many of my friends happy to see you in such great spirits you must have noticed surely every persons care and kind attention to you as more than common though they are your sincere and good wellwishers and not being by any means willing to disturb the pleasant party at my sisters i put on a pleasing countenance with an aching hear of sorrow therefore the lot of conveying ill news is reserved for me she then burst into tears and said my dear tate i have received a letter from your mothers dearest wellwisher lady forbes truly lamenting the loss of her agreeable intimate friend and old acquaintance your dear and revered mother with whom she has known many happy days her ladyship desired me to assure you tate that every attendance a person of the highest rank could have required had not been wanting to relieve aid and support her tottering impaired state of health  her ladyship had added that she would herself have been at the expense of sending for me but that my mother had thanked lady forbes for the avour and said as my seeing her agonies could only afflict her son and would add to her own pangs without answering any purpose she esteemed it as a blessing from god that tate was at a distance instead of being present at the same time imploring every benediction on her sons head from the almighty and declaring that her offspring had behaved nobly in his allowance for her comforts of life and to add to his expenses or imbitter his mind with sorrow would prevent that peaceful exit to god which she did not dread but approached with reverence and hope awfully relying on his allgracious mercies and she felt consolation in her quitting this earthly abode of sorrow that i was then under the patronage of my dublin wonderfully good friends and that she in her sons prosperity had inherited the utmost wishes and buildings of her fancy lady forbes honored me so far as to take every care of the funeral etc herself my mother requested if it might be granted without any extraordinary expense to be laid in the vault of the savoy chapel where my father had so many years been a minister but the rev mr wilmot then my fathers successor refused the grant unless the expensive fees were complied with which my good mother had prohibited being acquiesced with on any account as she thought her husband who had so long been minister and a grace and honor to the pulpit as a preacher her having an elder son and two daughters in that vault humanity charity pity and religion might have granted a wife and mother of most amiable and virtuous character in every true sense of the word such a boon but to the shame of the minister christianity and common feeling it was denied and she was decently and truly mournfully attended by respectable persons and such true friends as were not ashamed to pay a tribute to a woman of as good qualities as ever exalted or honored human nature  were it possible a religious and amiable mind could procure happiness for another in this world my mothers true prayers and petitions presented at the high throne of mercy in my behalf would at this time with the almightys will have made me one of the most blessed men in this life  but we should work ourselves and not trust to the labor of others as the best find that strait is the gate and narrow is the path which leads to heaven  mrs wilson also delivered me a paper enclosed from lady forbes wrote by my mother to the following effect which i replete with grief thrust into my pocket being full of distress and agitation fr nature will be nature but her letters to me at orwich my last farewell the epistle to chester  had in some measure prepared me for an event expected though not so suddenly but when choked with agony at my last seeing her in london she had spiritlike awfully informed me she should never behold me more so that altogether they had certainly been preparatives for the greatest loss that can be known that of an indulgent and good parent as a son i can repeat with truth that i was dutiful and respectful but when children slight an affectionate father or mother they not only give a stab to the parent but open a sluice in their own hearts for the admittance of every iron corrosive and melancholy quality the which will to a certainty one day or other soften what was hard and obdurate and make them truly reflect with shakspeare  how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child   indeed misfortune seldom pays a visit alone but is too often attended by a crowded procession of ills and vexations which answers one good purpose as it prepares the mind for submission and a proper resignation to quit a life which otherwise with health attended by the gaudy pleasures of the world nature tugs and makes us unwillingly give up  i retired home to mr chaigneaus house in abbeystreet where i then was till i suited mysel with a lodging to my mind mr and mrs chaigneau being that winter at bath i could not rest but run over the many good acts my mother had done and the many sufferings she had undergone but feeling that truly happy and glowing sensation the inspiration of the almighty that told me i had acted dutifully and right by having supplied her wants and that her last years were by her confessedly years of happiness and content it reconciled me to myself and when the morning gave a sufficient light i earnestly looked over the paper enclosed to me by lady forbes in my mothers handwriting great part of it is here inserted my dear tate having such frequent returns of this giddy disorder in my head though well and free from any complaint at this time yet i must look upon these sudden attacks as most proper warnings that i may resign life in one moment therefore leave this short memorandum of my wearing apparel i would have you divide it between mrs judkins and mrs jack  i mean my common gowns linen and such as may be proper for them at your discretion also such petticoats cloaks etc as may be warm to that poor old woman mrs jack  i have nothing worth leaving to my best friends as you know them all if any little thing will be acceptable let the offer come from you particularly to mrs batt and mrs hutchinson whether in sickness or in health i feel no reluctance at quitting this world but the separation from my dearly beloved tate  if in my senses my last breath will be imploring gods blessings for all that is truly good to you that the same good providence may still attend you and that you may ever be defended from all the evils and dangers of the world i pray god to conduct you through life and as i am happy in believing you are blessed with an honest good heart so doubt not but you will give due attention to the plain and easy duties of religion which will be the certain way to secure the favor of god both here and hereafter where may we meet to live for ever in heaven through the merits of jesus christ our lord amen  i desire no mark of folly or ridiculous pride may attend me to my bed of dust plain and decent as possible neither any dressed up catalogue of virtues in the news i am at this instant well calm cheerful and happy in good health and spirits and whilst in this world  your most tender and affectionate mother g wilkinson     that day i kept closely at home but as soon a i was mournfully equipped and could appear wt decency i went abroad after what had pased with mr mossop mr jefferson insisted on my not appearing in the streets without a sword which i complied with those who know me will augh when they figure to themselves wilk nson in a black scratch wig parading dublin treets with a glaring silverhilted sword  to those who do not recollect or know me i refer to mrs bellamys description in her  th volume  she says i will here take the opportunity of adding a short description of the figure manner and dportment of the gentleman who had been the subject of the foregoing anecdote his person is ll his countenance rather sportive than beautif and his manners agreeable as to his theatrial talen they are far above the common rank he has infinite merit in comedy and excels in micry his first appearance was in dublin in the year    where he remained till the following year e joined the edinburgh company in      durng the time i had a share in the management of  where by his unremitted application and great mert in every line of the drama he rendered himlf a valuable acquisition to the community to  up the whole of his character in a few words he has always been justly admired as an actor beloved as a man and esteemed as a friend    well said mrs bellamy that i read much more palatably than the unasked opinion of mr stephen kemble who honored me with the following from exeter my apothecary at exeter who is one of the best creatures in the world and never charges for his physic says he remembers you at exeter when you was a handsome looking young fellow  i said i thought he must be mistaken in the person or that at all events it must have been long ago  indeed there is a particular time of lit when every body looks well at least if not handsome  though i must confess he is the only person whom i ever heard connect the word handsome with tate wilkinson  for my part  think you as ugly as any subject in h majesty dominions  but as i observed before i might be then your welllooking time  this paragraph for fear you should think m impertinent i shall not sign kemble but  veritas     i should have imagined mr kembles lette meant rudely but that it contained matter of importance to him and me being no less than the foundation for a treaty that was afterward negotiating seriously for all my theatrical property but that gentleman not approving what i asked and myself not relishing by any means the sums he offered the matter dropped after a few weeks consideration mrs wilkinson has seen luckily for me with my eyes not mr kembles which undoubtedly is a blessing to herself  digression is so natural to my disposition it is in vain for me to attempt correcting it so little are we acquainted with our own peculiarities i had not known a wandering imagination possessed me in so strong a degree had not mr robertson late of the york company in high estimation as a worthy welleducated sensible man and was a most excellent comedian frequently warned me of it in my memoirs so a stranger need only take up mr footes comedy of the cozeners and in mr aircastle as drawn by that gentleman he will find a strong trait of tate wilkinson  the following lines of mr aircastles are a specimen and i often have recourse to that comedy for a peep at my own singularities the cozeners aye aye you officers play the very deuce when you come down into the country i remember ensign sash about ten years ago  his father came from barbados  i met him at treacles the great sugarbakers who had a house in st mary axe  he took the lease from alderman gingham who served sheriff with deputy  there was tight work on the hustings  though when i first came to the temple there was a lawyers wife that lived in qualitycourt that i was exceed ngly fond of  her huband came home one night and i crept under the bed where i should have remained concealed but for a little dog of charless breed he went bow wow wow indeed a man and wife to quarrel before folks is rather rudih i own by ourselves indeed it is a pretty innocent amuement enough tom test of ur town used to say his wife was a devonshire girl if i am not mistaken from plymouth there by the bye they have the best john dorees in england old quin one ummer went thither on purpose    when the gloom of the melancholy event and my natural reveries had subsided i went eagerly to work in preparing the rehearsal and myself in bays hen i first acted it at crowstreet i gave a likeness of mossop in the lines of  so boar and sow when any storm is nigh etc  which being well executed of course had good effect  in act the third where i was correcting an actor i hit off some words and directions pointedly in the manner of my friend mr macklin not supposing but he would laugh at it as he had often encouraged me to proceed with my mischievous tricks and i used to entertain him with such matter  it was immediately noticed and well taken the next day mr barry sent for me to give me information that mr macklin armed  a pe on horseback had called on him and addrsed him in the following words  sir i har wilkinson took some liberty with my manner of acting last night on your theater i do not truble myself about the boy for every affront or j e passed on your stage i shall look upon as authorized by you and if such a practice is again repeated or attempted i shall seriously expect you to answer for it barry assured him he might depend on mr wilkinsons being informed of his comaint and might rest satisfied no repetition of the rt should be again exhibited on which mr macklin remounted his rosinante and like don quixote having killed his puppet giant he retrned in triumph mr barry informed me he had pwned his honor as surety i would not be a nughty boy a second time now my dear wikison added barry smiling i beg you wi l b observant and let me really depend on your t drawing me into a scrape particularly as i  to you i think macklin will come to church again which the next season actually happened as he once more acted his sir archy to barrys sir callaghan which was excellent i reassured mr barry he need not urge seriously what was my wish to comply with as for mr macklin i retained the highest regard and he had ever been kind and improving me by his advice and observations and i really believe had mr macklin been present he would have laughed instead of being offended but fame increasing as she goes had formed the trifle i had done ere it reached mr macklin into a story perhaps as ridiculous as false and probably formed to the size of enormity and there that matter rested  but with mr mossop i really had no mercy and though he was confessedly an actor of merit and wonderful powers the most melodious clear voice i ever heard take it for all in all yet his manner was so peculiar that i fear as i got fame at his expense i rather decreased than increased his as it certainly led several enthusiastic admirers to distinguish foibles and oddities not before so discernible i really did expect in consequence of the great freedoms i had taken mr mossop would certainly have called me to an account and daily apprehended i should have a message or visit  mr jefferson now at exeter who loved a little mischief said to him one day sir i was last night at crowstreet where wilkinson in tragedy alamode and in bays had taken very great liberties indeed and added that the audience were illnatured enough to be highly entertained on which mossop snuffed the air put his hand on his sword and turning upon his heel replied yes sir but he only takes me off a t  tle and made his angry departure after which jefferson never again renewed the subject but was astonished after his repeated and open threats of vengeance he had not acted more constently and after the said mr jeffersons telling me that circumstance i never heard more of mr mossops sword pistol or anger  i played a great number of nights with mr barry that season and had a lucrative second engagement as my first finished december    i acted repeatedly wolsey oakly tragedy alaode cadwallader bays etc  and when mr sheridan that winter who had not been seen from the time of his banishment occasioned by barrys and woodwards opposition his long absence and a general respect being paid him gave success to barry and a severe blow to mossop as he had then lost every tragic support mrs fitzhenry having returned once more to crowstreet and mrs abington was engaged in london mossops only support was mr macklins shylock love alamode etc and miss catley who then occasioned much conversation and fashion gave the old beggars opera a new run and allured several audiences macklin acted peachum but mr sheridan not having performed in dublin from his desertion in      till late in the year      made him not only from grateful and honorable feelings well received for the wellknown injuries he had sustained as a gentleman and more so from malevolent party and prejudice as the darling actor of the hearts in general of that metropolis  not that i should have voted or assigned the chair of roscius to speak heartily in favor of mr sheridan against barry or mossp particularly not against the former  mr sheridan drew several overflowing houses  he acted hamlet his established particular character for his benefit by the universal desire of his friends and he actually sent a card to me requesting i would oblge him by studying the apprentice which i had never played for his night which i agreed to with pleasure as i ever held mr sheridan respectable and indeed the consequence turned out an obligation to myself as my performing that character though immediately after the mert of the justly admired woodward was not only much relished but perpetually called for and in london the ensuing season did wonders for me and might be termed my chef doeuvre there mr mossop i did not neglect when i was in my apprenticeship  and strange to tell  but men are men the best sometimes forget  mr sheridan came to return me thanks for the favor and to wish me joy of my applause and rejoicingly told me all his friends were particularly pleased and himself had been highly entertained with my strong likeness of mr mossop here is a striking instance of human nature for if the reader will but turn his memory round to my first winter in ireland he will recollect how more than pointedly austere mr sheridan was against mimicry and me with his particular severity on jokes and freedoms of that nature  my benefit was on monday december          the mourning bride osmyn by mr barry the king by mr wilkinson zara by mrs fitzhenry almeria by mrs dancer  with by particular desire the prodigals return n the manner of the original tragedy alamode also fieldings pleasures of the town or he puppet show  the bills passed mr barys ordeal and naturally may be supposed to have even quartered upon three parts of the dublin inabitants besides all my boxes being taken by my friends and the public and the great call for tickets made them more universally dispersed this if you are a theatrical reader i beg you will notice was the very winter woodward had broke his connection as manager with barry and had spoken his prologue of the prodigal returned at london and had been received with open arms at his former residence of elysium that prologue if i had properly considered certainly was a dangerous and wanton undertaking and therefore should have required thought as it indubitably might have drawn me into a predicament which if taken offensively might to a certainty have turned out so serious that all my friends combined could not have extricated me from the bad consequences as offense is sooner conceived than forgiven and too many people like being offended to gratify by such opportunity their darling spleen and ill nature and even acquaintances are liable to sway with the opinion of the multitude to prove their impartiality which often makes lukewarm friend the most dangerous of enemies that can be conceived as their desertion is made subservient b artful insinuations to become useful for base purposes  about five days before my benefit mr barr called on me in great perturbation and said mr woodward had informed him by letter that i london on looking over the dublin journal he to his astonishment had seen his prodigal prologue advertised to be spoken by mr wilkinson and in his manner  that he expected and requested to have that part of the bill expunged as it might greatly injure him and he also judged it a service of danger to mr wilkinson  he made a point of it the more as he intended he added to perform a few nights in the spring on his own stage in crowstreet and he feared mr wilkinsons whim might have a perilous tendency i felt the force of truth and not meaning injury should have been unhappy to have occasioned any my bills were immediately altered and what mr woodward had surmised to be offensive was directly taken out and its not being in the future bills great or small i never thought more of what i conidered merely as a trifling matter  that night december    though i had been honored with many good ones notwithstanding mr and mrs chaigneau were absent was he best i ever had in dublin the receipt being   0  the last music was called about the usual time and was playing to that bumper of a house which finished and the curtain rising to melting notes and as mrs dancer was impatiently expecting her usual plaudits from every hand stick and voice the contrary burst forth with most horrid din and vociferation and to her astonishment the universal cry was  off off  wilkinson wilknson woodwards prologue etc mrs dancer attempted to courtesy and speak but all in vain she was compelled to retire full of grief rage shame anger and vexation  for my part i was dressed all trim for his majesty and thinking to command as a king and not be commanded  was petrisied like lord ogleby and almost distilled to jelly by my fears barry summoned me in high rage and the audience continued all the while in tumult mrs dancer flew into a violent passion for what she had sustained on my account barr said he was certain i had wilfully occsioned the riot and planted persons to call for the prologue i replied on my honor that i had strictly obeyed his commands and from the moment he had mentioned my not doing it i never more gave the fatal prologue a thought and urged what was truth that my very dress for the king of portugal made my assertions evident therefore mr glover late dr glover in fleet street who was then engaged as an actor with mr barrys directions went forward and after much bowing entreating etc was at length suffered to infrm them that mr wilkinson was then dressed for the king and actually was not prepared for the prologue it having been judged improper in the highest degree and purposely omitted not only in the bills of the day but for the whole week past benefits were then advertised three weeks before the night  therefor mr barry and mr wilkinson respectfully hoped the omission would be pardoned approved and excused the answer was not only universal but as if one determined voice  no no no  no play no play no benefit unless he speaks the prologue barry began then to be eriously alarmed as it bore the marks of determination not to be trifled with he alleged so situated mr woodward himself could not be angry when properly informed and said well wikinson i do not blame you  i see evidently it is a formed party of angry enemies against woodward so speak the prologue as well as you can mr glover then informed the audience i would peak the prologue and endeavor to recollect it against the finish of the play but no no was the cry and answer  the prologue now or no play i felt myself in a situation very alarming i had no alternative and really not having attended to the prologue after giving up every idea of it to recollect what i had conned over was very difficult having never spoke it nor having the east imagination of its ever being such a serious matter of contention  once more mr glover was deputed and underwent a peal of groans and hisses but being again permitted to be heard he said if they would honor mr ilkinson with the indulgence of a few minutes to change his dress and collect himself he would exert his abilities and speak the prologue as well as he was capable the theater refounded approbation and yes yes  bravo bravo  i do not think in any dramatic occurrence i ever was so truly overpowered i took a half pint of madeira and that assistance before i thought of the prologue actually inspired me to repeat these lines   valor soars above what the world calls misfortune and affliction these are not ills else would they never fall on heavens first favorites and the best of men the gods in bounty work up storms about us that give mankind occasion to exert their hidden strength and throw out into practic virtues which shun the day and lie concealed in the smooth seasons and the calms of life   the above allusion was conceited but i w young and the whim struck my fancy the id of consequence i had agreeably placed myself i by that repetition however strutting and fantastical aided by the good heartening madeira tune my mind to some degree of composure i stripp with alacrity and put on an old gray frock a pa of blue boot stockings my scratch wig etc an quickly transformed myself and thus equipped with hat in hand advanced to take the field but however quick as i had been the patience of the audience were tired and suspecting more imposition as they termed it let me know they were all there and i naturally conceived they had not entirely forgot my slip mentioned in      when they promised retaliation which perhaps might have conspired to render the said mentioned prologue considered as a matter of more moment than otherwise it would have been however i was certainly the unlucky busy body the music played and the bell at last was rung they were soon all seated and silence loudly proclaimed be it observed that mr woodward when he spoke that prologue first at covent garden after an absence of a few years popped his head on the stage from the door drew himself hastily away as if ashamed of being such a prodigal son as to leave his good friends and not know when he was well he next crept on by the curtain peeping and then hiding his face again till he attained the center of the stage which was wittingly conceived and had a happy effect so on my approach that night i practiced the same maneuver but as in imitation of woodward and not owing to my own bright thought the audience on my first approach and drawing back as above described half hissed  half applauded but o my second and third advance alamode woodward the approbation arose to a degree equal almost to woodwards reception at covent garden for they apprehended all my acted modesty was a natural impromptu and a tacit confession of shame for keeping them so long waiting and having meant artfully to deprive them of that part of the evenings entertainment they were determined to hear and all in compliance to the bashaw order of the manager however my pardon was fully proclaimed long before i spoke by peals of laughter and applause and i felt very differently from the hour before that pleasing altered situation and what is no more strange than true they with infinite good humor approved almost every line of the prologue as if it had been calculated to compliment the dublin audience instead of the contrary and i may venture to say mr woodward was certainly to blame when he wrote and spoke it  but men in rage strike those who love them best for though he might be right in sound judgment to return to london he could easily have studied means to have paid court and obtained pardon and support on his going back to the station where he had formerly been for many years an established favorite without inconsiderately and ungratefully throwing reections on those who had ever respected his worth as a man and his merit as an actor of eminence his view in quitting london was gain as was his returning and he was like to stand the hazard of that die he himself had purposely thrown as i have said so much relative to the prologue i will here insert it and i hope not with impropriety behold the prodigal returned  quite tam  and though you will hardly think it full of stame ashamed so long to have left my patrons here  on random schemes  the lord knows what and where  with piteous face long stranger to a grin receive the penitent  and let him in forgive his errors  open the friendly door and then he is yours         pit boxes galleries  and yours    and yours    as heretofore  ye gods what havoc does ambition make  ambition drove me to the grand mistake ambition made me mad enough to roam  but now i feel with joy that home is home  faith they put powder in my drink do you see or else by pharaohs foot it could not be belike queen mab touched me at full of the moon with a field marshal managers battoon  and so i dreamt of riches  honor  power  it was but a dream though  and that dream is over  how happy now i walk my native ground above  below  nay says  all round and round i guess some pleasures in your bosoms bur to see the prodigal poor son return  perhaps i am vain though and the case mistake no  no  yes  yes  for old acquaintance sake some generous hospitable smiles you will send  besides i own my faults and mean to mend  oh ho the warningbell rings they ring  how sweet that sound appears after an absence of four tiresome years  marplot to night  so says the bill of fare pointing to a playbill  now waits your pleasure with his usual air  oh may i act the part still over and over but never be the busy body more   i thought all that prologue business well over and was to play cardinal wolsey shortly after  queen catherine mrs fitzhenry as mr foot had sent barry over the new farce of the mayo of garratt it occasioned me a second engagemen with him for ten nights more on my entranc as the cardinal to my astonishment there was a universal cry for woodwards prologue nor would they let me or the play proceed till i advanced an said gentlemen as soon as i am dead i will certainly speak it the oddity of my irish blunder set them into a laugh and all was right til the play was over then it was not forgot but for fear i should give them the slip was loudly calle for  in a few days the mayor of garratt was ready which with puffing and extracts from the london papers brought a crowded house i was equipped exactly in mr footes manner for major sturgeon and pleased myself with the effect my figure would have on my first entrance as the major for the piece being quite new was a feather in my cap and i was in high spirits on the occasion but notwithstanding the novelty and expectation of much entertainment from the new farce no sooner was the curtain drawn up than that cursed unfortunate and tormenting prologue was again called for by every bod and wilkinson  prologue prologue wilkinson resounded from every part of the theater  a person not acquainted with the stage may perhaps not think this any particular hardship but an actor will feel t to be as i myself found it really a piece of ill fortune and very distressing let any brother comedian suppose himself welldressed for a remarkable character dependent partly on that dress and that the first night too of a new comedy in which he expected fame and profit and one half the effect depending on his first appearance  but this prologue they would have  i refused  but was obliged to go on and plead  all arguing was in vain and what was worse in that prologue i was to omplain of want and penury etc and should have been in a very indifferent dress yet they wished me to speak it with a stuffed belly rosy cheeks and in a great pair of french boots no remonstrances would avail  i urged my boots as an excuse but they only laughed aloud and said never mind major speak it in your boots  i thought some planet had unwitted men  i was obliged to submit and was so far in character as the prodiga that i felt more inclined to cry than laugh after that disagreeable ceremony the farce proceeded on was highly received and acted six or seven nights but never without their favorite prologue let me have acted what i would nay had i played lady townly or juliet i am certain i must have spoke it however custom reconciles many disagreeable things in life which at first appear not only disgustful but painful so this prologue by use i at length repeated perfectly easy let me be dressed as i would and as what must be must be i was prepared for the summons barry wished me to continue as he urged i was much more established there as a performer than at any other period and that favor from the public at large without being in the least dependent on my particular friends yet things happen so contradictory that it must appear strange to say that the trifling prologue had so teized me it was the only time i ever quitted dublin withot regret and at the very period i loved that place he most at the end of january      i left that city and took my route the north road by drogheda newry carrickfergus and belfast to donogadee  but before i take leave of the prologue business entirely i must beg permission to give the sequel and catastrophe to it and i hope i shall be forgiven for my tautology and tediousness respecting it  mr woodward went over to ireland late in the spring season       he was advertised to play and to secure his former footing his first appearance was announced for a public charity benefit when a rumor was whispered and of course soon circulated about mr woodwards prodigal prologue spoken in london at covent garden theater and so often repeated by wilkinson to the audience in dublin during the winter months of playing it may be readily conjetured that foolish business was not a little pushed forwards by the opposite interests connected with the mossopian theater and actors can in spite of nature now and then give a lift to irritation and spleen in public taverns etc particularly if things are not agreeable to themselves at the time not but there are as worthy and superior minds of both sexes to be found in a theater as in any other set of people whatever but when we judge in general of mankind woe be to the safety of those who trust their security in the state of reliance on humanity honor and goodnature  though it is said charity covers a multitude of sins yet woodwards coat of mail and merit on this occasion would not avail it was not only penetrable stuff but furiously threatened with assassination on all sides as they judged it a flimsy pretext to hide or conceal a conscientiousness of his fault and a gross affront to the city of dublin at large  the playing for a charity for his first appearance was a poor subterfuge and made bad worse as they all knew his real view and intent was profit they therefore termed that a paltry evasion and a tacit confession of guilt and fear and on the day of his intended performance the said prologue was actually printed as spoken by the grateful henry woodward therefore all the lines they had noted when i spoke it they locked safe in the volumes of their brains and such as they took to be offensive and affrontive were marked in the fresh printed ones in italics  here potatoes another line turnips and at last banished from those boards  the matter wore so serious an aspect that mr woodward and his friends thought it prudent and advisable for him to decline playing there that night or any other on that he speedily retreated not making his appearance even in the streets for fear of being insulted nor did he ever visit ireland to play again  i am vexed at relating this because it was occasioned by a foolish wantonness on my part attended with perplexity and vexation to myself and followed with such serious consequences to mr woodward as never could have entered my head  it hurt me the more as i really regarded him much  it occasioned a great coolness and ironical distance between us for an interval which was natural and unavoidable but reflection and time made us reconciled and restored us not only to our former acquaintance but to a much stronger intimacy than before and a sincere friendship which truly continued till that moment which separates king and people husband and wife father and son  and all the world  mr woodward was a gentleman of true worth and not undeserving the sigh of any person however exalted as he undoubtedly was an honorable member of society and an actor while within memory whose merits cannot must not be forgotten his marplot bobadil and flash will be for years enrolled in stage history  i now must travel to donogadee and from thence to edinburgh but i was obliged to continue three or four days the wind not answering directly for scottish steerage  the distance i guess is nearly the same as between dover and calai or perhaps rather more packets appointed by government have now rendered that passage more commodious and sae and traverse to and fro in regular course which affords great temptations to ladies and gentlemen not fond of a sea voyage when i unluckily adventured over in the depth of winter it was in a storm accompanied by snow with all its horrid attendants and in an open wherry no shelter whatever from the inclemency of weather the sailors all drunk twenty pigs and sows with horses and a methodist preacher whether he or the possessed wine raised the tempest i cannot determine  i rather suppose the fates however we rushed on the rocks on the opposite shore which is remarkably rugged with a force that seemed to me astonishing they said it was the usual manner of landing at port patrick indeed though i was six hours the passage in general i believe is performed in less time and i am informed is rendered pleasant and convenient for the weary traveller and besides these allurements its shortness and an almost certainty of safety an accident being seldom heard of but mine was an instance to encourage wayfarers to pass that way as then conveniences were never thought of  the wherry in the storm almost guided itself  a drunken crew  no shelter from the severity of climate  yet the actor the preacher the sailors the sows and pigs horses etc all arrived safe on the scotch shore if the escape was owing to the particular good qualities of the medley groupe i fear the drunken sailors would have the superior claim allowed to them as they undisguised exposed their unthinking folly while it was possible the methodist and the dramatic were both actors had a jew been in the boat he would probably have imputed the storm to the herd of swine  i do confess without asking belief i was glad of a supper in an hut called an inn and to get a nights rest there that said hut is now transformed to a decent place of reception for strangers there was not at that period a tolerable road or any regular track for near forty miles nor any mode of traveling but on little starved horses and a wild guide to glasgow now there are postchaises  however i accomplished my journey on horseback in two days the first night to air the second to glasgow it rained heavily and was accompanied with hail snow and every concomitant severe weather could give i felt much for the guide who carried my luggage but he appeared perfectly contented whilst i seemed ready to give up the ghost but the beholding the spires of the noble ity of glasgow recruited my almost exhausted spirits till by dint of labor i at last about ten at night arrived in that truly elegant built city  it was far superior to edinburgh and has greatly improved but in point of rapid grandeur in building and improvement edinburgh has given glasgow a somerset surprise so as to baffle all comparison and now stands foremost as one of the most beautiful corporate towns in europe  i was truly ill when i go to the bull inn and actually from fatigue extended myself on the carpet before the fire but good wine good supper good bed good every thing made me feel in heaven next day i took a postchaise and in the evening reached edinburgh and stopped at an inn in the grass market very indifferent indeed in every respect as to accommodation or neatness which gave me a bad opinion of the capital city of scotland  edinburgh is romantically and pleasantly situated indeed more so than can be imagined or described nor has even bath or any other town or city within my knowledge made such rapid strides toward improvement as the new town of edinburgh the new streets hotels superb squares etc are astonishing but added to all those elegancies in the winter season the town is well lighted throughout thi description will make a narrowminded cockney stare who thinks green peace were never seen in scotland and supposes all the inhabitants live on barleybroth haggass and crowdy and has confirmed his notions by surmising edinburgh to be a dirty mean place but if he will travel and take a peep it will open his eyes and make him confess with surprise astonishment and conviction that it with justice lays claim to being placed in a station that evinces superiority and demands a rank as a city of eminence admiration consequence and distinction in point of elegance and spirit there is no such city in the kingdom of great britain except london and bath but reader observe edinburgh was not in the state i have been endeavoring to describe when i first arrived there in feb      it was then merely confined to the old town and destitute of many of those elegancies it now possesses  to a degree of luxury and extravagance in every respect on my setting down at edinburgh i neither had engagement nor acquaintance with any person whatever theatrical or otherwise but had gone there at hap hazard and removed myself four hundred miles from london into a strange country and took that wonderful circumbendibus to north britain uninvited merely from my own whim and inclination  but on inquiry was highly pleased to find my old friend mrs bellamy was there with whom i had not only dined at mr calcrafts when she lived in parliamentstreet but had been on an intimacy for years by seeing her constantly as a visitor at lady tyrawleys at somerset house near the savoy who regarded mrs bellamy much as a supposed natural daughter of lord tyrawleys though his lordship had proved a false mate to his wedded lady who though a woman of high sense and breeding could not boast of any personal attraction as she was shortsighted squinted and was in her person rather bordering on the extravagance of caricature but was friendly generous sensible and humane and ever honored my father and mother as a constant kind companion and good neighbor she possessed more of cibbers lady dainty in respect to cats dogs and monkeys than any other that ever came within the scope of my discernment indeed her apartments at somerset house were truly disagreeable to enter and when in not without some danger or apprehension at least from the variety of animals as there were loose monkeys and a file of yelping dogs to pass before one could get to the room and then to a chair and an affront to any one of those favorites was truly so to her ladyship and not to be forgiven  there were never s than three or four monkeys dressed in regimentals or as fine ladies and gentlemen  but no pen however able can possibly exaggerate her propensity to this tribe as if selected against a second flood on mrs bellamys knowing me so long by meetings at lady tyrawleys etc i was no sooner announced in scotland than most friendly received and a general insisted invitation to make a home of her house and mr bellamys alias digges at bonnington during my stay in edinburgh it is a pleasant village situated little more than a mile from the town but now i dare say nearly connected by the additional streets and buildings mr digges was certainly the most polite gentleman in the world to his ladies and not choosing to have mrs diggess name in the bills for living together in scotland constitutes a marriage while in that kingdom he most graciously exchanged his name of digges for bellamy also let that lady perform whatever character she would she was always placed at the head of the bill as for instance  this day romeo and juliet juliet mrs bellamy romeo mr bellamy  on being introduced into the green oom i met with little neat mrs mozeen my portsmouth desdemona      who by the name of edwards had been bred carefully up and introduced to the london audience by mrs clive who was so partial to her adoption that she for the first time gave up polly which she would not do to mrs cibber and acted lucy which was beyond compare on producing her own taught polly but mrs mozeens powers were weak and she fell by tasting the apple like her mother eve and the chaste the comical the enraged clive discarded her and resumed polly herself and let her pupil down the wind to prey on fortune  mrs mozeen whom i believe i have mentioned as being a favorite actress at portsmouth in      was at edinburgh      under the wings of a long tall northumberland manager of edinburgh whose name was dowson cojointly with a mr bates edinburgh dowson had like a true lovyer sacrificed all his business and good situation at newcastle to prostrate himself with offerings of incense and gaudy mock trappings of false silver and gold lace at the feet of his theatrical princess which at last ended in his wilful ruin  this was in the time of the old theater in cannongate long before the present new one or even the new town was either built or thought on  mrs mozeen had a plurality of lovers and alwas put me in mind of shakespeares lines  behold yon simpering lady she who starts at pleasures name and thinks her ear profaned with the least wanton word would you believe it etc and so it was with that lady for at the least sudden joke she blushed to such a degree as to give the beholder pain for an offense not meant or intended  a miss wordly also was there whom mrs bellamy has mentioned in her apology as being termed the goddess of nonsense as a compliment to her being remarkably the contrary but there my friend bellamy forgot herself as indeed she often tripped with her memory for miss wordly was called the goddess of nonsense by acting that part for my benefit in a farce of fieldings entitled the pleasures of the town and was so christened by mr aickin who was then in edinburgh in high and deserved estimation and with whom i had the satisfaction of many many happy days or rather evenings not omitting our scotch pint of claret and neither of us averse to madeira  to the lattr i then and now give the preference particularly recollecting one hours laugh with him on my nearly breaking my neck by a fall into the coal cellar i could have prophesied he would from his spirited manner then have been more fortunate if properly supported on his first onset in london in an animated and lively line but it may be better as it is for he is now playing what he might at this time have had to study as years will creep which neither aickin nor wilkinson can prevent therefore it makes his present time the more easy and pleasant and all is well that ends well is a good motto for us stage players  the third day of my being in edinburgh i had a card of invitation from mr dowson and mr david bates managers to sup with them at a tavern i was entertained very respectfully and in the course of casual conversation mr dowson who was the monied manager just then asked me what terms i required for eight or ten nights said they could not afford any thing extravagant as i had come uninvited which should never be done and at the very prime part of the season when they wanted not any foreign aid besides mr dowson said and with truth mr and mrs bellamy were towers of strength i easily surmised by that conversation they meant to be very courtierlike and civil but wanted not any engangement that was likely to cost them any thing i found i had undertaken an expensive tedious journey merely on speculation and condemned myself as having acted wrong in so doing and really thought i might as well have been lucratively paid at that time by mr barry who had had me at his bedside requesting me to stay a month longer in dublin even though i had been made to speak woodwards prologue against the grain for mr barry then wanted every assistance he being confined by a rheumatism few persons experienced equally painful as himself the scotch managers and i parted very civilly but no hint of terms for an engagement on either side  the day following at dinner with mr digges or mr bellamy  which ever appellation the reader likes best  i informed him and his lady what had passed and that it had determined me to quit scotland immediately mrs bellamy replied that what the managers had told me was the exact state of facts as they then stood and said she as mr bellamy and myself are concerned in the profits in one interest and as we settle all the plays we do not want you mr wilkinson as it is evident you have thrown yourself into their power if you play at all and if not you have no alternative but to depart and make better use of your time as you certainly can for bates and dowson undoubtedly think as you are on the spot you will not neglect any decent engagement but my friend tate continued she you are sure i wish you well from my long knowledge of you and if you will for once depend on my advice and stay over saturday or monday next a wonderful change may happen in the movements of the theatrical machine that will astonish bates and dowson and you may command your own terms at present they are sure they can do without you but sunday next will cause a contrary opinion i was much surprised and begged mrs bellamy to be explicit why said she tate i will prove myself explicit and honorable to you as i can rely on your secrecy  there is a law in force in scotland that if any person whatever is in debt and known to be quitting the kingdom they can arrest even on a sunday on oath being first made mr digges is much involved here and is so unfortunately circumstanced at this juncture that he cannot possibly continue longer without loss of liberty  on saturday night mr digges will on some pretext get all the cash he can from mr still the treasurer  dowson is not destitute of property and must pay the actors  mr digges will by sunday night be secretly and securely conveyed out of their reach and safe on the other side the tweed in old england  on monday bates and dowson will be in the utmost consternation and their only relief will be that of requesting your assistance  the event turned out exactly as mrs bellamys secret advice had painted and on the prophesied monday they were obliged to offer me unasked two clear benefits who a week before would not have given one without the charges being duly paid into their coffers instead of my purse  the minor was first resolved on next the mayor of garratt both were quite new  mrs cole was rather thought improper also dr squintum as touching on matters there judged too serious  but i was very fashionable and all was right but major sturgeon was the favorite  i acted in various plays and farces from richard bays etc to the liar in short i played many good parts and was received with candor and much approbation mrs bellamy had two benefits and both much honored in the compliments they paid her on those nights  her first was the funeral  i acted trim mrs bellamy lady brumpton campley mr aickin  her second night was the orphan of china zamti mr wilkinson tan mr aickin mandane mrs bellamy hamet was to have been acted by mr collins who has given the public at london and elsewhere much entertainment by his brush he was taken ill and the part was obliged to be substituted by mr creswicks goodnaturedly reading that character the accident not only hurt the play but mr collins as mrs bellamy in an acrimonious apology and manner represented to the audience that mr collins purposely distressed the representation and in plain terms told them naught but malevolence and illbehaviour was the true cause of the disappointment i have no reason to imagine her accusation was truly or illfounded but that was the color she gave it and because frequent illness sudden and lasting we are all subject to  i was soon well acquainted with several leading gentlemen particularly with mr nicholson swetart who was then universally known and as well remembered from london to edinburgh and at every public place of resort as any worthy spirited gentleman can be and in consequence respected in the three kingdoms  he possessed liberality and that goodness of heart above all to be recorded which many may envy but few very few can equal and felt the dramatic furor in a degree like mr vapid not to be surpassed which i mention as no dishonor to himself as an admirer of shakspere and garrick but to his own fame as a mind full of liberality and understanding and pay only a just tribute in such declaration  my days and hours at that period were very happily engaged and always when not with company was certain of an agreeable party with mrs bellamy my obligations at edinburgh were extended beyond mediocrity and in the course of my repeated visits to that city exceed the limits of expressing a proper acknowledgment  my first benefit there was on the   th of march      the way to keep him tragedy alamode bucks have at ye all with duke and no duke lovemore trapolin etc by mr wilkinson widow belmour mrs bellamy  my second the last night of the season i acted king lear and had the farce of the pleasures of the town aided by miss wordlys goddess of nonsense i was not only satisfied but even delighted with my expedition to canny edinburgh and indeed from my frequent visits to that place has occurred the most enviable and pleasing consequences which on reflection must ever be delightful to my memory such as renewing my acquaintance there which repaid my journies with every agreeable advantage an increase of friends a kind reception great and honorable benefits freely attended to with many highbestowed compliments which has left behind an indelible mark of gratitude on my heart that no filer or artist can ever deface only the slow and sure hand of time that moulders even matters of magnitude to ashes and dust  the edinburgh season ended mrs bellamy wished me to proceed on an expedition then forming for a new theater at glasgow just finished but i at that time was in a bad state of health and therefore declined it as added to indisposition i wished once more to review my london apartments which i had not had the opportunity of seeing from the time of my mothers death and where all the furniture clothes etc were safely and honorably secured by the undoubted care and regard of mrs alcock in little bedfordstreet in the strand and of course i had some matters of business to settle indeed i grew worse and worse in health and on leaving edinburgh by slow stages like cardinal wolsey choosing a great comparison expected just to reach london and die in earnest on my late mothers bed  mrs bellamy and the company had set off for the west of scotland glasgow  i set off south for my destined home but intended to halt at my good friends mr baker of the york theater  i was so very ill that five or six days were necessary even with difficulty to accomplish the journey when the afflictive tour was achieved i at noon found that good old gentleman busy with bricks and mortar and in his high glory giving directions to workmen who were erecting part of a new theater at york at a great and his sole expense it was intended to be as it now actually is on a much more capacious scale than the old one though nearly on the same spot as h was then finishing the tail of the new while the players were employed in the head of the old mr baker laughed on seeing me and exulted on valuing himself the younger man in point of comparison i was so emaciated which joking apart he was seriously sorry to behold  that night was the first benefit a mr and mrs powell had at york  the merchant of venice in which mr powell acted gratiano and mrs powell portia  mr powell was a york man  mrs powell a woman of a good and respectable family in warwickshire mr baker requested me much to rouse my spirits and play a few nights as i ever was ready to grasp at a benefit and be touching the cash to prevent running out and did not dislike the fatigue of playing i consented and on saturday april    fixed on othello for my opening character  it was to have been for the benefit of mrs quin i was daily abused at york for attempting mr frodshams part of othello when the day came i was after dinner taken so dreadfully ill that i never expected to play more mr frodsham was not to be found to supply my place and the audience were obliged to be dismissed and as the world is too fond of any tale that feeds its appetite for scandal however gross absurd and even impossible so in that instance did i suffer most inhumanly by the falsehoods propagated relished and believed without a trait of truth to lead to the matter first it was asserted i was afraid to appear conscious of my having picked their pockets at york on my tea benefit the year before next that mr baker and i had drank half pints of rum and wine till we were so intxicated that both were carried to bed speechless nay the matter was carried so far that i had a letter of condolance from mr foot lamenting and reproaching me for having been drove from the york stage for attempting to play when so infamously drunk that i could neither speak nor stand so these different tales of scandal were all sent piping hot north south east and west and the simple matter of fact was neither more nor less than my being truly and dangerously ill so instead of pity i heard of nothing but reproach spite unmerited abuse and malevolence but as we who live to please must please to live  i consoled myself when i heard such rabblelike opinion with the idea of coriolanus  ye common cry of curs whose breaths i did despise as reek of the rotten fens whose loves i prized as the dead carcass of unburied men that did corrupt my air at present i have the honor to know a few select friends good and capable to serve myself and family and to make us happy and that is a consolation every one cannot boast  and every reflective mind should observe that acrimonious and corrosive dispositions are such that having in themselves no share in natures bounties consequently they feel no pity toward such as have them  on the monday at york      though my illness was very little abated in spite of abuse and in spite of prudence having naturally at times a touch of the headstrong i persisted in being announced for major sturgeon on the tuesday may        several persons called at mr bakers desiring me not to play for i should certainly be insulted urging also that my state of health made it wrong to attempt it however on that said appointed tuesday i presented myself in major sturgeon when on my entrance the wrongs the audience had sustained as they termed it by their patience and forbearance the year before and such insolence added to drunkenness none but such good tempers would have permitted therefore an universal hiss with two or three uncivil oranges burst at once on my devoted head i was superior to making an apology or offering an explanation when so unjustifiably and cruelly treated so i marched and countermarched as the major though scarcely able to bear the weight of my boots and was hissed throughout that act and at my exit received every mark of disgrace  what i got for my labor the next day was that i need not think of playing major sturgeon after mr achurch as he performed it so much better and they wondered as i acted at york again i did not ask pardon for my insults to that public  it is no more strange than true though all this vexed and truly mortified me yet it roused my spirits in part from that languor my bad state of health had thrown me into as i really did not expect i should have remained long in this world but soon shut out daylight  the spring meeting was for the second trial that year on may the  th  th  0th and   th  i acted on saturday the  th bajazet and the orators for old tenoes benefit very little approbation nor many marks of the contrary  their stony hearts began to relent and soften and my love of acting though ill was very different to my present feelings for i am now truly grown weary and old with service though more weary than old and incapable  i was so weak at that time that at the end of each play i fainted repeatedly from sickness and lack of strength yet would not give it up but kept acting away  in the may meeting i performed oakley and the apprentice which in dublin had pleased so much but i was unfortunately at york much disapproved  i was shocking after frodsham in dick  may    kitely and cadwallader in the author  that night i was received into favor  several gentlemen desired i would play the major once more and they would support me in it  i was well received as the major  may  0  the author was repeated and i seemed restored to their grace  if applause was to fix opinion on that matter  my major sturgeon gained such ground the second time may    and so contrary from my first nights impression that the late colonel thornton then commander of the york militia bespoke my play but particularly desired the mayor of garratt the colonel requested i would pass an hour with him on that occasion over a bottle at howards now ringroses a few days before my benefit and the york reader will allow me to be weak in body as i could not crawl so far without a chair though in the month of may on a fine day and the distance a few yards only  on tuesday was my benefit by desire of col thornton  the funeral with the mayor of garratt etc  and i was contrary to my expectations favored with great boxes and a very genteel house though not crammed as the year bebefore the receipt was  0 l i parted with respect and was on a much better footing with the public on my departure than the year before when i left york after a more superabundant benefit the vicissitudes of life are strange and sometimes misfortunes past are stories of delight  while at york i received a letter from mrs bellamy congratulating me on my good fortune in not going with the company to glasgow for after the first night of performance the methodists had burst in and wilfully set fire to the theater which conflagration had consumed every part of the stage with all her wardrobe and wearing apparel except what was on her back and that the wardrobe of the theater had sustained the same fate i was so far consoled by the accident finding myself two hundred and forty miles nearer london than i should have been at glasgow as to return thanks for my lucky escape and rejoiced to find though i was at york and had got into the drying pan i had jumped away from the fire  these are mrs bellamys words  the next day at noon we saw the delightful y to which we were going at a little distance before us the magnificence of the buildings and the beauty of the river which the fineness of the day caused to appear if possible to greater advantage elated my heart and i anticipated the pleasure i should have in being received by friends who were not only most cordial in their repeated invitations but whose opulence furnished them with power to fulfill their warm promises of support  when we arrived at glasgow one of the performers exclaimed madam you are ruined for you have nothing left but what you have with you in the chaises i am at loss even now to account for the composure with which i heard this alarming salutation i was informed that the stage of the new theater had been set on fire the night before and that all my paraphernalia and wardrobe which lay there unpacked had been consumed by the flames  the conflagration i found was occasioned by the following circumstance a methodist teacher who held forth in that city told his auditors that he dreamed the preceding night of being in the infernal regions at a grand entertainment where all the devils in hell were present when lucifer their chief gave for a toast the health of mr  who had sold his ground to build him a house upon meaning the theater and which was to be opened the next day for them all to reign in  the poor ignorant enthusiastic hearers of this godly preacher found their enmity against satan and his subjects instantly inflamed by this harrangue and in order to prevent so alarming an extention of his infernal majestys empire they hastened away in a body to the newbuilt playhouse and set the stage on fire luckily the flames were extinguished before any other part of the theater was consumed but the whole of my theatrical wardrobe which lay in the packages upon it were destroyed it appeared that this religious mob had been joined by others who wished to take advantage of the conflagration as a great deal of the false trumpery upon the regalia of the mock kings and queens had been taken away and being found of no great value lay scattered about the fields as the theater was a mile from the city and the flames did not burst out so as to become visible the incendiaries completed their design and silently retired no alarm was therefore given nor our loss known till the next morning    i left york but instead of attending to my health and proceeding as i ought to have done to london i took as good a roundabout way to the south as possible by crossing to the west i by slow stages set off for manchester where the fatigue of two days and a half in getting thither had overpowered me so much that instead of sleep i passed the night in agonies i however crawled into the coach that went to warrington in the morning and from thence took postchaise to frodsham a village in cheshire where frodsham the york actor was born and from thence got once more to dan smiths at chester  whitleys company was there and that manager invited me to play four nights and to give me the fifth i could not resist the temptation and began with no less a difficult character than richard the third the very rehearsal of which occasioned my repeatedly fainting however i armed myself with no less than a bottle of madeira and went through beyond expectation at night i acted shylock etc but never got to bed after playing without one or more fainting fits mr wilbraham entreated i would desist but i urged as i had gone through so much gratis i would finish at all hazards though i knew my life was at stake  mr didier a comedian now fixed at bath was then at chester  a friendly agreeable gentleman  on friday the   d of june      i finished with my benefit and acted othello and cadwallader in the author and after all the wilful dangerous labor i underwent the receipt of the house was only   l  all my acquaintance said i was rightly served being in a state so very unfit for such an undertaking i there received a letter from mr foot who was astonished i neglected the haymarket and the season so far advanced not informing him my reasons for not being in london at the expected season and more surprised to hear by accident that i was well he supposed as the chester paper had given him a clue to find where i was i then informed him i would in a few days be with him but feared i could neither assist him nor myself by appearing on the stage i was so very incapable from severe sickness in two or three days following i took a place at chester in a coach that at that time went through birmingham  i bid adieu to mr smith and mr wilberham neither of whom i ever expected to see again instead of that they are gone long since to rest and i am still in this world living to relate their deaths  but to keep up ones spirits and hope for the best is not a bad prescription in sickness or in health and it is to my astonishment with grateful acknowledgments to almighty god for his blessings that here i am in tolerable health not yet having swallowed the allotment of dust to which i am to return  in the coach were seated madame capdeville a principal dancer with her mother the daughter had been for years a first dancer at covent garden theater but then returning from ireland i was very much indisposed and discomposed with the journey but both my fellow travelers were very kind and attentive to me at broad noonday the ladies desired the coachman to stop and having the door opened out they went in full display and with the most perfect composure performed a deed without a name in the middle of the road but as it was summer and dusty the roads wanted watering the john bull of a coachman blushed and hung down his head and ill as i was i could not refrain from the oddity of the whole groupe being considered as viewing and not viewing the whimsical transaction  i need not add those females were french not english ladies when the coach toward evening stopped at castle bromage i thought while the ladies were drinking tea i would attempt to walk a mile and let the coach overtake me and in case of being enfeebled as the evening was serene could stop at some style or door till i could be relieved by the attending vehicle i dragged myself on for near a mile or perhaps more when i halted expecting succor from the arrival of the carriage every minute then endeavored slowly to proceed for fear of growing chilly then i waited then i walked and that disagreeable predicament i sustained till all my patience was turned to the contrary extreme and tottering like jane shore in the last act was reduced to rea pain and uneasiness it was some time before on the road i could meet a friendly cottage to give me information or a comfortable resting place for by the quick approach of night my anxiety greatly increased the first hut i saw i implored a hearing and related my dismal story of waiting for the coach etc and on reciting my ditty and explaining my distressed situation the good old woman of the cottage exclaimed  o good sir you are sadly beside your own sen for you are now on london coach road coach is right weel at brumugum ere this so you mun cross country like you look perilous bad lse sure and god send you well at brumugum i then inquired with aching heart how far birmingham was from thence she said why a mun not mair than three or four miles like only cross country like now three or four computed miles by such guessers generally turns out double the ground they mention and to the stranger is treble  he is perplexed at every turning by not knowing whether he is right or wrong and that was my situation besides my sufferings from pain when i attempted to undertake to walk and explore my way to birmingham  and this situation so horrid was all occasioned by my having committed a blunder a child would have been whipped for the want of common observation at the division of the road and the remedy very easy for with patience and money in my purse the first countryman for a shilling or so would have gone to the welsh harp at castle bromage and ordered a postchaise and besides my illness all my luggage was in the coach with cash clothes etc which without resting a night proceeded directly for london  however in spite of prudence or ability i determined on this walk to birmingham with all my imperfections on my head while the night was making quick approach to darkness off i set and crossed from place to place sometimes with intelligence then not any to be had i had boots on and when i had conquered three or four miles to add still to my misfortune and misery my kneebuckle got loose dropped down my boot and imperceptibly worked itself to the bottom and at last got under the sole of my foot which occasioned not only uneasiness but very excruciating pain to a degree not to be endured and no possibility of relieving my anguish and it frequently shifted in the walking which caused increasing and variety of torments i actually should have abandoned myself to despair and to the first dry ditch for my nights lodging which then must have finished me but fortunately casting up my eyes through the gloomy dusk i with a most pleasing sensation beheld the steeple of the new church at birmingham which i recollected with rapture it gave a faint gleam of hope and like a drowning man and the straw so did i in idea feed my hopes with the luxury of a featherbed and a negus by twelve oclock  i was however as may naturally be supposed much farther off my station than i imagined  but while there is life there are hopes i could never have accomplished that event had not the perspiration i underwent been so undescribably violent that i dared not stop a moment to suffer the winds of heaven to visit my face too roughly and at the same time though overpowered with weakness i felt myself breathe easier and the fever and hectic heat not so strong as it usually hung upon me by twelve oclock thank god i accomplished my surprising undertaking which had given me more pain anxiety trouble and danger than ever the famous powell encountered on his walks from london to york and back again i soon after my arrival at mr barbers the swan got a strong madeira negus and on inquiring was much pleased and obliged to madame capdeville who had kindly taken care to have all my luggage left safely under the protection of mr barber for her head aided by the observation of the coachman had suggested how my unfortunate blunder had happened which prevented my having much trouble and inquiries what had helped the matter was my having been a constant friend to mr barber the season i have beforementioned being at birmingham under the command of my friend mr hull in       i was weak the next day and could not get out of bed but no fever and the perspiration still continued immoderately after three or four days i found myself recovering and wishing to be in london whether to live or die i ordered a postchaise and in two days and a half got there without being too much hurried and received benefit by making the stages easy and suitable as i ound my spirits i went to my own apartents and there got under good direction and or once in my life kept regular hours used moderate exercise and in a short time was so surprisingly improved in health as to wish being again on the boards and produced my skeleton figure to mr foot he was astonished and expressed himself much hurt at seeing me so ill but seemed impatient for me to begin at his theater  settling terms took but little time  he was not mean but acted generously i was not unreasonable for what i asked he immediately granted  indeed my terms might be better as i pleaded apparent ill health and not wishing to play  the old dish of the minor was in july appointed for my first onset which mr foot had not acted but had deferred in the interim wondering at my delay  and the minor not having been acted at either theater from september      till that time gave it a degree of novelty i was received that year as an old established favorite of the town the haymarket stage was as easy as the york stage was when i had the use of my legs and where i might be said of late years to have been truly at home  tragedy alamode was revived for mr foot and myself to appear in mr project mr foot the tragedy part all by me and was often repeated with equal and uncommon applause i increased highly in public favor not only from the indulgent partiality of the audience which in general accompanies such performers as they honor with their good and golden opinion but i was then particularly industrious and acting was my only resource for pleasure  my severe illness had alarmed me so much that i lived strictly regular i was more collected a material article for young or old actors to observe and follow for though a man be used to wine and good dinners and be perfectly clear and sober in his room yet the least flurry or mistake on the stage sets that dinner and wine into a fume and makes the brain feel deranged and confused and no actor can be a good timeist on the stage unless he keeps himself cool and collected and in good spirits of the purest kind not beholden to the assistance of the grape o thou invincible spirit of wine if thou have no name to be known by let us call thee devil  to be now a sensible man and by and by a fool and presently a beast  every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil  the true refreshment of the performer should be from the fanning gales excited from the pleasure of the audience while the actor in return feels his heart glowing with rapture and gratitude  my health improved daily and by acting with mr foot i had seldom more stage exercise than what was of service to me the apprentice was also revived which i acted very often to a crowded theater  it was commanded by the duke of york as a first piece which occasioned the only little dispute that in the haymarket theater ever occurred between mr foot and myself his royal highness commanded it as a first piece as he urged some very particular engagement  mr foot appointed the minor as the after piece and i remonstrated and indeed reused playing shift enforcing that as al my imitatons were so dispersed in the apprentice i could not leave out in the character of shift what i had accustomed the audience to see and if i did perform the same the repetition of such mimicry instead of being pleasing would be offensive mr foot seemed much displeased and even disgusted but yielded to my argument and on that occasion played shift himself there was no more dispute about it or was it ever mentioned again  we had one little sparringbout in the spring of      which mr woodward soon reconciled i had acted by having secretly obtained a purloined copy his farce of the devil upon two sticks and after having committed the fault and well knowing he would quickly hear of my offense i by way of preventing his anger informed him of my invasion on his property thinking he would construe it as a very good joke but on the contrary he was really much irritated and by return of post favored me with the few following whimsical lines my dear sir your favor brought me the first account of the devil upon two sticks having been played upon your stage  your letter has delivered me from every difficulty and will procure me the pleasure of soon seeing you in town as i shall most certainly move the court of kings bench against you the first day of next term i have the honor to be my dear sir  your most obliged and faithful humble servant sam foot may            mr footes sly indignation insinuated in the above obliged me to have recourse to my friend woodwards interference which in a little time after procured me the following with the olivebranch from the devil upon two sticks and as they are both originals imagine they will be deemed worth perusal dear sir methinks i hear you say to mrs wilkinson  do not you think mr woodward considering all our civility is a little negligent in his return  what signified writing till i had materials to write upon  i waited for an opportunity to see and converse with foot in a proper moment  have eat with him drank with him took him in a convivial cue and after all can assure you there is nothing will happen from that quarter unless fresh crimes are committed i saw macklin the other night who tells me he has traveled lately to leicester and intends writing to you i suppose upon the subject that induced him to travel  i shall send the nonsense i promised you the very first opportunity  i expected mr tasker to dine with me at my little mansion out of town but i have seen him but once and that accidentally in the street since we parted at stilton  the weather has been much against us at the haymarket and we have done nothing yet to swagger about  when i have been alone in the fields near my dewlling place i have sometimes thought of you and your theater  i have conceived and perhaps may bring forth an harlequin at york races if i am delivered of a wellfeatured kinchin i will pin it up in a basket and drop it at your door  without any offense to mrs wilkinson  to whom pray give my most grateful compliments and accept the same yourself from him who really is  your sincere friend and humble servant h woodward june           mr foot and i after that time were on the most perfect terms of intimacy as the followin will evidence amongst a number i have now b me from that gentleman and man of true wi humor and genius dear sir i am much obliged to you for the offer of your assistance in the town of newcastle but the newspapers have laid out a plan for me that never occurred to myself  your old friend d  e has not only lost his situation with me and colman but is on the brink of losing his nose so that his head and his tail have brought him into a pretty condition  i hope the northern crown sits lightly on your brow and that your immediate subjects are not only dutiful and observant but that your whole wideextended empire pay their taxes largely and cheerfully i have this summer entertained the veteran sheridan who is dwindled to a mere cok and bottle chelsea pensioner  he has enlisted some new recruits unfit for service and such as might be expected to issue from his discipline  i should be glad to chop upon you in my way to edinburgh for which place i shall set out about the middle of october  ross is with me ill and indolent but however thanks to my own industry the campaig has been happy enough  believe me most sincerely yours sam foot northend aug       in      to my part of the apprentice in london when acted as the afterpiece i was ever honored with the continuance of the audience on account of the four last lines to which i never had less than four plaudits for my imitations were not only good but well planned for effect  and much depends on that one speech in a parody of different writing would suit for the mimicry of one particular person which to imitate another would seem all discordant and out of time and place  the last lines to the apprentice were as follows to which are affixed the names for those who knew the actors of those days to judge how far they were applicable or the contrary sparks some act the upper some the under parts  sheridan and most assume what is foreign to their hearts  mossop thus life is but a tra  gic co  mic jest  woodward and all is farce and mummery at best  the regular marking each actors features and manners in those lines gave great effect and obtained much approbation  mr weston was of great assistance in that farce by his inimitable acting of simon  i requested mrs rich on my benefit to honor me once more with letting me ride her hobbyhorses and give them a summers airing as they had not been rubbed down for a twelvemonth which she kindly granted me and i acted bays by universal desire and to a house much more crowded than the year before  that truly excellent actor mr parsons was then at mr footes theater and i think will remember my assertion to be not a chimera of the brain but a fact  from a love of cash i performed five saturdays for the sixth to be clear at the old theater on richmond hill mr foot lent me his dresses and my benefit was on saturday august  0      and was honored with the sanction of the duke of york lady petersham and a large party were there and i was favored with a brilliant appearance most of the little pit was laid into the boxes the farce of the citizen i had as a play and i acted young philpot old philpot mr weston with tragedy alamode  mr footes season ended the middle of september  i sold all my furniture china etc which was very good though not of the newest fashion being that of my honored fathers and mothers originally at the old savoy residence but as i had lost my revered good parent i had not any occasion for constant apartments being kept in london at mr alcocks who is a most worthy man and enjoying ease and affluence from the sweet gathered fruits of industry that business of sale being concluded i set off for liverpool where i wa an entire stranger but had heard money not grass grew in the streets there i offered my tea to sale but they were better judges of traffic than to purchase from one they thought no better of than a hawker or a peddler and i no more than a destitute peddler at that time who had a license to distribute my wares the inhabitants of liverpool proved to me cautious and wary i hired what was called the bucksroom and there i expected a numerous attendance from curiosity but truth compels me to relate   l was the first nights receipt october the  th and the other on october the  th   l and they were attended so ill that my own cash not that of the liverpool bank secured me a carriage to birmingham where i cannot boast of superior attraction the best receipt being only   l from thence i returned from the southward to old west chester and at that ancient city had an elegant and crowded appearance  very strange that when i relied on myself alone i was well attended by my chester friends as before observed from that place i went to bristol where i had a brilliant room there i received a letter of invitation forwarded to me from mr jefferson  on november         i performed for my friend mr flemings benefit at bath who had he week preceding favored me with his assistance on my night at the bristol assemblyrooms  early in december      i set off for exeter where mr jefferson my old friend and acquaintance in dublin and london was then become the manager and every thing promised most flatteringly that he would soon make a fortune but the substance is often changed for a shadow nor are managers gains so easily amassed as the public can gather it for them his invitation had double allurement  first novelty which was ever prevalent and next to see so pleasant and friendly a man as he had ever proved to me  i joined him and his new troop  mr jefferson was at that time endeavoring not without encouragement to bring that theater into a regular and established reputation  he had engaged mr reddish and many other good performers mrs jefferson his first wife was then living she had one of the best dispositions that ever harbored in a human breast and more extraordinary joined to that meekness she was one of the most elegant women ever beheld the city of exeter had till that time for some years been under the management in theatrical matters of the old portsmouth and plymouth company of comedians of whom i have made so much mention from the year       but all that set by the practice of morning drams from alehouse to alehouse besides every hour being employed in large libations with their friends as they termed them had as by universal agreement one would suppose almost all of them made their final exit to another world unanointed unaneald no reckoning made but sent to their account with all their imperfections on their heads which should be here marked to the general class of actors as a lighthouse to mariners in bad weather to all morning stage drinking town or country performers as a slow but sure poison a dangerous custom easily attained but once admitted as a habit very very difficult to quit and the conclusion certain ruin with sense and reason holds superior strife and conquers honor nature fame and life   it will be here scornfully and perhaps too justly remarked by unforgiving zealots what strange dissipated creatures low players are but let them recollect that every profession has its degrees and singularities and i think it as strange a trait when i observe a proud priest beyond a wolsey bursting with mossopian pride and will certainly smile when informed he has been holding forth on meekness of spirit and charity to all men  nor should a preachers changing his opinion after having been a constant attendant at the theater and a professed admirer of the drama warp my judgment because he from lucrative visws has altered his way of thinking as we all do at different periods according to our state of health our humor or our time of life when i picture pretenders meeting under the cloak of outside purity i marvel  like lady brumpton how one can accost the other with a grave face methinks they should laugh out like two fortune tellers or two opponent lawyers that know each other for cheats the great and good in all ages have been protectors of the muses and they will outbalance any characters that can be set in opposition and i must beg permission to advance that no diversion ever was devised which is so truly calculated to instruct while it entertains and it is no argument against the stage to affirm that the morals of some of its professors have been tainted by it for the evil and perverse inclination will extract malignity from a howard a hanway or a mason let us ask the most rigid  did never the man of intrigue first become acquainted at church with her whose unsuspecting innocence he has sacrificed o his passions  bid me not drink because alexander was poisoned nor suffer any fire in my house because london was burned the reasons in defense of these remonstrances would be of the same force against the theater  o but says one of the sanctified a young lady dropped down dead some years ago in the hull theater  poor thing the devil found her on his own ground  and pray mr good man pure name any place where mr death ever did or does pay any ceremony  the dreadful earthquake at lisbon which happened at the time of high mass was on a sunday noon  one half of the lives lost on that occasion were at their duty though taken unprepared to that undiscovered country that puzzles our will  besides the whole body of actors should not be condemned because a few are unconvertible since by the same rule we may freely abuse the state the clergy the army and every set of people until one offers itself to our view which has never been disgraced by a member  this i believe is not in being  to have filled the theater had it been possible with professed methodists  the dramas declared enemies they would have involuntarily wept at mr garricks lear and have laughed incessantly at his abel drugger the strict sects who are blessed with superiority of virtue should make allowances from their own superfluity of goodness for the thoughtless sallies of men of genius and quick passions who are too liable to fall into mistakes many inconsiderate minds have been too easily led into error and have thereby forfeited their country friends and liberty and by the necessary laws have been subject to the most ignominious as well as heartfelt sufferings yet after reflection aided by judgment and selfcorrection and full conviction of their folly have providentially been blessed with affluence and prosperity  so the poor player who struts his life upon the stage is too often drove thereto from acts of indiscretion and seeks refuge in the theater as his dernir resort  if unsuccessful he turns again abandoned and from intoxication becomes indifferent as to what he does either in regard to his life his death or his reputation  but if blessed with genius and the seeds of industry and attention and also happily fostered and nourished by the good and affluent his mind expands and the child of folly on the stage becomes in reality new born proves a shining ornament to the theater and an example wothy of imitation to his newlyadopted profession consequently a praiseworthy character and a credit to universal society  an honest mans the noblest work of god  at the time of my expedition to exeter there existed at that place a most eccentric genius and very particular character mr andrew brice a printer  he was to a degree remarkable in manner figure and a thousand peculiarities that cannot be described but had accumulated by art genius and lucky circumstances an independent fortune  george faulkener of dublin was by no means such an extraordinary being besides mr faulkener as a man of benevolent and good qualities must ever be revered but in the comparison of goodness the rueful andrew brice should not be mentioned  alluding to andrew brice gives me authority from mr king himself to insert the following  when mr garrick wrote the character of lord ogleby it was before he went to italy but on his return and once more engaging with the fatigues of his theater he relinquished all thoughts of acting that part telling mr king for his reasons that he found his state of health not equal to sustain the run of a new play and that if he himself should play lord ogleby it would lead into applications from authors to request his performing in their pieces to prevent which he had come to a determination not to study any new character whatever and desired mr king would do the part  mr king begged to decline  mr garrick read it to that gentleman  the part he still refused even to the fourth time and desired the part of brush instead of lord ogleby  mr garrick still continued pressing and mr king fearing mr garrick should think him more obstinate than right took the part to consider of it and by paying close attention when locked up in his study he accidentally repeated a few passages in a tremulous voice which recurred to his ear as something similar to the sound of old andrew brices of exeter  he tried again and again and found he had hit upon the very man as a natural and true picture to represent lord ogleby mr king went to mr garrick and privately rehearsed a scene  garrick was all astonished and thundered out by g  d king if you can but sustain that fictitious manner and voice throughout it will be one of the greatest performances that ever adorned a british theater mr garricks prophecy was verified as mr kings manner of producing that character before the public was then and is to this day one of the most capital and highlyfinished pieces of acting with which any audience ever was treated and will never be forgotten while a trait of mr king can be remembered but alas the actors fame however great cannot be recollected many years beyond the time he lived for ah me as garrick observed  the painter dead yet still he charms the eye while england lives his fame can never die but he who struts his hour upon the stage can scarce extend his fame for half an age nor pen nor pencil can the actor save the art and artist share one common grave   andrew brice in figure and tremulous manner was exactly what mr king appears to be in lord ogleby and i could have forgiven brice had he painted like his lordship for he had so much of the lily in his complexion that he looked though one of the neatest the most corpselike mandarine figure i ever beheld in the various productions of human nature  when i acted bays at exeter and spoke a speech or two in his manner it struck the whole audience like electricity  mr jefferson who performed johnson was so taken by the surprise that e could not proceed for laughter  he is now at exeter and will i am certain recollect and corroborate that circumstance my benefit even at this distant time demands my acknowledgement it was so numerously attended i ever think of exeter with pleasure the country that surrounds that city is beautiful and the air esteemed more screne and salubrious than almost any other part of the kingdom  as a proof it is judged so i have known families who have been in bad health ordered by yorkshire physicians to winter the severe months at exeter as the montpelier of great britain  good eating abounds there and the market produces an uncommon variety of articles all in the highest perfection  i was there in the winter and in january the face of the country looked well and produced a verdure not usual at that inclement season in other parts of england i went from thence for two days with mr jefferson to plymouth at the dock i met my old acquaintance captain scot of chester  the situation seemed striking but i had not leisure nor was it a time of the year to judge of the prospect of mount edgcumbe etc to any fair advantage  i took a peep at the theater though on a sunday it appeared very decent good theaters were not then so plenty in any county as at present the flat scenes i remember moved on a principle i never saw either before or since they pushed up and down a groove in one straight frame like  windowsash which must be a good plan a hey so worked must be always steady and the canvas not wrinkled as when on rollers  one inconvenience must attend it  a great height in the building is required and another they must always gather dust and dirt which will consequently efface the painting  one good effect however occurs no idler performer or other could move the scene and produce the head of peeping tom while an act was conducting of the utmost consequence a trifling accident of that kind once disconcerted me much  the audience hissed the person so peeping which disgrace i took to myself but had it soon pleasingly explained  that fault should be more avoided by the performers than it is  before i finished at exeter i had the most presing invitations repeatedly from mess dowson and bates at edinburgh intimating they could not go on without my immediate assistance  a pretty little trip the end of january from exeter to edinburgh  however preliminaries were soon settled and mr jefferson had behaved friendly generously politely and attentively i left him with my best wishes and proceeded to london where i rested only two or three days and then posted down for the north stopped one day with mr baker at york saw the new theater  broke down near durham  t chaise was so shattered with the crush i was obliged to wait on the road till another could be procured i myself was asleep and not hurt though i confess a little alarmed mr dowson was purposely come to newcastle to treat me from thence post to edinburgh we only continued one day we got safe to the capital of scotland  the first night on the road thither we lay at old camus which house i believe is now erased  from what cause i know not  it was said to be haunted and though i am not superstitious as to such idle dreams and fictions of the brain yet i must declare such a noise i never heard in my life as during the night at that place we reached edinburgh the first week in february      the theater had sustained the loss of mr digges and mrs bellamy the only true support was mr aickin there was it is true a mr stamper who had been a great favorite but he was grown quite inebriated and that from morning drinking the company was much the same except mr stamper mr creswick a mr parker and mrs pie from ireland also mr and mrs mgeorge we went on tolerably till richard the third was acted  a character at edinburgh i was always particularly well received in and with more than common applause but during the summer sessions in      mr sheridan had engaged for a certain number of nights and on one of those nights had acted richard at which time the want of a young gentleman or lady to supply the part of prince edward rendered it impracticable to have the play acted unless mrs mozeen whose figure was neat and youthful though bordering at that time on the vale of years would quit petticoat hopes in lady anne of royal coronation and assume the young monarch in expectation of the same honors but in the winter mrs wheelers daughters who promised remarkably well on the stage supplied the childrens parts very ably mrs mozeen expected her lady anne as her ock part and no supposition could be wellgrounded for mrs mgeorges taking offense at it for though she had played lady anne with mr sheridan in the summer season she must have known it was necessity and goodnature in mrs mozeen to have resigned lady anne for prince edward on a matter of emergency which obstacle being removed and the children provided for the royal stock she had double claim to former rights but on the night richard was acted in the scene where mrs mozeen in lady anne made her appearance a general uproar ensued aye even to the pelting of the lady the collegians one and all having formed a severe party at the malevolent misrepresentations instigated by mr and mrs mgeorge whose wrongs were related with double force to the town as being cruelly deprived o lady anne a character in which she had been received with so much praiseworthy applause  mrs mgeorge inended to have produced another lady anne to the wondering audience to laent a husband but manager dowson having been alarmed by authenticated intelligence that mischief was brewing barricaded the entrances and kept them double guarded by doorkeepers to prevent roxana with her dagger from gaining admittance behind the scenes and thereby wounding the bosom of his beloved statira it was an hour before the uproar ceased but mrs mozeen evinced if she had a little body she had a great soul  the audience were very attentive and honored me much that evening in every scene except where lady anne made her appearance and then marks of rage indignation and contempt ensued  the riot did not subside with that night but lasted above a fortnight and was carried to such extremes that not any ladies visited the theater from apprehension of disturbances and outrage manager dowson who paid adoration to his beloved statira even equal to the poets fancy levelled all his fury on her desperate foe mrs mgeorge by an immediate dismission which stroke of sudden impolicy at that juncture only served to enrage the more dowson still faithful to his faithless mistress rather than mrs mgeorges party should have reigned triumphant i verily believe would have taken a torch at noon and set our famed persepolis on fire but the fates did what the manager could not for though the collegians gave ammunition and all manual assistance in mrs mgeorges defense yet they did not or could not afford to offer their purses therefore as provisions grew scanty that tragic queen thought it more prudent and better generalship to retreat than be starved by attacking a fortress she found determined on obstinate defense and which perseverance stood very little chance of subduing nor would she trust to the chance of war which seemed to threaten instant famine and though she had proved her ability to raise discord she plainly found she could not in her distressed state raise the necessary supplies for if dowson could not pay his regiment with notes from the bank of air he could find remaining resources and draw from newcastle but the mgeorges forces though few from desertions had to their surprise only the bank of air to rely on so off she and her spouse went and soon after her departure the cause of dispute being removed times lenient hand spread over mutual faults our theatrical wounds were healed and peace and harmony once more restored us to our pristine health and vigor  this is no more in the relation of our stage battle at edinburgh than a strict matter of fact and can be attested by a gentleman of wellknown worth and veracity mr garenciers now of york who was at that time a student at edinburgh college  treating on the subject of rios occasions my proceeding with a few anecdotes  i remember in the winter of      that that was the season mrs cibber was first attacked with her somach complaint and barry the divine barry either had or pretended he had frequent sore throats and hoarsenesses the comedies in which mrs woffington was principal were generally brought forward on these sicknesses of the tragedians and at the bottom of the bill in which she alone stood capital were generally announced the united names of quin barry and cibber of this she constantly complained and at last declared that the next time it happened she would not play  shortly after jane shore was announced mrs cibber was ill and the play changed late in the day but i cannot say to what  the next day the constant couple was put up sir harry wildair mrs woffington with the great names at the bottom of the bill  woffington kept her word sent a message at five oclock she was ill and positively refused to play  they were obliged to substitute the miser lovegold mr macklin by this time the public began to murmur at their frequent disappointments and took it into their heads that mr rich the manager was very ill used by his company and determined on the next indisposition they would interfere and resent for him precisely at this time woffington made her refusal and on her next appearance in lady jane gray the whole weight of their resentment fell on her  whoever is living and saw her that night will own they never beheld any figure half so beautiful since  her anger gave a glow to her complexion and even added luster to her charming eyes they treated her very rudely bade her ask pardon and threw orange peels she behaved with great resolution and treated their rudeness with glorious contempt she left the stage was called for and with infinite persuasion was prevailed on to return however she did walked forward and told them she was there ready and willing to perform her character if they chose to permit her that the decision was theirs on or off just as they pleased a matter of indifference to her  the ons had it and all went smoothly afterward though she always persisted in believing that the party was originally formed by mr richs family and particular friends some of whom she did not scruple to name though i believe she always acquitted him of any knowledge of it  it is often mentioned in the country that a manager should prevent every riot  that a manager should be ready to answer on any frivolous occasion  were that to be really submitted to how could mr garrick dared to have had a palace at hampton court for his chief residence or mr harris live at knightsbridge constantly or be part of the season at bath entrusting the care of the theater and answers to the public in case of unforeseen particular disturbances to mr kemble mr lewis or the principal actor then on the spot if danger or misfortune threatened  these suppositions in the country leads to incendiary epistles but how can such demons pretended friends or secret enemies be answered either as to their ill will or affected good wishes equally immaterial and not availing as be the contents right or wrong true or false good or bad it would be ridiculous and really loss of time to answer what is avowedly fabricated by nobody i had in consequence thereof formed a resolution in future never to read any one of the kind and had in fact carried the resolve into practice but accident only broke the determination for one morning last york races on opening a letter and not perceiving any name i threw it on the table which mrs w perused and hastily declared i had an estate let me i instantly took up mr anonymous and read the following lines petworth in sussex sir by the death of a mr whicker you are supposed to have right to considerable property and desired to send your mothers maiden name respectively to the executors  mr ireland here and mr wait of byworth near petworth  aug            i on inquiry was soon informed by a most respectable family in essex that the executors had been from such letters greatly plagued and tormented by different applications and that one person had actually traveled some hundred miles with great fatigue trouble perplexity and expense to attain the sussex estate but was soon after his arrival convinced it was all a bubble  end of the third
