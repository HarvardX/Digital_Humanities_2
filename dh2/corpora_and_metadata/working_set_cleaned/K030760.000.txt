annual oration delivered march   th    0 before the medical society bolt court fleet street london by george wallis m d one of the fellows and lecturer on the theory and practice of physic  medico diligenti priusquam conetur aegro adhibere medicinam non solum morbus ejus cui mederi volet sed etiam consuetudo valentis and natura corporis cognoscenda est  cicer orat london printed for g g j and j robinson paternoster row  mdccxc  preface when the members of the medical society on the day of my delivering this oration before them did me the honor to request its publication i considered the request as a complimentary custom usual on that occasion and as such received it however on a second and third application by order of their council amongst whom freedom of debate on any subject is expected and all compliment and ceremony incompatible with their characters in that department i was induced to believe that they might have perceived some hints at least not unworthy further consideration and notwithstanding i had at first asked permission to make such additions as to me appeared requisite on finding they would be infinitely too diffusive for a work of this nature and as i could claim protection only by adhering strictly to those sentiments and opinions which were to them delivered and upon which they could alone found a wish for my making them more public in that state i now offer them without alteration reserving the elucidation of several parts for some future occasion as they form the basis of a larger work which i have an intention of completing as i can find opportunity  should therefore the following sheets which now make their appearance to the world in compliance with the desire of the medical society fortunately add the slightest ray of consequence to that collective body and afford the candid reader satisfaction my labor will be amply compensated particularly as at the same time it will evince the deference i pay to the impartiality  judgment  and abilities of several members of that institution  as well as the sense of that duty i owe to the community in general  g w  addendum after heart in page    line   insert muscular fibers  annual oration gentlemen and fellowassociates as i consider this institution formed on the broad basis of universal good the parent of general utility not of selfish ostentation and as this with its sister kingdoms may be justly styled the emporium of medical knowledge where many of its members the brightest luminaries of the hippocratic school have not disdained to convey their discoveries to the world in the common language of this country  a language if not esteemed so concise and elegant yet full as comprehensive full as replete with descriptive powers as any of which greece or rome could ever boast and as it must be allowed that opinions in any art ought to be delivered in modes divested of all ambiguity and embarrassment certainly considering our own vernacular language possessed of these advantages as being the most familiar to a very great majority of this audience though learned before which i have the honor to present myself and perfectly understood by all  it will not i hope be construed want of respect or a careless inattention to the consequence and dignity ever annexed to professional bodies thus associated that i have presumed to deviate from some of my predecessors dropping the tinselled trappings of roman grace for the plain but more useful ornament of english perspicuity and making use of a vehicle easy as common to communicate my observations in order that i might through the whole of them be readily followed and not in any part misunderstood  for however familiar may be the latin idiom to readers conversant in that language  however easy to comprehend in its nicest points  to auditors not constantly habituated to that style of delivery the familiarity and ready comprehension would be defective  on these considerations i found some small claim to your approbation and considering the arduousness of the present undertaking i flatter myself i shall still farther experience your indulgence unimpressed with this idea insurmountable indeed would have been the difficulties which presented themselves to my reflection but conscious that liberality of sentiment with men of erudition directs the judgment and softens the severity of criticism every obstacle vanished and diffidence gave way to duty for it has ever been with me a fixed principle and laid down as a law immutable that as every individual in the medical hemisphere is so closely and so necessarily united to the welfare of mankind he is bound by the strongest ties natural and social to exert his abilities however weak when called to promote any laudable purpose  connected therefore as i am with the members of this medical institution  with you who actuated by philanthropy make science the pleasurable labor of your lives  and that part of science your particular study the most noble which can engage the pursuit of man  framed by divine wisdom for the relief and preservation of the human species  preventing mitigating and subduing many of their corporal calamities  your wishes i considered as a mandate  and as you have thought proper to elect me to this office of honor  an office which would have been far better supplied by many of your associates  it became me therefore to reflect what there was in my power to offer which might in some though perhaps too small a degree compensate for your loss of time and attention to the consequential avocation of your profession which candor would subject you to on this occasion  conversant as you are with assiduously engaged in the acquisition of medical knowledge and happy in the promulgation two points fell only to my election either to furnish something new for the improvement or something to clear what might retard and clog the progress of the healing art  of the former i fear i have little to lay before you worthy of your attention even vanity cannot suggest to or persuade me that any thing has occurred to my observation with which you may not perhaps have been long acquainted  my animadversions must therefore in a great measure be confined to the latter wherein i shall only presume to offer some hints which taken into the consideration of superior abilities may assist so am i led to hope in extending our particular art to that goal of perfection at which human exertions are limited only to arrive  and as many obstacles have been thrown in the way which have prevented us from rising to that achme as much as human endeavors united with strong mental powers and indefatigable assiduity judiciously conducted would have accomplished the greatest of which has been the thirst after theoretic knowledge  it might appear necessary to take a survey of the progress of the medic art from the time of the divine old man the first founder of systematic physic to the present era in which some possess no less merited no less exalted characters but to an audience like this so well versed in the history of physic and all its branches it would properly be considered a work of presumption and supererogation  i shall therefore only as it is necessarily connected with my subject take a concise view of the means by which hippocrates acquired his knowledge extensive as it was considering the period in which he lived  in the same manner show how his successors rather retarded than promoted the utility of the aesculapian art particularly as some of our professors steer not altogether clear of similar errors and then attempt to point out where some of our present modes require the aid of correction  hippocrates enriched his mind from observation and founded his practice on facts simply as they appeared to him who being blessed with quick perception nice discrimination and profound sagacity made such discoveries  deduced such certain consequences  and raised his superstructures on so solid a foundation that he left behind him stupendous monuments of great abilities  abilities so superior to his predecessors and cotemporaries that future ages pursued with avidity and retained with confidence many documents framed in the infancy of his art  and happy had it been for later times had his plan simple and easy as it was been religiously observed but alas man as if unconscious of his own weakness vain enough to suppose he could discover the arcana naturae  investigate first causes  and carry his curious eye into the darkest labyrinths began to prefer ingenuity to observation and mounted on the wings of false fame disregarded the humble paths of modest inquiry and built on vain and conjectural hypothesis  and what the result theory arose after theory and each succeeding one though it corrected the errors of that which had been before adopted still like its predecessor sunk into oblivion leaving behind few remains worthy of practical pursuit   nor is it difficult to account for the cause why such different consequences awaited these different modes  hippocrates it is said by the most rigid observation of every action and motion of nature of things which did in reality exist acquired a wonderful knowledge of the genuine disposition of diseases and by carefully comparing the same sort of distempers and their various minute motions in different patients and all the circumstances and accidents which usually preceded and attended them he could readily foretell an approaching malady and after its invasion give a right judgment of its progress and event  as nature terminated diseases when left to herself he observed her mode first tracing the manner in which the symptoms in those that were acute succeeded one another hence arose his art of presaging and thus he formed his method of curing them by imitating nature when she proved herself defective  from these observations he discovered the use of bleeding  scarifications  issues  setons where in similar complaints nature supplied haemorrhages and abscesses  artificial diarrhoeas  sudorifics  emetics  diaphoretics  diuretics etc because he found she by some of these means relieved the constitution under particular circumstances hence then he became her humble imitator conscious that she alone was the most judicious directress  but the theorists forming of themselves a set of principles principles the mere coinage of distempered reason from them deduced all their arguments supported all their practice and endeavored to prove nature obedient to laws so founded  hence the incongruous elementary atomical systems of succeeding sects  hence the conceits of an helmont  the whimsicalities of a paracelsus  hence a variety of chemical chimaeras and all the inconsistencies of hydraulic and mechanic subtlety and hence fell medicine into shameful disrepute it becoming more the pride of cavilling skepticism and scholastic vanity to build ingenious though fallacious doctrines than after detecting error laboring to pursue nature through her plain and humble paths  and it appears astonishing to a reflecting mind that notions so ridiculous practices so absurd should be countenanced in later times when it is known that all the labors of the ancients as well as moderns are chiefly valuable for the simple recitals they contain founded on observation collected from appearances and delivered with candor hence the praeeminence of an hippocrates aretaeus trallian aurelianus celsus tulpius lommius morgagni sydenham and some others of more modern date whom to mention might be considered as indelicate and the result of adulation  and indeed this simplicity the more it is pursued the more strongly it convinces us of its utility affording the most certain perhaps the only proper method of acquiring and communicating medical information for the theories of the present day though fraught with no small degree of plausibility will not stand the test of critical inquiry they all appear to be too generally applied in fevers particularly  can we suppose that in such as from their commencement to their termination are attended with profuse sweating or a moist soft skin a constriction of the cuticular pores takes place  in those where the circulation is languid  the action of the vascular system torpid  the prostration of strength sudden and extreme that an active stimulus is the cause  or in those where no oppression load nausea sickness at the stomach or uneasiness in the intestines  no catarrhal or pulmonic affections manifest themselves that they deduce their origin from too copious and morbid secretion of the mucus in those organs surely not yet these by different classes of practitioners are considered as the proximate cause of febrile affections and applied in common to all  but within these mansions such a theoretic cacoethes appears not to be nurtured if we examine the nature of the proceedings within these walls adopted what is the roof by which we are sheltered but that of an aedes aesculapiana if we advert to the public product of your application what are your memoirs so justly enumerated amongst the most valuable labors of the medic art but the tabulae aeneae templorum ornamented by simplicity and supported by truth it must be observed that at this period the author had not sent any papers on medical subjects to the society   nor need we take up much time in furnishing proofs of the superiority of such a scheme over every other which has been produced by the fertility of human invention  view but our english hippocrates sydenham he by recalling this mode not only contended with but conquered a theoretic world notwithstanding the powerful opposition he met with invidious as violent and we find his descriptions stand at this hour unshaken nor can be overthrown but by the hand of heaven when medicine shall be no more so firmly supported are they by unerring truth so simply yet so justly are they delivered that they are to all intelligible  by all valued  by all quoted even those who wild with hypothesis leave nothing behind them but relics similar to these which can attract our attention or merit our observation  still notwithstanding we are convinced of the decaptive notions by which some of our early predecessors were governed  notwithstanding we can view the efforts of our cotemporaries not perfectly consistent in the application of their speculative opinions  notwithstanding the advantages unknown to former ages which daily are presented in every branch of medical philosophy which are discoverable by slight observation and may be truly arranged with the causae evidentes we avail not ourselves of these advantages or apply them sufficiently to render our modus medendi as perfect as it might be  there is too great too general a solicitude in searching after specifics and inquiring into the nature of the semina morbi as if the former did exist  or the latter were within the reach of human investigation we seem to be more anxious about the agentia mirifica than the agenda as if the latter were completely understood that they were is devoutly to be wished for they come more materially under our consideration at least it appears to me a truth irrefragable that were we to pay the strictest attention to the constitution study more minutely its parts dependencies moving powers and peculiarities practice would be divested of many errors with which it too unfortunately at present abounds  however that we may be enabled to prove the validity of this assertion we shall attempt to show the fallacy of the first of these pursuits  the impossibility of demonstrating the nature of the second in general  and the real utility of attending closely to the third and its mode of being applied in order to add to the improvement of the art  and first  no idea perhaps has done more real injury than that of medicines acting specifically in conquering diseases  of this truth a very superficial examination will convince us for it retards our researches in investigating their full and true powers  it prevents us consequently from extending those powers so as to be as diffusively useful as they might  it lays the foundation for a thousand deceptions causing us to attribute particular consequences to materials which do not from thence in reality originate and keeping their true source hid from our observation  nor is this all it does worse  it often by occasioning delay increases the malady remedies thus considered are pretended to subdue nay frequently generating disorders of a more deleterious nature overturning that first and salutary caution which directs us in all our efforts if we fail to do good to do no harm  is artis medicae scopus est ut hominem a tot gravibus malis liberet ideoque medicus nullo modo nocere nedum vitam destruere aut sanitatem laedere debet utpote quum medicina non nocendi sed juvandi sit scientia hoffmannus  indeed the mischief ceases not here it proves detrimental in another view for it places the credulous philosopher and physician on a footing with the impudent and ignorant empiric and too often throws such an odium on the art itself that professors of the first eminence are frequently held in contempt and treated with ridicule by the injudicious and illiterate who fly with confidence to the cabinet and depend upon the presuming arrogance of every plundering impostor  still strange as may be the appearance painful the reflection to an informed mind why should it be matter of surprise do not the physician and medicaster too often assign the same reason for their success the specific power of their applied antidote and build on the same fortuitous exhibition and under such circumstances the modest diffidence of the one can never with the million stand against the bold bustling ignorance of the other  for men of weak discriminating powers of which nine tenths of mankind consist at least if we confine them to medical understanding will give credit to the opinions of creatures of their own level and place as indians with their painted pagods confidence in and pay large tribute to things their folly and superstition have set up  but notwithstanding the credulity in this point of many professors of the art men held in the highest estimation adopting such ideas handing them down to posterity and having them received by succeeding generations  is it not singular that not one specific has ever yet been discovered out of the number which have acquired the appellation  it has been and is now by some thought due to the bark in an intermittent fever  to quicksilver and its preparations in the syphilis but in reality even these merit no such distinction for let us ask do they in all cases as if possessed of specific power they would become infallible or will they by any means prevent the accession of these distempers practice proves the contrary for they will not alone always cure these complaints  and men have been seized with intermittents whilst under a course of bark  and the lues venerea with a mercuriated habit  as well might modesty and judgment be united to the names of m g or any other empirical depredators with which this metropolis is loaded as well might infallibility be added to every nostrummonger as specific powers in curing diseases in all constitutions to any medicine  indeed if we search into the practice of men highly elevated in their profession who retain such a species of absurd faith we shall find such glaring contradictions  circumstances militating so diametrically against and so totally subversive of these opinions that we must be convinced of the fallibility of such a dogma  for it is not uncommon to have accounts published by some of the efficacy of a medicine in certain complaints which cures they tell us specifically to which are tacked a long catalogue of cases in proof whilst at the same time in the hands of others of equal eminence tried under similar circumstances no such surprising effects are manifested need i to what i have already mentioned add the accounts of arsenic hemlock deadly nightshade henbane flores cardamines flores zinci fossile alkali and some others which have been foisted upon the world under such a pretense all having worked miracles under the direction of some whilst others have failed in the administration  to what are we to attribute this diversification can we dispute the abilities of the authors it would be considered presumptuous  can we doubt their veracity it would be thought illiberal  dare we think they are attempting to acquire same from false principles it would be construed invidious  what are we to conjecture certainly that no such specifics exist and that those who were favorers of such an opinion unwilling or unable to pursue their researches were happy in having so easy a support to rest upon or uninclined to lessen their consequence by receding from sentiments once adopted and publicly sanctioned by their fiat condescended to suffer science to be clothed in an unintelligible jargon and lead men credulous as themselves to believe it was impossible to proceed farther pleased as well with the phantom as the reality of knowledge hence was a check given to particular inquiries by implicit confidence being paid to hoaryheaded obstinacy i had almost said cunning creeping under the cloak of false experience hence was the healing art impeded in its progress by such a belief and hence a few characters called great made thousands appear little and live in the shade of indolence and obscurity  examine but the works of galen diascorides oribasius messue boerhaave and almost all the writers of the materia medica of former ages and compare them with what has been written by some of the latest authors who have made real experience the test of their opinions you will find that a multiplicity of errors from time to time have been transmitted from one to another forming a contemptible farrago of specific absurdities  view but the imaginary powers bestowed on bezoar and saffron two out of the numberless instances which might be produced what mighty virtues have not been attributed to the former by men renowned for medical sagacity so multifarious so efficacious that almost all powerful medicines or those imagined such were called bezoardics and what from faithful experiment is it now proved one of our most imperfect absorbents  what has not been said of saffron receiving for its supposed amazing specific powers the pompous names aroma philosophorum  sanguis herculis  rex vegetabilium  panacea vegetabilis  hortus laetitiae  medicina tristitiae  and many more given in small quantities indeed the great boerhaave considers a few drops of the extract of saffron inspissated only to the consistence of oil and taken in a glass of rich wine as highly exhilarant and cordial how different from the experience of this day for except in very large doses saffron is not known to produce any effects and of these accounts are very rare and doubtful  but as an apology for this credulity might it not be called fanaticism it has been asserted that the means by which medicines produced their effects at least those to which were attributed a specific power were impossible to be detected and accounted for and indeed the same notion is too prevalent at this day in many cases to such a height is it carried that an arcanum scrophulosum has been proposed even to the members of this society so flagrant is folly in her attempts yet meets nevertheless with such enormous encouragement and though associated with ignorance and supported by presumption is so successful it is no wonder that crude inexperience should be led to conclude he might palm his nostrum on this institution for great medic characters so called at this time we have seen swell the catalogues and enrich the lists of great impostors  however to prove the fallacy of this opinion let us examine one medicine which has long been held replete with specific power and which claims more the title could such be allowed than any other medicine with which we are acquainted if we except quicksilver we shall by that means detect the errors accruing from such an idea and perceive the benefits arising from the discovery of its true action  benefits which should stimulate us in all cases to similar inquiries i mean the bark  this was long considered to cure intermittents specifically  that is we know not how  by some latent inexplicable power and indeed such was the confidence placed in this miraculous drug so thought incomprehensible as astonishing that in cases of this kind it was indiscriminately exhibited  though very often productive of great mischief  till from long continued and often repeated trials some of the more judicious observers found that this specific power was not always in intermittents an inoffensive much less a certain curative agent not even of the same complaint at different times in the same person hence it became necessary to inquire from whence this deviation arose and in which state of the complaint it might be productive of the greatest success and it appeared to be when the constitution had been harrassed and the vascular system so far oppressed as to be debilitated by the preceding malady or was ab initio in that state  for given at first when the constitution was in full vigor it produced very dangerous effects converting quotidians and tertians into continued fevers aggravating instead of alleviating the febrile symptoms and forming a variety of other distressing consequences  on considering these phenomenon it was manifest that what was thought its specific power depended upon some exertion which occasioned the system to act under some circumstances with too much force by increasing the vascular tone  hence men imbibing this idea labored to abate the activity of the constitution by bleeding purging etc  or suffered it to be weakened by delay before they exhibited this medicine which was then almost always successful unless prevented by some constitutional defect that at the same time required for its alleviation or subduction some attention  it appears therefore obvious that the virtue of this medicine lay not in its correcting or destroying the miasma or virus producing the intermittent but in the exertion of its tonic power hence a peculiar state of the constitution was necessary  and hence the necessity of knowing that state before we can promise success  thus we see the particular power of this universally allowed specific was developed by observation and experience and there remains no doubt of the bark producing generally i might have said always the disagreeable and sometimes dangerous effects above specified if given too early or persisted in  without it brings on some debility at first as it sometimes does by becoming purgative and it may be laid down as an invariable rule in practice that where there is in the habit strong vascular action and an inflammatory diathesis of the blood which are i take it generally conjoined bark universally does harm  where the contrary constitution is prevalent universally good if no topical defect impedes or counteracts its action nor does the bark being successful in some local inflammatory complaints at all invalidate the force of the argument for in those cases the disorder itself is not an active but a passive inflammation  similar arguments might be adduced to the same purpose proving the known action of quicksilver and its saline compounds capable of producing its good effects instead of its imaginary specific powers and of some others but what i have advanced will i hope prove sufficiently satisfactory to show that by this idea of medicines acting specifically no small impediment has been thrown in the way of medical improvement for men satisfied with this lusus this larva rationis practiced from principles falsely founded nay very often without any principles at all  occasioning great loss of time and not only doing mischief by injudicious application but keeping the extensive powers of many active medicines immersed in obscurity hence those formerly administered in one malady only to which their specific power was supposed to be singularly adapted we now find their modes of action being brought to light in a variety of others extremely useful and inestimable  yet it is very extraordinary that men flying from inquiries after properties it may be in their power to discover should rush forward in pursuit of what lies far beyond their reach the nature of the semina morbi the second point appropriated for discussion  that such an attempt should be made in the early periods of an art while the professors were almost totally ignorant of the nature of the human machine with regard to its moving powers and sympathic affections  knew little of the animal economy  of what different parts the body was formed how they were actuated by each other and by what laws they were governed  at a time when philosophy was searching after the principia rerum is not to be wondered at  but considering this inquiry has been set on foot ever since the prevalence of hippocrates idea of the  calidum and salsum  calidum and acidum  calidum and amarum and alia innumerabilia a period of above two thousand years and has ever continued in the same point of uncertainty is it not surprising then that men should for ages perplex themselves in the attempt to make discoveries so much above the power of human understanding  that they should vainly dissipate their time in endeavoring to detect the component parts of materials which are in general too minute to be collected  in all too subtle to come within the limits of mans scrutinizing abilities  knowing these things is it not still more astonishing to hear men talk of the acidity and alkalescency of the materies morbi and otherwise specifying the particular nature of the acrimony productive of eruptive complaints to assert positively that the venereal virus is an alkali and propose to cure disorders from that cause with muriatic acid traversing through all the diversified mazes of the human body and there making neutral salts by the specific combinations  yet ridiculous as is this attempt fantastic this enthusiasm some modern anatomists hold up the certainty of such discoveries and form from thence schemes of practice curable and infallible implanting in young inexperienced minds an ignis fatuus unprofitable as visionary  let philosophers of such a description go in quest of atoms and the diversified modification of matter mount air balloons seek medical knowledge in the clouds  astra petant quomodo formentur  be it ours to inquire how the effects produced by matter in its combined and morbid state are to be remedied and to such heated imaginations be the advice of celsus recommended  rationalem quidem puto medicinam esse debere instrui vero ab evidentibus causis obscuris omnibus non a cogitatione artificis sed ab ipsa art rejectis  advice so pregnant with unerring truth  fraught with such strong conviction that on this point it is needless to dwell any longer  the futility of such inquiries  the impossibility of attaining the quid desideratum are so conspicuously evident to the eye of common sense prima facie that they need no arguments to be adduced in proof for what understand we more of the particular nature of the virus creative of the plague  small pox  pemphigus  cancer  than the first observers of these diseases  virus which might be examined if any could from the copiousness of the matter produced but we like them form our judgment only from the effects  it will be more to our purpose to examine how much greater benefit will be derived to mankind by paying attention to that upon which to be of any service our applications must act for certainly the human machine itself is the grand object of the physicians consideration and the moving powers of that instrument with what i shall for the present call their appendiculae the things which require his attention and which being too much neglected in our descriptions of cases has retarded and still retards the progress of the healing art  by the moving powers i mean the muscular fibers and vascular system possessed of irritability  the nervous system of incitability  and the sanguinary mass of fluids of the vis animans and servans naturam  by the appendiculae the lungs stomach intestines uterus kidneys etc parts which affected have some influence on the moving powers with respect to their action the brain and heart i include in the nervous and vascular system  by the incitability as applied to the nerves i would be understood that power which is capable of being put into action by immateriality such as mental affection  sympathy though it may be put into motion by material stimulus to which irritability itself abstractedly considered is only obedient though that may be also rouzed by the connection of parts wherein it resides with the nervous system and by means of the nerves thus put into action and supported  but in order to form a proper idea of what i mean for your consideration i must beg leave to take a survey of the machine according to my division in the enjoyment of perfect health  now in this case the principles of which it is formed must be in a state exactly or pretty nearly proportioned to each other so that one may assist in promoting and supporting the vigor of the other and producing those effects with ease and constancy for which they were ordained  the moving solids of the human machine must have such firmness pliability and elasticity as to enable them to answer to the impulse of the given irritability  the irritability of such a nature as to be kept in action by the nervous incitability  the nerves to be so formed as perpetually to supply their power when and where wanted with regularity  the blood and fluids in such quantity and of such consistency as to receive the vis animans retain and transfuse it through the whole system in an invariable current  and so bland that they may produce no defect in the secretory or excretory organs so as to impede them in their duty  and the appendiculae so complete in their powers that they may perform their actions to which they are allotted with constancy and freedom  while matters are thus conducted the machine remains in perfect health but if a defect arises in one or more of these particulars diseases succeed in proportion to the magnitude of the defect  and of different natures agreeable to the parts affected and their connections and the changes brought on in them which may be either partial or general or idiopathic or symptomatic and the cause of such defect will arise from the imperfections in some of the sources from whence the active powers deduce their origin immediately or secondarily and as we conclude that the sources of all activity are either the brain medulla spinalis heart or blood  so in some of these we shall find something contrary to a state of nature in its most perfect form or a derangement in some of the appendiculae by which these sources are disordered  but that i may be more perfectly understood i shall trespass only a very little on your patience to supply two or three short though common cases by way of elucidation  suppose a man of strong stamina  great vascular irritability  strong equable nervous incitability abounding with blood copious and tenacious has perspiration obstructed by what is called catching cold we are all acquainted with the general result the matter which ought to pass off by the perspirable pores is retained in the habit the vascular system experiences a plenitude  a quick circulation is produced  irritability increased  and febrile symptoms succeed here the immediate source lies in the heart and vascular system excited by a stimulus from the occasional cause constriction of the cuticular pores and that by the more remote the application of cold  and if there should be in such a constitution any defect in the brain lungs etc or any other internal organ or part a topical affection will be the consequence of the inflammatory kind which will increase and support the fever or should any of the organs be affected in the first instance that affection will occasion the same effect and this arises also from the source above specified  but should the remote cause operate on one of a weak  relaxed habit  possessed of quick nervous incitability but a small portion of vascular irritability and a thin sat of fluids with a paucity of blood the consequences will not be so violent  the febrile affections will be of the slow kind attended with more nervous symptoms the pulse will be quick but languid the heat in a small degree increased but not so permanent accompanied by spasms of various parts depression or sinking of the spirits and seldom any topical inflammation  here then the nervous system will be more affected discovered by the languor of the moving powers load and heaviness of the head coldness of the extremities and such other symptoms as indicate the source of motion the nervous system the part oppressed  but suppose lastly a man of good stamina with a weak vascular irritability though steady nervous incitability and blood of a tolerable density and in moderate quantity under the present circumstances  what will from thence occur  the circulation of the blood will not be so greatly accelerated as in the first instance  the extremities will be cold  the perspiration obstructed though not in so great a degree  uneasy sensations of coldness and heaviness of the head  disturbed and restless nights  oppressions on the praecordia  chillness and flushings of heat not continued or regular  dejection of spirits  and affections somewhat approaching to delirium  thus we find from the same immediate cause different effects will be produced and they may be varied as the different combinations in the constitution happen  and we must to this add as the blood and fluids are in such a particular state to receive the vis animans more or less copiously or to transfuse it more or less freely the effects may be increased or diminished in a proportionate degree  or as it may be more or less acrimonious for acrimony always adds a stimulus particularly to the vascular system though some may exert at the same time as a sedative power on the nerves and therefore the additional stimulus not be so perceptible  besides we know that the intestines lungs liver kidneys bladder uterus etc have such universal connections with the whole machine particularly the two former that they can in many instances transmit their affections sympathetically to the whole or some parts of the body which lie at a distance hence then as they are more or less affected so will be the moving powers in adequate proportions instances of which are observable in some symptomatic inflammatory catarrhal hectic remittent verminose fevers etc  now as is the nature of the moving powers as are the different combinations as is the state of the fluids with respect to their acrimony or blandness texture and capability of receiving and transfusing the vis animans as is the state of the appendiculae and muscular stamina so do constitutions vary and so are different effects produced by similar causes which we see often occur in epidemic and other complaints where though the leading symptoms may be similar in a great degree the concomitants will be different and put on various appearances as we find in the recitals of the same complaints by different authors hence arise many of the species and varieties of different genera of diseases hence a deviation in our modus medendi and hence the good effects of one medicine in some instances at one time which produce no such benefit at another in complaints considered as similar and hence perhaps also arise the good or bad effects of the same medicine given in different doses and likewise the necessity of forming different combinations to make it act with certainty and success in different constitutions  let us therefore take a survey of the effects of medicines in different doses or differently combined and see what conclusions we may from thence deduce  opium in full doses instead of proving antispasmodic anodyne or narcotic has often created other distressing symptoms and so far from taking off spasms alleviating pain or procuring sleep occasioned nausea vertigo and restlessness whilst in smaller doses it has procured every desired purpose  mercury also given in a similar manner with respect to the dose has also occasioned disagreeable consequences instead of affecting the salivary system its chief scene of action producing nausea gripings and bloody stools whilst in smaller doses it has readily been absorbed into the habit and gradually brought on a ptyalism nay often cured without any perceptible effect  under the same circumstances bark has been the cause of sickness purging and constantly rejected by vomiting producing not any of its salutary effects either by prolonging the apyrexy or taking off the febrile affections which have been accomplished by cold or hot infusions of this medicine  on the contrary small doses of these very active materials have been productive of no sensible or curative effect sometimes whilst administered in larger doses their good consequences have been made manifest  and again it is indisputably true that these medicines given in any quantity or form they may the most perfectly agreeable to the constitution and without having any painful concomitant circumstances attendant have by ho means answered the desired purpose but being joined with other remedies have proved successful  what then can be the cause of these deviations is it in the medical ingredient itself impossible  for every medicine considered in itself ceteris paribus must always be alike its action must be invariably the same and in similar constitutions or in the same constitutions under similar circumstances must universally produce the same effects  though i am well aware it may be urged that the same medicine in the same person has appeared to act as if it varied its mode of action this will be readily granted  but then it has been owing to some change brought upon the habits by illness indiscretion or some other cause  for medicines producing in a state of full health one effect will create others in a state of illness with respect to the constitution though the action of the medicine must be the same  for the constitution laboring under an indisposition its powers are altered they act not under a state of healthful nature but require something to relieve and regulate them  now the same medicine which relieves and regulates them during the illness would when the illness was conquered and the powers of the constitution returned to their natural order or standard produce bad effects if continued inasmuch as the same action of a medicine in illness producing the same effect on the habit brings that habit into a state of health by that very action which action the body being in an healthful state is too powerful for it then needing no such aid would have its powers too much increased and by that means distress from that very source would be occasioned  the same argument may be made use of where debilitating means have been applied in order to reduce the too active powers of the habit morbidly affected  from what has been advanced i conclude therefore that the cause of these deviations depend solely on the state of the constitution and by no means on the nature of the medicine  now as i consider the action of medicines and the semina morbi to be exactly under the same point of view regarding their respective operations on the machine and effects produced  i say these depend totally on the nature of the constitution operated upon  for instance  if a man of strong stamina great vascular irritability steady regular nervous incitability firm texture of the blood was to be seized with an intermittent fever of the quotidian or tertian type from marsh miasma  in order to form his cure the vascular irritability must be abated the too strong tone of the solids and muscular fibers in some degree debilitated and the cohesive power of the blood weakened  by bleeding purging cooling saline medicines antimonial diaphoretics  which done the bark might afterward be administered and if a man of a similar constitution takes so large a quantity of heating stimulants as to produce the same febrile appearances without intermission  the treatment would be the same  not from the miasmata or stimulants having produced these effects  but from the same constitutional causes  but was the marsh miasma to affect a man of debilitated habit weak nervous incitability and enfeebled vascular irritability with a loose texture of the sanguinary mass  cordial nervous medicines with the use of blisters might be added to the use of the bark and these would be required from constitutional causes also  that the constitution itself might be rouzed to feel the tonic power of that remedy and experience its good effects  a variety of other instances might be offered in proof of the same positions  and this mode of reasoning will be found applicable to almost all cases particularly all such as are general in the habit or are owing to general affections and the more it is examined into the more the propriety and necessity of paying particular attention to what has been specified will appear but what has been said will i hope be sufficient to supply the proposed hints and lead me to my last proposition   that one present source of retarding the progress of the medic art is the loose and neglectful manner in which cases and their modes of cure or want of success are described  it has i flatter myself been clearly proved as far as the time allotted upon this occasion will permit that the constitution with its different divisions require the first attention of the physician and it will readily occur that in practice it is to be considered not only collectively but abstractedly that it should be found out in what part the constitution is most defective whether respecting its nervous incitability  vascular irritability  muscular strength  texture or composition of the blood  and fluids  and the appendiculae  for as all the parts act in combination with each other as they transmit to each other the principle of their power yet may experience separate affections inherent in themselves which may be generally or partially communicated creative of general or partial disturbance  they should always be particularly attended to inasmuch as the neglect of some may occasion too often our endeavors to become abortive  but we find commonly too little said on the prevalent peculiarities of the constitution upon which different medicines have been tried in similar diseases wherein they have sometimes proved successful sometimes otherwise  now as medicines act differently in different quantities  with different combinations  in different constitutions  in the same constitutions at different periods  in the same disease at the different times of the malady with regard to the good or bad effects they produce  and as this apparent difference of action depends upon the different states of the moving powers and what i call their appendiculae the constitutional peculiarities should always be nicely discriminated  this mode would often enable us to discover on what account various remedies had been successful wherein they had failed and direct us to the best method of selecting and combining medicines and of curing diseases such as fall immediately under the physicians care and assist in most to which the surgeon lays claim as little very little is to be done with the semina morbi and the specific power of our remedies is merely ideal for as is the state of the moving powers and fluids with their combinations so will be the action of our medicines and consequently so will be the indications in our applications  permit me before i conclude to offer a case by way of exemplification which will afford i presume no weak proof of what has been advanced  mr  a person of middle age had been some time afflicted with a disease similar to what is termed gonorrhaea libidinosa  his muscular stamina were tolerably good he had a great deal of nervous incitability weak vascular irritability the texture of the blood not firm nor could be called broken his digestion though his appetite was tolerable defective he had now and then chilliness succeeded by flushing heats which came on irregularly his pulse in general was slow and undulating and when quickened as it would now and then be on some extraordinary occasions weak his viscera all appeared found though delicacy prevents the insertion of the name still any medical gentleman desirous of further information may acquire it by application to the author who for the sake of accuracy read this account three times to the patient and he at that time perfectly coincided with the exactitude of the description his bowels very irregular sometimes extremely costive at others as much the reverse  always in one extreme or the other his urine pale and limpid for the most part but now and then depositing a whitish furfuraceous mucilaginous sediment  he was petulant and irascible when trifles perplexed him when not timid and despairing  his fluids were acrimonious his memory weak and his recollection painful creative of much uneasiness when he could not bring to his mind that of which he was in quest  his whole frame was in general so languid that slight motion greatly fatigued him his extremities were in general cold  in easterly or southwest winds he always complained of being worse and was perceptibly so  his nights were constantly restless  he had sometimes two or three emissions in the night complained of partial heat at the lower part of the back which he said now and then transfused itself all over him and made him extremely faint  he was never thirsty  in this state he had continued for ten months though now visibly growing worse and had been under the care of two physicians of eminence they had put him under a course of restringent medicines  bark white vitriol ginseng etc and ordered him the cold bath but all proved ineffectual  at this period his constitution was considered in general after the mode above recommended taking in also the topical affection  a weakness of the seminal vessels and determination of the fluids to those parts creating heat and causing emissions  the indications of cure were  to determine the fluids externally by increasing perspiration  to strengthen the digestive organs  increase the irritability of the vascular system  abate the nervous incitability  and give tone and firmness to the habit in general which were accomplished by cordial saline diaphoretics warm tonics camphorated and ethereal antispasmodics and stomachic bitters  keeping the body moderately and gently open by mild aperients  under this method his extremities first lost their coldness in a great degree and when warm he always found himself relieved at which time there was a great itching in his skin which was distended appearing like an universal essera the matter by a general stimulus under the skin elevating the whole surface regularly not showing any eruptions except here and there one now and then on his breast or on the lower part of the head just above the neck at the roots of the hair he began now to recover every day and when his system showed it was in some degree invigorated bathing in the thames and riding exercise established his cure  the reason why the former gentlemen had been so long unsuccessful appears very obvious they had not paid any attention to the torpid state of the vascular system on which account the fluids were always crowding upon the internal parts having their acrimony increased and the astringent medicines not being capable of exerting their action from a defect of vascular irritability the vessels being in such a state of torpor as not to feel the effects  hence the seminal vessels being before in a weakened state suffered a partial irritation by the fluids there collected occasioning stimulus and increased heat  emissions succeeded emissions  the machine became more and more debilitated  the nervous incitability increased the consequence of which would soon have been a hectic fever with a tabes  would time permit a variety of cases might be adduced in which similar success from similar reasons have confirmed the validity of a practice so founded  and i am fully persuaded that in all our recitals of cases whether successfully or unsuccessfully treated were we to advert to what perhaps by some may be considered as minutiae too trifling in the present scale of physic we should find as well from one as the other much useful matter proceeding  and i have no doubt but we should discover in very many if not in all the reasons why accounts so similar in their descriptions so dissimilar in their consequences have and do present themselves daily to our view  but i flatter myself what has been already advanced will be sufficient to afford hints that may induce some more capable to attempt the investigation and give still clearer views than lies within the compass of my very limited knowledge i shall therefore conclude in the words of a favorite author as they are expressive of my wishes  non dicam quod ad commodiorem and certiorem medendi methodum
