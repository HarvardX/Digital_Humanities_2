memoirs of fanny hill  by john cleland   a new and genuine edition from the original text london       parisâ€isidore liseux   of this edition privately printed there are   0 numbered copies of which this is number         contents    letter the first  letter the second   letter the first  madam  i sit down to give you an undeniable proof of my considering your desires as indispensable orders ungracious then as the task may be i shall recall to view those scandalous stages of my life out of which i emerged at length to the enjoyment of every blessing in the power of love health and fortune to bestow whilst yet in the flower of youth and not too late to employ the leisure afforded me by great ease and affluence to cultivate an understanding naturally not a despicable one and which had even amidst the whirl of loose pleasures i had been tossed in exerted more observation on the characters and manners of the world than what is common to those of my unhappy profession who looking on all though or reflection as their capital enemy keep it at as great a distance as they can or destroy it without mercy  hating as i mortally do all long unnecessary prefaces i shall give you good quarter in this and use no farther apology than to prepare you for seeing the loose part of my life written with the same liberty that i led it  truth stark naked truth is the word and i will not so much as take the pains to bestow the strip of a gauze wrapper on it but paint situations such as they actually rose to me in nature careless of violating those laws of decency that were never made for such unreserved intimacies as ours and you have too much sense too much knowledge of the originals to sniff prudishly and out of character at the pictures of them the greatest men those of the first and most leading taste will not scruple adorning their private closets with nudities though in compliance with vulgar prejudices they may not think them decent decorations of the staircase or salon  this and enough premised i go souse into my personal history my maiden name was frances hill i was born at a small village near liverpool in lancashire of parents extremely poor and i piously believe extremely honest  my father who had received a maim on his limbs that disabled him from following the more laborious branches of country drudgery got by making nets a scanty subsistence which was not much enlarged by my mothers keeping a little dayschool for the girls in her neighborhood they had had several children but none lived to any age except myself who had received from nature a constitution perfectly healthy  my education till past fourteen was no better than very vulgar reading or rather spelling an illegible scrawl and a little ordinary plain work composed the whole system of it and then all my foundation in virtue was no other than a total ignorance of vice and the shy timidity general to our sex in the tender age of life when objects alarm or frighten more by their novelty than anything else but then this is a fear too often cured at the expense of innocence when miss by degrees begins no longer to look on a man as a creature of prey that will eat her  my poor mother had divided her time so entirely between her scholars and her little domestic cares that she had spared very little to my instruction having from her own innocence from all ill no hint or thought of guarding me against any  i was now entering on my fifteenth year when the worst of ills befell me in the loss of my fond tender parents who were both carried off by the smallpox within a few days of each other my father dying first and thereby by hastening the death of my mother so that i was now left an unhappy friendless orphan for my fathers coming to settle there was accidental he being originally a kentisrman that cruel distemper which had proved so fatal to them had indeed seized me but with such mild and favourable symptoms that i was presently out of danger and what then i did not know the value of was entirely unmarked i skip over here an account of the natural grief and affliction which i felt on this melancholy occasion a little time and the giddiness of that age dissipated too soon my reflections on that irreparable loss but nothing contributed more to reconcile me to it than the notions that were immediately put into my head of going to london and looking out for a service in which i was promised all assistance and advice from one esther davis a young woman that had beer down to see her friends and who after the stay of a few days was returned to her place  as i had now nobody left alive in the village who had concern enough about what should become of me to start any objections to this scheme and the woman who took care of me after my parents death rather encouraged me to pursue it i soon came to a resolution of making this launch into the wide world by repairing to london in order to seek my fortune a phrase which by the bye has ruined more adventurers of both sexes from the country than ever it made or advanced  nor did esther davis a little comfort and inspirit me to venture with her by piquing my childish curiosity with the fine sights that were to be seen in london the tombs the lions the king the royal family the fine plays and operas and in short all the diversions which fell within her sphere of life to come at the detail of all which perfectly turned the little head of me  nor can i remember without laughing the innocent admiration not without a spice of envy with which we poor girls whose churchgoing clothes did not rise above dowlas shifts and stuff gowns beplaced with silver all which we imagined grew in london and entered for a great deal into my determination of trying to come in for my share of them  the idea however of having the company of a townswoman with her was the trivial and all the motives that engaged esther to take charge of me during my journey to town where she told me after the manner and style â€œas how several maids out of the country had made themselves and all their kind for ever that by preserving their virtue some had taken so with their masters that they had married them and kept them coaches and lived vastly grand and happy and some mayhap came to be duchesses luck was all and why not i as well as anotherâ€ with other almanacs to this purpose which set me a tiptoe to begin this promising journey and to leave a place which though my native one contained no relations that i had reason to regret and was grown insupportable to me from the change of the tenderest usage into a cold air of charity with which i was entertained even at the only friends house that i had the least expectation of care and protection from she was however so just to me as to manage the turning into money the little matters that remained to me after the debts and burial charges were allowed for and at my departure put my whole fortune into my hands which consisted of a very slender wardrobe packed up in a very portable box and eight guineas with seventeen shillings in silver stowed in a springpouch which was a greater treasure than i ever had seen together and which i could not conceive there was a possibility of running out and indeed i was so entirely taken up with the joy of seeing myself mistress of such an immence sum that i gave very little attention to a world of good advice which was given me with it  places then being taken for esther and me in the chester waggon i pass over a very immaterial scene of leavetaking at which i droped a few tears betwixt grief and joy and for the same reasons of insignificance skip over all that happened to me on the road such as the waggoners looking liquorish on me the schemes laid for me by some of the passengers which were defeated by the valiance of my guardian esther who to do her justice took a motherly care of me at the same time that she taxed me for the protection by making me bear all travelling charges which i defrayed with the unmost cheerfulness and thought myself much obliged to her into the bargain  she took indeed great care that we were not overrated or imposed on as well as of managing as frugally as possible expensiveness was not her vice  it was pretty late in a summer evening when we reached the town in our slow conveyance though drawn by six at length as we passed through the greatest streets that led to our inn the noise of the coaches the hurry the crowds of foot passengers in short the new scenery of the shops and houses at once pleased and amazed me  but guess at my mortification and surprise when we came to the inn and our things were landed and delivered to us when my fellow traveller and protectress esther davis who had used me with the utmost tenderness during the journey and prepared me by no preceedings signs for the stunning blow i was to receive when i say my only dependence and friend in this strange place all of a sudden assumed a strange and cool air towards me as if she dreaded my becoming a burden to her  instead then of proffering me the continuance of her assistance and good offices which i relied upon and never more wanted she thought herself it seems abundantly acquitted of her engagements to me by having brought me safe to my journeys end and seeing nothing in her procedure towards me but what natural and in order began to embrace me by the way of taking leave whilst i was so confounded so struck that i had not spirit or sense enough so much as to mention my hopes or expectations from her experience and knowledge of the place she had brought me to  whilst i stood thus stupid and mute which she doubtless attributed to nothing more than a concern at parting this idea procured me perhaps a slight alleviation of it in the following harangue â€œthat now we were got safe to london and that she was obliged to go to her place she advised me by all means to get into one as soon as possible that i need not fear getting one there were more places than parishchurches that she advised me to go to an intelligence office that if she heard of any thing stirring she would find me out and let me know that in the meantime i should take a private lodging and acquaint her where to send to me that she wished me good luck and hoped i should always have the grace to keep myself honest and not bringing a disgrace on my parentageâ€ with this she took her leave of me and left me as it were on my own hands full as lightly as i had been put into hers  left thus alone absolutely destitute and friendless i began then to feel most bitterly the severity of this separation the scene of which had passed in a little room in the inn and no sooner was her back turned but the affliction i felt at my helpless strange circumstances burst out into a flood of tears which infinitely relieved the oppression of my heart though i still remained stupified and most perfectly perplexed how to dispose of myself  one of the drawers coming in added yet more to my uncertainty by asking me in a short way if i called for anything to which i replied innocently â€œnoâ€ but i wished him to tell me where i might get a lodging for that night he said he would go and speak to his mistress who accordingly came and told me drily without entering in the least into the distress she saw me in that i might have a bed for a shilling and that as she supposed i had some friends in town there i fetched a deep sigh in vain i might provide for myself in the morning  it is incredible what trifling consolations the human mind will seize in its greatest afflictions the assurance of nothing more than a bed to lie on that night calmed my agonies and being ashamed to acquaint the mistress of the inn that i had no friends to apply to in town i proposed to myself to proceed the very next morning to an intelligence office to which i was furnished with written directions on the back of a ballad esther had given me there i counted on getting information of any place that such a country girl as i might be fit for and where i could get into any sort of being before my little stock should be consumed and as to a character esther had often repeated to me that i might depend on her managing me one nor however affected i was at her leaving me thus did i entirely cease to rely on her as i began to think goodnaturedly that her procedure was all in course and that is was only my ignorance of life that had made me take it in the light i at first did  accordingly the next morning i dressed myself as clean and as neat as my rustic wardrobe would permit me and having left my box with special recommendation with the landlady i ventured out by myself and without any more difficulty than can be supposed of a young country girl barely fifteen and to whom every sign or shop was a gazing trap i got to the wished for intelligence office  it was kept by an elderly woman who sat at the receipt of custom with a book before her in great form and order and several scrolls made out of directions for places  i made up then to this important personage without lifting up my eyes or observing any of the people round me who were attending there on the same errand as myself and dropping her curtsies nine deep just made a shift to stammer out my business to her  madam heard me out with all the gravity and brow of a petty minister of state and seeing at one glance over my figure what i was made me no answer but to ask me the preliminary shilling on receipt of which she told me places for women too slight built for hard work but that she would look over her book and see what was to be done for me desiring me to stay a little till she had dispatched some other customers  on this i drew back a little most heartily mortified at a declaration which carried with it a killing uncertainly that my circumstances could not well endure  presently assuming more courage and seeking some diversion from my uneasy thoughts i ventured to lift up my head a little and sent my eyes on a course round the room where they met full tilt with those of a lady for such my extreme innocence pronounced her sitting in a corner of the room dressed in a velvet mantle in the midst of summer with her bonnet off squat fat redfaced and at least fifty  she looked as if she would devour me with her eyes staring at me from head to foot without the least regard to the confusion and blushes her eyeing me so fixedly put me to and which were to her no doubt the strongest recommendation and marks of my being fit for her purpose after a little time in which my air person and whole figure had undergone a strict examination which i had on my part tried to render favourable to me by primming drawing up my neck and setting my best looks she advanced and spoke to me with the greatest demureness  â€œsweetheart do you want a place  â€œyes and please youâ€ with a curtsey down to the ground  upon this she acquainted me she was actually come to the office herself to look out for a servant that she believed i might do with a little of her instruction that she could take my very looks for a sufficient character that london was a very wicked vile place that she hoped i would be tractable and keep out of bad company in short she said all to me that an old experienced practitioner in town could think of and which was much more than was necessary to take in an artless inexperienced country maid who was even afraid of becoming a wanderer about the streets and therefore gladly jumped at the first offer of a shelter especially from so grave and matronlike a lady for such my flattering fancy assured me this new mistress of mine was i being actually hired under the nose of the good woman that kept the office whose shrewed smiles and shrugs i could not help observing and innocently interpreted them as marks of being pleased at my getting into place so soon but as i afterwards came to know these beldams understood one another very well and this was a market where mrs brown my mistress frequently attended on the watch for any fresh goods that might offer there for the use of her customers and her own profit  madam was however so well pleased with her bargain that fearing i presume lest better advice or some accident might occasion my slipping through her fingers she would officiously take me in a coach to my inn where calling herself for my box it was i being present delivered without the least scruple or explanation as to where i was going  this being over she bid the coachman drive to a shop in st pauls churchyard where she bought a pair of gloves which she gave me and thence renewed her directions to the coachman to drive to her house in â€â€â€ street who accordingly landed us at the door after i had been cheered up and entertained by the way with the most plausible flams without one syllable from which i could conclude anything but that i was by the greatest luck fallen into the hands of kindest mistress not to say friend that the vast world could afford and accordingly i entered her doors with most complete confidence and exultation promising myself that as soon as i could be a little settled i would acquaint esther davis with my rare good fortune  you may be sure the good opinion of my place was not lessened by the appearance of a very handsome back parlor into which i was led and which seemed to me magnificently furnished who had never seen better rooms than the ordinary ones in inns upon the road there were two gilt pierglasses and a buffet on which a few pieces of plate set out to the most shew dazzled and altogether persuaded me that i must be got into a very reputable family  here my mistress first began her part with telling me that i must have good spirits and learn to be free with her that she had not taken me to be a common servant to do domestic drudgery but to be a kind of companion to her and that if i would be a good girl she would do more than twenty mothers for me to all which i answered only by the profoundest and the awkwardest curtsies and a few monosyllables such as â€œyes no to be sureâ€  presently my mistress touched the bell and in came a strapping maidservant who had let us in â€œhere marthaâ€ said mrs brown â€œi have just hired this young woman to look after my linen so step up and show her her chamber and i charge you to use her with as much respect as you would myself for i have taken a prodigious liking to her and i do not know what i shall do for herâ€  martha who was an archjade and being used to this decoy had her cue perfect made me a kind of half curtsy and asked me to walk up with her and accordingly showed me a neat room two pair of stairs backwards in which there was a handsome bed where martha told me i was to lie with a young gentlewoman a cousin of my mistress who she was sure would be vastly good to me then she ran out into such affected encomiums on her good mistress her sweet mistress and how happy i was to light upon her and that i could not have bespoke a better with other the like gross stuff such as would itself have started suspicions in any but such an unpractised simpleton who was perfectly new to life and who took every word she said in the very sense she laid out for me to take it but she readily saw what a penetration she had to deal with and measured me very rightly in her manner of whistling to me so as to make me pleased with my cage and blind to the wires  in the midst of these false explanations of the nature of my future service we were rung for down again and i was reintroduced into the same parlour where there was a table laid with three covers and my mistress had now got with her one of her favourite girls a notable manager of her house and whose business it was to prepare and break such young fillies as i was to the mounting block and she was accordingly in that view alloted me for a bedfellow and to give her the more authority she had the title of cousin conferred on her by the venerable president of this college  here i underwent a second survey which ended in the full approbation of mrs phåbe ayres the name of my tutoress elect to whose care and instruction i was affectionately recommended  dinner was now set on table and in pursuance of treating me as a companion mrs brown with a tone to cut off all dispute soon overruled my most humble and most confused protestations against sitting down with her ladyship which my very short breeding just suggested to me could not be right or in the order of things  at table the conversation was chiefly kept up by the two madams and carried on in double meaning expressions interrupted every now and then by kind assurances to me all tending to confirm and fix my satisfaction with my present condition augment it they could not so very a novice was i then  it was here agreed that i should keep myself up and out of sight for a few days till such clothes could be procured for me as were fit for the character i was to appear in of my mistresss companion observing withal that on the first impressions of my figure much might depend and as they rightly judged the prospect of exchanging my country clothes for london finery made the clause of confinement digest perfectly well with me but the truth was mrs brown did not care that i should be seen or talked to by any either of her customers or her does as they called the girls provided for them till she secured a good market for my maidenhead which i had at least all the appearances of having brought into her ladyships service  to slip over minutes of no importance to the main of my story i pass the interval to bed time in which i was more and more pleased with the views that opened to me of an easy service under these good people and after supper being shewed up to bed miss phåbe who observed a kind of reluctance in me to strip and go to bed in my shift before her now the maid was withdrawn came up to me and beginning with unpinning my handkerchief and gown soon encouraged me to go on with undressing myself and blushing at now seeing myself naked to my shift i hurried to get under the bedclothes out of sight  phåbe laughed and was not long before she placed herself by my side she was about five and twenty by her most suspicious account in which according to all appearances she must have sunk at least ten good years allowance too being made for the havoc which a long course of hackneyship and hot waters must have made of her constitution and which had already brought on upon the spur that stale stage in which those of her profession are reduced to think of showing company instead of seeing it  no sooner then was this precious substitute of my mistress laid down but she who was never out of her way when any occasion of lewdness presented itself turned to me embraced and kissed me with great eagerness this was new this was odd but imputing it to nothing but pure kindness which for ought i knew it might be the london way to express in that manner i was determined not to be behindhand with her and returned her the kiss and embrace with all the fervour that perfect innocence knew  encouraged by this her hands became extremely free and wandered over my whole body with touches squeezes pressures that rather warmed and surprised me with their novelty than they either shocked or alarmed me  the flattering praises she intermingled with these invasions contributed also not a little to bribe my passiveness and knowing no ill i feared none especially from one who had prevented all doubts of her womanhood by conducting my hands to a pair of breasts that hung loosely down in a size and volume that full sufficiently distinguished her sex to me at least who had never made any other comparison  i lay then all tame and passive as she could wish whilst her freedom raised no other emotion but those of a strange and till then unfelt pleasure every part of me was open and exposed to the licentious courses of her hands which like a lambent fire ran over my whole body and thawed all coldness as they went  my breasts if it is not too bold a figure to call so two hard firm rising hillocks that just began to shew themselves or signify anything to the touch employed and amused her hands awhile till slipping down lower over a smooth track she could just feel the soft silky down that had but a few months before put forth and garnished the mountpleasant of those parts and promised to spread a grateful shelter over the sweet seat of the most exquisite sensation and which had been till that instant the seat of the most insensible innocence her fingers played and strove to twine in the young tendrils of that moss which nature has contrived at once for use and ornament  but not contented with these outer posts she now attempts the main spot and began to twitch to insinuate and at length to force an introduction of a finger into the quick itself in such a manner that had she not proceeded by insensible gradations that inflamed me beyond the power of modesty to oppose its resistance to their progress i should have jumped out of bed and cried for help against such strange assaults  instead of which her lascivious touches had lighted up a new fire that wantoned through all my veins but fixed with violence in that center appointed them by nature where the first strange hands were now busied in feeling squeezing compressing the lips then opening them again with a finger between till an â€œohâ€ expressed her hurting me where the narrowness of the unbroken passage refused it entrance to any depth  in the meantime the extension of my limbs languid stretching sighs short heavings all conspired to assure that experienced wanton that i was more pleased than offended at her proceedings which she seasoned with repeated kisses and exclamations such as â€œoh what a charming creature thou art what a happy man will he be that first makes a woman of you oh that i were a man for your sakeâ€ with the like broken expressions interrupted by kisses as fierce and salacious as ever i received from the other sex  for my part i was transported confused and out of myself feelings so new were too much for me my heated and alarmed senses were in a tumult that robbed me of all liberty of thought tears of pleasure gushed from my eyes and somewhat assuaged the fire that raged all over me  phåbe herself the hackneyed thoroughbred phåbe to whom all modes and devices of pleasure were known and familiar found it seems in this exercise her those arbitrary tastes for which there is no accounting not that she hated men or did not even prefer them to her own sex but when she met with such occasions as this was a satiety of enjoyments in the common road perhaps too a great secret bias inclined her to make the most of pleasure wherever she could find it without distinction of sexes in this view now well assured that she had by her touches sufficiently inflamed me for her purpose she rolled down the bed clothes gently and i saw myself stretched naked my shift being turned up to my neck whilst i had no power or sense to oppose it even my growing blushes expressed more desire than modesty whilst the candle left to be sure not undesignedly burning threw a full light on my whole body  â€œnoâ€ says phåbe â€œyou must not my sweet girl think to hide all these treasures from me my sight must be feasted as my touch i must devour with my eyes this springing bosom suffer me to kiss it i have not seen it enough let me kiss it once more what firm smooth white flesh is here how delicately shaped then this delicious down oh let me view the small dear tender cleft this is too much i cannot bear it i must i mustâ€ here she took my hand and in a transport carried it where you will easily guess but what a difference in the state of the same thing a spreading thicket of bushy curls marked the full grown complete woman then the cavity to which she guided my hand easily received it and as soon as she felt it within her she moved herself to and fro with so rapid a friction that i presently withdrew it wet and clammy when instantly phåbe grew more composed after two or three sighs and heartfetched ohs and giving me a kiss that seemed to exhale her soul through her lips she replaced the bedclothes over us what pleasure she had found i will not say but this i know that the first sparks of kindling nature the first ideas of pollution were caught by me that night and that the acquaintance and communication with the bad of our sex is often as fatal to innocence as all the seductions of the other but to go on when phåbe was restored to that calm which i was far from the enjoyment of myself she artfully sounded me on all the points necessary to govern the designs of my virtuous mistress on me and by my answers drawn from pure undissembled nature she had no reason but to promise herself all imaginable success so far as it depended on my ignorance easiness and warmth of constitution  after a sufficient length of dialogue my bedfellow left me to my rest and i fell asleep through pure weariness from the violent emotions i had been led into when nature which had been too warmly stirred and fermented to subside without allaying by some means or other relieved me by one of those luscious dreams the transports of which are scarce inferior to those of waking real action  in the morning i awoke about ten perfectly gay and refreshed phåbe was up before me and asked me in the kindest manner how i did how i had rested and if i was ready for breakfast carefully at the same time avoiding to increase the confusion she saw i was in at looking her in the face by any hint of the nights bed scene i told her if she pleased i would get up and begin any work she would be pleased to set me about she smiled presently the maid brought in the tea equipage and i just huddled my clothes on when in waddled my mistress i expected no less than to be told of if not chid for my late rising when i was most agreeably disappointed by her compliments on my pure and fresh looks i was â€œa bud of beautyâ€ this was her style â€œand how vastly all the fine men would admire meâ€ to all which my answers did not i can assure you wrong my breeding they were as simple and silly as they could wish and no doubt flattered them infinitely more than had they proved me enlightened by education and a knowledge of the world  we breakfasted and the tea things were scarce removed when in were brought two bundles of linen and wearing apparel in short all the necessaries for rigging me out as they termed it completely  imagine to yourself madam how my little coquet heart fluttered with joy at the sight of a white lutestring flowered with silver scoured indeed but passed on me for spick and span new a brussels lace cap braited shoes and the rest in proportion all secondhand finery and procured instantly for the occasion by the diligence and industry of the good mrs brown who had already a chapman for me in the house before whom my charms were to pass in review for he had not only in course insisted on a previous sight of the premises but also on immediate surrendering to him in case of his agreeing for me concluding very wisely that such a place as i was in was of the hottest to trust the keeping of such a perishable commodity in as a maidenhead  the care of dressing and tricking me out for the market was then left to phåbe who acquitted herself if not well at least perfectly to the satisfaction of everything but my impatience of seeing myself dressed when it was over and i viewed myself in the glass i was no doubt too natural too artless to hide my childish joy at the change a change in the real truth for much the worse since i must have much better become the neat easy simplicity of my rustic dress than the awkward untoward tawdry finery that i could not conceal my strangeness to  phåbes compliments however in which her own share in dressing me was not forgot did not a little confirm me in the first notions i had ever entertained concerning my person which be it said without vanity was then tolerable to justify a taste for me and of which it may not be out of place here to sketch you an unflattered picture  i was tall yet not too tall for my age which as i before remarked was barely turned of fifteen my shape perfectly straight thin waisted and light and free without owing anything to stays my hair was a glossy auburn and as soft as silk flowing down my neck in natural curls and did not a little to set off the whiteness of a smooth skin my face was rather too ruddy though its features were delicate and the shape was a roundish oval except where a pit on my chin had far from a disagreeable effect my eyes were as black as can be imagined and rather languishing than sparkling except on certain occasions when i have been told they struck fire fast enough my teeth which i ever carefully preserved were small even and white my bosom was finely raised and one might then discern rather the promise than the actual growth of the round firm breast that in a little time made that promise good in short all the points of beauty that are most universally in request i had or at least my vanity forbid me to appeal from the decision of our sovereign judges the men who all that i ever knew at last gave it thus highly in my favour and i met with even in my own sex some that were above denying me that justice whilst others praised me yet more unsuspectedly by endeavouring to detract from me in points of person and figure that i obviously excelled in this is i own too strong of self praise but i should be ungrateful to nature and to a form to which i owe such singular blessings of pleasure and fortune were i to suppress through an affectation of modesty the mention of such valuable gifts  well then dressed i was and little did it then enter into my head that all this gay attire was no more than decking the victim out for sacrifice whilst i innocently attributed all to mere friendship and kindness in the sweet good mrs brown who i was forgetting to mention had under pretence of keeping my money safe got from me without the least hesitation the driblet so i now call it which remained to me after the expenses of my journey  after some little time most agreebly spent before the glass in scarce selfadmiration since my new dress had by much the greatest share in it i was sent for down to the parlour where the old lady saluted me and wished me joy of my new clothes which she was not ashamed to say fitted me as if i had worn nothing but the finest all my lifetime but what was it she could not see me silly enough to swallow at the same time she presented me to another cousin of her own creation an elderly gentleman who got up at my entry into the room and on my dropping a curtsy to him saluted me and seemed a little affronted that i had only presented my cheek to him a mistake which if one he immediately corrected by gluing his lips to mine with an ardour which his figure had not at all disposed me to thank him for his figure i say than which nothing could be more shocking or detestable for ugly and disagreeable were terms too gentle to convey a just idea of it  imagine to yourself a man rather past threescore short and illmade with a yellow cadaverous hue great goggle eyes that stared as if he was strangled an outmouth from two more properly tusks than teeth livid lips and breath like a jakes then he had a peculiar ghastliness in his grin that made him perfectly frightful if not dangerous to women with child yet made as he was thus in mock of man he was so blind to his own staring deformities as to think himself born to please and that no woman could see him with impunity in consequence of which idea he had lavished great sums on such wretches as could gain upon themselves to pretend love to his person whilst to those who had not art or patience to dissemble the horror it inspired he behaved even brutally impotence more than necessity made him seek in variety the provocative that was wanting to raise him to the pitch of enjoyment which he too often saw himself baulked of by the failure of his powers and this always threw him into a fit of rage which he wreaked as far as he durst on the innocent objects of his fit of momentary desire  this then was the master to which my conscientious benefactress who had long been his purveyor in this way had doomed me and sent for me down purposely for his examination accordingly she made me stand up before him turned me round unpinned my handkerchief remarked to him the rise and fall the turn and whiteness of a bosom just beginning to fill then made me walk and took even a handle from the rusticity of my charms in short she omitted no point of jockeyship to which he only answered by gracious nods of approbation whilst he looked goats and monkeys at me for i sometimes stole a corner glance at him and encountering his fiery eager stare looked another way from pure horror and affright which he characteristically attributed to nothing more than maiden modesty or at least the affectation of it  however i was soon dismissed and reconducted to my room by phåbe who stuck close to me not leaving me alone and at leisure to make such reflections as might naturally rise to any one not an idiot on such a scene as i had just gone through but to my shame be it confessed that just was my invincible stupidity or rather portentous innocence that i did not yet open my eyes to mrs browns designs and saw nothing in this titular cousin of hers but a shockingly hideous person which did not at all concern me unless that my gratitude for my benefactress made me extend my respect to all her cousinhood  phåbe however began to sift the state and pulses of my heart toward this monster asking me how i should approve of such a fine gentelman for a husband fine gentleman i suppose she called him from his being daubed with lace i answered her very naturally that i had no thoughts of a husband but that if i was to choose one it should be among my own degree sure so much had my aversion to that wretchs hideous figure indisposed me to all â€œfine gentlemenâ€ and confounded my ideas as if those of that rank had been necessarily cast in the same mould that he was but phåbe was not to be put off so but went on with her endeavours to melt and soften me for the purposes of my reception into that hospitable house and whilst she talked of the sex in general she had no reason to despair of a compliance which more than one reason showed her would be easily enough obtained of me but then she had too much experience not to discover that my particular fixed aversion to that frightful cousin would be a block not so readily to be removed as suited the consummation of their bargain and sale of me  mother brown had in the meantime agreed the terms with this loquorice old goat which i afterwards understood were to be fifty guineas peremptory for the liberty of attempting me and a hundred more at the complete gratification of his desires in the triumph over my virginity and as for me i was to be left entirely at the discretion of his liking and generosity this unrighteous contract being thus settled he was so eager to be put in possession that he insisted on being introduced to drink tea with me that afternoon when we were to be left alone nor would he hearken to the procuresss remonstrances that i was not sufficiently prepared and ripened for such an attack that i was too green and untamed having been scarce twentyfour hours in the house it is the character of lust to be impatient and his vanity arming him against any supposition of other than the common resistance of a maid on those occasions made him reject all proposals of a delay and my dreadful trial was thus fixed unknown to me for that very evening  at dinner mrs brown and phåbe did nothing but run riot in praise of this wonderful cousin and how happy that woman would be that he would favour with his addresses in short my two gossips exhausted all their rhetoric to persuade me to accept them â€œthat the gentleman was violently smitten with me at first sight that he would make my fortune if i would be a good girl and not stand in my own light that i should trust his honour that i should be made for ever and have a chariot to go abroad inâ€ with all such stuff as was fit to turn the head of such a silly ignorant girl as i then was but luckily here my aversion had taken already such deep root in me my heart was so strongly defended from him by my senses that wanting the art to mask my sentiments i gave them no hopes of their employer succeeding at least very easily with me the glass too marched pretty quick with a view i suppose to make a friend of the warmth of my constitution in the minutes of the imminent attack  thus they kept me pretty long at table and about six in the evening after i had retired to my apartment and the tea board was set enters my venerable mistress followed close by that satyr who came in grinning in a way peculiar to him and by his odious presence confirmed me in all the sentiments of detestation which his first appearance had given birth to  he sat down fronting me and all tea time kept ogling me in a manner that gave me the utmost pain and confusion all the mark of which he still explained to be my bashfulness and not being used to see company  tea over the commoding old lady pleady urgent business which indeed was true to go out and earnestly desired me to entertain her cousin kindly till she came back both for my own sake and her and then with a â€œpray sir be very good be very tender to the sweet childâ€ she went out of the room leaving me staring with my mouth open and unprepared by the suddenness of her departure to oppose it  we were now alone and on that idea a sudden fit of trembling seized me i was so afraid without a precise notion of why and what i had to fear that i sat on the settee by the fire side motionless and petrified without life or spirit not knowing how to look or how to stir  but long i was not suffered to remain in this state of stupefaction the monster squatted down by me on the settee and without farther ceremony or preamble flings his arms about my neck and drawing me pretty forcibly towards him obliged me to receive in spite of my struggles to disengage from him his pestilential kisses which quite overcame me finding me then next to senseless and unresisting he tears off my neck handkerchief and laid all open there to his eyes and hands still i endured all without flinching till emboldened by my sufferance and silence for i had not the power to speak or cry out he attempted to lay me down on the settee and i felt his hand on the lower part of my naked thighs which were crossed and which he endeavoured to unlock oh then i was roused out of my passive endurance and springing from him with an activity he was not prepared for threw myself at his feet and begged him in the most moving tone not to be rude and that he would not hurt me â€œhurt you my dearâ€ says the brute â€œi intend you no harm has not the old lady told you that i love you that i shall do handsomely by youâ€  â€œshe has indeed sirâ€ said i â€œbut i cannot love you indeed i cannot pray let me alone yes i will love you dearly if you will let me alone and go awayâ€ but i was talking to the wind for whether my tears my attitude or the disorder of my dress proved fresh incentives or whether he was now under the dominion of desires he could not bridle but snorting and foaming with lust and rage he renews his attack seizes me and again attempts to extend and fix me on the settee in which he succeeded so far as to lay me along and even to toss my petticoats over my head and lay my thighs bare which i obstinately kept close nor could he though he attempted with his knee to force them open effect it so as to stand fair for being master of the main avenue he was unbuttoned both waistcoat and breeches yet i only felt the weight of his body upon me whilst i lay struggling with indignation and dying with terrors but he stopped all of a sudden and got off panting blowing cursing and repeating â€œold and uglyâ€ for so i had very naturally called him in the heat of my defence  the brute had it seems as i afterwards understood brought on by his eagerness and struggle the ultimate period of his hot fit of lust which his power was too shortlived to carry him through the full execution of of which my thighs and linen received the effusion  when it was over he bid me with a tone of displeasure get up â€œthat he would not do me the honour to think of me any more that the old bâ€â€h might look out for another cully that he would not be fooled so by ever a country mock modesty in england that he supposed i had left my maidenhead with some hobnail in the country and was come to dispose of my skimmilk in townâ€ with a volley of the like abuse which i listened to with more pleasure than ever fond woman did to protestations of love from her darling minion for incapable as i was of receiving any addition to my perfect hatred and aversion to him i looked on this railing as my security against his renewing his most odious caress  yet plain as mrs browns views were now come out i had not the heart or spirit to open my eyes to them still i could not part with my dependence on that beldam so much did i think myself hers soul and body or rather i sought to deceive myself with the continuation of my good opinion of her and choose to wait the worst at her hands sooner than be turned out to starve in the streets without a penny of money or a friend to apply to these fears were my folly  while this confusion of ideas was passing in my head and i sat pensively by the fire with my eyes brimming with tears my neck still bare and my cap fallen off in the struggle so that my hair was in the disorder you may guess the villains lust began i suppose to be again in flow at the sight of all that bloom of youth which presented itself to his view a bloom yet unenjoyed and of course not yet indifferent to him  after some pause he asked me with a tone of voice mightily softer whether i would make it up with him before the old lady returned and all should be well he would restore me to his affections at the same time offering to kiss me and feel my breasts but now my extreme aversion my fears my indignation all acting upon me gave me a spirit not natural to me so that breaking loose from him i ran to the bell and rang it with such violence and effect as to bring up the maid to know what was the matter or whether the gentleman wanted anything and before he could proceed to greater extremities she bounced into the room and seeing me stretched on the floor my hair all dishevelled my nose gushing out blood which did not a little tragedize the scene and my odious persecutor still intent of pushing his brutal point unmoved by all my cries and distress she was herself confounded and did not know what to do  as much however as martha might be prepared and hardened to transactions of this sort all womanhood must have been out of her heart could she have seen this unmoved besides that on the face of things she imagined that matters had gone greater lengths than they really had and that the courtesy of the house had been actually consummated on me and flung me into the condition i was in in this notion she instantly took my part and advised the gentleman to go down and leave me to recover myself and â€œthat all would be soon over with me that when mrs brown and phåbe who were gone out were returned they would take order for everything to his satisfaction that nothing would be lost by a little patience with the poor tender thing that for her part she was frightened she could not tell what to say to such doings but that she would stay by me till my mistress came homeâ€ as the wench said all this in a resolute tone and the monster himself began to perceive that things would not mend by his staying he took his hat and went out of the room murmuring and pitting his brows like an old ape so that i was delivered from the horrors of his detestable presence  as soon as he was gone martha very tenderly offered me her assistance in anything and would have got me some hartshorn drops and put me to bed which last i at first positively refused in the fear that the monster might return and take me at that disadvantage however with much persuasion and assurances that i should not be molested that night she prevailed on me to lie down and indeed i was so weakened by my struggles so dejected by my fearful apprehension so terrorstruck that i had not power to sit up or hardly to give answers to the questions with which the curious martha plied and perplexed me  such too and so cruel was my fate that i dreaded the sight of mrs brown as if i had been the criminal and she the person injured a mistake which you will not think so strange on distinguishing that neither virtue nor principles had the least share in the defence i had made but only the particular aversion i had conceived against this first brutal and frightful invader of my tender innocence  i passed then the time till mrs brown came home under all the agitations of fear and despair that may easily be guessed  about eleven at night my two ladies came home and having received rather a favourable account from martha who had run down to let them in for mr crofts that was the name of my brute was gone out of the house after waiting till he had tired his patience for mrs browns return they came thundering up stairs and seeing me pale my face bloody and all the marks of the most thorough dejection they employed themselves more to comfort and reinspirit me than in making me the reproaches i was weak enough to fear i who had so many juster and stronger to retort upon them  mrs brown withdrawn phåbe came presently to bed to me and what with the answers she drew from me what with her own method of palpably satisfying herself she soon discovered that i had been more frightened than hurt upon which i suppose being herself seized with sleep and reserving her lectures and instructions till the next morning she left me properly speaking to my unrest for later tossing and turning the greatest part of the night and tormenting myself with the falsest notions and apprehensions of things i fell through mere fatigue into a kind of delirious doze out of which i waked late in the morning in a violent fever a circumstance which was extremely critical to reprieve me at least for a time from the attacks of a wretch infinitely more terrible to me than death itself  the interested care that was taken of me during my illness in order to restore me to a condition of making good the bawds engagements or of enduring further trials had however such an effect on my grateful disposition that i even thought myself obliged to my undoers for their attention to promote my recovery and above all for the keeping out of my sight of that brutal ravisher the author of my disorder on their finding i was too strongly moved at the bare mention of his name  youth is soon raised and a few days were sufficient to conquer the fury of my fever but what contributed most to my perfect recovery and to my reconciliation with life was the timely news that mr crofts who was a merchant of considerable dealings was arrested at the kings suit for nearly forty thousand pounds on account of his driving a certain contraband trade and that his affairs were so desperate that even were it in his inclination it would not be in his power to renew his designs upon me for he was instantly thrown into a prison which it was not likely he would get out of in haste  mrs brown who had touched his fifty guineas advanced to so little purpose and lost all hopes of the remaining hundred began to look upon my treatment of him with a more favourable eye and as they had observed my temper to be perfectly tractable and conformable to their views all the girls that composed her flock were suffered to visit me and had their cue to dispose me by their conversation to a perfect resignation of myself to mrs browns direction  accordingly they were let in upon me and all that frolic and thoughtless gaiety in which those giddy creatures consume either leisure made me envy a condition of which i only saw the fair side insomuch that the being one of them became even my ambition a disposition which they all carefully cultivated and i wanted now nothing but to restore my health that i might be able to undergo the ceremony of the initiation  conversation example in short all contributed in that house to corrupt my native parity which had taken no root in education whilst now the inflammable principal of pleasure so easily fired at my age made strange work within me and all the modesty i was brought up in the habit not the instruction of began to melt away like dew before the suns heat not to mention that i made a vice of necessity from the constant fears i had of being turned out to starve  i was soon pretty well recovered and at certain hours allowed to range all over the house but cautiously kept from seeing any company till the arrival of lord bâ€â€ from bath to whom mrs brown in respect to his experienced generosity on such occasions proposed to offer the perusal of that trinket of mine which bears so great an imaginary value and his lordship being expected in town in less than a fortnight mrs brown judged i would be entirely renewed in beauty and freshness by that time and afforded her the chance of a better bargain than she had driven with mr crofts  in the meantime i was so thoroughly as they call it brought over so tame to their whistle that had my cage door been set open i had no idea that i ought to fly anywhere sooner than stay where i was nor had i the least sense of regretting my condition but waited very quietly for whatever mrs brown should order concerning me who on her side by herself and her agents took more than the necessary precautions to lull and lay asleep all just reflections on my destiny  preachments of morality over the left shoulder a life of joy painted in the gayest colours caresses promises indulgent treatment nothing in short was wanting to domesticate me entirely and to prevent my going out anywhere to get better advice alas i dreamed of no such thing  hitherto i had been indebted only to the girls of the house for the corruption of my innocence their luscious talk in which modesty was far from respected their description of their engagements with men had given me a tolerable insight into the nature and mysteries of their profession at the same time that they highly provoked an itch of florid warmspirited blood through every vein but above all my bed fellow phåbe whose pupil i more immediately was exerted her talents in giving me the first tinctures of pleasure whilst nature now warmed and wantoned with discoveries so interesting piqued a curiosity which phåbe artfully whetted and leading me from question to question of her own suggestion explained to me all the mysteries of venus but i could not long remain in such a house as that without being an eyewitness of more than i could conceive from her descriptions  one day about twelve at noon being thoroughly recovered of my fever i happened to be in mrs browns dark closet where i had not been half an hour resting upon the maids bed before i heard a rustling in the bedchamber separated from the closet only by two sash doors before the glasses of which were drawn two yellow damask curtains but not so close as to exclude the full view of the room from any person in the closet  i instantly crept softly and posted myself so that seeing everything minutely i could not myself be seen and who should come in but the venerable mother abbess herself handed in by a tall brawny young horsegrenadiers moulded in the hercules style in fine the choice of the most experienced dame in those affairs in all london  oh how still and hush did i keep at my stand lest any noise should baulk my curiosity or bring madam into the closet  but i had not much reason to fear either for she was entirely taken up with her present great concern that she had no sense of attention to spare to anything else  droll was it to see that clumsy fat figure of hers flop down on the foot of the bed opposite to the closet door so that i had a full front view of all her charms  her paramour sat down by her he seemed to be a man of very few words and a great stomach for proceeding instantly to essentials he gave her some hearty smacks and thrusting his hands into her breasts disengaged them from her stays in scorn of whose confinement they broke loose and sagged down navellow at least a more enormous pair did my eyes never behold nor of a worse colour flagging soft and most lovingly contiguous yet such as they were this great beefeater seemed to paw them with a most unenviable lust seeking in vain to confine or cover one of them with a hand scarce less than a shoulder of mutton after toying with them thus some time as if they had been worth it he laid her down pretty briskly and canting up her petticoats made barely a mask of them to her broad red face that blushed with nothing but brandy  as he stood on one side unbuttoning his waistcoat and breeches her fat brawny thighs hung down and the whole greasy landscape lay fairly open to my view a wide open mouthed gap overshaded with a grizzly bush seemed held out like a beggars wallet for its provision  but i soon had my eyes called off by a more striking object that entirely engrossed them  her sturdy stallion had now unbuttoned and produced naked stiff and erect that wonderful machine which i had never seen before and which for the interest my own seat of pleasure began to take furiously in it i stared at with all the eyes i had however my senses were too much flurried too much concentered in that now burning spot of mine to observe anything more than in general the make and turn of that instrument from which the instinct of nature yet more than all i had heard of it now strongly informed me i was to expect that supreme pleasure which she had placed in the meeting of those parts so admirably fitted for each other  long however the young spark did not remain before giving it two or three shakes by way of brandishing it he threw himself upon her and his back being now towards me i could only take his being ingulphed for granted by the directions he moved in and the impossibility of missing so staring a mark and now the bed shook the curtains rattled so that i could scarce hear the sighs and murmurs the heaves and pantings that accompanied the action from the beginning to the end the sound and sight of which thrilled to the very soul of me and made every vein of my body circulate liquid fires the emotion grew so violent that it almost intercepted my respiration  prepared then and disposed as i was by the discourse of my companions and phåbes minute detail of everything no wonder that such a sight gave the last dying blow to my native innocence  whilst they were in the heat of the action guided by nature only i stole my hand up my petticoats and with fingers on fire seized and yet more inflamed that center of all my senses my heart palpitated as if it would force its way through my bosom i breathed with pain i twisted my thighs squeezed and compressed the lips of that virgin slit and following mechanically the example of phåbes manual operation on it as far as i could find admission brought on at last the critical ecstasy the melting flow into which nature spent with excess of pleasure dissolves and dies away  after which my senses recovered coolness enough to observe the rest of the transaction between this happy pair  the young fellow had just dismounted when the old lady immediately sprung up with all the vigour of youth derived no doubt from her late refreshment and making him sit down began in her turn to kiss him to pat and pinch his cheeks and play with his hair all which he received with an air of indifference and coolness that showed him to be much altered from what he was when he first went on to the breach  my pious governess however not being above calling in auxiliaries unlocks a little case of cordials that stood near the bed and made him pledge her in a very plentiful dram after which and a little amorous parley madam set herself down upon the same place at the beds foot and the young fellow standing sidewise by her she with the greatest effrontery imaginable unbuttons his breeches and removing his shirt draws out his affair so shrunk and diminished that i could not but remember the difference now crestfallen or just faintly lifting its head but our experience matron very soon by chaffing it with her hands brought it to swell to that size and erection i had before seen it up to  i admired then upon a fresh account and with a nicer survey the texture of that capital part of man the flaming red head as it stood uncapt the whiteness of the shaft and the shrub growth of curling hair that embrowned the foots of it the roundish bag that dangled down from it all exacted my eager attention and renewed my flame but as the main affair was now at the point the industrious dame had laboured to bring it to she was not in the humour to put off the payment of her pains but laying herself down drew him gently upon her and thus they finished in the same manner as before the old last act  this over they both went out lovingly together the old lady having first made him a present as near as i could observe of three or four pieces he being not only her particular favourite on account of his performances but a retainer to the house from whose sight she had taken great care hitherto to secret me lest he might not have had patience to wait for my lords arrival but have insisted on being his taster which the old lady was under too much subjection to him to dare dispute with him for every girl of the house fell to him in course and the old lady only now and then got her turn in consideration of the maintenance he had and which he could scarce be accused of not earning from her  as soon as i heard them go downstairs i stole up softly to my own room out of which i had luckily not been missed there i began to breathe more free and to give a loose to those warm emotions which the sight of such an encounter had raised in me i laid me down on the bed stretched myself out joining and ardently wishing and requiring any means to divert or allay the rekindled rage and tumult of my desires which all pointed strongly to their pole man i felt about the bed as if i sought for something that i grasped in my waking dream and not finding it could have cried for vexation every part of me plowing with simulated fires at length i resorted to the only present remedy that of vain attempts at digitation where the smallness of the theatre did not yet afford room enough for action and where the pain my fingers gave me in striving for admission though they procured me a slight satisfaction for the present started an apprehension which i could not be easy till i had communicated to phåbe and received her explanations upon it  the opportunity however did not offer till next morning for phåbe did not come to bed till long after i was gone to sleep as soon then as we were both awake it was but in course to bring our lyabed chat to hand on the subject of my uneasiness to which a recital of the love scene i had thus by chance been spectatress of served for a preface  phåbe could not hear it to the end without more than one interruption by peals of laughter and my ingenuous way of relating matters did not a little heighten the joke to her  but on her sounding me how the sight had affected me without mincing or hiding the pleasurable emotions it had inspired me with i told her at the same time that one remark had perplexed me and that very considerably â€œayeâ€ says she â€œwhat was thatâ€ â€œwhyâ€ replied i â€œhaving very curiously and attentively compared the size of that enormous machine which did not appear at least to my fearful imagination less than my wrist and at least three of my handfuls long to that of the tender small part of me which was framed to receive it i could not conceive its being possible to afford it entrance without dying perhaps in the greatest pain since she well knew that even a finger thrust in there hurt me beyond bearing as to my mistresss and yours i can very plainly distinguish the different dimensions of them from mine palpable to the touch and visible to the eye so that in short great as the promised pleasure may be i am afraid of the pain of the experimentâ€  phåbe at this redoubled her laugh and whilst i expected a very serious solution of my doubts and apprehensions in this matter only told me that â€œshe never heard of a mortal wound being given in those parts by that terrible weapon and that some she knew younger and as delicately made as myself had outlived the operation that she believed at the worst i should take a great deal of liking that true it was there was a great diversity of sizes in those parts owing to nature childbearing frequent overstretching with unmerciful machines but that at a certain age and habit of body even the most experienced in those affairs could not well distinguish between the maid and the woman supposing too an absence of all artifice in their natural situation but that since chance had thrown in my way one sight of that sort she would procure me another that should feast my eyes more delicately and go a great way in the cure of my fears from that imaginary disproportionâ€  on this she asked me if i knew polly phillips â€œundoubterlyâ€ says i â€œthe fair girl which was so tender of me when i was sick and has been as you told me but two months in the houseâ€ â€œthe sameâ€ says phåbe â€œyou must know then she is kept by a young genoes merchant whom his uncle who is immensely rich and whose darling he is on a pretex of settling some accounts but in reality to humour his inclinations for travelling and seeing the world he met casually with this polly once in company and taking a likning to her makes it worth her while to keep entirely to him he comes to her here twice or thrice a week and she receives him in the light closet up one pair of stairs where he enjoys her in a taste i suppose peculiar to the heat or perhaps the caprices of his own country i say no more but tomorrow being his day you shall see what passes between them from a place only known to your mistress and myselfâ€  you may be sure in the ply i was now taking i had no objection to the proposal and was rather a tiptoe for its accomplishments  at five in the evening next day phåbe punctual to her promise came to me as i sat alone in my own room and beckoned me to follow her  we went down the back stairs very softly and opening the door of a dark closet where there was some old furniture kept and some cases of liquor she drew me in after her and fastened the door upon us we had no light but what came through a long crevice in the partition between ours and the light closet where the scene of action lay so that sitting on those low cases we could with the greatest ease as well as clearness see all objects ourselves unseen only by applying our eyes close to the crevice where the moulding of a panel had warped or started a little on the other side  the young gentleman was the first person i saw with his back directly towards me looking at a print polly was not yet come in less than a minute though the door opened and she came in and at the noise the door made he turned about and come to meet her with an air of the greatest tenderness and satisfaction  after saluting her he led her to a coach that fronted us where they both sat down and the young genoes helped her to a glass of wine with some naples biscuits on a salver  presently when they had exchanged a few kisses and questions in broken english on one side he began to unbutton and in fine stript unto his shirt  as if this had been the signal agreed on for pulling off all their clothes a scheme which the heat of the season perfectly favoured polly began to draw her pins and as she had no stays to unlace she was in a trice with her gallants officious assistance undressed to all but her shift  when he saw this his breeches were immediately loosened waist and knee bands and slipped over his ankles clean off his shirt collar was unbottoned too then first giving polly an encouraging kiss he stole as it were the shift off the girl who being i suppose broke and familiarized to this humour blushed indeed but less than i did at the apparition of her now standing stark naked just as she came ont of the hands of pure nature with her black hair loose and afloat down her dazzling white neck and shoulders whilst the deepened carnation of her cheeks went off gradually into the hue of glazed snow for such were the blended tints polish of her skin  this girl could not be above eighteen her face regular and sweet featured her shape exquisite nor could i help envying her two ripe enchanting breasts finely plumped out in flesh but withal so round so firm that they sustained themselves in scorn of any stay then their nipples pointing different ways marked their pleasing separation beneath them lay the delicious tract of the belly which terminated in a parting of rift scarce discerning that modesty seemed to retire downward and seek shelter between two plump fleshy thighs the curling hair that overspread its delightful front clothed it with the richest sable fur in the universe in short she was evidently a subject for the painters to court her sitting to them for a pattern female beauty in all the true pride and pomp of nakedness  the young italian still in his shirt stood gazing and transported at the sight of beauties that might have fired a dying hermit his eager eyes devoured her as she shifted attitudes at his discretion neither were his hands excluded their share of the high feast but wandered on the hunt of pleasure over every part and inch of her body so qualified to afford the most exquisite sense of it  in the mean time time one could not help observing the swell of his shirt before that bolstered out and pointed out the condition of things behind the curtain but he soon removed it by slipping his shirt over his head and now as to nakedness they had nothing to reproach one another  the young gentleman by phåbes guess was about two and twenty tall and well limbed his body was finely formed and of a most vigorous make square shouldered and broad chested his face was not remarkable any way but for a nose inclining to the roman eyes large black and sparkling and a ruddiness in his cheeks that was the more a grace for his complexion was of the brownest not of that dusky dun colour which excludes the idea of freshness but of that clear olive gloss which glowing with life dazzles perhaps less than fairness and yet pleases more when it pleases at all his hair being too short to tie fell no lower than his neck in short easy curls and he had a few sprigs about his paps that garnished his chest in a style of strength and manliness then his grand movement which seemed to rise out of a thicket of curling hair that spread from the root all over his thighs and belly up to the navel stood stiff and upright but of a size to frighten me by sympathy for the small tender part which was the object of its fury and which now lay exposed to my fairest view for he had immediately on stoppings off his shirt gently pushed her down on the couch which stood conveniently to break her willing fall her thighs were spread out to their utmost extention and discovered between them the mark of the sex the redcentered cleft of flesh whose lips vermillioning inwards expressed a small ruby line in sweet miniature such as guides touch or colouring could never attain to the life or delicacy of  phåbe at this gave me a gentle jog to prepare me for a whisper question â€œwhether i thought my little maidenhead was much lessâ€ but my attention was too much engrossed too much inwrapped with all i saw to be able to give her any answer  by this time the young gentelman had changed her posture from lying breadth to lengthwise on the coach but her thighs were still spread and the mark lay fair for him who now kneeling between them displayed to us a side view of that fierce erect machine of his which threatened no less than splitting the tender victim who lay smiling at the uplifted stroke nor seemed to decline it he looked upon his weapon himself with some pleasure and guiding it with his hand to the inviting slit drew aside the lips and lodged it after some thrusts which polly seemed even to assist about half way but there it stuck i suppose from its growing thickness he draws it again and just wetting it with spittle reenters and with ease sheathed it now up to the hilt at which polly gave a deep sigh which was quite another tone than one of pain he thrusts she heaves at first gently and in a regular cadence but presently the transport began to be too violent to observe any order or measure their motions were too rapid their kisses too fierce and fervent for nature to support such fury long both seemed to me out of themselves their eyes darted fires â€œoh oh i cant bear it it is too much i die i am goingâ€ were pollys expressions of extasy his joys were more silent but soon broken murmurs sighs heartfetched and at length a dispatching thrust as if he would have forced himself up her body and then the motionless languor of all his limbs all shewed that the dieaway moment was come upon him which she gave signs of joining with by the wild throwing of her hands about closing her eyes and giving a deep sob in which she seemed to expire in an agony of bliss  when he had finished his stroke and got from off her she lay still without the least motion breathless as it should seem with pleasure he replaced her again breadthwise on the couch unable to sit up with her thighs open between which i could observe a kind of white liquid like froth hanging about the outward lips of that recently opened wound which now glowed with a deeper red presently she gets up and throwing her arms round him seemed far undelighted with the trial he had put her to to judge at least by the fondness with which she eyed and hung upon him  for my part i will not pretend to describe what i felt over me during this scene but from that instant adieu all fears of what man can do unto me they were now changed into such ardent desires such ungovernable longings that i could have by the sleeve and offered him the bauble which i now imagined the loss of would be a gain i could not too soon procure myself  phåbe who had more experience and to whom such sights were not so new could not however be unmoved at so warm a scene and drawing me away softly from the peeping hole for fear of being overheard guided me as the door as possible all passive and obedient to her least signals  here was no room either to sit or lie but making me stand with my back towards the door she lifted up my petticoats and with her busy fingers fell to visit and explore that part of me where i was perfectly sick and ready to die with desire that the bare touch of her finger in that critical place had the effect of a fire to a train and her hand instantly made her sensible to what a pitch i was wound up and melted by the sight she had thus procured me satisfied then with her success in allaying a heat that would have made me impatient of seeing the continuation of the transactions between our amourous couple she brought me again to the crevice so favourable to our curiosity  we had certainly been but a few instants away from it and yet on our return we saw everything in good forwardness for recommencing the tender hostilities  the young foreigner was sitting down fronting us on the coach with polly upon one knee who had her arms round his neck whilst the extreme whiteness of her skin was not undelightfully contrasted by the smooth glossy brown of her lovers  but who could count the fierce unnumbered kisses given and taken in which i could often discover their mouths were double tongued and seemed to favour the mutual insertion with the greatest gust and delight  in the meantime his redheaded champion that had so lately fled the pit quelled and abashed was now recovered to the top of his condition perked and crested up between pollys thighs who was not wanting on her part to coax and keep it in good humour stroking it with her head down and receiving even its velvet tip between the lips of not its proper mouth whether it was to render it more glib and easy of entrance i could not tell but it had such an effect that the young gentleman seemed by his eyes that sparkled with more excited lustre and his inflamed countenance to receive increase of pleasure he got up and taking polly in his arms embraced her and said something too softly for me to hear leading her withal to the foot of the couch and taking delight to slap her thighs and posteriors with that stiff sinew of his which hit them with a spring that he gave it with his hand and made them resound again but her about as much as he meant to hurt her for she seemed to have as frolic a taste as himself  but guess my surprise when i saw the lazy young rogue lie down on his back and gently pull down polly upon him who giving way to his humour stradled and with her hands conducted her blind favourite to the right place and following her impulse ran directly upon the flaming point of this weapon of pleasure which she staked herself upon up pierced and infixed to the extremest hair breadth of it thus she sat on him a few instants enjoying and relishing her situation whilst he toyed with her provoking breasts sometimes she would stoop to meet his kiss but presently the sting of pleasure spurred them up to fiercer action then began the storm of heaves which from the undermost combatant were thrust at the same time he crossing his hands over her and drawing her home to him with a sweet violence the inverted strokes of anvil over hammer soon brought on the critical period in which all the signs of a close conspiring extasy informed us of the point they were at  for me i could bear to see no more i was so overcome so inflamed at the second part of the same play that mad to an intolerable degree i hugged i clasped phåbe as if she had wherewithal to relieve me pleased however with and pitying the taking she could feel me in she drew towards the door and opening it softly as she could we both got off undiscovered and reconducted me to my own room where unable to keep my legs in the agitation i was in i instantly threw myself down on the bed where i lay transported though ashamed at what i felt  phåbe lay down by me and asked me archly â€œif now that i had seen the enemy and fully considered him i was still afraid of him or did i think i could come to a close engagement with himâ€ to all which not a word on my side i sighed and could scarcely breathe she takes hold of my hand and having rolled up her own petticoats forced it half strivingly towards those parts where now grown more knowing i missed the main object of my wishes and finding not even the shadow of what i wanted where every thing was so fiat or so hollow in the vexation i was in at it i should have withdrawn my hand but for fear of disobliging her abandoning it then entirely to her management she made use of it as she thought proper to procure herself rather the shadow than the substance of any pleasure for my part i now pined for more solid food and promised tacitly to myself that i would not be put off much longer with this foolery of woman to woman of mrs brown did not soon provide me with the essential specific in short i had all the air of not being able to wait the arrival of my lord bâ€â€ though he was now expected in a very fews days nor did i wait for him for love itself took charge of the disposal of me in spite of interest or gross lust  it was now two days after the closet scene that i got up about six in the morning and leaving my bedfellow fast asleep stole down with no other thought than of taking a little fresh air in a small garden which our back parlour opened into and from which my confinement debarred me at the times company came to my house but now sleep and silence reigned all over it  i opened the parlour door and well surprised was i at seeing by the side of a fire halfout a young gentleman in the old ladys elbow chair with his legs laid upon another fast asleep and left there by his thoughtless companions who had drank him down and then went off with every one but his mistress whilst he stayed behind by the courtesy of the old matron who would not disturb or turn him out in that condition at one in the morning and beds it is more than probable there were none to spare on the table still remained the punch bowl and glasses stewed about in their usual disorder after a drunken revel  but when i drew nearer to view the sleeping estray heavens what a sight no term of years no turn of fortune could ever eraze the lightninglike impression his form made on me yes dearest object of my earliest passion i command for ever the remembrance of thy first appearance to my ravished eyes it calls thee up present and i see thee now  figure to yourself madam fair stripling between eighteen and nineteen with his head reclined on one of the sides of the chair his hair disordered curls irregularly shading a face on which all the roseate bloom of youth and all the manly graces conspired to fix my eye sand heart even the languour and paleness of his face in which the momentary triumph of the lily over the rose was owing to the excesses of the night gave an inexpressible sweetness to the finest features imaginable his eyes closed in sleep displayed the meeting edges of their lids beautifully bordered with long eyelashes over which no pencil could have described two more regular arches than those that graced his forehead which was high perfectly white and smooth then a pair of vermilion lips pouting and swelling to the touch as if a bee had freshly stung them seemed to challenge me to get the gloves off this lovely sleeper had not the modesty and respect which in both sexes are inseparable from a true passion checked my impulses  but on seeing his shirt collar unbottoned and bosom whiter than a drift of snow the pleasure of considering it could not bribe me to lengthen it at the hazard of a health that began to be my lifes concern love that made me timid taught me to be tender too with a trembling hand i took hold of one of his and waking him as gently as possible he started and looking at first a little wildly said with a voice that sent its harmonious sound to my heart â€œpray child whataclock is itâ€ i told him and added that he might catch cold if he slept longer with his breast open in the cool of the morning air on this he thanked me with a sweetness perfectly agreeing with that of his features and eyes the last now broad open and eagerly surveying me carried the surightly fires they sparkled with directly to my heart  it seems that having drank too freely before he came upon the rake with some of his young companions he had put himself out of a condition to go through all the weapons with them and crown the night with a getting a mistress so that seeing me in a loose undress he did not doubt but i was one of the misses of the house sent in to repair his loss of time but though he seized that notion and a very obvious one it was without hesitation yet whether my figure made a more than ordinary impression on him or whether it was his natural politeness he addressed me in a manner far from rude though still on the foot of one of the house pliers come to amuse him and giving me the first kiss that i ever relished from man in my life asked me if i could favour him with my company assuring me that he would make it worth my while but had not even newborn love that true refiner of lust opposed so sudden a surrender the fear of being surprised by the house was a sufficient bar to my compliance  i told him then in a tone set by love itself that for reasons i had not time to explain to him i could not stay with him and might even ever see him again with a sigh at these words which broke from the bottom of my heart my conqueror who as he afterwards told me had been struck with my appearance and liked me as much as he could think of liking any one in my supposed way of life asked me briskly at once if i would be kept by him and that he would take a lodging for me directly and relieve me from any engagements he presumed i might be under to the house  rash sudden undigested even dangerous as this offer might be from a perfect stranger and that stranger a giddy boy the prodigious love i was struck with for him had put a charm into every objection i not resisting and blinded me to every objection i could at that instant have died for him think if i could resist an invitation to live with him thus my heart beating strong to the proposal dictated my answer after scarce a minutes pause that i would accept of his offer and make my escape to him in what way he pleased and that i would be entirely at his disposal let it be good or bad i have often since wondered that so great an easiness did not disgust him or make me too cheap in his eyes but my fate had so appointed it that in his fears of the hazzard of the town he had been some time looking out for a girl to take into keeping and my person happening to hit his fancy it was by one of those miracles reserved to love that we struck the bargain in the instant which we sealed by an exchange of kisses that the hopes of a more uninterrupted enjoyment engaged him to content himself with  never however did dear youth carry in his head more wherewith to justify the turning of a girls head and making her set all consequences at defiance for the sake of following a gallant  for besides all the perfections of manly beauty which were assembled in his form he had an air of neatness and gentility certain smartness in the carriage and port of his head that yet more distinguished him his eyes were sprightly and full of meaning his looks had in them something at once sweet and commanding his complexion outbloomed the lovely coloured rose whilst its inimitable tender vivid glow clearly saved it from the reproach of wanting life of raw and doughlike which is commonly made of those so extremely fair as he was  our little plan was that i should get out about seven the next morning which i could readily promise as i knew where to get the key of the street door and he would wait at the end of the street with a coach to convey me safe off after which we would send and clear any debt incurred by my stay at mrs browns who he only judged in gross might not care to part with one he thought so fit to draw custom to the house  i then just hinted to him not to mention in the house his having seen such a person as me for reasons i would explain to him more at leisure and then for fear of miscarrying by being seen together i tore myself from him with a bleeding heart and stole up softly to my room where i found phåbe still fast asleep and hurrying off my few clothes lay down by her with a mixture of joy and anxiety that may be easier conceived than expressed  the risks of mrs browns discovering my purpose of disappointments misery ruin all vanished before this newkindled flame the seeing the touching the being if but for a night with this idol of my fond virgin heart appeared to me a happiness above the purchase of my liberty or life he might use me ill let him he was the master happy too happy even to receive death at so dear a hand  to this purpose were the reflections of the whole day of which every minute seemed to me a little eternity how often did i visit the clock nay was tempted to advance the tedious hand as if that would have advanced the time with it had those of the house had the least observations on me they must have remarked something extraordinary from the discomposure i could not help betraying especially when at dinner mention was made of the charmingest youth having been there and stayed breakfast â€œoh he was such a beauty i should have died for him they would pull caps for himâ€ and the like fooleries which however was throwing oil on a fire i was sorely put to it to smother the blaze of  the fluctuations of my mind the whole day produced one good effect which was that through mere fatigue i slept tolerably well till five in the morning when i got up and having dressed myself waited under the double tortures of fear and impatience for the appointed hour it came at last the dear critical dangerous hour came and now supported only by the courage love lent me i ventured a tiptoe down stairs leaving my box behind for fear of being surprized with it in going out  i got to the street door the key whereof was always laid on the chair by our bed side in trust with phåbe who having not the least suspicion of my entertaining any design to go from them nor indeed had i but the day before made no reserve or concealment of it from me i opened the door with great ease love that emboldened protected me too and now got safe into the street i saw my new guardian angel waiting at a coach door ready open how i got to him i know not i suppose i flew but i was in the coach in a trice and he by the side of me with his arms clasped round me and giving me the kiss of welcome the coachman had his orders and drove to them  my eyes were instantly filled with tears but tears of the most delicious delight to find myself in the arms of that beauteous youth was a rapture that my little hear swam in past or future were equally out of the question with me the present was as much as all my powers of life were sufficient to bear the transport of without fainting nor were the most tender embraces the most soothing expressions wanting on his side to assure me of his love and of never giving me cause to repent the bold step i had taken in throwing myself thus entirely upon his honour and generosity but alas this was no merit in me for i was drove to it by a passion too impetuous for me to resist and i did what i did because i could not help it  in an instant for time was now annihilated with me we were landed at a public house in chelsea hospitably commodious for the reception of duet parties of pleasure where a breakfast of chocolate was prepared for us  an old jolly stager who kept it and understood life perfectly well breakfasted with us and leering archly at me gave us both joy and said â€œwe were well paired i faith that a great many gentlemen and ladies used his house but he had never seen a handsomer couple he was sure i was a fresh piece i looked so country so innocent well my spouse was a lucky manâ€ all which common landlords cant not only pleased and soothed me but helped to diver my confusion at being with my new sovereign whom the minute approached i began to fear to be alone with a timidity which true love had a greater share in than even maiden bashfulness  i wished i doated i could have died for him and yet i know not how or why i dreaded the point which had been the object of my fiercest wishes my pulses beat fears amidst a flush of the warmest desires this struggle of the passions however this conflict betwixt modesty and lovesick longings made me burst again into tears which he took as he had done before only for the remains of concern and emotion at the suddenness of my change of condition in committing myself to his care and in consequence of that idea did and said all that he thought would most comfort and reinspirit me  after breakfast charles the dear familiar name i must take the liberty henceforward to distinguish my adonis by with a smile full of meaning took me gently by the hand and said â€œcome my dear i will show you a room that commands a fine prospect over some gardensâ€ and without waiting for an answer in which he relieved me extremely he led me up into a chamber airy and lightsome where all seeing of prospects was out of the question except that of a bed which had all the air of recommending the room to him  charles had just slipped the bolt of the door and running caught me in his arms and lifting me from the ground with his lips glued to mine bore me trembling panting dying with soft fears and tender wishes to the bed where his impatience would not suffer him to undress me more than just unpinning my handkerchief and gowns and unlacing my stays  my bosom was now bare and rising in the warmest throbs presented to his sight and feeling the firm hard swell of a pair of young breast such as may be imagined of a girl not sixteen fresh out of the country and never before handled but even their pride whiteness fashion pleasing resistance to the touch could not bribe his restless hands from roving but giving them the loose my petticoats and shift were soon taken up and their stronger center of attraction laid open to their tender invasion my fears however made me mechanically close my thighs but the very touch of his hand insinuated between them disclosed them and opened a way for the main attack  in the mean time i lay fairly exposed to the examination of his eyes and hands quiet and unresisting which confirmed him the opinion he proceeded so cavalierly upon that i was no novice in these matters since he had taken me out of a common bawdy house nor had i said one thing to prepossess him of my virginity and if i had he would sooner have believed that i took him for a cully that would swallow such an improbability than that i was still mistress of that darling treasure that hidden mine so eagerly sought after by the men and which they never dig for but to destroy  being now too high wound up to bear a delay he unbuttoned and drawing out the engine of love assaults drove it currently as at a ready made breach then then for the first time did i feel that stiff hornhard gristle battering against the tender part but imagine to yourself his surprise when he found after several vigorous pushes which hurt me extremely that he made not the least impression  i complained but tenderly complained â€œi could not bear it indeed he hurt meâ€ still he thought no more than that being so young the largeness of his machine for few men could dispute size with him made all the difficulty and that possibly i had not been enjoyed by any so advantageously made in that part as himself for still that my virgin flower was yet uncropped never entered into his head and he would have thought it idling with time and words to have questioned me upon it  he tried again still no admittance still no penetration but he had hurt me yet more while my extreme love made me bear extreme pain almost without a groan at length after repeated fruitless trials he lay down panting by me kissed my falling tears and asked me tenderly â€œwhat was the meaning of so much complaining and if i had not borne it better from other than i did from himâ€ i answered with a simplicity framed to persuade that he was the first mam that ever served me so truth is powerful and it is not always that we do not believe what we eagerly wish  charles already disposed by the evidence of his senses to think my pretences to virginity not entirely apocryphal smothers me with kisses begs me in the name of love to have a little patience and that he wilt be as tender of hurting me as he would be of himself  alas it was enough i knew his pleasure to submit joyfully to him whatever pain i foresaw it would cost me  he now resumes his attempts in more form first he put one of the pillows under me to give the blank of his aim a more favourable elevation and another under my head in ease of it then spreading my thighs and placing himself standing betwen them made them rest upon his applying then the point of his machine to the slit into which he sought entrance it was so small he could scarce assure himself of its being rightly pointed he looks he feels and satisfies himself there driving on with fury its prodigious stiffness thus impacted wedgelike breaks the union of those parts and gained him just the insertion of the tip of it lip deep which being sensible of he improved his advantage and following well his stroke in a straight line forcibly deepens his penetration but put me to such intolerable pain from the separation of the sides of that soft passage by a hard thick body i could have screamed out but as i was unwilling to alarm the house i held in my breath and crammed my petticoat which was turned up over my face into my mouth and bit it through in the agony at length the tender texture of that tract giving way to such fierce tearing and rending he pierced something further into me and now outrageous and no longer his own master but borne headlong away by the fury and overmettle of that member now exerting itself with a kind of native rage he breaks in carries all before him and one violent merciless lunge sent it imbrued and reeking with virgin blood up to the very hilt in me then then all my resolution deserted me i screamed out and fainted away with the sharpness of the pain and as he told me afterwards on his drawing out when emission was over with him my thighs were instantly all in a stream of blood that flowed from the wounded torn passage  when i recovered my senses i found myself undressed and abed in the arms of the sweet relenting murderer of my virginity who hung mourning tenderly over me and holding in his hand a cordial which coming from the still dear author of so much pain i could not refuse my eyes however moistened with tears and languishingly turned upon him seemed to reproach him with his cruelty and ask him if such were the rewards of love but charles to whom i was now infinitely endeared by his complete triumph over a maidenhead where he so little expected to find one in tenderness to that pain which he had put me to in procuring himself the height of pleasure smothered his exultation and employed himself with so much sweetness so much warmth to sooth to caress and comfort me in my soft complainings which breathed indeed more love than resentment that i presently drowned all sense of pain in the pleasure of seeing him of thinking that i belonged to him he who was now the absolute disposer of my happiness and in one word my fate  the sore was however too tender the wound too bleeding fresh for charless goodnature to put my patience presently to another trial but as i could not stir or walk across the room he ordered the dinner to be brought to the bed side where it could not be otherwise than my getting down the wing of a fowl and two or three glasses of wine since it was my adored youth who both served and urged them on me with that sweet irresistible authority with which love had invested him over me  after dinner and everything but the wine was taken away charles very impudently asks a leave he might read the grant of in my eyes to come to bed to me and accordingly falls to undressing which i could not see the progress of without strange emotions of fear and pleasure  he is now in bed with me the first time and in broad day but when thrusting up his own shirt and my shift he laid his naked glowing body to mine oh insupportable delight oh superhuman rapture what pain could stand before a pleasure so transporting i felt no more the smart of my wounds below but curling round him like the tendril of a vine as if i feared any part of him should be untouched or unpressed by me i returned his strenuous embraces and kisses with a fervour and gust only known to true love and which mere lust never rise to  yes even at this time that all the tyranny of the passions is fully over and that my veins roll no longer but a cold tranquil stream the remembrance of those passages that most affected me in my youth still cheers and refreshes me let me proceed then my beauteous youth was now glued to me in all the folds and twists that we could make our bodies meet in when no longer able to rein in the fierceness of refreshed desires he gives his steed the head and gently insinuating his thighs between mine stopping my mouth with kisses of humid fire makes a fresh eruption and renewing his thrusts pierces tears and forces his way up the torn tender folds that yielded him admission with a smart little less severe that when the breach was first made i stifled however my cries and bore him with the passive fortitude of an heroine soon his thrusts more and more furious cheeks flushed with a deeper scarlet his eyes turned up in the fervent fit some dying sighs and an agonizing shudder announced the approaches of that ecstatic pleasure i was yet in too much pain to come in for my share of  nor was it till after a few enjoyments had numbed and blunted the sense of the smart and given me to feel the titillating inspersion of balsamic sweets drew from me the delicious return and brought down all my passion that i arrived at excess of pleasure through excess of pain but when successive engagements had broke and inured me i began to enter into the true unalloyed relish of that pleasure of pleasures when the warm gush darts through all the ravished inwards what floods of bliss what melting transports what agonies of delight too fierce too mighty for nature to sustain well has she therefore no doubt provided the relief of a delicious momentary dissolution the approaches of which are intimated by a dear delirium a sweet thrill on the point of emitting those liquid sweets in which enjoyment itself is drowned when one gives the languishing stretch out and die at the discharge  how often when the rage and tumult of my senses had subsided after the melting flow have i in a tender meditation asked myself cooly the question if it was in nature for any of its creatures to be so happy as i was or what were all fears of the consequence put in the scale of one nights enjoyment of any thing so transcendently the taste of my eyes and heart as that delicious fond matchless youth  thus we spent the whole afternoon till supper time in a continued circle of love delights kissing turtlebilling toying and all the rest of the feast at length supper was served in before which charles had for i do not know what reason slipped his clothes on and sitting down by the bed side we made table and tablecloth of the bed and sheets whilst he suffered nobody to attend or serve but himself he ate with a very good appetite and seemed charmed to see me eat for my part i was so transported with the comparison of the delights i now swam in with the insipidity of all my past scenes of life that i thought them sufficiently cheap at even the price of my ruin or the risk of their not lasting the present possession was all my little head could find room for  we lay together that night when after playing repeated prizes of pleasure nature overspent and satisfied gave us up to the arms of sleep those of my dear youth encircled me the consciousness of which made even that sleep more delicious  late in the morning i waked first and observing my lover slept profoundly softly disengaged myself from his arms scarcely daring to breathe for fear of shortening his repose my cap my hair my shift were all in disorder from the rufflings i had undergone and i took this opportunity to adjust and set them as well as i could whilst every now and then looking at the sleeping youth with inconceivable fondness and delight and reflecting on all the pain he had put me to tacitly owned that the pleasure had overpaid me for my sufferings  it was then broad day i was sitting up in the bed the clothes of which were all tossed or rolled off by the unquietness of our motions from the sultry heat of the weather nor could i refuse myself a pleasure that solicited me so irresistibly as this fair occasion of feasting my sight with all those treasures of youthful beauty i had enjoyed and which lay now almost entirely naked his shirt being trussed up in a perfect wisp which the warmth of the season and room made me easy about the consequence of i hung over him enamoured indeed and devoured all his naked charms with only two eyes when i could have wished them at least an hundred for the fuller enjoyment of the gaze  oh could i paint his figure as i see it now still present to my transported imagination a whole length of an all perfect manly beauty in full view think of a face without a fault glowing with all the opening bloom and verdant freshness of an age in which beauty is of either sex and which the first down over his upper lip scarce began to distinguish  the parting of the double ruby pout of his lips seemed to exhale an air sweeter and purer than what it drew in ah what violence did it not cost me to refrain the so tempted kiss  then a neck exquisitely turned graved behind and on the sides with fais hair playing freely in natural ringlets connected his head to a body of the most perfect form and of the most vigorous contexture in which all the strength of manhood was concealed and softened to appearance by the delicacy of his complexion the smoothness of his skin and the plumpness of his flesh  the platform of his snow white bosom that was laid out in a manly proportion presented on the vermilion summit of each pap the idea of a rose about to blow  nor did his shirt hinder me from observing the symmetry of his limbs that exactness of shape in the fall of it towards the loins where the waist ends and the rounding swell of the hips commences where the skin sleek smooth and dazzling white burnishes on the stretchover firm plump ripe flesh that crimped and ran into dimples at the least pressure or that the touch could not rest upon but slid over on the surface of the most polished ivory  his thighs finely fashioned and with a florid glossy roundness gradually tapering away to the knees seemed pillars worthy to support that beauteous frame at the bottom of which i could not without some remains of terror some tender emotions too fix my eyes on that terrible machine which had not long before with such fury broke into torn and almost ruined those soft tender parts of mine that had not yet done smarting with the effects of its rage but behold it now crest fallen reclining its halfcaped vermilion head over one of his thighs quiet pliant and to all appearances incapable of the mischiefs and cruelty it had committed then the beautiful growth of the hair in short and soft curls round its roots its whiteness branched veins the supple softness of the shaft as it lay foreshortened rolled and shrunk up into a squat thickness languid and borne up from between his thighs by its globular appendage that wondrous treasure bag of natures sweets which revelled round and pursed up in the only wrinkles that are known to please perfected the prospect and altogether formed the most interesting moving picture in nature and surely infinitely superior to those nudities furnished by the painters statuaries or any art which are purchased at immense prices whilst the sight of them in actual life is scarce sovereignly tasted by any but the few whom nature has endowed with a fire of imagination warmly pointed by a truth of judgment to the springhead the originals of beauty of natures unequalled composition above all the imitations of art or the reach of wealth to pay their price  but every thing must have an end a motion made by this angelic youth in the listlessness of goingoff sleep replaced his shirt and the bed clothes in a posture that shut up that treasury from longer view  i lay down then and carrying my hands to that part of me in which the objects just seen had begun to raise a mutiny that prevailed over the smart of them my fingers now opened themselves an easy passage but long i had not time to consider the wide difference there between the maid and the now finished woman before charles waked and turning towards me kindly enquired how i had rested and scarce giving me time to answer imprinted on my lips one of his burning rapture kisses which darted a flame to my heart that from thence radiated to every part of me and presently as if he had proudly meant revenge for the survey i had smuggled of all his naked beauties he spurns off the bed clothes and trussing up my shift as high as it would go took his turn to feast his eyes on all the gifts nature had bestowed on my person his busy hands too ranged intemperately over every part of me the delicious austerity and hardness of my yet unripe budding breasts the whiteness and firmness of my flesh the freshness and regularity of my features the harmony of my limbs all seemed to confirm him in his satisfaction with his bargain but when curious to explore the havock he had made in the centre of his over fierce attack he not only directed his hands there but with a pillow put under placed me favourably for his wanton purpose of inspection then who can express the fire his eyes glistened his hands glowed with whilst sighs of pleasure and tender broken exclamations were all the praises he could utter by this time his machine stiffly risen at me gave me to see it in its highest state and bravery he feels it himself seems pleased at its condition and smiling loves and graces seizes one of my hands and carries it with gentle compulsion to this pride of nature and its richest master piece  i struggling faintly could not help feeling what i could not grasp a column of the whitest ivory beautifully streaked with blue veins and carrying fully uncapt a head of the liveliest vermilion no horn could be harder or stiffer yet no velvet more smooth or delicious to the touch presently he guided my hand lower to that part in which nature and pleasure keep their stores in concert so aptly fastened and hung on to the root of their first instrument and minister that not improperly he might be styled their pursebearer too there he made me feel distinctly through their soft cover the contents a pair of roundish balls that seemed to play within and elude all pressure but the tenderest from without  but now this visit of my soft warm hand in those so sensible parts had put every thing into such ungovernable fury disdaining all further preluding and taking advantage of my commodious posture he made the storm fall where i scarce patiently expected and where he was sure to lay it presently then i felt the stiff intersection betwen the yielding divided lips of the wound now open for life where the narrowness no longer put me to intolerable pain and afforded my lover no more difficulty than what heightened his pleasure in the strict embrace of that tender warm sheath round the instrument it was so delicately adjusted to and which now cased home so gorged me with pleasure that it perfectly suffocated me and took away my breath then the killing thrusts the unnumbered kisses every one of which was a joy inexpressible and that joy lost in a crowd of yet greater blisses but this was a disorder too violent in nature to last long the vessels so stirred and intensely heated soon boiled over and for that time put out the fire meanwhile all this dalliance and disport had so far consumed the morning that it became a kind of necessity to lay breakfast and dinner into one  in our calmer intervals charles gave the following account of himself every tittle of which was true he was the only son of a father who having a small post in the revenue rather overlived his income and had given this young gentleman a very slender education no profession had he bred him up to but designed to provide for him in the army by purchasing him an ensigns commission that is to say provided he could raise the money or procure it by interest either of which clauses was rather to be wished than hoped for by him on no better a plan however had his improvident father suffered this youth a youth of great promise to run up to the age of manhood or near it at least in next to idleness and had besides taken no sort of pains to give him even the common premonitions against the vices of the town and the dangers of all sorts which wait the unexperienced and unwary in it he lived at home and at discretion with his father who himself kept a mistress and for the rest provided charles did not ask him for money he was indolently kind to him he might lie out when he pleased any excuse would serve and even his reprimands were so slight that they carried with them rather an air of connivance at the fault than any serious control or constraint but to supply his calls for money charles whose mother was dead had by her side a grandmother who doated upon him she had a considerable annuity to live on and very regularly parted with every shilling she could spare to this darling of hers to the no little heartburn of his father who was vexed not that she by this means fed his sons extravagance but that she preferred charles to himself and we shall too soon see what a fatal turn such a mercenary jealousy could operate on the breast of a father  charles was however by the means of his grandmothers lavish fondness very sufficiently enabled to keep a mistress so easily contented as my love made me and my good fortune for such i must ever call it threw me in his way in the manner above related just as he was on the lookout for one  as to temper the even sweetness of it made him seem born for domestic happiness tender naturally polite and gentlemannerd it could never be his fault if ever jars or animosities ruffled a calm he was so qualified every way to maintain or restore without those great or shining qualities that constitute a genius or are fit to make a noise in the world he had all those humble ones that compose the softer social merit plain common sense set off with every grace of modesty and good nature made him if not admired what is much happier universally beloved and esteemed but as nothing but the beauties of his person had at first attracted my regard and fixed my passion neither was i then a judge of the internal merit which i had afterwards full occasion to discover and which perhaps in that season of giddiness and levity would have touched my heart very little had it been lodged in a person less the delight of my eyes and idol of my senses but to return to our situation  after dinner which we ate abed in most voluptuous disorder charles got up and taking a passionate leave of me for a few hours went to town where concerting matters with a young sharp lawyer they went together to my late venerable mistresss from whence i had but the day before made my elopement and with whom he was determined to settle accounts in a manner that should cut off all after reckonings from that quarter  accordingly they went but by the way the templar his friend on thinking over charless information saw reason to give their visit another turn and instead of offering satisfaction to demand it  on being let in the girls of the house flocked round charles whom they knew and from the earlyness of my escape and their perfect ignorance of his ever having so much as seen me not having the least suspicion of his being accessory to my flight they were in their way making up to him and as to his companion they took him probably for a fresh cully but the templar soon checked their forwardness by enquiring for the old lady with whom he said with a gravelike countenance that he had some business to settle  madam was immediately sent for down and the ladies being desired to clear the room the lawyer asked her severely if she did know or had not decoyed under pretence of hiring as a servant a young girl just come out of the country called frances or fanny hill describing me withal as particularly as he could from charlies description  it is peculiar to vice to tremble at the enquiries of justice and mrs brown whose conscience was not entirely clear upon my account as knowing as she was of the town as hackneyed as she was in bluffing through all the dangers of her vocation could not help being alarmed at the questions especially when he went on to talk of a justice of peace newgate the old bailey indictments for keeping a disorderly house pillory carting and the whole process of that nature she who it is likely imagined i had lodged an information against her house looked extremely blank and began to make a thousand protestations and excuses however to abridge they brought away triumphantly my box of things which had she not ben under an awe she might have disputed with them and not only that but a clearance and discharge of any demands on the house at the expense of no more than a bowl of arrackpunch the treat of which together with the choice of the house conveniences was offered and not accepted charles all the time acted the chance companion of the lawyer who had brought him there as he knew the house and appeared in no wise interested in the issue but he had the collateral pleasure of hearing all that i told him verified as far as the bawds fears would give her leave to enter into my history which if one may guess by the composition she so readily came into were not small  phåbe my kind tutoress phåbe was at the time gone out perhaps in search of me or their cookedup story had not it is probable passed smoothly  this negociation had however taken up some time which would have appeared much longer to me left as i was in a strange house if the landlady a motherly sort of a woman to whom charles had liberally recommended me had not come up and borne me company we drank tea and her chat helped to pass away the time very agreeably since he was our theme but as the evening deepened and the hour set for his return was elapsed i could not dispel the gloom of impatience and tender fears which gathered upon me and which our timid sex are apt to feel in proportion to their love  long however i did not suffer the sight of him overpaid me and the soft reproach i had prepared for him expired before it reached my lips  i was still abed yet unable to use my legs otherwise than awkwardly and charles flew to me catches me in his arms raised and extending mine to meet his dear embrace and gives me an account interrupted by many a sweet parenthesis of kisses of the success of his measures  i could not help laughing at the fright of the old woman had been put into which my ignorance and indeed my want of innocence had far from prepared me from bespeaking she had it seems apprehended that i fled the shelter to some relation i had recollected in town on my dislike of their ways and proceedings towards me and that this application came from thence for as charles had rightly judged not one neighbour had at that still hour seen the circumstance of my escape into the coach or at least noticed him neither had any in the house the least hint of suspicion of my having spoken to him much less of my having clapt up such a sudden bargain with a perfect stranger thus the greatest improbability is not always what we should most mistrust  we supped with all the gaiety of two young giddy creatures at the top of their desires and as i had given up to charles the whole charge of my future happiness i thought of nothing beyond the exquisite pleasure of possessing him  he came to bed in due time and this second night the pain being pretty well over i tasted in full draught all the transports of perfect enjoyment i swam i bathed in bliss till both fell asleep through the natural consequences of satisfied desires and appeased flames nor did we wake but to renewed raptures  thus making the most of love and life did we stay in this lodging in chelsea about ten days in which time charles took care to give his excursions from home a favourable gloss and to keep his footing with his fond indulgent grandmother from whom he drew constant and sufficient supplies for the charge i was to him and which was very trifling in comparison with his former less regular course of pleasure  charles removed me then to a private ready furnished lodging in d street st jamess where he paid half a guinea a week for two rooms and a closet on the second floor which he had been some time looking out for and was more convenient for the frequency of his visits than where he had at first placed me in a house which i cannot say but i left with regret as it was infinitely endeared to me by the first possession of my charles and the circumstance of losing there that jewel which can never be twice lost the landlord however had no reason to complain of any thing but of a procedure in charles too liberal not to make him regret the loss of us  arrived at our new lodging i remember i thought them extremely fine though ordinary enough even at that price but had it been a dungeon that charles had brought me to his presence would have made a little versailles  the landlady mrs jones waited on us to our apartment and with great volubility of tongue explained to us all its conveniences â€œthat her own maid should wait on us that the best of quality had lodged at her house that her first floor was let to a foreign secretary of an embassy and his lady that i looked like a very good natured ladyâ€ at the word lady i blushed out of flattered vanity this was strong for a girl of my condition for though charles had the precaution of dressing me in a less tawdry flaunting style than were the clothes i escaped to him in and of passing me for his wife that she had secretly married and kept private the old story on account of his friends i dare swear this appeared extremely apocryphal to a woman who knew the town so well as she did but that was the least of her concern it was impossible to be less scrupleridden than she was and the advantage of letting her rooms being her sole object the truth itself would have far from scandalized her or broke her bargain  a sketch of her picture and personal history will dispose you to account for the part she is to act in my concern  she was about forty six years old tall meagre redhaired with one of those trivial ordinary faces you meet with every where and go about unheeded and unmentioned in her youth she had been kept by a gentleman who dying left her forty pounds a year during her life in consideration of a daughter he had by her which daughter at the age of seventeen she sold for not a very considerable sum neither to a gentleman who was going on envoy abroad and took his purchase with him where he used her with the utmost tenderness and it is thought was secretly married to her but had constantly made a point of her not keeping up the least correspondence with a mother base enough to make a market of her own flesh and blood however as she had not nature nor indeed any passion but that of money this gave her no further uneasiness then as she thereby lost a handle of squeezing presents or other after advantages out of the bargain indifferent then by nature of constitution to every other pleasure but that of increasing the lump by any means whatever she commenced a kind of private procuress for which she was not amiss fitted by her grave decent appearance and sometimes did a job in the matchmaking way in short there was nothing that appeared to her under the shape of gain that she would not have undertaken she knew most of the ways of the town having not only herself been upon but kept up constant intelligences in promoting a harmony between the two sexes in private pawnbroking and other profitable secrets she rented the house she lived in and made the most of it by letting it out in lodgings though she was worth at least near three or four thousand pounds she would not allow herself even the necessaries of life and pinned her subsistence entirely on what she could squeeze out of her lodgers  when she saw such a young pair come under her roof her immediate notions doubtless were how she should make the most money of us by every means that money might be made and which she rightly judged our situations and inexperience would soon beget her occasions of  in this hopeful sanctuary and under the clutches of this harpy did we pitch our residence it will not be might material to you or very pleasant to me to enter into a detail of all the petty cutthroat ways and means with which she used to fleece us all which charles indolently chose to bear with rather than take the trouble of removing the difference of expense being scarce attended to by a young gentleman who had no ideas of stint or even economy and a raw country girl who knew nothing of the matter  here however under the wings of my sovereignly beloved did the most delicious hours of my life flow on my charles i had and in him every thing my fond heart could wish or desire he carried me to plays operas masquerades and every diversion of the town all which pleased me indeed but pleased me infinitely the more for his being with me and explaining every thing to me and enjoying perhaps the natural impressions of surprise and admiration which such sights at the first never fail to excite in a country girl new to the delights of them but to me they sensibly proved the power and dominion of the sole passion of my heart over me a passion in which soul and body were concentered and left me no room for any other relish of life but love  as to the men i saw at those places or at any other they suffered so much in the comparison my eyes made of them with my allperfect adonis that i had not the infidelity even of one wandering thought to reproach myself with upon his account he was the universe to me and all that was not him was nothing to me  my love in fine was so excessive that is arrived at annihilating every suggestion or kindling spark of jealousy for one idea only tending that way gave me such exquisite torment that my selflove and dread of worse than death made me for ever renounce and defy it nor had i indeed occasion for were i to enter here on the recital of several instances wherein charles sacrificed to me women of much greater importance than i dare hint which considering his form was no such wonder i might indeed give you full proof of his unshaken constancy to me but would not you accuse me of warming up against a feast which my vanity ought long ago to have been satisfied with  in our cessations from active pleasure charles framed himself one in instructing me as far as his own lights reached in a great many points of life that i was in consequence of my noeducation perfectly ignorant of nor did i suffer one word to fall in vain from the mouth of my lovely teacher i hung on every syllable he uttered and received as oracles all he said whilst kisses were all the interruption i could not refuse myself the pleasure of admitting from lips that breathed more than arabian sweetness i was in a little time enabled by the progress i had made to prove the deep regard i had paid to all that he had said to me repeating it to him almost word for word and to shew that i was not entirely the parrot but that i reflected upon that i entered into it i joined my own comments and asked him questions of explanation  my country accent and the rusticity of my gait manners and deportment began now sensibly to wear off so quick was my observation and so efficacious my desire of growing every day worthier of his heart  as to money though he brought me constantly all he received it was with difficulty he even got me to give it room in my bureau and what clothes i had he could prevail on me to accept of on no other foot than that of pleasing him by the greater neatness in my dress beyond which i had no ambition i could have made a pleasure of the greatest toil and worked my fingers to the bone with joy to have supported him guess then if i could harbour any idea of being burthensome to him and this disinterested turn in me was so unaffected so much the dictate of my heart that charles could not but feel it and if he did not love me as much as i did him which was the constant and only matter of sweet contention between us he managed so at least as to give me the satisfaction of believing it impossible for man to be more tender more true more faithful than he was  our landlady mrs jones came frequently up to my apartment from whence i never stirred on any pretext without charles nor was it long before she wormed out without much art the secret of our having cheated the church of a ceremony and in course of the terms we lived together upon a circumstance which far from displeased her considering the designs she had upon me and which alas she will have too soon room to carry into execution but in the meantime her own experience of life let her see that any attempt however indirect or disguised to divert or break at least presently so strong a cement of hearts as ours was could only end in losing two lodgers of whom she had made very competent advantages if either of us came to smoke her commission for a commission she had from one of her customers either to debauch or get me away from my keeper at any rate  but the barbarity of my fate soon saved her the task of disuniting us i had now been eleven months with this life of my life which had passed in one continued rapid stream of delight but nothing so violent was ever made to last i was about three months gone with a child by him a circumstances would have added to his tenderness had he ever left me room to believe it could receive an addition when the mortal the unexpected blow of separation fell upon us i shall gallop postover the particulars which i shudder yet to think of and cannot to this instant reconcile myself how or by what means i could outlive it  two livelong days had i lingered through without hearing from him i who breathed who existed but in him and had never yet seen twentyfour hours pass without seeing or hearing from him the third day my impatience was so strong my alarms had been so severe that i perfectly sickened with them and being unable to support the shock longer i sunk upon the bed and ringing for mrs jones who had far from comforted me under my anxieties she came up and i had scarce breath and spirit enough to find words to beg of her if she would save my life to fall upon some means of finding out instantly what was become of its only prop and comfort she pitied me in a way that rather sharpened my affliction than suspended it and went out upon this commission  for she had but to go to charless house who lived but an easy distance in one of the streets that run into covent garden there she went into a public house and from thence sent for a mid servant whose name i had given her as the properest to inform her  the maid readily came and as readily when mrs jones enquired of her what had become of mr charles or whether he was gone out of town acquainted her with the disposal of her masters son which the very day after was no secret to the servants such sure measures had he taken for the most cruel punishment of his child for having more interest with his grandmother than he had though he made use of a pretence plausible enough to get rid of him in this secret abrupt manner for fear her fondness should have interposed a bar to his leaving england and proceeding on a voyage he had concerted for him which pretext was that it was indispensably necessary to secure a considerable inheritance that devolved to him by the death of a rich merchant his own brother at one of the factories in the south seas of which he had lately received advice together with a copy of the will  in consequence of which resolution to send away his son he had unknown to him made the necessary preparations for fitting him out struck a bargain with the captain of a ship whose punctual execution of his orders he had secured by his interest with his principal owners and patron and in short concerted his measures so secretly and effectually that whilst the son thought he was going down to the river that would take him a few hours he was stopt on board of a ship debarred from writing and more strictly watched than a state criminal  thus was the idol of my soul torn from me and forced on a long voyage without taking leave of one friend or receiving one line of comfort except a dry explanation and instructions from his father how to proceed when he should arrive at his destined port enclosing withal some letters of recommendation to a factor there all these particulars i did not learn minutely till some time after  the maid at the same time added that she was sure this usage of her sweet young master would be the death of his grandmamma as indeed it proved true for the old lady on hearing it did not survive the news a whole month and as her fortune consisted in an annuity out of which she had laid up no reserves she left nothing worth mentioning to her so fatally envied darling but absolutely refused to see his father before she died  when mrs jones returned and i observed her looks they seemed so unconcerned and even nearest to pleased that i half flattered myself she was going to set my tortured heart at ease by bringing me good news but this indeed was a cruel delusion of hope the barbarian with all the coolness imaginable stabs me to the heart in telling me succinctly that he was sent away at least on a four years voyage here she stretched maliciously and that i could not expect in reason ever to see him again and all this with such pregnant circumstances that i could not escape giving them credit as they were indeed too true  she had hardly finished her report before i fainted away and after several successive fits all the while wild and senseless i miscarried of the dear pledge of my charless love but the wretched never die when it is fittest they should die and women are hardlived to a proverb  the cruel and interested care taken to recover me saved an odious life which instead of the happiness and joys it had overflower in all of a sudden presented no view before me of any thing but the depth of misery horror and the sharpest affliction  thus i lay six weeks in the struggles of youth and constitution against the friendly efforts of death which i constantly invoked to my relief and deliverance but which proved too weak for my wish i recovered at length but into a state of stupefaction and despair that threatened me with the loss of my senses and a mad house  time however that great comforter in ordinary began to assuage the violence of my suffering and to numb my feeling of them my health returned to me though i still retained an air of grief dejection and languor which taking off from the ruddiness of my country complexion rendered it rather more delicate and affecting  the landlady had all this while officiously provided and seen that i wanted for nothing and as soon as she saw me retrieved into a condition of answering her purpose one day after we had dined together she congratulated me on my recovery the merit of which she took entirely to herself and all this by way of introduction to a most terrible and scurvy epilogue â€œyou are nowâ€ says she â€œmiss fanny tolerably well and you are very welcome to stay in these lodgings as long as you please you see i have asked you for nothing this long time but truly i have a call to make up a sum of money which must be answeredâ€ and with that presents me with a bill of arrears for rent diet apothecaries charges nurse etc sum total twentythree pounds seventeen and sixpence towards discharging of which i had not in the world which she well knew more than seven guineas left by chance of my dear charless common stock with me at the same time she desired me to tell her what course i would take for payment i burst out into a flood of tears and told her my condition that i would sell what few clothes i had and that for the rest would pay her as soon as possible but my distress being favourable to her view only stiffened her the more  she told me very cooly that â€œshe was indeed sorry for my misfortunes but that she must do herself justice though it would go to the very heart of her to send such a tender young creature to prisonâ€ at the word â€œprisonâ€ every drop of my blood chilled and my fright acted so strongly upon me that turning as pale and faint as a criminal at the first sight of his place of execution i was on the point of swooning my landlady who wanted only to terrify me to a certain point and not to throw me into a state of body inconsistent with her designs upon it began to sooth me again and told me in a tone composed to more pity and gentleness that â€œit would be my own fault if she was forced to proceed to such extremities but she believed there was a friend to be found in the world who would make up matters to both our satisfactions and that she would bring him to drink tea with us that very afternoon when she hoped we would come to a right understanding in our affairsâ€ to all this not a word of answer i sat mute confounded terrified  mrs jones however judging rightly that it was time to strike while the impressions were so strong upon me left me to myself and to all the terrors of an imagination wounded to death by the idea of going to prison and from a principle of selfpreservation snatching at every glimpse of redemption from it  in this situation i sat near half an hour swallowed up in grief and despair when my landlady came in and observing a deathlike dejection in my countenance still in pursuance of her plan put on a false pity and bidding me be of good heart â€œthingsâ€ she said â€œwould be but my own friendâ€ and closed with telling me â€œshe had brought a very honourable gentleman to drink tea with me who would give me the best advice how to get rid of all my troublesâ€ upon which without waiting for a reply she goes out and returns with this very honourable gentleman whose very honourable procuress she had been on this as well as other occasions  the gentleman on his entering the room made me a very civil bow which i had scarce strength or presence of mind enough to return a curtsey to when the landlady taking upon her to do all the honours of the first interview for i had never that i remember seen the gentleman before sets a chair for him another for herself all this while not a word on either side a stupid stare was all the face i could put on this strange visit  the tea was made and the landlady unwilling i suppose to lose any time observing my silence and shyness before this entire stranger â€œcome miss fannyâ€ says she in a coarse familiar style and tone of authority â€œhold up your head child and do not let sorrow spoil that pretty face of yours what sorrows are only for a time come be free here is a worthy gentleman who has heard of your misfortunes and is willing to serve you you must be better acquainted with him do not you now stand upon your punctilios and this and that but make your market while you mayâ€  at this so delicate and eloquent harangue the gentleman who saw i loooked frighted and amazed and indeed incapable of answering took her up for breaking things in so abrupt a manner as rather to shock than incline me to an acceptance of the good he intended me then addressing himself to me told me â€œhe was perfectly acquainted with my whole story and every circumstance of my distress which he owned was a cruel plunge for one of my youth and beauty to fall into that he had long taken a liking to my person for which he appealed to mrs jones there present but finding me so deeply engaged to another he had lost all hopes of succeeding till he had heard the sudden reverse of fortune that had happened to me on which he had given particular orders to my landlady to see that i should want for nothing and that had he not been forced abroad to the hague on affairs he could not refuse himself to he would himself have attended me during my sickness that on his return which was the day before he had on learning my recovery desired my landladys good offices to introduce him to me and was as angry at least as i was shocked at the manner in which she had conducted herself towards obtaining him that happiness but that to show me how much he disdained her procedure and how far he was from taking any ungenerous advantage of my situation and from exacting any security for my gratitude he would before my face that instant discharge my debt entirely to my landlady and give me her receipt in full after which i should be at liberty either to reject or grant his suit as he was much above putting any force upon my inclinationsâ€  whilst he was exposing his sentiments to me i ventured just to look up to him and observed his figure which was that of a very welllooking gentleman well made of about forty dressed in a suit of plain clothes with a large diamond ring on one of his fingers the lustre of which played in my eyes as he waved his hand in talking and raised my notions of his importance in short he might pass for what is commonly called a comely black man with an air of distinction natural to his birth and condition  to all his speeches however i answered only in tears that flower plentifully to my relief and choking up my voice excused me from speaking very luckily for i should not have known what to say  the sight however moved him as he afterwards told me irresistibly and by way of giving me some reason to be less powerfully afflicted he drew out his purse and calling for pen and ink which the landlady was prepared for paid her every farthing of her demand independent of a liberal gratification which was to follow unknown to me and taking a receipt in full very tenderly forced me to secure it by guiding my hand which he had thrust it into so as to make me passively put it into my pocket  still i continued in a state of stupidity or melancholic despair as my spirits could not yet recover from the violent shocks that they had received and the accommodating landlady had actually left the room and me alone with this strange gentleman before i had observed it and then i observed it without alarm for i was now lifeless and indifferent to every thing  the gentleman however no novice in affairs of this sort drew near me and under the pretence of comforting me first with his handkerchief dried my tears as they ran down my cheeks presently he ventured to kiss me on my part neither resistance nor compliance i sat stock still and now looking on myself as bought by the payment that had been transacted before me  i did not care what became of my wretched body and wanting life spirits or courage to oppose the least struggle even that of the modesty of my sex i suffered tamely whatever the gentleman pleased who proceeding insensibly from freedom to freedom insinuating his hand between my handkerchief and bosom which he handled at discretion finding thus no repulse and that every thing favoured beyond expectation the completion of his desires he took me in his arms and bore me without life or motion to the bed on which laying me gently downed and having me at what advantage he pleased i did not so much as know what he was about till recovering from a trance of lifeless insensibility i found him buried in me whilst i lay passive and innocent of the least sensations of pleasure a deathcold corpse could scarce have less life or sense in it as soon as he had thus pacified a passion which had too little respected the condition i was in he got off and after recomposing the disorder of my clothes employed himself with the utmost tenderness to calm the transports of remorse and madness at myself with which i was seized too late i confess for having suffered on that bed the embraces of an utter stranger i tore my hair wrung my hands and beat my breast like a mad woman but when my new master for in that light i then viewed him applied himself to appease me as my whole rage was levelled at myself no part of which i thought myself permitted to aim at him i begged of him with more submission than anger to leave me alone that i might at least enjoy my affliction in quiet this he positively refused for fear as he pretended i should do myself a mischief violent passions seldom last long and those of women least of any a dead still calm succeeded this storm which ended in a profuse shower of tears  had any one but a few instants before told me that i should have ever known any man but charles i would have spit in his face or had i been offered infinitely a greater sum of money than that i saw paid for me i had spurned the proposal in cold blood but our virtues and our vices depend too much on our circumstances unexpectedly beset as i was betrayed by a mind weakened by a long severe affliction and stunned with the terrors of a goal my defeat will appear the more excusable since i certainly was not present at or a party in any sense to it however as the first enjoyment is decisive and he was now over the bar i thought i had no longer a right to refuse the caresses of one that had got that advantage over me no matter how obtained conforming myself then to this maxim i considered myself as so much in his power that i endured his kisses and embraces without affecting struggles or anger not that he as yet gave me any pleasure or prevailed over the aversion of my soul to give myself up to any sensation of that sort what i suffered i suffered out of a kind of gratitude and as a matter of course what had passed  he was however so regardful as not to attempt the renewal of those extremities which had thrown me just before into such violent agitations but now secure of possession contented himself with bringing me to temper by degrees and waiting at the hand of time for those fruits of generosity and courtship which he since often reproached himself with having gathered much too green when yielding to the inability to resist him and overborne by desires he had wreaked his passion on a mere lifeless spiritless body dead to all purpose of joy since taking none it ought to be supposed incapable of giving any this is however certain my heart never thoroughly forgave him the manner in which i had fallen to him although in point of interest i had fallen to him i had reason to be pleased that he found in my person wherewithal to keep him from leaving me as easily as he had had me  the evening was in the mean time so far advanced that the maid came in to lay the cloth for supper when i understood with joy that my landlady whose sight was present poison to me was not to be with us  presently a neat and elegant supper was introduced and a bottle of burgundy with the other necessaries were set on a dumbwaiter  the maid quitting the room the gentleman insisted with a tender warmth that i should sit up in the elbow chair by the fire and see him eat if i could not be prevailed on to eat myself i obeyed with a heart full or affliction at the comparison it made between those delicious tãªteã tãªtes with my very dear youth and this forced situation this new awkward scene imposed and obtruded on me a cruel necessity  at supper after a great many arguments used to comfort and reconcile me to my fate he told me that his name was h brother to the earl of l and that having by the suggestions of my landlady been led to see me he had found me perfectly to his taste and given her a commission to procure me at any rate and that at length he had succeeded as much to his satisfaction as he passionately wished it might be to mine adding withal some flattering assurances that i should have no cause to repent my knowledge of him  i had now got down at least half a partridge and three or four glasses of wine which he compelled me to drink by way of restoring nature but whether there was any thing extraordinary put into the wine or whether there wanted no more to revive the natural warmth of my constitution and give fire to the old train i began no longer to look with that constraint not to say disguise on mr h which i had hitherto done but withal there was not the least grain of love mixed with this softening of my sentiments any other man would have been just the same to me as mr h that stood in the same circumstances and had done for me and with me what he had done  there are not on earth at least eternal griefs mine were if not at an end at least suspended my heart which had been so long overloaded with anguish and vexation began to dilate and open to the last gleam of diversion or amusement i wept a little and my tears relieved me i sighed and my sighs seemed to lighten me of a load that oppressed me my countenance grew if not cheerful at least more composed and free  mr h who had watched perhaps brought on this change knew too well not to seize it he thrust the table imperceptibly from between us and bringing his chair to face me he soon began after preparing me by all the endearments of assurance and protestations to lay hold of my hands to kiss me and once more to make free with my bosom which being at full liberty from the disorder of a loose dishabile now panted and throbbed less with indignation than with fear and bashfulness at being used so familiarly by still a stranger but he soon gave me greater occasion to exclaim by stooping down and slipping his hands above my garters thence he strove to regain the pass which he had before found so open and unguarded but now he could not unlock the twist of my thighs i gently complained and begged him to let me alone told him i was not well however he saw there was more form and ceremony in my resistance than good earnest he made his conditions for desisting from pursuing his point that i should be put instantly to bed whilst he gave certain orders to the landlady and that he would return in an hour when he hoped to find me more reconciled to his passion for me than i seemed at present i neither assented nor denied but my air and manner of receiving his proposal gave him to see that i did not think myself enough my own mistress to refuse it  accordingly he went out and left me when a minute or two after before i could recover myself into any composure for thinking the maid came in with her mistresss service and a small silver orringer of what she called a bridal posset and desired me to eat it as i went to bed which consequently i did and felt immediately a heat a fire run like a hueandcry through every part of my body i burnt i glowed and wanted even little of wishing for any man  the maid as soon as i was lain down took the candle away and wishing me a good night went out of the room and shut the door after her  she had hardly time to get down stairs before mr h opened my room door softly and came in now undressed in his nightgown and cap with two lighted wax candles and bolting the door gave me though i expected him some sort of alarm he came a tiptoe to the bed side and saying with a gentle whisper â€œpray my dear do not be startled i will be very tender and kind to youâ€ he then hurried off his clothes and leaped into bed having given me openings enough whilst he was stripping to observe his brawny structure strong made limbs and rough shaggy breast  the bed shook again when it received this new load he lay on the outside where he kept the candles burning no doubt for the satisfaction of every sense for as soon as he had kissed me he rolled down the bed clothes and seemed transported with the view of all my person at full length which he covered with a profusion of kisses sparing no part of me then being on his knees between my thighs he drew up his shirt and bared all his hairy thighs and stiff staring truncheon red top and rooted into a thicket of curls which covered his belly to the novel and gave it the air of a flesh brush and soon i feel it joining close to mine when he had drove the nail up to the head and left no partition but the intermediate hair on both sides  i had it now i felt it now and beginning to drive he soon gave nature such a powerful summons down to her favourite quarters that she could no longer refuse repairing thither all my animals spirits then rushed mechanically to that center of attraction and presently inly warmed and stirred as i was beyond bearing i lost all restraint and yielding to the force of the emotion gave down as mere woman those effusions of pleasure which in the strictness of still faithful love i could have wished to have kept in  yet oh what an immense difference did i feel between this impression of a pleasure merely animal and struck out of the collision of the sexes by a passive bodily effect from that sweet fury that rage of active delight which crowns the enjoyments of a mutual love passion where two hearts tenderly and truly united club to exalt the joy and give it a spirit and soul that bids defiance to that end which mere momentary desires generally terminate in when they die of a surfeit of satisfaction  mr h whom no distinctions of that sort seemed to distract scarce gave himself or me breathing time from the last encounter but as if he had tasked himself to prove that the appearances of his vigour were no signs hung out in vain in a few minutes he was in a condition for renewing the onset to which preluding with a storm of kisses he drove the same course as before with unbated fervour and thus in repeated engagements kept me constantly in exercise till dawn of morning in all which time he made me fully sensible of the virtues of his firm texture of limbs his square shoulders broad chest compact hard muscles in short a system of manliness that might pass for no bad image of our ancient sturdy barons whose race is now so thoroughly refined and frittered away into the more delicate and modern built frame of our papnerved softlings who are as pale as pretty and almost as masculine as their sisters  mr h content however with having the day break upon his triumph resigned me up to the refreshment of a rest we both wanted and we soon dropped into a profound sleep  though he was some time awake before me yet he did not offer to disturb a repose he had given me so much occasion for but on my first stirring which was not till past ten oclock i was obliged to endure one more trial of his manhood  about eleven in came mrs jones with two basins of the richest soup which her experience in these matters had moved her to prepare i pass over the fulsome compliments the cant of the decent procuress with which she saluted us both but though my blood rose at the sight of her i supprest my emotions and gave all my concerne to reflections on what would be the consequence of this new engagement  but mr h who penetrated my uneasiness did not suffer me to languish under it and acquainted me that having taken a solid sincere affection to me he would begin by giving me one leading mark of it in removing me out of a house which must for many reasons be irksome and disagreeable to me into convenient lodgings where he would take all imaginable care of me and desiring not to have any explanations with my landlady or be impatient till he returned he dressed and went out having left me a purse with two and twenty guineas in it being all he had about him as he express it to keep my pocket still further supplied  as soon as he was gone i felt the usual consequence of the first launch into vice for my love attachment to charles never appeared to me in that light i was instantly borne away down the stream without making back to the shore my dreadful necessities my gratitude and above all to say the plain truth the dissipation and diversion i began to find in this new acquaintance from the black corroding thoughts my heart had been a prey to ever since the absence of my dear charles concurred to stun all my contrary reflections if i now thought of my first my only charmer it was still with the tenderness and regret of the fondest love embittered with the consciousness that i was no longer worthy of him i could have begged my bread with him all over the world but wretch that i was i had neither the virtue or courage requisite not to outlive my separation from him  yet had not my heart been thus preengaged mr h might probably have been the sole master of it but the place was full and the force of conjectures alone had made him the possessor of my person the charms of which had by the bye been his sole object and passion and were of course no foundation for a love either very delicate or very durable  he did not return till six in the evening to take me away to my new lodgings and my moveables being soon packed and conveyed into a hackney coach it cost me but little regret to take my leave of a landlady whom i thought i had so much reason not to be over pleased with and as for her part she made no other difference to my staying or going but what that of the profit created  we soon got to the house appointed for me which was that of a plain tradesman who on the score of interest was entirely at mr hs devotion and who let him the first floor very genteelly furnished for two guineas a week of which i was instated mistress with a maid to attend me  he stayed with me that evening and we had a supper from a neighbouring tavern after which and a gay glass or two the maid put me to bed mr h soon followed and notwithstanding the fatigues of the preceding night i found no quarter nor remission from him he piquet himself as he told me on doing the honours of my new apartment  the morning being pretty well advanced we got to breakfast and the ice now broke my heart no longer engrossed by love began to take ease and to please itself with such trifles mr hs liberal liking led him to make his court to the usual vanity of our sex silks laces ear rings pearl necklace gold watch in sort all the trinkets and articles of dress were lavishly heaped upon me the sence of which if it did not create returns of love forced a kind of grateful fondness something like love a distinction which it would be spoiling the pleasure of nine tenths of the keepers in the town to make and is i suppose the very good reason why so few of them ever do make it  i was now established the kept mistress in form well lodged with a very sufficient allowance and lighted up with all the lustre of dress  mr h continued kind and tender to me yet with all this i was far from happy for besides my regrets for my dear youth which though often suspended or diverted still returned upon me in certain melancholic moments with redoubled violence i wanted more society more dissipation  as to mr h he was so much my superior in every sense that i felt it too much to the disadvantage of the gratitude i owed him thus he gained my esteem though he could not raise my taste i was qualified for no sort of conversation with him except one sort and that is a satisfaction which leaves tiresome intervals if not filled up by love or other amusements  mr h so experienced so learned in the ways of women numbers of whom had passed through his hands doubtless soon perceived this uneasiness and without approving or liking me the better for it had the complaisance to indulge me  he made suppers at my lodging where he brought several companions of his pleasures with their mistresses and by this means i got into a circle of acquaintance that soon stripped me of all the remains of bashfulness and modesty which might be yet left of my country education and were to a just taste perhaps the greatest of my charms  we visited one another in form and mimicked as near as we could all the miseries the follies and impertinencies of the women in quality in the round of which they trifle away their time without it ever entering their little heads that on earth there cannot subsist any thing more silly more flat more insipid and worthless than generally considered their system of life is they ought to treat the men as their tyrants indeed were they to condemn them to it  but though amongst the kept mistresses and i was now acquainted with a good many besides some useful matrons who live by their connexions with them i hardly knew one that did not perfectly detest their keepers and of course made little or no scruple of any infidelity they could safely accomplish i had still no notion of wronging mine for besides that no mark of jealousy on his side started me the hint or gave me the provocation to play him a trick of that sort and that his constant generosity politeness and tender attention to please me forced a regard to him that without affecting my heart insured him my fidelity no object had yet presented that could overcome the habitual liking i had contracted for him and i was on the eve of obtaining from the movements of his own voluntary generosity a modest provision for life when an accident happened which broke all the measures he had resolved upon in my favour  i had now lived near seven months with mr h when one day returning to my lodgings from a visit in the neighbourhood where i used to stay longer i found the street door open and the maid of the house standing at it talking with some of her acquaintance so that i came in without knocking and as i passed by she told me mr h was above i slept up stairs into my own bedchamber with no other thought than of pulling off my hat etc and then to wait upon him in the dining room into which my bedchamber had a door as is common enough whilst i was untying my hat strings i fancied i heard my maid hannahs voice and a sort of tustle which raised my curiosity i stole softly to the door where a knot in the wood had been slipped out and afforded a very commanding peephole to the scene then in agitation the actors of which had been to earnestly employed to hear my opening my own door from the landing place of the stairs into my bedchamber  the first sight that struck me was mr h pulling and hauling this coarse country strammel towards a couch that stood in a corner of the diningroom to which the girl made only a sort of awkward holdening resistance crying out so loud that i who listened at the door could scarce hear her â€œpray sir dont let me alone i am not for your turn you cannot sure demean yourself with such a poor body as i lord sir my mistress may come home i must not indeed i will cry outâ€ all of which did not hinder her from insensibly suffering herself to be brought to the foot of the couch upon which a push of no mighty violence served to give her a very easy fall and my gentleman having got up his hands to the strong hold of her virtue she no doubt thought it was time to give up the argument and that all further defense would be vain and he throwing her petticoats over her face which was now as red as scarlet discovered a pair of stout plump substantial thighs and tolerably white he mounted them round his haps and coming out with his drawn weapon stuck it in the cloven sport where he seemed to find a less difficult entrance than perhaps he had flattered himself with for by the way this blouse had left her place in the country for a bastard and indeed all his motions shewed he was lodged pretty much at large after he had done his deare gets up drops her petticoats down and smooths her apron and handkerchief mr h looked a little silly and taking out some money gave it her with an air indifferent enough bidding her be a good girl and say nothing  had i loved this man it was not in nature for me to have had patience to see the whole scene through i should have broke in and played the jealous princess with a vengeance but that was not the case my pride alone was hurt my heart not and i could easier win upon myself to see how far he would go till i had no uncertainty upon my conscience  the least delicate of all affairs of this sort being now over i retired softly into my closet where i began to consider what i should do my first scheme naturally was to rush in and upbraid them this indeed flattered my present emotions and vexations as it would have given immediate vent to them but on second thoughts not being so clear as to the consequence to be apprehended from such a step i began my discovery still a safer season when dissembly my discovery till a safer season when mr h should have perfected the settlement he had made overtures to me of and which i was not to think such a violent explanation as i was indeed not equal to the management of could possibly forward and might destroy on the other hand the provocation seemed too gross too flagrant not to give me some thoughts of revenge the very start of which idea restored me to perfect composure and delighted as i was with the confused plan of it in my head i was easily mistress enough of myself to support the part of ignorance i had prescribed to myself and as all this circle of reflections was instantly over i stole a tiptoe to the passage door and opening it with a noise passed for having that moment come home and after a short pause as if to pull off my things i opened the door into the dining room where i fund the dowdy blowing the fire and my faithful shepherd walking about the room and wistling as cool and unconcerned as if nothing had happened i think however he had not much to brag of having outdissembled me for i kept up nobly the character of our sex for art and went up to him with the same open air of frankness as i had ever received him he stayed but a little while made some excuse for not being able to stay the evening with me and went out  as for the wench she was now spoiled at least for my servant and scarce eight and forty hours were gone round before her insolence on what had passed betwen mr h and her gave me so fair an occasion to turn her away at a minutes warning that not to have done it would have been the wonder so that he could neither disapprove it nor find in it the least reason to suspect my original motive what became of her afterwards i know not but generous as mr h was he undoubtedly made her amends though i dare answer that he kept up no further commerce with her of that sort as his stooping to such a coarse morsel was only a sudden sally of lust on seeing a wholesome looking buxom country wench and no more strange than hunger or even a whimsical appetites making a fling meal of neckbeef for change of diet  had i considered this escapade of mr h in no more than that light and contented myself with turning away the wench i had thought and acted right but flushed as i was with imaginary wrongs i should have held mr h to have been cheaply off if i had not pushed my revenge farther and repaid him as exactly as could for the soul of me in the same coin  nor was this worthy act of justice long delayed i had it too much at heart mr h had about a fortnight before taken into his service a tenants son just come out the country a very handsome young lad scarce turned of nineteen fresh as a rose well sharped and clear limbed in short a very good excuse for any womans liking even though revenge had been out of the question any woman i say who was disprejudiced and that wit and spirit enough to prefer a point of pleasure to a point of pride  mr h had clapped a livery upon him and his chief employ was after being shewn my lodgings to bring and carry letters or messages between his master and me and as the situation of all kept ladies is not the fittest to inspire respect even to the meanest of mankind and perhaps less of it from the most ignorant i could not help observing that this lad who was i suppose acquainted with my relation to his master by his fellow servants used to eye me in that bashful confused way more expressive more moving and readier caught at by our sex than any other declarations whatever my figure had it seems struck him and modest and innocent as he was he did not himself know that the pleasure he took in looking at me was love or desire but his eyes naturally wanton and now inflamed with passion spoke a great deal more than he durst have imagined they did hitherto indeed i had only taken notice of the comeliness of the youth but without the least design my pride alone would have guarded me from a thought that way had not mr hs condescension with my maid where there was not half the temptation in point of person set me a dangerous example but now i began to look on this stripling as every way a delicious instrument of my designed retaliation upon mr h of an obligation for which i should have made a conscience to die in his debt  in order then to pave the way for the accomplishment of my scheme for two or three times that the young fellow came to me with messages i managed so or without affectation to have him admitted to my bed side or brought to me at my toilet where i was dressing and by carelessly shewing or letting him as if without meaning or design sometimes my bosom rather more bare than it should be sometimes my hair of which i had a very fine head in the natural flow of it while combing sometimes a neat leg that had unfortunately slipt its garter which i made no scruple of tying before him easily gave him the impressions favourable to my purpose which i could perceive to sparkle in his eyes and glow in his cheeks then certain slight squeezes by the hand as i took letters from him did his business completely  when i saw him thus moved and fired for my purpose i inflamed him yet more by asking him several leading questions such as â€œhad he a mistress was she prettier than me could he love such a one as i wasâ€ and the like to all which the blushing simpleton answered to my wish in a strain of perfect nature perfect undebauched innocence but with all the awkwardness and simplicity of country breeding  when i thought i had sufficiently ripened him for the laudable point i had in view one day that i expected him at a particular hour i took care to have the coast clear for the reception i designed him and as i laid it he came to the dining room door tapped at it and in my bidding him come in he did so and shut the door after him i desired him then to bolt it on the inside pretending it would not otherwise keep shut  i was then lying at length upon that very couch the scene of mr hs polite joys in an undress which was with all the art of negligence flowing loose and in a most tempting disorder no stays no hoop no incumbrance whatever on the other hand he stood at a little distance that gave me a full view of a fine featured shapely healthy country lad breathing the sweets of fresh blooming youth his hair which was of a perfect shining black played to his face in natural side curls and was set out with a smart tuckup behind new buckskin breechs that clipping close shewed the shape of a plump well made thigh white stockings garterlaced livery shoulder knot altogether composed a figure of pure flesh and blood and appeared under no disgrace from the lowness of a dress to which a certain spruce neatness seems peculiarly fitted  i bid him come towards me and give me his letter at the same time throwing down carelessly a book i had in my hands he coloured and came within reach of delivering me the letter which he held out awkwardly enough for me to take with his eyes rivetted on my bosom which was through the designed disorder of my handkerchief sufficiently bare and rather than hid  i smiling in his face took the letter and immediately catching hold of his shirt sleeve drew him towards me blushing and almost trembling for surely his extreme bashfulness and utter inexperience called for at least all the advances to encourage him his body was now conveniently inclined toward me and just softly chucking his beardless chin i asked him â€œif he was afraid of a ladyâ€ and with that took and carrying his hands to my breasts i press it tenderly to them they were now finely furnished and raised in flesh so that panting with desire they rose and fell in quick heaves under his touch at this the boys eyes began to lighten with all the fires of inflamed nature and his cheeks flushed with a deep scarlet tonguetied with joy rapture and bashfulness he could not speak but then his looks his emotion sufficiently satisfied me that my train had taken and that i had no disappointment to fear  my lips which i threw in his way so that he could not escape kissing them fixed fired and emboldened him and now glancing my eyes towards that part of his dress which covered the essential object of enjoyment i plainly discovered the swell and commotion there and as i was now too far advanced to stop in so fair a way and was indeed no longer able to contain myself or wait the slower progress of his maiden bashfulness for such it seemed and really was i stole my hands upon his thighs down one of which i could both see and feel a stiff hard body confined by his breeches that my fingers could discover no end to curious then and eager to unfold so alarming a mystery playing as it were with his buttons which were bursting ripe from the active force within those of his waistband and foreflap flew open at a touch when out it started and now disengaged from the shirt i saw with wonder and surprise what not the play thing of a boy not the weapon of a man but a maypole of so enormous a standard that had proportions been observed it must have belonged to a young giant yet i could not without pleasure behold and even venture to feel such a length such a breadth of animated ivory perfectly well turned and fashioned the proud stiffness of which distented its skin whose smooth polish and velvet softness might vie with that of the most delicate of our sex and whose exquisite whiteness was not a little set off by a sprout of black curling hair round the root through the jetty springs of which the fair skin shewed as in a fine evening you may have remarked the clear light through the branchwork of distant trees overtopping the summit of a hill then the broad of blueishcasted incarnate of the head and blue serpentines of its veins altogether composed the most striking assemblage of figure and colours in nature in short it stood an object of terror and delight  but what was yet more surprising the owner of this natural curiosity through the want of occasions in the strictness of his home breeding and the little time he had been in town not having afforded him one was hitherto an absolute stranger in practice at least to the use of all that manhood he was so nobly stocked with and it now fell to my lot to stand his first trial of it if i could resolve to run the risks of its disproportion to that tender part of me which such an oversized machine was very fit to lay in ruins  but it was now of the latest to deliberate for by this time the young fellow over heated with the present objects and too high metled to be longer curbed in by that modesty and awe which had hitherto restrained him ventured under the stronger impulse and instructive promptership of nature alone to slip his hands trembling with eager impetuous desires under my petticoats and seeing i suppose nothing extremely severe in my looks to stop or dash him he feels out and seizes gently the center spot of his ardours oh then the fiery touch of his lingers determines me and my fears melting away before the glowing intolerable heat my thighs disclose of themselves and yield all liberty to his hand and now a favourable movement giving my petticoats a toss the avenue lay too fair too open to be missed he is now upon me i had placed myself with a jerk under him as commodious and open as possible to his attempts which were untoward enough for his machine meeting with no inlet bore and battered stiffly against me in random pushes now above now below now beside his point till burning with impatience from its irritating touches i guided gently with my hand this furious fescue to where my young novice was now to be taught his first lesson of pleasure thus he nicked at length the warm and insufficient orifice but he was made to find no breach impracticable and mine though so often entered was still far from wide enough to take him easily in  by my direction however the head of his unwieldy machine was so critically pointed that feeling him foreright against the tender opening a favourable motion from me met his timely thrust by which the lips of it strenuously dilated gave way to his thus assisted impetuosity so that we might both feel that he had gained a lodgment pursuing then his point he soon by violent and to me most painful piercing thrusts wedges himself at length so far in as to be now tolerably secure of his entrance here he stuck and i now felt such a mixture of pleasure and pain as there is no giving a definition of i dreaded alike his splitting me farther up or his withdrawing i could not bear either to keep or part with him the sense of pain however prevailing from his prodigious size and stiffness acting upon me in those continued rapid thrusts with which he furiously pursued his penetration made me cry out gently â€œoh my dear you hurt meâ€ this was enough to check the tender respectful boy even in his midcareer and he immediately drew out the sweet cause of my complaint whilst his eyes eloquently expressed at once his grief for hurting me and his reluctance at dislodging from quarters of which the warmth and closeness had given him a gust of pleasure that he was now desire mad to satisfy and yet too much a novice not to be afraid of my withholding his relief on account of the pain he had put me to  but i was myself far from being pleased with his having too much regarded my tender exclaims for now more fired with the object before me as it still stood with the fiercest erection unbonneted and displayed its broad vermilion head i first gave the youth a reencouraging kiss which he repaid me with a fervour that seemed at once to thank me and bribe my further compliance and soon replaced myself in a posture to receive at all risk the renewed invasion which he did not delay an instant for being presently remounted i once more felt the smooth hard gristle forcing an entrance which he achieved rather easier than before pained however as i was with his efforts of gaining a complete admission which he was so regardful as to manage by gentle degrees i took care not to complain in the mean time the soft strait passage gradually loosens yields and stretched to its utmost bearing by the stick thick indriven engine sensible at once to the ravishing pleasure of the feel and the pain of the distension let him in about half way when all the most nervous activity he now exerted to further his penetration gained him not an inch of his purpose for whilst he hesitated there the crisis of pleasure overtook him and the close compressure of the warm surrounding flow drew from him the ecstatic gush even before mine was ready to meet it kept up by the pain i had endured in the course of the engagement from the insufferable size of his weapon though it was not as yet in above half its length  i expected then but without wishing it that he would draw but was pleasingly disappointed for he was not to be let off so the well breathed youth hotmettled and flush with genial juices was now fairly in for making me know my driver as soon then as he had made a short pause waking as it were out of the trance of pleasure in which every sense seemed lost for a while whilst with his eyes shut and short quick breathings he had yielded down his maiden tribute he still kept his post yet unsated with enjoyment and solacing in these so new delights till his stiffness which had scarce perceptibly remitted being thoroughly recovered to him who had not once unsheathed he proceeded afresh to cleave and open to himself an entire entry into me which was not a little made easy to him by the balsamic injection with which he had just plentifully moistened the whole internals of the passage redoubling then the active energy of his thrusts favoured by the fervid appetency of my motions the soft oiled wards can no longer stand so effectual a picklock but yield and open him an entrance and now with conspiring nature and my industry strong to aid him he pierces penetrates and at length winning his way inch by inch gets entirely in and finally a home made thrust sheaths it up to the guard on the information of which from the close jointure of our bodies insomuch that the hair on both sides perfectly interweaved and incircled together the eyes of the transported youth sparkled with more joyous fires and all his looks and motions acknowledged excess of pleasure which i now began to share for i felt him in my very vitals i was quite sick with delight stirred beyond bearing with its furious agitations within me and gorged and crammed even to a surfeit thus i lay gasping panting under him till his broken breathings faultering accents eyes twinkling with humid fires lunges more furious and an increased stiffness gave me to hail the approaches of the second period it came and the sweet youth overpowered with the ecstasy died away in my arms melting a flood that shot in genial warmth into the innermost recesses of my body every conduit of which dedicated to that pleasure was on flow to mix with it thus we continued for some instants lost breathless senseless of every thing and in every part but those favourite ones of nature in which all that we enjoyed of life and sensation was now totally concentered  when our mutual trance was a little over and the young fellow had withdrawn that delicious stretcher with which he had most plentifully drowned all thoughts of revenge in the sense of actual pleasure the widened wounded passage refunded a stream of pearly liquids which flowed down my thighs mixed with streaks of blood the marks of the ravage of that monstrous machine of his which had now triumphed over a kind of second maidenhead i stole however my handkerchief to those parts and wiped them as dry as i could whilst he was readjusting and buttoning up  i made him sit down by me and as he had gathered courage from such extreme intimacy he gave me an aftercourse of pleasure in a natural burst of tender gratitude and joy at the new scenes of bliss i had opened to him scenes positively new as he had never before had the least acquaintance with that mysterious mark the cloven stamp of female distinction though nobody better qualified than he to penetrate into its deepest recesses or do it nobler justice but when by certain motions certain unquietness of his hands that wandered not without design i found he languished for satisfying a curiosity natural enough to view and handle those parts which attract and concenter the warmest force of imagination charmed as i was to have any occasion of obliging and humouring his young desires i suffered him to proceed as he pleased without check or control to the satisfaction of them  easily then reading in my eyes the full permission of myself to all his wishes he scarce pleased himself more than me when having insinuated his hand under my petticoat and shift he presently removed those bars to the sight by slily lifting them upwards under favour of a thousand kisses which he thought perhaps necessary to divert my attention from what he was about all my drapery being now rolled up to my waist i threw myself into such a posture upon the couch as gave up to him in full view the whole region of delight and all the luxurious landscape around it the transported youth devoured every thing with his eyes and tried with his fingers to lay more open to his sight the secrets of that dark and delicious deep he opens the folding lips the softness of which yielding entry to any thing of a hard body close round it and oppose the sight and feeling further meets with and wonder at a soft fleshy excrescence which limber and relaxed after the late enjoyment now grew under the touch and examination of his fiery fingers more and more stiff and considerable till the titillating ardours of that so sensible part made me sigh as if he had hurt me on which he withdrew his curious probing fingers asking me pardon as it were in a kiss that rather increased the flame there  novelty ever makes the strongest impressions and in pleasures especially no wonder then that he was swallowed up in raptures of admiration of things so interesting by their nature and now seen and handled for the first time on my part i was richly overpaid for the pleasure i gave him in that of examining the power of those objects thus abandoned to him naked and free to his loosest wish over the artless natural stripling his eyes streaming fire his cheeks glowing with a florid red his fervid frequent sighs whilst his hands convulsively squeezed opened pressed together again the lips and sides of that deep flesh wound or gently twitched the overgrowing moss and all proclaimed the excess the riot of joys in having his wantonness thus humoured but he did not long abuse my patience for the objects before him had now put him by all his and coming out with that formidable machine of his he lets the fury loose and pointing it directly to the poutinglip mouth that bid him sweet defiance in dumb shew squeezes in his head and driving with refreshed rage breaks in and plugs up the whole passage of that soft pleasureconduit pipe where he makes all shake again and put once more all within me into such an uproar as nothing could still but a fresh inundation from the very engine of those flames as well as from all the springs with which nature floats that reservoir of joy when risen to its floodmark  i was now so bruised so battered so spent with this overmatch that i could hardly stir or raise myself but lay palpitating till the ferment of my senses subsiding by degrees and the hour striking at which i was obliged to dispatch my young man i tenderly advised him of the necessity there was for parting at which i felt so much displeasure as he could do who seemed eagerly disposed to keep the field and to enter on a fresh action but the danger was too great and after some hearty kisses of leave and recommendations of secrecy and discretion i forced myself to send him away not without assurances of seeing him again to the same purpose as soon as possible and thrust a guinea into his hands not more less being too flush of money a suspicion or discovery might arise from thence having everything to fear from the dangerous indiscretion of that age in which young fellows would be too irresistible too charming if we had not that terrible fault to guard against  giddy and intoxicated as i was with such satiating draughts of pleasure i still lay on the couch supinely stretched out in a delicious languor diffused over all my limbs hugging myself for being thus revenged to my hearts content and that in a manner so precisely alike and on the identical spot in which i had received the supposed injury no reflections on the consequences ever once perplexed me nor did i make myself one single reproach for having by this step completely entered myself into a profession more decried than disused i should have held it ingratitude to the pleasure i had received to have repented of it and since i was now over the bar i thought by plunging head and ears into the stream i was hurried away by to drown all sense of shame or reflection  whilst i was thus making these laudable dispositions and whispering to myself a kind of tacit vow of incontinency enters mr h the consciousness of what i had been doing deepened yet the glowing of my cheeks flushed with the warmth of the late action which joined to the piquant air of my dishabile drew from mr h a compliment on my looks which he was proceeding to bask the sincerity of with proofs and that with so brisk an action as made me tremble for fear of a discovery from the condition those parts were left in from their late severe handling the orifice dilated and inflamed the lips swollen with their uncommon distension the ringlets pressed down crushed and uncurled with the over flowing moisture that had wet everything round it in short the different feel and state of things would hardly have passed upon one of mr hs nicety and experience unaccounted for but by the real cause but here the woman saved me i pretended a violent disorder of my head and a feverish heat that indisposed me too much to receive his embraces he gave in to this and good naturedly desisted soon after an old lady coming in made a third very apropos for the confusion i was in and mr h after bidding me take care of myself and recommending me to my repose left me much at ease and relieved by his absence  in the close of the evening i took care to have prepared for me a warm bath of aromatik and sweet herbs in which having fully laved and solaced myself i came out voluptuously refreshed in body and spirit  the next morning waking pretty early after a nights perfect rest and composure it was not without some dread and uneasiness that i thought of what innovation that tender soft system of mine might have sustained from the shock of a machine so sized for its destruction  struck with this apprehension i scarce dared to carry my hand thither to inform myself of the state and posture of things  but i was soon agreeably cured of my fears  the silky hair that covered round the borders now smoothed and repruned had resumed its wonted curl and trimness the fleshy pouting lips that had stood the brunt of the engagement were no longer swollen or moisturedrenched and neither they nor the passage into which they opened that had suffered so great a dilation betrayed any the least alteration outwardly or inwardly to the most curious research notwithstanding the laxity that naturally follows the warm bath  this continuation of that grateful stricture which is in us to the men the very jet of their pleasure i owed it seems to a happy habit of body juicy plump and furnished towards the texture of those parts with a fullness of soft springy flesh that yielding sufficiently as it does to almost any distension soon recovers itself so as to retighten that strict compression of its mantlings and folds which form the sides of the passage wherewith it so tenderly embraces and closely clips any foreign body introduced into it such as my exploring finger then was  finding then every thing in due tone and order i remember my fears only to make a jest of them to myself and now palpably mistress of any size of man and triumphing in my double achievement of pleasure and revenge i abandoned myself entirely to the ideas of all the delight i had swam in i lay stretching out glowingly alive all over and tossing with burning impatience for the renewal of joys that had sinned but in a sweet excess nor did i lose my longing for about ten in the morning according to expectation will my new humble sweetheart came with a message from his master mr h to know how i did i had taken care to send my maid on an errand into the city that i was sure would take up time enough and from the people of the house i had nothing to fear as they were plain good sort of folks and wise enough to mind no more other peoples business than they could well help  all dispositions then made not forgetting that of lying in bed to receive him when he was entered the door of my bed chamber a latch that i governed by a wire descended and secured it  i could not but observe that my young minion was as much spruced out as could be expected from one in his condition a desire of pleasing that could not be indifferent to me since it proved that i pleased him which i assure you was now a point i was not above having in view  his hair trimly dressed clean linen and above all a hale ruddy wholesome country look made him out as pretty a piece of womans meat as you could see and i should have thought any one much out of taste that could not have made a hearty meal of such a morsel as nature seemed to have designed for the highest diet of pleasure  and why should i here suppress the delight i received from this amiable creature in remarking each artless look each motion of pure indissembled nature betrayed by his wanton eyes or shewing transparently the glow and suffusion of blood through his fresh clear skin whilst even his stury rustic pressure wanted not their peculiar charm oh but say you this was a young fellow of too low a rank of life to deserve so great a display may be so but was my condition strictly considered one jot more exalted or had i really been much above him did not his capacity of giving such exquisite pleasure sufficiently raise and enoble him to me at least let who would for me cherish respect and reward the painters the statuarys the musicians art in proportion to the delight taken in them but at my age and with my taste for pleasure a taste strongly constitutional to me the talent of pleasing with which nature has endowed a handsome person formed to me the greatest of all merits compared to which the vulgar prejudices in favour of titles dignities honours and the like held a very low rank indeed nor perhaps would the beauties of the body be so much affected to be held cheap were they in their nature to be bought and delivered but for me whose natural philosophy all resided in the favourite center of sense and who was ruled by its powerful instinct in taking pleasure by its right handle i could scarce have made a choice more to my purpose  mr hs loftier qualifications of birth fortune and sense laid me under a sort of subjection and constraint that were far from making harmony in the concert of love nor had he perhaps thought me worth softening that superiority to but with this lad i was more on the level which love delights in  we may say what we please but those we can be the easiest and freest with are ever those we like not to say love the best  with this stripling all whose art of love was the action of it i could without check of awe or restraint give a loose to jay and execute every scheme of dalliance my fond fancy might put me on in which he was in every sense a most exquisite companion and now my great pleasure lay in humouring all the petulances all the wanton frolic of a raw novice just fledged and keen on the burning scent of his game but unbroken to the sport and to carry on the figure who could better read the wood than he or stand fairer for the heart of the hunt  he advanced then to my bed side and whilst he faultered out his message i could observe his colour rise and his eyes lighten with joy in seeing me in a situation as favourable to his loosest wishes as if he had bespoke the play  i smiled and put out my hand towards him which he kneeled down to a politeness taught him by love alone that great master of it and greedily kissed after exchanging a few confused questions and answers i asked him if he would come to bed to me for the little time i could venture to detain him this was just asking a person dying with hunger to feast upon the dish on earth the most to his palate accordingly without further reflection his clothes were off in an instant when blushing still more at this new liberty he got under the bed clothes i held up to receive him and was now in bed with a woman for the first time in his life  here began the usual tender preliminaries as delicious perhaps as the crowning act of enjoyment itself which they often beget an impatience of that makes pleasure destructive of itself by hurrying on the final period and closing that scene of bliss in which the actors are generally too well pleased with their parts not to wish them an eternity of duration  when we had sufficiently graduated our advances towards the main point by toying kissing clipping feeling my breasts now round and plump feeling that part of me i might call a furnace mouth from the prodigious intense heat his fiery touches had rekindled there my young sportsman emboldened by the very freedom he could wish wontonly takes my hand and carries it to that enormous machine of his that stood with a stiffness a hardness an upward bend of erection and which together with it bottom dependence the inestimable bulse of ladies jewels formed a grand showout of goods indeed then its dimensions mocking either grasp or span almost renewed my terrors  i could not conceive how or by what means i could take or put such a bulk out of sight i stroked it gently on which the mutinous rogue seemed to swell and gather a new degree of fierceness and insolence so that finding it grew not to be trifled with any longer i prepared for rubbers in good earnest  slipping then a pillow under me that i might give him the fairest play i guided officiously with my hand this furious battering ram whose ruby head presenting nearest the resemblance of a heart i applied to its proper mark which lay as finely elevated as we could wish my hips being borne up and my thighs at their utmost extension the gleamy warmth that shot from it made him feel that he was at the mouth of the indraught and driving fore right the powerfully divided lips of that pleasurethirsty channel received him he hesitated a little then settled well in the passage he makes his way up the straights of it with a difficulty nothing more than pleasing widening as he went so as to distend and smooth each soft furrow our pleasure increasing deliciously in proportion to our points of mutual touch increased in that so vital part of me which i had now taken him all indriven and completely sheathed and which crammed as it was stretched splitting ripe gave it so gratefully straight an accommodation so strict a fold a suction so fierce that gave and took unutterable delight we had now reached the closest point of union but when he beckened to come on the fiercer as if i had ben actuated by a fear of losing him in the height of my fury i twist my legs round his naked loins the flesh of which so firm so springy to the touch quivered again under the pressure and now i had him every way encircled and begirt and having drawn him home to me i kept him fast there as if i had sought to unite bodies with him at that point this bred a pause of action a pleasure stop whilst that delicate glutton my nether mouth as full as it could hold kept palating with exquisite relish the morsel that so deliciously ingorged it but nature could not long endure a pleasure that it so highly provoked without satisfying it pursuing then its darling end the battery recommenced with redoubled exertion nor lay i inactive on my side but encountering him with all the impetuosity of motion i was mistress of the downy cloth of our meeting mount was now of real use to break the violence of the tilt and soon indeed the highwrought agitation the sweet urgency of this toandfro friction raised the titillation on me to its height so that finding myself on the point of going and loath to leave the tender partner of my joys behind me i employed all the forwarding motions and arts my experience suggested to me to promote his keeping me company to our journeys end i not only then tightened the pleasuregirth round my restless inmate by a secret spring of friction and compression that obeys the will in those parts but stole my hand softly to that store bag of natures prime sweets which is so pleasingly attached to its conduit pipe from which we receive them there feeling and most gently indeed squeezing those tender globular reservoirs the magic touch took instant effect quickened and brought on upon the spur the symptoms of that sweet agony the melting moment of dissolution when pleasure dies by pleasure and the mysterious engine of it overcomes the titillation it has raised in those parts by plying them with the stream of a warm liquid that in itself the highest of all titillations and which they thirstily express and draw in like the hot natured leach which to cool itself tenaciously extracts all the moisture within its sphere of execution chiming then to me with exquisite consent as i melted away his oily balsamic injection mixing deliciously with the sluices in flow from me sheathed and blunted all the stings of pleasure whilst a voluptuous languor possest and still maintained us motionless and fast locked in one anothers arms alas that these delights should be no longerlived for now the point of pleasure unedged by enjoyment and all the brisk sensations flattened upon us resigned us up to the cool cares of insipid life disengaging myself then from his embrace i made him sensible of the reasons there were for his present leaving me on which though reluctantly he put on his clothes with as little expedition however as he could help wantonly interrupting himself between whiles with kisses touches and embraces i could not refuse myself to yet he happily returned to his master before he was missed but at taking leave i forced him for he had sentiments enough to refuse it to receive money enough to buy a silver watch that great article of subaltern finery which he at length accepted of as a remembrance he was carefully to preserve of my affections  and here madam i ought perhaps to make you an apology for this minute detail of things that dwelt so strongly upon my memory after so deep an impression but besides that this intrigue bred one great revolution in my life which historical truth requires i should not sink from you may i not presume that so exalted a pleasure ought not to be ungratefully forgotten or suppressed by me because i found it in a character in low life where by the by it is oftener met with purer and more unsophisticated than among the false ridiculous refinements with which the great suffer themselves to be so grossly cheated by their pride the great than whom there exist few amongst those they call the vulgar who are more ignorant of or who cultivate less the art of living than they do they i say who for ever mistake things the most foreign to the nature of pleasure itself whose capital favourite object is enjoyment of beauty wherever that rare incaluable gift is found without distinction of birth or station  as love never had so now revenge had no longer any share in my commerce in this handsome youth the sole pleasures of enjoyment were now the link i held to him by for though nature had done such great maters for him in his outward form and especially in that superb piece of furniture she had so liberally enriched him with though he was thus qualified to give the senses their richest feast still there was something more wanting to create in me and constitute the passion of love yet will had very good qualities too gentle tractable and above all grateful silentious even to a fault he spoke at any time very little but made it up emphatically with action and to do him justice he never gave me the least reason to complain either of any tendency to encroach upon me for the liberties i allowed him or of his indiscretion in blabbing them there is then a fatality in love or have loved him i must for he was really a treasure a bit for the bonne bouche of a duchess and to say the truth my liking for him was so extreme that it was distinguishing very nicely to deny that i loved him  my happiness however with him did not last long but found an end from my own imprudent neglect after having taken even superfluous precautions against a discovery our success in repeated meetings emboldened me to omit the barely necessary ones about a month after our first intercourse one fatal morning the season mr h rarely or never visited me in i was in my closet where my toilet stood in nothing but my shift a bed gown and under petticoat will was with me and both ever too well disposed to baulk an opportunity for my part a whim a wanton toy had just taken me and i had challenged my man to execute it on the spot who hesitated not to comply with my humour i was set in the arm chair my shift and petticoat up my thighs wide spread and mounted over the arms of the chair presenting the fairest mark to wills drawn weapon which he stood in act to plunge into me when having neglected to secure the chamber door and that of the closet standing ajar mr h stole in upon us before either of us was aware and saw us precisely in these convicting attitudes  i gave a great scream and dropped my petticoat the thunderstruck lad stood trembling and pale waiting his sentence of death mr h looked sometimes at one sometimes at the other with a mixture of indignation and scorn and without saying a word spun upon his heel and went out  as confused as i was i heard him very distinctly turn the key and lock the chamber door upon us so that there was no escape but through the dining room where he himself was walking about with distempered strides stamping in a great chafe and doubtless debating what he would do with us  in the mean time poor william was frightened out of his senses and as much need as i had of spirits myself i was obliged to employ them all to keep his a little up the misfortune i had now brought upon him endeared him the more to me and i could have joyfully suffered any punishment he had not shared in i watered plentifully with my tears the face of the frightened youth who sat not having strength to stand as cold and as lifeless as a statue  presently mr h comes in to us again and made us go before him into the dining room trembling and dreading the issue mr hsat down on a chair whilst we stood like criminals under examination and beginning with me asked me with an even firm tone of voice neither soft nor severe but cruelly indifferent what i could say for myself for having abused him in so unworthy a manner with his own servant too and how he had deserved this of me  without adding to the guilt of my infidelity that of an audacious defence of it in the old style of a common kept miss my answer was modest and often interrupted by my tears in substance as follows â€œthat i never had a single thought of wronging himâ€ which was true â€œtill i had seen him taking the last liberties with my servant wenchâ€ here he coloured prodigiously â€œand that my resentment at that which i was overawed from giving vent to by complaints or explanations with him had driven me to a course that i did not pretend to justify but that as to the young man he was entirely faultless for that in the view of making him the instrument of my revenge i had down right seduced him to what he had done and therefore hoped whatever he determined about me he would distinguish between the guilty and the innocent and that for the rest i was entirely at his mercyâ€  mr h on hearing what i said hung his head a little but instantly recovering himself he said to me as near as i can retain to the following purpose  â€œmadam i owe shame to myself and confess you have fairly turned the tables upon me it is not with one of your cast of breeding and sentiments that i allow you so much reason on your side as great difference of the provocations be it sufficient that i should enter into a discussion of the very to have changed my resolution in consideration of what you reproach me with and i own too that your clearing that rascal there is fair and honest in you renew with you i cannot the affront is too gross i give you a weeks warning to get out of these lodgings whatever i have given you remains to you and as i never intend to see you more the landlord will pay you fifty pieces on my account with which and every debt paid i hope you will own i do not leave you in a worse condition than what i took you up in or that you deserve of me blame yourself only that it is no betterâ€  then without giving me time to reply he addressed himself to the young fellow  â€œfor you spark i shall for your fathers sake take care of you the town is no place for such an easy fool as thou art and tomorrow you shall set out under the charge of one of my men well recommended in my name to your father not to let you return and be spoild hereâ€  at these words he went out after my vainly attempting to stop him by throwing myself at his feet he shook me off though he seemed greatly moved too and took will away with him who i dare swear thought himself very cheaply off  i was now once more adrift and left upon my own hands by a gentleman whom i certainly did not deserve and all the letters arts friends entreaties that i employed within the week of grace in my lodging could never win on him so much as to see me again he had irrevocably pronounced my doom and submission to it was my only part soon after he married a lady of birth and fortune to whom i have heard he proved an irreproachable husband  as for poor will he was immediately sent down to the country to his father who was an easy farmer where he was not four months before an innkeepers buxom young widow with a very good stock both in money and trade fancied and perhaps preacquainted with his secret excellencies married him and i am sure there was at least one good foundation for their living happily together  though i should have been charmed to see him before he went such measures were taken by mr hs orders that it was impossible otherwise i should certainly have endeavoured to detain him in town and would have spared neither offers nor expense to have procured myself the satisfaction of keeping him with me he had such powerful holds upon my inclinations as were not easily to be shaken off or replaced as to my heart it was quite out of the question glad however i was from my soul that nothing worse and as things turned out nothing better could have happened to him  as to mr h though views of conveniency made me at first exert myself to regain his affection i was giddy and thoughtless enough to be much easier reconciled to my failure than i ought to have been but as i never had loved him and his leaving me gave me a sort of liberty that i had often longed for i was soon comforted and flattering myself that the stock of youth and beauty i was going to trade with could hardly fail of procuring me a maintenance i saw myself under the necessity of trying my fortune with them rather with pleasure and gaiety than with the least idea of despondency  in the mean time several of my acquaintances among the sisterhood who had soon got wind of my misfortune flocked to insult me with their malicious consolations most of them had long envied me the affluence and splendour i had been maintained in and though there was scarce one of them that did not at least deserve to be in my case and would probably sooner or later come to it it was equally easy to remark even in their affected pity their secret pleasure at seeing me thus discarded and their secret grief that it was no worse with me unaccountable malice of the human heart and which is not confined to the class of life they were of  but as the time approached for me to come to some resolution how to dispose of myself and i was considering round where to shift my quarters to mrs cole a middle aged discreet sort of woman who had been brought into my acquaintance by one of the misses that visited me upon learning my situation came to offer her cordial advice and service to me and as i had always taken to her more than to any of my female acquaintances i listened the easier to her proposals and as it happened i could not have put myself into worse or into better hands in all london into worse because keeping a house of conveniency there were no lengths in lewdness she would not advise me to go in compliance with her customers no schemes or pleasure or even unbounded debauchery she did not take even a delight in promoting into a better because nobody having had more experience of the wicked part of the town than she had was fitter to advise and guard one against the worst dangers of our profession and what was rare to be met with in those of hers she contented herself with a moderate living profit upon her industry and good offices and had nothing of their greedy rapacious turn she was really too a gentlewoman born and bred but through a train of accidents reduced to this course which she pursued partly through necessity partly through choice as never woman delighted more in encouraging a brisk circulation of the trade for the sake of the trade itself or better understood all the mysteries and refinements of it than she did so that she was consummately at the top of her profession and dealt only with customers of distinction to answer the demands of whom she kept a competent number of her daughters in constant recruit so she called those whom their youth and personal charms recommended to her adoption and management several of whom by her means and through her tuition and instructions succeeded very well in the world  this useful gentlewoman upon whose protection i now threw myself having her reasons of state respecting mr h for not appearing too much in the thing herself sent a friend of hers on the day appointed for my removal to conduct me to my new lodgings at a brushmakers in eâ€â€ street covent garden the very next door to her own house where she had no conveniences to lodge me herself lodgings that by having been for several successions tenanted by ladies of pleasures the landlord of them was familiarized to their ways and provided the rent was paid every thing else was as easy and commodious as one could desire  the fifty guineas promised me by mr h at his parting with me having been duly paid me all my clothes and moveables chested up which were at least of two hundred pounds value i had them conveyed into a coach where i soon followed them after taking a civil leave of the landlord and his family with whom i had never lived in a degree of familiarity enough to regret the removal but still the very circumstance of its being a removal drew tears from me i left too a letter of thanks for mr h from whom i concluded myself as i really was irretrievably separated  my maid i had discharged the day before not only because i had her of mr h but that i suspected her of having some how or other been the occasion of his discovering me in revenge perhaps for my not having trusted her with him  we soon got to my lodgings which though not so handsomely furnished nor so showy as those i left were to the full as convenient and at half price though on the first floor my trunks were safely landed and stowed in my apartments where my neighbour and now gouvernante mrs cole was ready with my landlord to receive me to whom she took care to set me out in the most favourable light that of one from whom there was the clearest reason to expect the regular payment of his rent all the cardinal virtues attributed to me would not have had half the weight of that recommendation alone  i was now settled in lodgings of my own abandoned to my own conduct and turned loose upon the town to sink or swim as i could manage with the current of it and what were the consequences together with the number of adventures which befell me in the exercise of my new profession will compose the mater of another letter for surely it is high time to put a period to this  i am  madam  yours etc etc etc  the end of the first letter    letter the second  madam  if i have delayed the sequel of my history it has been purely to allow myself a little breathing time not without some hopes that instead of pressing me to a continuation you would have acquitted me of the task of pursuing a confession in the course of which my selfesteem has so many wounds to sustain  i imagined indeed that you would have been cloyed and tired with uniformity of adventures and expressions inseparable from a subject of this sort whose bottom or groundwork being in the nature of things eternally one and the same whatever variety of forms and modes the situations are susceptible of there is no escaping a repetition of near the same images the same figures the same expressions with this further inconvenience added to the disgust it creates that the words joys ardours transports extasies and the rest of those pathetic terms so congenial to so received in the practice of pleasure flatten and lose much of their due spirit and energy by the frequency they indispensably recur with in a narrative of which that practice professedly composes the whole basis i must therefore trust to the candour of your judgment for your allowing for the disadvantage i am necessarily under in that respect and to your imagination and sensibility the pleasing taks of repairing it by their supplements where my descriptions flag or fail the one will readily place the pictures i present before your eyes the other give life to the colours where they are dull or worn with too frequent handling  what you say besides by way of encouragement concerning the extreme difficulty of continuing so long in one strain in a mean tempered with taste between the revoltingness of gross rank and vulgar expressions and the ridicule of mincing metaphors and affected circumlocutions is so sensible as well as goodnatured that you greatly justify me to myself for my compliance with a curiosity that is to be satisfied so extremely at my expense  resuming now where i broke off in my last i am in my way to remark to you that it was late in the evening before i arrived at my lodgings and mrs cole after helping me to range and secure my things spent the whole evening with me in my apartment where we supped together in giving me the best advice and instruction with regard to the new stage of my profession i was now to enter upon and passing thus from a private devotee to pleasure into a public one to become a more general good with all the advantages requisite to put my person out to use either for interest or pleasure or both â€œbut thenâ€ she observed â€œas i was a kind of new face upon the town that is was an established rule and myster of trade for me to pass for a maid and dispose of myself as such on the first good occasion without prejudice however to such diversions as i might have a mind to in the interim for that nobody could be a greater enemy than she was to the losing of time that she would in the mean time do her best to find out a proper person and would undertake to manage this nice point for me if i would accept of her aid and advice to such good purpose that in the loss of a fictitious maidenhead i should reap all the advantages of a native oneâ€  as too great a delicacy of sentiments did not extremely belong to my character at that time i confess against myself that i perhaps too readily closed with a proposal which my candor and ingenuity gave me some repugnance to but not enough to contradict the intention of one to whom i had now thoroughly abandoned the direction of all my steps for mrs cole had i do not know how unless by one of those unaccountable invincible sympathies that nevertheless from the strongest links especially of female friendship won and got entire possession of me on her side she pretended that a strict resemblance she fancied she saw in me to an only daughter whom she had lost at my age was the first motive of her taking to me so affectionately as she did it might be so there exist a slender motives of attachment that gathering force from habit and liking have proved often more solid and durable than those founded on much stronger reasons but this i know that though i had no other acquaintance with her than seeing her at my lodgings when i lived with mr h where she had made errands to sell me some millinery ware she had by degrees insinuated herself so far into my confidence that i threw myself blindly into her hands and came at length to regard love and obey her implicitly and to do her justice i never experienced at her hands other than a sincerity of tenderness and care for my interest hardly heard of in those of her profession we parted that night after having settled a perfect unreserved agreement and the next morning mrs cole came and took me with her to her house for the first time  here at the first sight of things i found every thing breathe an air of decency modesty and order  in the outer parlour or rather shop sat three young women rather demurely employed on millinery work which was the cover of a traffic in more precious commodities but three beautifuller creatures could hardly be seen two of them were extremely fair the eldest not above nineteen and the third much about that age was a piquant brunette whose black sparking eyes and perfect harmony of features and shape left her nothing to envy in her fairer companions their dress too had the more design in it the less it appeared to have being in a taste of uniform correct neatness and elegant simplicity these were the girls that composed the small domestic flock which my governess trained up with surprising order and management considering the giddy wildness of young girls once got upon the loose but then she never continued any in her house whom after a due noviciate she found untractable or unwilling to comply with the rules of it thus she had insensibly formed a little family of love in which the members found so sensibly their account in a rare alliance of pleasure and interest and of a necessary outward decency with unbounded secret liberty that mrs cole who had picked them as much for their temper as their beauty governed them with ease to herself and them too  to these pupils then of hers whom she had prepared she presented me as a new boarder and one that was to be immediately admitted to all the intimacies of the house upon which these charming girls gave me all the marks of a welcome reception and indeed of being perfectly pleased with my figure that i could possibly expect from any of my own sex but they had been effectually brought to sacrifice all jealousy or competition of charms to a common interest and considered me a partner that was bringing no despicable stock of goods into the trade of the house they gathered round me viewed me on all sides and as my admission into this joyous troop made a little holiday the shew of work was laid aside and mrs cole giving me up with special recommendation to their caresses and entertainment went about her ordinary business of the house  the sameness of our sex age profession and views soon creased as unreserved a freedom and intimacy as if we had been for years acquainted they took and shewed me the house their respective apartments which were furnished with every article of convenience and luxury and above all a spacious drawingroom where a select revelling band usually met in general parties of pleasure the girls supping with their sparks and acting their wanton pranks with unbounded licentiousness whilst a defiance of awe modesty or jealousy were their standing rules by which according to the principles of their society whatever pleasure was lost on the side of sentiment was abundantly made up to the senses in the poignancy of variety and the charms of ease and luxury the authors and supporters of this secret institution would in the height of their humour style themselves the restorers of the golden age and its simplicity of pleasures before their innocence became so unjustly branded with the names of guilt and shame  as soon then as the evening began and the shew of a shop was shut the academy opened the mask of mockmodesty was completely taken off and all the girls delivered over to their respective calls of pleasure or interest with their men and none of that sex was promiscuously admitted but only such as mrs cole was previously satisfied with their character and discretion in short this was the safest politest and at the same time the most thorough house of accommodation in town every thing being conducted so that decency made no intrenchment upon the most libertine pleasures in the practice of which too the choice familiars of the house had found the secret so rare and difficult of reconciling even all the refinements of taste and delicacy with the most gross and determinate gratifications of sensuality  after having consumed the morning in the dear endearments and instructions of my new acquaintance we went to dinner when mrs cole presiding at the head of her club gave me the first idea of her management and address in inspiring these girls with so sensible a love and respect for her there was no stiffness no reserve no airs of pique or little jealousies but all was unaffectedly gay cheerful and easy  after dinner mrs cole seconded by the young ladies acquainted me that there was a chapter to be held that night in form for the ceremony of my reception into the sisterhood and in which with all due reserve to my maidenhead that was to be occasionally cooked up for the first proper chapman i was to undergo a ceremonial of initiation they were sure i should not be displeased with  embarked as i was and moreover captivated with the charms of my new companions i was too much prejudiced in favour of any proposal they could make to as much as hesitate an assent which therefore readily giving in the style of a carte blanche i received fresh kisses of compliment from them all in approval of my docility and good nature now i was â€œa sweet girl i came into things with a good grace i was not affectedly coy i should be the pride of the houseâ€ and the like  this point thus adjusted the young women left mrs cole to talk and concert matters with me when she explained to me that â€œi should be introduced that very evening to four of her best friends one of whom she had according to the custom of the house favoured with the preference of engaging me in the first party of pleasureâ€ assuring me at the same time â€œthat they were all young gentlemen agreeable in their persons and unexceptionable in every respect that united and holding together by the band of common pleasures they composed the chief support of her house and made very liberal presents to the girls that pleased and humoured them so that they were properly speaking the founders and patrons of this little seraglio not but that she had at proper seasons other customers to deal with whom she stood less upon punctilio with than with these for instance it was not on one of them she could attempt to pass me for a maid they were not only too knowing too much townbred to bite at such a bait but they were such generous benefactors to her that it would be unpardonable to think of itâ€  amidst all the flutter and emotion which this promise of pleasure for such i conceived it stirred up in me i preserved so much of the woman as to feign just reluctance enough to make some merit of sacrificing it to the influence of my patroness whom i likewise still in character reminded of it perhaps being right for me to go home and dress in favour of my first impressions  but mrs cole in opposition to this assured me â€œthat the gentlemen i should be presented to were by their rank and taste of things infinitely superior to the being touched with any glare of dress or ornaments such slick women rather confound and overlay than set off their beauty with that these veteran voluptuaries knew better than not to hold them in the highest contempt they with whom the pure native charms alone could pass current and who would at any time leave a sallow washy painted duchess on her own hands for a ruddy healthy firm fleshed country maid and as for my part that nature had done enough for me to set me above owing the least favour to artâ€ concluding withal that for the instant occasion there was no dress like an undress  i thought my governess too good a judge of these matters not to be easily overruled by her after which she went on preaching very pathetically the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance to all those arbitrary tastes of pleasure which are by some styled the refinements and by others the depravations of it between whom it was not the business of a simple girl who was to profit by pleasing to decide but to conform to whilst i was edifying by these wholesome lessons tea was brought in and the young ladies returning joined company with us  after a great deal of mixed chat frolic and humour one of them observing that there would be a good deal of time on and before the assembly hour proposed that each girl should entertain the company with that critical period of her personal history in which she first exchanged the maiden state for womanhood the proposal was approved with only one restriction of mrs cole that she on account of her age and i on account of my titular maidenhead should be excused at least till i had undergone the forms of the house this obtained me a dispensation and the promotress of this amusement was desired to begin  her name was emily a girl fair to excess and whose limbs were if possible too well made since their plump fulness was rather to the prejudice of that delicate slimness required by the nicer judges of beauty her eyes were blue and streamed inexpressible sweetness and nothing could be prettier than her mouth and lips which closed over a range of the evenest and whitest teeth thus she began  â€œneither my extraction nor the most critical adventure of my life is sublime enough to impeach me of any vanity in the advancement of the proposal you have approved of my father and mother were and for aught i know are still farmers in the country not above forty miles from town their barbarity to me in favour of a son on whom alone they vouchsafed to bestow their tenderness had a thousand times determined me to fly their house and throw myself on the wide world but at length an accident forced me on this desperate attempt at the age of fifteen i had broken a chinabowl the pride and idol of both their hearts and as an unmerciful beating was the least i had to depend on at their hands in the silliness of these tender years i left the house and at all adventures took the road to london how my loss was resented i do not know for till this instant i have not heard a syllable about them my whole stock was two broad pieces of my godmothers a few shillings silver shoebuckles and a silver thimble thus equipped with no more clothes than the ordinary ones i had on my back and frightened at every foot or noise i heard behind me i hurried on and i dare sweare walked a dozen miles before i stopped through mere weariness and fatigue at length i sat down on a style wept bitterly and yet was still rather under increased impressions of fear on the account of my escape which made me dread worse than death the going back to my unnatural parents refreshed by this little repose and relieved by my tears i was proceeding onward when i was overtaken by a sturdy country lad who was going to london to see what he could do for himself there and like me had given his friends the slip he could not be above seventeen was ruddy well featured enough with uncombed flaxen hair a little flapped hat kersey frock yarn stockings in short a perfect plough boy i saw him come whistling behind me with a bundle tied to the end of a stick his travelling equipage we walked by one another for some time without speaking at length we joined company and agreed to keep together till we got to our journeys end what his designs or ideas were i know not the innocence of mine i can solemnly protest  â€œas night drew on it became us to look out for some inn or shelter to which perplexity another was added and that was what we should say for ourselves if we were questioned after some puzzle the young fellow started a proposal which i thought the finest that could be and what was that why that we should pass for husband and wife i never dreamed of consequences we came presently after having agreed on this notable experience to one of those hedge accommodations for foot passengers at the door of which stood an old crazy beldam who seeing us trudge by invited us to lodge there glad of any cover we went in and my fellow traveller taking all upon him called for what the house afforded and we supped together as man and wife which considering our figures and ages could not have passed on any one but such as any thing could pass on but when bedtime came on we had neither of us the courage to contradict our first account of ourselves and what was extremely pleasant the young lad seemed as perplexed as i was how to evade lying together which was so natural for the state we had pretended to whilst we were in this quandary the landlady takes the candles and lights us to our apartment through a long yard at the end of which it stood separate from the body of the house thus we suffered ourselves to be conducted without saying a word in opposition to it and there in a wretched room with a bed answerable we were left to pass the night together as a thing quite of course for my part i was so incredibly innocent as not even to think much more harm of going into bed with the young man than with one of our dairy wenches nor had he perhaps any other notions than those of innocence till such a fair occasion put them into his head  â€œbefore either of us undressed however he put out the candle and the bitterness of the weather made it a kind of necessity for me to go into bed slipping then my clothes off i crept under the bedclothes where i found the young stripling already nestled and the touch of his warm flesh rather pleased than alarmed me i was indeed too much disturbed with the novelty of my condition to be able to sleep but then i had not the least thought of harm but oh how powerful are the instincts of nature how little is there wanting to set them in action the young man sliding his arm under my body drew me gently towards him as if to keep himself and me warmer and the heat i felt from joining our breasts kindled another that i had hitherto never felt and was even then a stranger to the nature of emboldened i suppose by my easiness he ventured to kiss me and i insensibly returned it without knowing the consequence of returning it for on this encouragement he slipped his hand all down from my breast to that part of me where the sense of feeling is so exquisitely critical as i then experienced by its instant taking fire upon the touch and glowing with a strange tickling heat there he pleased himself and me by feeling till growing a little too bold with me he hurt me and made me complain then he took my hand which he guided not unwillingly on my side between the twist of his closed thighs which were extremely warm there he lodged and pressed it till raising it by degrees he made me feel the proud distinction of his sex from mine i was frightened at the novelty and drew back my hand yet pressed and spurred on by sensations of a strange pleasure i could not help asking him what that was for he told me he would shew me if i would let him and without waiting for my answer which he prevented by stopping my mouth with kisses i was far from disrelishing he got upon me and inserting one of his thighs between mine opened them so as to make way for himself and fixed me to his purpose whilst i was so much out of my usual sense so subdued by the present power of a new one that between far and desire i lay utter passive till the piercing pain rouzed and made me cry out but it was too late he was too firm fixed in the saddle for me to compass flinging him with all the struggles i could use some of which only served to further his point and at length an irresistible thrust murdered at once my maidenhead and almost me i now lay a bleeding witness of the necessity imposed on our sex to gather the first honey off the thorns  â€œbut the pleasure rising as the pain subsided i was soon reconciled to fresh trials and before morning nothing on earth could be dearer to me than this rifler of my virgin sweets he was every thing to me now  â€œhow we agreed to join fortunes how we came up to town together where we lived some time till necessityparted us and drove me into this course of life to which i had been long ago bettered and torn to pieces before i came to this age as much through my easiness as through inclination had it not been for my finding refuge in this house these are all circumstances which pass the mark i proposed so that here my narrative endsâ€  in the order of our sitting it was harriets turn to go on amongst all the beauties of our sex that i had before or have since seen few indeed were the forms that could dispute excellence with hers it was not delicate but delicacy itself incarnate such was the symmetry of her small but exactly fashioned limbs her complexion fair as it was appeared yet more fair from the effect of two black eyes the brilliancy of which gave her face more vivacity than belonged to the colour of it which was only defended from paleness by a sweetly pleasing blush in her cheeks that grew fainter and fainter till at length it died away insensibly into the overbearing white then her miniature features joined to finish the extreme sweetness of it which was not belied by that of a temper turned to indolence languor and the pleasures of love pressed to subscribe her contingent she smiled blushed a little and thus complied with our desires  â€œmy father was neither better nor worse than a miller near the city of york and both he and my mother dying whilst i was an infant i fell under the care of a widow and childless aunt housekeeper to my lord n at his seat in the county of where she brought me up with all imaginable tenderness i was not seventeen as i am not now eighteen before i had on account of my person purely for fortune i had notoriously none several advantageous proposals but whether nature was slow in making me sensible in her favourite passion or that i had not seen any of the other sex who had stirred up the least emotion or curiosity to be better acquainted with it i had till that age preserved a perfect innocence even of thought whilst my fears of i did not now well know what made me no more desirous of marrying than of dying my aunt good woman favoured my timorousness which she loooked on as childish affection that her own experience might probably assure her would wear off in time and gave my suitors proper answers for me  â€œthe family had not been down at that seat for years so that it was neglected and committed entirely to my aunt and two old domestics to take care of it thus i had the full range of a spacious lonely house and gardens situated at about half a mile distance from any other habitation except perhaps a straggling cottage or so  â€œhere in tranquillity and innocence i grew up without any memorable accident till one fatal day i had as i had often done before left my aunt asleep and secure for some hours after dinner and resorting to a kind of ancient summer house at some distance from the house i carried my work with me and sat over a rivulet which its door and window faced upon here i fell into a gentle breathing slumber which stole upon my senses as they fainted under the excessive heat of the season at that hour a cane couch with my work basked for a pillow were all the conveniences of my short repose for i was soon awaked and alarmed by a flounce and noise of splashing in the water i got up to see what was the matter and what indeed should it be but the son of a neighbouring gentleman as i afterwards found for i had never seen him before who had strayed that way with his gun and heated by his sport and the sultriness of the day had been tempted by the freshness of the clear stream so that presently stripping he jumped into it on the other side which bordered on a wood some trees whereof inclined down to the water formed a pleasing shady recess commodious to undress and leave his clothes under  â€œmy first emotions at the sight of this youth naked in the water were with all imaginable respect to truth those of surprise and fear and in course i should immediately have run out had not my modesty fatally for itself interposed the objection of the door and window being so situated that it was scarce possible to get out and make my way along the bank to the house without his seeing me which i could not bear the thought of so much ashamed and confounded was i at having seen him condemned then to stay till his departure should release me i was greatly embarrassed how to dispose of myself i kept some time betwixt terror and modesty even from looking through the window which being an old fashioned casement without any light behind me could hardly betray any ones being there to him from within then the door was so secure that without violence or my own consent there was no opening it from without  â€œbut now by my own experience i found it too true that objects which affright us when we cannot get from them draw our eyes as forcibly as those that please us i could not long withstand that nameless impulse which without any desire of this novel sight compelled me towards it emboldened too by my certainty of being at once unseen and safe i ventured by degrees to cast my eyes on an object so terrible and alarming to my virgin modesty as a naked man  â€œbut as i snatched a look the first gleam that struck me was in general the dewy lustre of the whitest skin imaginable which the sun playing upon made the reflection of it perfectly beamy his face in the confusion i was in i could not well distinguish the lineamints of any farther than that there was a great deal of youth and freshness in it the frolic and various play of all his fine polished limbs as they appeared above the surface in the course of his swimming or wantoning with the water amused and insensibly delighted me sometimes he lay motionless on his back waterborne and dragging after him a fine head of hair that floating swept the stream in a bush of black curls then the overflowing water would make a separation between his breast and glossy white belly at the bottom of which i could not escape observing so remarkable a distinction as a black mossy tuft out of which appeared to emerge a round softish limber white something that played every way with ever the least motion or whirling eddy i cannot say but that part chiefly by a kind of natural instinct attracted detained captivated my attention it was out of the power of all my modesty to command my eye away from it and seeing nothing so very dreadful in its appearance i insensibly looked away all my fears but as fast as they gave way new desires and strange wishes took place and i melted as i gazed the fire of nature that had so long lain dormant or concealed began to break out and made me feel my sex for the first time he had now changed his posture and swam prone on his belly striking out with his legs and arms finer modeled than which could not have been cast whilst his floating locks played over a neck and shoulders whose whiteness they delightfully set off then the luxuriant swell of flesh that rose from the small of his back and terminates its double cope at where the thighs are set off perfectly dazzled one with its watery glistening gloss  â€œby this time i was so affected by this inward involution of sentiments so softened by this sight that now betrayed into a sudden transition from extreme fears to extreme desires i found these last so strong upon me the heat of the weather too perhaps conspiring to exalt their rage that nature almost fainted under them not that i so much as knew precisely what was wanting to me my only thought was that so sweet a creature as this youth seemed to me could only make me happy but then the little likelihood there was of compassing an acquaintance with him or perhaps of ever seeing him again dashed my desires and turned them into torments i was still gazing with all the powers of my sight on this bewitching object when in an instant down he went i had heard of such things as a cramp seizing on even the best swimmers and occasioning their being drowned and imagining this so sudden eclipse to be owing to it the inconceivable fondness this unknown lad had given birth to distracted me with the most killing terrors insomuch that my concern giving the wings i flew to the door opened it ran down to the canal guided thither by the madness of my fears for him and the intense desire of being an instrument to save him though i was ignorant how or by what means to effect it but was it for fears and a passion so sudden as mine to reason all this took up scarce the space of a few moments i had then just life enough to reach the green borders of the waterpiece where wildly looking round for the young man and missing him still my fright and concern sunk me down in a deep swoon which must have lasted me some time for i did not come to myself till i was roused out of it by a sense of pain that pierced me to the vitals and awaked me to the the most surprising circumstance of finding myself not only in the arms of this very young gentleman i had been so solicitous to save but taken at such an advantage in my unresisting condition that he had actually completed his entrance into me so far that weakened as i was by all the preceding conflicts of mind i had suffered and struck dumb by the violence of my surprise i had neither the power to cry out nor the strength to disengage myself from his strenuous embraces before urging his point he had forced his way and completely triumphed over my virginity as he might now as well see by the streams of blood that followed his drawing out as he had felt by the difficulties he had met with consummating his penetration but the sight of the blood and the sense of my condition had as he told me afterwards since the ungovernable rage of his passion was somewhat appeased now wrought so far on him that at all risks even of the worst consequences he could not find in his heart to leave me and make off which he might easily have done i still lay all discomposed in bleeding ruin palpitating speechless unable to get off and frightened and fluttering like a poor wounded partridge and ready to faint away again at the sense of what had befallen me the young gentleman was by me kneeling kissing my hand and with tears in his eyes beseeching me to forgive him and offering all the reparation in his power it is certain that could i at the instant of regaining my senses have called out or taken the bloodiest revenge i would not be stuck at it the violation was attended too with such aggravating circumstances though he was ignorant of them since it was to my concern for the preservation of his life that i owed my ruin  â€œbut how quick is the shift of passions from one extreme to another and how little are they acquainted with the human heart who dispute it i could not see this amiable criminal so suddenly the first object of my love and as suddenly of my just hate on his knees bedewing my hands with his tears without relenting he was still starknaked but my modesty had been already too much wounded in essentials to be so much shocked as i should have otherwise been with appearances only in short my anger ebbed so fast and the tide of love returned so strong upon me that i felt it a point of my own happiness to forgive him the reproaches i made him were murmured in so soft a tone my eyes met his with such glances expressing more languor than resentment that he could not but presume his forgiveness was at no desperate distance but still he would not quit his posture of submission till i had pronounced his pardon in form which after the most fervent entreaties protestations and promises i had not the power to withhold on which with the utmost marks of a fear of again offending he ventured to kiss my lips which i neither declined nor resented but on my mild expostulation with him upon the barbarity of his treatment he explained the mystery of my ruin if not entirely to the clearance at least much to the alleviation of his guilt in the eyes of a judge so partial in his favour as i was grown  â€œit seems that the circumstance of his going down or sinking which in my extreme ignorance i had mistaken for something very fatal was no other than a trick of diving which i had not ever heard or at least attended o the mention of and he was so longbreathed at it that in the few moments in which i ran out to save him he had not yet emerged before i fell into the swoon in which as he rose seeing me extended on the bank his first idea was that some young woman was upon some design of frolic or diversion with him for he knew i could not have fallen asleep there without his having seen me before agreebly to which notion he had ventured to approach and finding me without sign of life and still perplexed as he was what to think of the adventure he took me in his arms at all hazards and carried me into the summerhouse of which he observed the door open there he laid me down on the couch and tried as he protested in good faith by several means to bring me to myself again till fired as he said beyond all bearing by the sight and touch of several parts of me which were unguardedly exposed to him he could no longer govern his passion and the less as he was not quite sure that his first idea of this swoon being a feint was not the very truth of the case seduced then by this flattering notion and overcome by the present as he styled them superhuman temptations combined with the solitude and seeming security of the attempt he was not enough his own master not to make it leaving me then just only whilst he fastened the door he returned with redoubled eagerness to his prey when finding me still entranced he ventured to place me as he pleased whilst i felt no more than the dead what he was about till the pain he put me to roused me just in time enough to be witness of a triumph i was not able to defeat and now scarce regretted for as he talked the tone of his voice sounded methought so sweetly in my ears the sensible nearness of so new and interesting an object to me wrought so powerfully upon me that in the rising perception of things in a new and pleasing light i lost all sense of the past injury the young gentleman soon discerned the symptoms of a reconciliation in my softened looks and hastening to receive the seal of it from my lips pressed them tenderly to pass his pardon in the return of a kiss so melting fiery that the impression of it being carried to my heart and thence to my new discovered sphere of venus i was melted into a softness that could refuse him nothing when now he managed his caresses and endearments so artfully as to insinuate the most soothing consolations for the past pain and the most pleasing expectations of future pleasure but whilst mere modesty kept my eyes from seeing his and rather declined them i had a glimpse of that instrument of mischief which was now obviously even to me who had scarce had snatches of a comparative observation of it resuming its capacity to renew it and grew greatly alarming with its increase of size as he bore it no doubt designedly hard and stiff against one of my hands carelessly dropt but then he employed such tender prefacing such winning progressions that my returning passion of desire being now so strongly prompted by the engaging circumstances of the sight and incendiary touch of his naked glowing beauties i yield at length at the force of the present impressions and he obtained of my tacit blushing consent all the gratifications of pleasure left in the power of my poor person to bestow after he had cropt its richest flower during my suspension of life and abilities to guard it  â€œhere according to the rule laid down i should stop but i am so much in notion that i could not if i would i shall only add however that i got home without the least discovery or suspicion of what had happened i met my young ravisher several times after whom i now passionately loved and who though not of age to claim a small but independent fortune would have married me but as the accident that prevented it and its consequences which threw me on the public contain matters too moving and serious to introduce at present i cut short hereâ€  louisa the brunette whom i mentioned at first now took her turn to treat the company with her history i have already hinted to you the graces of her person than which nothing could be more exquisitely touching i repeat touching as a just distinction from striking which is ever a less lasting effect and more generally belongs to the fair complexions but leaving that decision to every ones taste i proceed to give you louisas narrative as follows  â€œaccording to practical maxims of life i ought to boast of my birth since i owe it to pure love without marriage but this i know it was scarce possible to inherit a stronger propensity to that cause of my being than i did i was the rare production of the first essay of a journeyman cabinetmaker on his masters maid the consequence of which was a big belly and the loss of a place he was not in circumstances to do much for her and yet after all this blemish she found means after she had dropt her burthen and disposed of me to a poor relation in the country to repair it by marrying a pastrycook here in london in thriving business on whom she soon under favour of the complete ascendant he had given her over him passed me for a child she had by her first husband i had on that footing been taken home and was not six years old when this fatherinlaw died and left my mother in tolerable circumstances and without any children by him as to my natural father he had betaken himself to the sea where when the truth of things came out i was told that he died not immensely rich you may think since he was no more than a common sailor as i grew up under the eyes of my mother who kept on the business i could not but see in her severe watchfulness the marks of a slip which she did not care should be hereditary but we no more choose our passions than our features or complexions and the bent of mine was so strong to the forbidden pleasure that it got the better at length of all her care and precaution i was scarce twelve years old before that part which she wanted so much to keep out of harms way made me feel its impatience to be taken notice of and come into play already had it put forth the signs of forwardness in the sprout of a soft down over it which had often fluttered and i might also say grown under my constant touch and visitation so pleased was i with what i took to be a kind of title to womanhood that state i pined to be entered of for the pleasures i conceived were annexed to it and now the growing importance of that part to me and the new sensations in it demolished at once all my girlish playthings and amusements nature now pointed me strongly to more solid diversions while all the stings of desire settled so fiercely in that little centre of them that i could not mistake the spot i wanted a playfellow in  â€œi now shunned all company in which there was no hopes of coming at the object of my longings and used to shut myself up to indulge in solitude some tender meditation on the pleasure i strongly perceived the overture of in feeling and examining what nature assured me must be the chosen avenue the gates for unknown bliss to enter at that i panted after  â€œbut these meditations only increased my disorder and blew the fire that consumed me i was yet worse when yielding at length to the insupportable irritations of the little fairy charm that tormented me i seized it with my fingers teazing it to no end sometimes in the furious excitations of desire i threw myself on the bed spread my thighs abroad and lay as it were expecting the longedfor relief till finding my illusion i shut and squeezed them together again burning and fretting in short this develish thing with its impetuous girds and itching fires led me such a life that i could neither night or day be at peace with it or myself in time however i thought i had gained a prodigious prize when figuring to myself that my fingers were something of the shape of what i pined for i worked my way in with one of them with great agitation and delight yet not without pain too did i deflower myself as far as it could reach proceeding with such a fury of passion in this solitary and last shift of pleasure as extended me at length breathless on the bed in an amorous melting trance  â€œbut frequency of use dulling the sensation i soon began to perceive that this work was but a paultry shallow expedient that went but a little way to relieve me and rather raised more flame than its dry and insignificant titillation could rightly appease  â€œman alone i almost instinctively knew as well as by what i had industriously picked up at weddings and christenings was possessed of the only remedy that could reduce this rebellious disorder but watched and overlooked as i was how to come at it was the point and that to all appearance an invincible one not that i did not rack my brains and invention how at once to elude my mothers vigilance and procure myself the satisfaction of my impetuous curiosity and longings for this mighty and untasted pleasure at length however a singular chance did at once the work of a long course of alertness one day that we had dined at an acquaintance over the way together with a gentlewomanlodger that occupied the first floor of our house there started an indispensable necessity for my mothers going down to greenwich to accompany her the party was settled when i do not know what genius whispered me to plead a headache which i certainly had not against my being included in a jaunt that i had not the least relish for the pretext however passed and my mother with much reluctance prevailed with herself to go without me but took particular care to see me safe home where she consigned me into the hands of an old trusty maidservants who served in the shop for we had not a male creature in the house  â€œas soon as she was gone i told the maid i would go up and lie down on our lodgers bed mine not being made with a charge to her at the same time not to disturb me as it was only rest i wanted this injunction probably proved of eminent service to me as soon as i was got into the bedchamber i unlaced my stays and threw myself on the outside of the bedclothes in all the loosest undress here i gave myself up to the old insipid privy shifts of my selfviewing selftouching selfenjoying in fine to all the means of self knowledge i could devise in search of the pleasure that fled before me and tantalized with that unknown something that was out of my reach thus all only served to enflame myself and to provoke violently my desires whilst the one thing needful to their satisfaction was not at hand and i could have bit my finger for representing it so ill after then wearying and fatiguing myself with grasping shadows whilst that most sensible part of me disdained to content itself with less than realities the strong yearnings the urgent struggles of nature towards the melting relief and the extreme selfagitations i had used to come at it had wearied and thrown me into a kind of unquiet sleep for if i tossed and threw about my limbs in proportion to the distraction of my dreams as i had reason to believe i did a bystander could not have helped seeing all for love and one there was it seems for waking out of my very short slumber i found my hand locked in that of a young man who was kneeling at my bedside and begging my pardon for his boldness but that being a son to the lady to whom this bedchamber he knew belonged he had slipped by the servant of the shop as he supposed unperceived when finding me asleep his first ideas were to withdraw but that he had been fixed and detained there by a power he could better account for than resist  â€œwhat shall i say my emotions of fear and surprise were instantly subdued by those of the pleasure i bespoke in great presence of mind from the turn this adventure might take he seemed to me no other than a pitying angel dropt out of the clouds for he was young and perfectly handsome which was more than even i had asked for man in general being all that my utmost desires had pointed at i thought then i could not put too much encouragement into my eyes and voice i regretted no leading advances no matter for his afteropinion of my forwardness so it might bring him to the point of answering my pressing demands of present case it was not now with his thoughts but his actions that my business immediately lay i raised then my head and told him in a soft tone that tended to prescribe the same key to him that his mamma was gone out and would not return till late at night which i thought no bad hint but as it proved i had nothing of a novice to deal with the impressions i had made on him from the discoveries i had betrayed of my person in the disordered motions of it during his view of me asleep had as he afterwards told me so fixed and charmingly prepared him that had i known his dispositions i had more to hope from his violence than to fear from his respect and even less than the extreme tenderness which i threw into my voice and eyes would have served to encourage him to make the most of the opportunity finding then that his kisses imprinted on my hand were taken as tamely as he could wish he rose to my lips and glewing his to them made me so faint with overcoming joy and pleasure that i fell back and he with me in course on the bed upon which i had by insensibly shifting from the side to near the middle invitingly made room for him he is now lain down by me and the minutes being too precious to consume in ultimate ceremony or dalliance my youth proceeds immediately to those extremities which all my looks humming and palpitations had assured him he might attempt without the fear of a repulse those rogues the men read us admirably on these occasions i lay then at length panting for the imminent attack with wishes far beyond my fears and for which it was scarce possible for a girl barely thirteen but tall and well grown to have better dispositions he threw up my petticoat and shift whilst my thighs were by an instinct of nature unfolded to their best and my desires had so thoroughly destroyed all modesty in me that even their being now naked and all laid open to him was part of the prelude that pleasure deepened my blushes at more than same but when his hand and touches naturally attracted to their center made me feel all their wantonness and warmth in and round it oh how immensely different a sense of things did i perceive there than when under my own insipid handling and now his waistcoat was unbuttoned and the confinement of the breeches burst through when out started to view the amazing pleasing object of all my wishes all my dreams all my love the king member indeed i gazed at i devoured it at length and breadth with my eyes intently directed to it till his getting upon me and placing between my thighs took from me the enjoyment of its sight to give me a far more grateful one in its touch in that part where its touch is so exquisitely affecting applying it then to the minute opening for such at that age it certainly was i met with too much good will i felt with too great a rapture of pleasure the first insertion of it to heed much the pain that followed i thought nothing too dear to pay for this the richest treat of the sense so that split up torn bleeding mangled i was still superiorly pleased and hugged the author of all this delicious ruin but when soon after he made his second attack sore as every thing was the smart was soon put away by the sovereign cordial all my soft complainings were silenced and the pain melting fast away into pleasure i abandoned myself over to all its transports and gave it the full possession of my whole body and soul for now all thought was at an end with me i lived in what i felt only and who could describe those feelings those agitations yet exalted by the charm of their novelty and surprise when that part of me which had so hungered for the dear morsel that now so delightfully crammed forced all my vital sensations to fix their home there during the stay of my beloved guest who too soon paid me for his hearty welcome in a dissolvent richer far than that i have heard of some queen treating her paramour with in liquified pearl and ravishingly poured into me where now myself too much melted to give it a dry reception i hailed it with the warmest confluence on my side amidst all those ecstatic raptures not unfamiliar i presume to this good company thus however i arrived at the very top of all my wishes by an accident unexpected indeed but not so wonderful for this young gentleman was just arrived in town from college and came familiarly to his mother at her apartment where he had once before been though by mere chance i had not seen him so that we knew one another by hearing only and finding me stretched on his mothers bed he readily concluded from her description who it was the rest you know  â€œthis affair had however no ruinous consequences the young gentleman escaping then and many more times undiscovered but the warmth of my constitution that made the pleasures of love a kind of necessary of life to me having betrayed me into indiscretions fatal to my private fortune i fell at length to the public from which it is probable i might have met with the worst of ruin if my better fate had not thrown me into this safe and agreeable refugeâ€  here louisa ended and these little histories having brought the time for the girls to retire and to prepare for the revels of the evening i staid with mrs cole till emily came and told us the company was met and waited for us  mrs cole on this taking me by the hand with a smile of encouragement led me up stairs preceded by louisa who was come to hasten us and lighted us with two candles one in each hand  on the landingplace of the first pair of stairs we were met by a young gentleman extremely well dressed and a very pretty figure to whom i was to be indebted for the first essay of the pleasures of the house he saluted me with great gallantry and handed me into the drawing room the floor of which was overspread with a turkey carpet and all its furniture voluptuously adapted to every demand of the most studied luxury now too it was by means of a profuse illumination enlivened by a light scarce inferior and perhaps more favourable to joy more tenderly pleasing than that of broad sunshine  on my entrance into the room i had the satisfaction to hear a buzz of approbation run through the whole company which now consisted of four gentlemen including my particular this was the cant term of the house for ones gallant for the time the three youngwomen in a neat flowing dishabille the mistress of the academy and myself i was welcomed and saluted by a kiss all round in which however it was easy to discover in the superior warmth of that of the men the distinction of the sexes  awed and confounded as i was at seeing myself surrounded caressed and made court to by so many strangers i could not immediately familiarize myself to all that air of gaiety and joy which dictated their compliments and animated their caresses  they assured me that i was so perfectly to their taste as to have but one fault against me which i might easily be cured of and that was my modesty this they observed might pass for a beauty the more with those who wanted it for a heightener but their maxim was that it was an impertinent mixture and dashed the cup so as to spoil the sincere draught of pleasure they considered it accordingly as their mortal enemy and gave it no quarter wherever they met with it this was a prologue not unworthy of the revels that ensued  in the midst of all the frolic and wantonness which this joyous band had presently and all naturally run into an elegant supper was served in and we sat down to it my spark elect placing himself next to me and the other couples without order or ceremony the delicate cheer and good wine soon banished all reserve the conversation grew as lively as could be wished without taking too loose a turn these professors of pleasure knew too well how to stale impressions of it or evaporate the imagination of words before the time of action kisses however were snatched at times or where a handkerchief round the neck interposed its feeble barrier it was not extremely respected the hands of the men went to work with their usual petulance till the provocation on both sides rose to such a pitch that my particularss proposal for beginning the country dances was received with instant assent for as he laughingly added he fancied the instruments were in tune this was a signal for preparation that the complaisant mrs cole who understood life took for her cue of disappearing no longer so fit for personal service herself and content with having settled the order of battle she left us the field to fight it out at discretion  as soon as she was gone the table was removed from the middle and became a sideboard a couch was brought into its place of which when i whisperingly inquired the reason of my particular he told me â€œthat as it was chiefly on my account that his convention was met the parties intended at once to humour their taste of variety in pleasures and by an open public enjoyment to see me broke of any taint of reserve or modesty which they looked on as the poison of joy that though they occasionally preached pleasure and lived up to the text they did not enthusiastically set up for missionaries and only indulged themselves in the delights of a practical instruction of all the pretty women they liked well enough to bestow it upon and who fell properly in the way of it but that as such a proposal might be too violent too shocking for a young beginner the old standers were to set an example which he hoped i would not be averse to follow since it was to him i was devolved in favour of the first experiment but that still i was perfectly at my liberty to refuse the party which being in its nature one of pleasure supposed an exclusion of all force or constraintâ€  my countenance expressed no doubt my surprise as my silence did my acquiescence i was now embarked and thoroughly determined on any voyage the company would take me on  the first that stood up to open the ball were a cornet of horse and that sweetest of olivebeauties the soft and amorous louisa he led her to the couch nothing loth on which he gave her the fall and extended her at length with an air of roughness and vigour relishing high of amorous eagerness and impatience the girl spreading herself to the best advantage with her head upon the pillow was so concentered in that she was about that our presence was the least of her care and concern her petticoats thrown up with her shift discovered to the company the finest turned legs and thighs that could be imagined and in broad display that gave us a full view of that delicious cleft of flesh into which the pleasing hair grown mount over it parted and presented a most inviting entrance between two close hedges delicately soft and pouting her gallant was now ready having disencumbered himself from his clothes overloaded with lace and presently his shirt removed shewed us his forces at high plight bandied and ready for action but giving us no time to consider the dimensions he threw himself instantly over his charming antagonist who received him as he pushed at once dead at mark like a heroine without flinching for surely never was girl constitutionally truer to the taste of joy or sincerer in the expressions of its sensations than she was we could observe pleasure lighten in her eyes as he introduced his plenipotentiary instrument into her till at length having indulged her to its utmost reach its irritations grew so violent and gave her the spurs so furiously that collected within herself and lost to every thing but the enjoyment of her favourite feelings she retarded his thrusts with a just concert of spring heaves keeping time so exactly with the most pathetic sighs that one might have numbered the strokes in agitation by their distinct murmurs whilst her active limbs kept wreathing and intertwisting with his in convulsive folds then the turtlebilling kisses and the poignant painless lovebites which they both exchanged in a rage of delight all conspiring towards the melting period it soon came on when louisa in the ravings of her pleasurefrensy impotent of all restraint cried out â€œoh sir good sir pray do not spare me ah ahâ€ all her accents now faultering into heartfetched sighs she closed her eyes in the sweet death in the instant of which we could easily see the signs in the quiet dying languid posture of her late so furious driver who was stopped of a sudden breathing short panting and for that time giving up the spirit of pleasure as soon as he was dismounted louisa sprung up shook her petticoats and running up to me gave me a kiss and drew me to the sideboard to which she was herself handed by her gallant where they made me pledge them in a glass of wine and toast a droll health of louisas proposal in high frolic  by this time the second couple was ready to enter the lists which were a young baronet and that delicatest of charmers the winning tender harriet my gentle esquire came to acquaint me with it and brought me back to the scene of action  and surely never did one of her profession accompany her dispositions for the barefaced part she was engaged to play with such a peculiar grace of sweetness modesty and yielding coyness as she did all her air and motions breathed only unreserved unlimited complaisance without the least mixture of impudence or prostitution but what was yet more surprising her spark elect in the midst of the dissolution of a public open enjoyment doated on her to distraction and had by dint of love and sentiments touched her heart though for a while the restraint of their engagement to the house laid him under a kind of necessity of complying with an institution which himself had had the greatest share establishing  harriet was then led to the vacant couch by her gallant blushing as she looked at me and with eyes made to justify any thing tenderly bespeaking of me the most favourable construction of the step she was thus irresistibly drawn into  her lover for such he was sat her down at the foot of the couch and passing his arm round her neck preluded with a kiss fervently applied to her lips that visibly gave her life and spirit to go through with the scene and as he kissed he gently inclined her head till it fell back on a pillow disposed to receive it and leaning himself down all the way with her at once countenanced and endeared her fall to her there as if he had guessed our wishes or meant to gratify at once his pleasure and his pride in being the master by the title of present possession of beauties delicate beyond imagination he discovered her breast to his own touch and our common view but oh what delicious manual of love devotion how inimitable fine moulded small round firm and excellently white then the grain of their skin so soothing so flattering to the touch and of beauty when he had feasted his eyes with the their nipples that crowned them the sweetest buds touch and perusal feasted his lips with kisses of the highest relish imprinted on those all delicious twinorbs he proceeded downwards  her legs still kept the ground and now with the tenderest attention not to shock or alarm her too suddenly he by degrees rather stole than rolled up her petticoats at which as if a signal had been given louisa and emily took hold of her legs in pure wantonness and in ease to her kept them stretched wide abroad then lay exposed or to speak more properly displayed the greatest parade in nature of female charms the whole company who except myself had often seen them seemed as much dazzled surprised and delighted as any one could be who had now beheld them for the first time beauties so excessive could not but enjoy the privileges of eternal novelty her thighs were so exquisitely fashioned that either more in or more out of flesh than they were they would have declined from that point of perfection they presented but what infinitely enriched and adorned them was the sweet intersection formed where they met at the bottom of the smoothest roundest whitest belly by that central furrow which nature had sunk there between the soft relievo of two pouting ridges and which in this girl was in perfect symmetry of delicacy and miniature with the rest of her frame no nothing in nature could be of a beautifuller cut then the dark umbrage of the downy spring moss that overarched it bestowed on the luxury of the landscape a touching warmth a tender finishing beyond the expression of words or even the paint of thought  her truly enamoured gallant who had stood absorbed and engrossed by the pleasure of the sight long enough to afford us time to feast ours no fear of glutting addressed himself at length to the materials of enjoyment and lifting the linen veil that hung between us and his master member of the revels exhibited one whose eminent size proclaimed the owner a true womans hero he was besides in every other respect an accomplished gentleman and in the bloom and vigour of youth standing then between harriets legs which were supported by her two companions at their widest extension with one hand he gently disclosed the lips of that luscious mouth of nature whilst with the other he stooped his mighty machine to its lure from the height of his stiff standup towards his belly the lips kept open by his fingers received its broad shelving head of coral hue and when he had nestled it in he hovered there a little and the girls then delivered over to his hips the agreeable office of supporting her thighs and now as if he meant to spin out his pleasure and give it the more play for its life he passed up his instrument so slow that we lost sight of it inch by inch till at length it was wholly taken into the soft laboratory of love and the mossy mounts of each fairly met together in the mean time we could plainly mark the prodigious effect the progressions of this delightful energy wrought in this delicious girl gradually heightening her beauty as they heightened her pleasure her countenance and whole frame grew more animated the faint blush of her cheeks gaining ground on the white deepened into a florid vivid vermillion glow her naturally brilliant eyes now sparkled with tenfold lustre her languor was vanished and she appeared quick spirited and alive all over he had now fixed nailed this tender creature with his homedriven wedge so that she lay passive by force and unable to stir till beginning to play a strain of arms against this vein of delicacy as he urged the toandfro confriction he awakened roused and touched her so to the heart that unable to contain herself she could not but reply to his motions as briskly as her nicety of frame would admit of till the raging stings of the pleasure rising towards the point made her wild with the intolerable sensations of it and she now threw her legs and arms about at random as she lay lost in the sweet transport which on his side declared itself by quicker eager thrusts convulsive gasps burning sighs swift laborious breathing eyes darting humid fires all faithful tokens of the imminent approaches of the last gasp of joy it came on at length the baronet led the extasy which she critically joined in as she felt the melting symptoms from him in the nick of which gluing more ardently than ever his lips to hers he shewed all the signs of that agony of bliss being strong upon him in which he gave her the finishing titillation inly thrilled with which we saw plainly that she answered it down with all effusion of spirit and matter she was mistress of whilst a general soft shudder ran through all her limbs which she gave a stretch out and lay motionless breathless dying with dear delight and in the height of its expression showing through the nearly closed lids of her eyes just the edges of their black the rest being rolled strongly upwards in their extasy then her sweet mouth appeared languishingly open with the tip of her tongue leaning negligently towards the lower range of her white teeth whilst natural ruby colour of her lips glowed with heightened life was not this a subject to dwell upon and accordingly her lover still kept on her with an abiding delectation till compressed squeezed and distilled to the last drop he took leave with one fervent kiss expressing satisfied desires but unextinguished love  as soon as he was off i ran to her and sitting down on the couch by her raisd her head which she declined gently and hung on my bosom to hide her blushes and confusion at what had passed till by degrees she recomposed herself and accepted of a restorative glass of wine from my spark who had left me to fetch it to her whilst her own was readjusting his affaire and buttoning up after which he led her leaning languishingly upon him to oar stand of view round the couch  and now emilys partner had taken her out for her share in the dance when this transcendently fair and sweet tempered creature readily stood up and if a complexion to put the rose and lily out of countenance extreme pretty features and that florid health and bloom for which the country girls are so lovely might pass her for a beauty this she certainly was and one of the most striking of the fair ones  her gallant began first as she stood to disengage her breasts and restore them to the liberty of nature from the easy confinement of no more than a pair of jumps but on their coming out to view we thought a new light was added to the room so superiourly shining was their whiteness then they rose in so happy a swell as to compose her a well horned fullness of bosom that had such an effect on the eye as to seem flash hardened into marble of which it emulated the polished gloss and far surpassed even the whitest in the life and lustre of its colours white weined with blue who could refrain from such provoking enticements in reach he touched her breasts first lightly when the glossy smoothness of the skin eluded his hand and made it slip along the surface he pressed them and the springy flesh that filled them thus pitted by force rose again reboundingly with his hand and on the instant defaced the pressure and alike indeed was the consistence of all those parts of her body throughout where the fulness of flesh compacts and constitutes all that fine firmness which the touch is so highly attached to when he had thus largely pleased himself with this branch of dalliance and delight he trussed up her petticoat and shift in a wisp to her waist where being tucked in she stood fairly naked on every side a blush at this overspread her lovely face and her eyes downcast to the ground seemed to be for quarter when she had so great a right to triumph in all the treasures of youth and beauty that she now so victoriously displayed her legs were perfectly well shaped and her thighs which she kept pretty close shewed so white so round so substantial and abounding in firm flesh that nothing could afford a stronger recommendation to the luxury of the touch which he accordingly did not fail to indulge in then gently removing her hand which in the first emotion of natural modesty she had carried thither he gave us rather a glimpse than a view of that soft narrow chink running its little length downwards and hiding the remains of it between her thighs but plain was to be seen the fringe of lightbrown curls in beauteous growth over it that with their silk gloss created a pleasing variety from the surrounding white whose lustre too their gentle embrowning shade considerably raised her spark then endeavoured as she stood by disclosing her thighs to gain us a completer sight of that central charm of attraction but not obtaining it so conveniently in that attitude he led her to the foot of the couch and bringing it to one of the pillows gently inclined her head down so that as she leaned with it over her crossed hands straddling with her thighs wide spread and jutting her body out she presented a full back view of her person naked to her waist her posteriors plump smooth and prominent formed luxuriant tracts of animated snow that splendidly filled the eye till it was commanded down the parting or separation of those exquisitely white cliffs by their narrow vale and was there stopt and attracted by the embowered bottomsavity that terminated this delightful vista and stood moderately gaping from the influence of her bended posture so that the agreeable interior red of the sides of the orifice came into view and with respect to the white that dazzled round it gave somewhat the idea of a pink slash in the glossiest white satin her gallant who was a gentleman about thirty somewhat inclined to a fatness that was in no sort displeasing improving the hint thus tendered him of this mode of enjoyment after setting her well in this posture and encouraging her with kisses and caresses to stand him thro drew out his affair ready erected and whose extreme length rather disproportioned to its breadth was the more surprising as that excess is not often the case with those of his corpulent habit making then the right and direct application he drove it up to the guard whilst the round bulge of those turkish beauties of hers tallying with the hollow made with the bent of his belly and thighs as he curved inwards brought all those parts surely not undelightfully into warm touch and close conjunction his hands he kept passing round her body and employed in toying with her enchanting breasts as soon too as she felt him at home as he could reach she lifted her head a little from the pillow and turning her neck without much straining but her cheeks glowing with the deepest scarlet and a smile of the tenderest satisfaction met the kiss he pressed forward to give her as they were thus close joined together when leaving him to pursue his delights she hid again her face and blushes with her hands and pillow and thus stood passively and as favourably too as she could whilst he kept laying at her with repeated thrusts and making the meeting flesh on both sides resound again with the violence of them then ever as he backened from her we could see between them part of his long white staff foamingly in motion till as he went on again and closed with her the interposing hillocks took it out of sight sometimes he took his hands from the semiglobes of her bosom and transferred the pressure of them to those large ones the present subjects of his soft blockade which he squeezed grasped and played with till at length in pursuit of driving so hotly urged brought on the height of the fit with such overpowering pleasure that his fair partner became now necessary to support him panting fainting and dying as he discharged which she no sooner felt the killing sweetness of than unable to keep her legs and yielding to the mighty intoxication she reeld and falling forward on the couch made it a necessity for him if he would preserve the warmpleasure hold to fall upon her where they perfected in a continued conjunction of body and ecstatic flow their scheme of joys for that time  as soon as he had disengaged the charming emily got up and we crowded round her with congratulations and other officious little services for it is to be noted that though all modesty and reserve were banished from the transaction of these pleasures good manners and politeness were inviolably observed there was no gross ribaldry no offensive or rude behaviour or ungenerous reproaches to the girls for their compliance with the humours and desires of the men on the contrary nothing was wanting to soothe encourage and soften the sense of their condition to them men know not in general how much they destroy of their own pleasure when they break through the respect and tenderness due to our sex and even to those of it who live only by pleasing them and this was a maxim perfectly well understood by these polite voluptuaries these profound adepts in the great art and science of pleasure who never shewed these votaries of theirs a more tender respect than at the time of those exercises of their complaisance when they unlocked their treasures of concealed beauty and shewed out in the pride of their native charms ever more touching surely than when they parade it in the artificial ones of dress and ornament  the frolic was now come round to me and it being my turn of subscription to the will and pleasure of my particular elect as well as to that of the company he came to me and saluting me very tenderly with a flattering eagerness put me in mind of the compliances my presence there authorized the hopes of and at the same time repeated to me â€œthat if all this force of example had not surmounted any repugnance i might have to concur with the humours and desires of the company that though the play was bespoke for my benefit and great as his own private disappointment might be he would suffer any thing sooner than be the instrument of imposing a disagreeable taskâ€  to this i answered without the least hesitation or mincing grimace â€œthat had i not even contracted a kind of engagement to be at his disposal without the least reserve the example of such agreeable companions would alone determine me and that i was in no pain about any thing but my appearing to so great a disadvantage after such superior beautiesâ€ and take notice that i thought as i spoke the frankness of the answer pleased them all my particular was complimented on his acquisition and by way of indirect flattery to me openly envied me  mrs cole by the way could not have given me a greater mark of her regard than in managing for me the choice of this young gentleman for my master of the ceremonies for independent of his noble birth and the great fortune he was heir to his person was even uncommonly pleasing well shaped and tall his face marked with the smallpox but no more than what added a grace of more manliness to features rather turned to softness and delicacy was marvellously enlivened by eyes which were of the clearest sparkling black in short he was one whom any woman would in the familiar style ready call a very pretty fellow  i was now handed by him to the cockpit of our match where as i was dressed in nothing but a white morning gown he vouchsafed to play the male abigail on this occasion and spared me the confusion that would have attended the forwardness of undressing myself my gown then was loosend in a trice and i divested of it my stays next offered an obstacle which readily gave way louisa very readily furnished a pair of scissors to cut the lace off went that shell and dropping my uppercoat i was reduced to my under one and my shift the open bosom of which gave the hands and eyes all the liberty they could wish here i imagined the stripping was to stop but i reckon short my spark at the desire of the rest tenderly begged that i would not suffer the small remains of a covering to rob them of a full view of my whole person and for me who was too flexibly obsequious to dispute any point with them and who considered the little more that remained as very immaterial i readily assented to whatever he pleasedin an instant then my under petticoat was untied and at my feet and my shift drawn over my head so that my cap slightly fastened came off with it and brought all my hair down of which be it again remembered without vanity that i had a very fine head in loose disorderly ringlets over my neck and shoulders to the no unfavourable setoff of my skin  i now stood before my judges in all the truth of nature to whom i could not appear a very disagreeable figure if you please to recollect what i have beforesaid of my person which time that at certain periods of life robs use every instant of our charms had at that of mine then greatly improved into full and open bloom for i wanted some months of eighteen my breasts which in the state of nudity are ever capital points now in no more than in graceful plenitude maintained a firmness and steady independence of any stay or support that dared and invited the test of the touch then i was as tall as slimshaped as could be consistent with all that juicy plumpness of flesh ever the most grateful to the senses of sight and touch which i owed to the health and youth of my constitution i had not however so thoroughly renounced all innate shame as not to suffer great confusion at the state i saw myself in but the whole troop round me men and women relieved me with every mark of applause and satisfaction even flattering attention to raise and inspire me with even sentiments of pride on the figure i made which my friend gallantly protested infinitely outshone all other birthday finery whatever so that had i leave to set down for sincere all the compliments these connoisseurs overwhelmed me with upon this occasion i might flatter myself with having passed my examination with the approbation of the learned  my friend however who for this time had alone the disposal of me humoured their curiosity and perhaps his own so far that he placed me in all the variety of postures and lights imaginable pointing out every beauty under every aspect of it not without such parentheses of kisses such inflammatory liberties of his roving hands as made all shame fly before them and a blushing glow give place to a warmer one of desire which led me even to find some relish in the present scene  but in this general survey you may be sure the most material spot of me was not excused the strictest visitation nor was it but agreed that i had not the least reason to be diffident of passing even for a maid on occasion so inconsiderable a flaw had my preceding adventures created there and so soon had the blemish of an overstretch been repaired and worn out at any age and in my naturally small make in that part  now whether my partner had exhausted all the modes of regaling the touch or sight or whether he was now ungovernably wound up to strike i know not but briskly throwing off his clothes the prodigious heat bred by a close room a great fire numerous candles and even the inflammatory warmth of these scenes induced him to lay aside his shirt too when his breeches before loosened now gave up their contents to view and shewd in front the enemy i had to engage with stiffly bearing up the port of its head unhooded and glowing red then i plainly saw what i had to trust to it was one of those just truesized instruments of which the masters have a better command than the more unwieldy inordinate sized one are generally under straining me then close to his bosom as he stood up foreright against me and applying to the obvious niche its peculiar idol he aimed at inserting it which as i forwardly favoured he effected at once by canting up my thighs over his naked hips and made me receive every inch and close home sothat stuck upon the pleasurepivot add clinging round his neck in which and in his hair i hid my face burningly flushing with present feeling as much as with shame my bosom glued to him he carried me once round the couch on which he then without quitting the middlefastness or dischannelling laid me down and began with pleasuregrist but so provokingly predisposed and primed as we were by all the moving sights of the night our imagination was too much heated not to melt us of the soonest and accordingly i no sooner felt the warm spray darted up my inwards from him but i was punctually on flow to share the momentary extasy but i had yet greater reason to boast of our harmony for finding that all the flames of desire were not yet quenched within me but that rather like wetted coals i glowed the fiercer for this sprinkling my hotmettled spark sympathizing with me and loaded for a double fire recontinued the sweet battery with undying vigour greatly encouraged to accommodate all my motions to his best advantage and delight kisses squeezes tender murmurs all came into play till our joys growing more turbulent and riotous threw us into a fond disorder and as they raged to a point bore us far from our selves into an ocean of boundless pleasures into which we both plunged together in a transport of taste now all the impressions of burning desire from the lively scenes i had been spectatress of ripened the heat of this exercise and collecting to a head throbbed and agitated me with insupportable irritations i perfectly fevered and maddened with their excess i bid not now enjoy a calm of reason enough to perceive but i ecstatically indeed felt the power of such rare and exquisite provocatives as the examples of the night had proved towards thus exalting our pleasures which with great joy i sensibly found my gallant shared in by his nervous and home expressions of it his eyes flashing eloquent flames his action infuriated with the stings of it all conspiring to raise my delight by assuring me of his lifted then to the utmost pitch of joy that human life can bear undestroyed by excess i touched that sweetly critical point whence scarce prevented by the injection from my partner i dissolved and breaking out into a deep drawn sigh sent my whole sensitive soul down to that passage where escape was denied it by its being so deliciously plugged and choked up thus we lay a few blissful instants overpowered still and languid till as the sense of pleasure stagnated we recovered from our trance and he slipt out of me not however before he had protested his extreme satisfaction by the tenderest kiss and embrace as well as by the most cordial expressions  the company who had stood round us in a profound silence when all was over helped me to hurry on my clothes in an instant and complimented me on the sincere homage they could not escape observing had been done as they termed itâ€to the sovereignty of my charms in my receiving a double payment of tribute at one juncture but my partner now dressed again signalized above all a fondness unbated by the circumstance of recent enjoyment the girls too kissed and embraced me assuring me that for that time or indeed any other unless i pleased i was to go through no farther public trials and that i was now consummatedly initiated and one of them  as it was an inviolable law for every gallant to keep to his partner for the night especially and even till he relinquished possession over to the community in order to preserve a pleasing property and to avoid the disgusts and indelicacy of another arrangement the company after a short refection of biscuits and wine tea and chocolate served in at now about one in the morning broke up and went off in pairs mrs cole had prepared my spark and me an occasion fieldbed to which we retired and there ended the night in one continued strain of pleasure sprightly and uncloyed enough for us not to have formed one wish for its ever knowing an end in the morning after a restorative breakfast in bed he got up and with very tender assurance of a particular regard for me left me to the composure and refreshment of a sweet slumber waking out of which and getting up to dress before mrs cole should come in i found in one of my pockets a purse of guineas which he had slipt there and just as i was musing on a liberality i had certainly not expected mrs cole came in to whom i immediately communicated the present and naturally offered her whatever share she pleased but assuring me that the gentleman had very nobly rewarded her she would on no terms no entreaties no shape i could put it in receive any part of it her denial she observed was no affectation of grimace and proceeded to read me such admirable lessons on the economy of my person and my purse as i became amply paid for my general attention and conformity to in the course of my acquaintance with the town after which changing the discourse she fell on the pleasures of the preceding night where i learned without much surprise as i began to enter on her character that she had seen every thing that had passed from a convenient place managed solely for that purpose and of which she readily made me the confidante  she had scarce finished this when the little troop of love girls my companions broke in and renewed their compliments and caresses i observed with pleasure that the fatigues and exercises of the night had not usurped in the least on the life of their complexion or the freshness of their bloom this i found by their confession was owing to the management and advice of our rare directress they went down then to figure it as usual in the shop whilst i repaired to my lodging where i employed myself till i returned to dinner at mrs coles  here i staid in constant amusement with one or other of these charming girls till about five in the evening when seized with a sudden drowsy fit i was prevailed on to go up and doze it off on harriets bed who left me on it to my repose there then i laid down in my clothes and fell fast asleep and had now enjoyed by guess about an hours rest when i was pleasingly disturbed by my new and favourite gallant who enquiring for me was readily directed where to find me coming then into my chamber and seeing me lie alone with my face turned from the light towards the inside of the bed he without more ado just slipped off his breeches for the greater ease and enjoyment of the naked touch and softly turning up my petticoats and shift behind opened the prospect of the back avenue to the genial seat of pleasure where as i lay at my side length inclining rather face downward i appeared full fair and liable to be entered laying himself gently down by me he invested me behind and giving me to feel the warmth of his body as he applied his thighs and belly close to me and the endeavours of that machine whose touch has something so exquisitely singular in it to make its way good into me i awaked pretty much startled at first at seeing who it was disposed myself to turn to him when he gave me a kiss and desiring me to keep my posture just lifted up my upper thigh and ascertaining the right opening soon drove it up to the farthest satisfied with which and solacing himself with lying so close in those parts he suspended motion and thus steeped in pleasure kept me lying on my side into him spoonfashion as he termed it from the snug indent of the back part of my thighs and all upwards into the space of the bending between his thighs and belly till after some time that restless and turbulent inmate impatient by nature of longer quiet urged him to action which now prosecuting with all the usual train of toying kissing and the like ended at length in the liquid proof on both sides that we had not exhausted or at less were quickly recruited of last nights draughts of pleasure in us  with this noble and agreeable youth lived i in perfect joy and constancy he was full bent on keeping me to himself for the honeymonth at least but his stay in london was not even so long his father who had a post in ireland taking him abruptly with him on his repairing thither yet even then i was near keeping hold of his affection and person as he had proposed and i had consented to follow him in order to go to ireland after him as soon as he could be settled there but meeting with an agreeable and advantageous match in that kingdom he chose the wiser part and forebore sending for me but at the same time took care that i should receive a very magnificent present which did not however compensate for all my deep regret on my loss of him  this event also created a chasm in our little society which mrs cole on the foot of her usual caution was in no haste to fill up but then it redoubled her attention to procure me in the advantages of a traffic for a counterfeit maidenhead some consolation for the sort of widowhood i had been left in and this was a scheme she had never lost prospect of and only waited for a proper person to bring it to bear with  but i was it seems fated to be my own caterer in this as i had been in my first trial of the market  i had now passed near a month in the enjoyment of all the pleasures of familiarity and society with my companions whose particular favourites the baronet excepted who soon after took harriet home had all on the terms of community established in the house solicited the gratification of their taste for variety in my embraces but i had with the utmost art and address on various pretexts eluded their pursuit without giving them cause to complain and this reserve i used neither out of dislike of them nor disgust of the thing but my true reason was my attachment to my own and my tenderness of invading the choice of my companions who outwardly exempt as they seemed from jealousy could not but in secret like me the better for the regard i had for without making a merit of it to them thus easy and beloved by the whole family did i get on when one day that about five in the afternoon i stepped over to a fruit shop in covent garden to pick some table fruit for myself and the young women i met with the following adventure  whilst i was chaffering for the fruit i wanted i observed myself followed by a young gentleman whose rich dress first attracted my notice for the rest he had nothing remarkable in his person except that he was pale thinmade and ventured himself upon legs rather of the slenderest easy was it to perceive without seeming to perceive it that it was me he wanted to be at and keeping his eyes fixed on me till he came to the same basket that i stood at and cheapening or rather giving the first price asked for the fruit began his approaches now most certainly i was not at all out of figure to pass for a modest girl i had neither the feathers nor fumet of a taudry townmiss a straw hat a white gown clean linen and above all a certain natural and easy air of modesty which the appearances of never forsook me even on those occasions that i most broke in upon it in practice were all signs that gave him no opening to conjecture my condition he spoke to me and this address from a stranger throwing a blush into my cheeks that still set him wider of the truth i answered him with an awkwardness and confusion the more apt to impose as there really was a mixture of the genuine in them but when proceeding on the foot of having broken the ice to join discourse he went into other leading questions i put so much innocence simplicity and even childishness into my answers that on no better foundation liking my person as he did i will not answer for it he would have been sworn for my modesty there is in short in the men when once they are caught by the eye especially a fund of cullibility that their lordly wisdom little dreams of and in virtue of which the most sagacious of them are seen so often our dupes amongst other queries he put to me one was whether i was married i replied that i was too young to think of that this many a year to that of my age i answered and sunk a year upon him passing myself for not above seventeen as to my way of life i told him i had served an apprenticeship to a milliner in preston and was come to town after a relation that i had found on my arrival was dead and now lived journeywoman to a milliner in town that last article indeed was not much of the side of what i pretended to pass for but it did pass under favour of the growing passion i had inspired him with after he had next got out of me very dexterously as he thought what i had no sort of design to make reserve of my own my mistresss name and place of abode he loaded me with fruit all the rarest and dearest he could pick out and sent me home pondering on what might be the consequence of this adventure  as soon then as i came to mrs coles i related to her all that passed on which she very judiciously concluded that if he did not come after me there was no harm done and that if he did as her presage suggested to her he would his character and his views should be well sifted so as to know whether the game was worth the springes that in the mean time nothing was easier than my part in it since no more rested on me than to follow her cue and promptership throughout till the last act  the next morning after an evening spent on his side as we afterwards learnt in perquisitions into mrs coles character in the neighbourhood than which nothing could be more favourable to her designs upon him my gentleman came in his chariot to the shop where mrs cole alone had an inkling of his errand asking then for her he easily made a beginning of acquaintance by bespeaking some millinery ware when as i sat without lifting my eyes and pursuing the hem of a ruffle with the utmost composure and simplicity of industry mrs cole took notice that the first impressions i made on him ran no risk of being destroyed by those of louisa and emily who were then sitting at work by me after vainly endeavouring to catch my eyes in rencounter with him i held my head down affecting a kind of consciousness of guilt for having by speaking to him given him encouragement and means of following me and after giving mrs cole direction when to bring the things home herself and the time he should expect them he went out taking with him some goods that he paid for liberally for the better grace of his introduction  the girls all this time did not in the least smoak the mystery of this new customer but mrs cole as soon as we were conveniently alone insured me in virtue of her long experience in these matters â€œthat for this bout my charms had not missed fire for by his eagerness his manner and looks she was sure he had it the only point now in doubt was his character and circumstances which her knowledge of the town would soon gain her the sufficient acquaintance with to take measure uponâ€  and effectively in a few hours her intelligence served her so well that she learned that this conquest of mine was no other than mr norbert a gentleman originally of great fortune which with a constitution naturally not the best he had vastly impaired by his overviolent pursuit of the vices of the town in the course of which having worn out and staled all the more common modes of debauchery he had fallen into a taste of maidenhunting in which chase he had ruined a number of girls sparing no expense to compass his ends and generally using them well till tired or cooled by enjoying or springing a new face he could with more ease disembarrass himself of the old ones and resign them to their fate as his sphere of achievements of that sort lay only amongst such as he could proceed with by way of bargain and sale  concluding from these premises mrs cole observed that a character of this sort was ever a lawful prize that the sin would be not to make the best of our market of him and that she thought such a girl as i only too good for him at any rate and on any terms  she went then at the hour appointed to his lodgings in one of our inns of court which were furnished in a taste of grandeur that had a special eye to all the conveniences of luxury and pleasure here she found him in ready waiting and after finishing her business of pretence and a long conduit of discussions concerning her trade which she said was very bad the qualities of her servants apprentices journeywomen the discourse naturally landed at length on me when mrs cole acting admirably the good old prating gossip who lets every thing escape her when her tongue is set in motion cooked him up a story so plausible of me throwing in every now and then such strokes of art with all the simplest air of nature in praise of my person and temper as finished him finely for her purpose whilst nothing could be better counterfeited than her innocence of his but when now fired and on edge he proceeded to drop hints of his design and views upon me after he had with much confusion and pains brought her to the point she kept as long aloof from it as she thought proper of understanding him without now affecting to pass for a dragoness of virtue by flying out into those violent and ever suspicious passions she stuck with the better grace and effect to the character of a plain good sort of woman that knew no harm and that getting her bread in an honest way was made of stuff easy and flexible enough to be wrought to his ends by his superior skill and address but however she managed so artfully that three or four meetings took place before he could obtain the least favourable hope of her assistance without which he had by a number of fruitless messages letters and other direct trials of my disposition convinced himself there was no coming at me all which too raised at once my character and price with him  regardful however of not carrying these difficulties to such a length as might afford time for starting discoveries or incidents unfavourable to her plan she at last pretended to be won over by mere dint of entreaties promises and above all by the dazzling sum she took care to wind him up to the specification of when it was now even a piece of art to feign at once a yielding to the allurements of a great interest as a pretext for her yielding at all and the manner of it such as might persuade him she had never dipped her virtuous fingers in an affair of that sort  thus she led him through all the gradations of difficulty and obstacles necessary to enhance the value of the prize he aimed at and in conclusion he was so struck with the little beauty i was mistress of and so eagerly bent on gaining his ends of me that he left her no room to boast of her management in bringing him up to her mark he drove so plump of himself into every thing tending to make him swallow the bait not but in other respects mr norbert was not clear sighted enough or that he did not perfectly know the town and even by experience the very branch of imposition now in practice upon him but we had his passion our friend so much he was so blinded and hurried on by it that he would have thought any undeception a very ill office done to his pleasure thus concurring even precipitately to the point she wanted him at mrs cole brought him at last to hug himself on the cheap bargain he considered the purchase of my imaginary jewel was to him at no more than three hundred guineas to myself and a hundred to the brokers being a slender recompense for all her pains and all the scruples of conscience she had now sacrificed to him for this first time of her life which sums were to be paid down on the nail upon delivery of my person exclusive of some no inconsiderable presents that had been made in the course of the negociation during which i had occasionally but sparingly been introduced into his company at proper times and hours in which it is incredible how little it seemed necessary to strain my natural disposition to modesty higher in order to pass it upon him for that a very maid all my looks and gestures ever breathing nothing but that innocence which the men so ardently require in us for no other end than to feast themselves with the pleasure of destroying it and which they are so grievously with all their skill subject to mistakes in  when the articles of the treaty had been fully agreed on the stipulated payments duly secured and nothing now remained but the execution of the main point which centered in the surrender of my person up to his free disposal and use mrs cole managed her objections especially to his lodgings and insinuations so nicely that it became his own mere notion and urgent request that this copy of a wedding should be finished at her house â€œat first indeed she did not care not she to have such doings in it she would not for a thousand pounds have any of the servants or apprentices know it her precious good name would be gone for everâ€ with the like excuses however on superior objections to all other expedients whilst she took care to start none but those which were most liable to them it came round at last to the necessity of her obliging him in that conveniency and of doing a little more where she had already done so much  the night then was fixed with all possible respect to the eagerness of his impatience and in the mean time mrs cole had omitted no instructions nor even neglected any preparation that might enable me to come off with honour in regard to the appearance of my virginity except that favoured as i was by nature with all the narrowness of stricture in that part requisite to conduct my designs i had no occasion to borrow those auxiliaries of art that create a momentary one easily discovered by the test of a warm bath and as to the usual sanguinary symptoms of defloration which if not always are generally attendants on it mrs cole had made me the mistress of an invention of her own which could hardly miss its effect and of which more in its place  every thing then being disposed and fixed for mr norberts reception he was at the hour of eleven at night with all the mysteries of silence and secrecy let in by mrs cole herself and introduced into her bedchamber where in an oldfashioned bed of hers i lay fully undressed and panting if not with the fears of a real maid at least with those perhaps greater of a dissembled one which gave me an air of confusion and bashfulness that maidenmodesty had all the honour of and was indeed scarce distinguishable from it even by less partial eyes than those of my lover so let me call him for i ever thought the term â€œcullyâ€ too cruel a reproach to the men for their abused weakness for us  as soon as mrs cole after the old gossipery on these occasions used to young women abandoned for the first time to the will of man had left us alone in her room which by the bye was well lighted up at his previous desire that seemed to bode a stricter examination than he afterwards made mr norbert still dressed sprung towards the bed where i got my head under the clothes and defended them a good while before he could even get at my lips to kiss them so true it is that a false virtue on this occasion even makes  greater rout and resistance than a true one from thence he descended to my breasts the feel i disputed tooth and nail with him till tired with my resistance and thinking probable to give a better account to me he hurried his clothes off in an instant and came into bed  mean while by the glimpse i stole of him i could easily discover a person far from promising any such doughty performances as the storming of maidenheads generally requires and whose flimsy consumptive texture gave him more the air of an invalid that was pressed than of a volunteer on such hot service  at scarce thirty he had already reduced his strength of appetite down to a wretched dependance on forced provocatives very little seconded by the natural power of a body jaded and racked off to the less by constant repeated over draughts of pleasure which had done the work of sixty winters on his springs of live leaving him at the same time all the fire and head of youth in his imagination which served at once to torment and spur him down the precipice  as soon as he was in bed he threw off the bedclothes which i suffered him to force from my hold and i now lay as exposed as he could wish not only to his attacks but his visitation of the sheets where in the various agitations of the body through my endeavours to defend myself he could easily assure himself there was no preparation though to do him justice he seemed a less strict examinant than i had apprehended from so experienced a practitioner my shift then he fairly tore open finding i made too much use of it to barricade my breasts as well as the more important avenue yet in every thing else he proceeded with all the marks of tenderness and regard to me whilst the art of my play was to shew none for him i acted them all the niceties apprehensions and terrors supposable for a girl perfectly innocent to feel at so great a novelty as a naked man in bed with her for the first time he scarce even obtained a kiss but what he ravished i put his hand away twenty times from my breasts where he had satisfied himself of their hardness and consistence with passing for hitherto unhandled goods but when grown impatient upon the main point he now threw himself upon me and first trying to examine me with his finger sought to make himself further way i complained of his usage bitterly â€œi thought he would not have served a body so i was ruined i did not know what i had done i would get up so i wouldâ€ and at the same time kept my thighs so fast locked that it was not for strength like his to force them open or do any good finding thus my advantages and that i had both my own and his motions at command the deceiving him came so easy that it was perfectly playing upon velvet in the mean time his machine which was one of those sizes that slip in and out without being minded kept pretty stiffly bearing against that part which the shutting my thighs barred access to but finding at length he could do no good by mere dint of bodily strength he resorted to entreaties and arguments to which i only answered with a tone of shame and timidity â€œthat i was afraid he would kill me lord would not be served so i was never so used in all my born days i wondered he was not ashamed of himself so i didâ€ with such silly infantine moods of repulse and complaint as i judged best adapted to express the character of innocence and affright pretending however to yield at length to the vehemence of his insistence in action and words i sparing disclosed my thighs so that he could just touch the cloven inlet with the tip of his instrument but as he fatigued and toiled to get in a twist of my body so as to receive it obliquely not only thwarted his admission but giving a scream as if he had pierced me to the heart i shook him off me with such violence that he could not with all his might to it keep the saddle vexed indeed at this he seemed but not in the style of displeasure with me for my skittishness on the contrary i dare swear he held me the dearer and hugged himself for the difficulties that even hurt his instant pleasure fired however now beyond all bearance of delay he remounts and begged of me to have patience stroking and soothing me to it by all the tenderest endearments and protestations of what he would moreover do for me at which feigning to be somewhat softened and abating of the anger that i had shewn at his hurting me so prodigiously i suffered him to lay my thighs aside and make way for a new trial but i watched the directions and management of his point so well that no sooner was the orifice in the least open to it but i gave such a timely jerk as seemed to proceed not from the evasion of his entry but from the pain his efforts at it put me to a circumstance too that i did not fail to accompany with proper gestures sighs and cries of complaint of which â€œthat he had hurt me he killed me i should dieâ€ were the most frequent interjections but now after repeated attempts in which he had not made the least impression towards gaining his point at least for that time the pleasure rose so fast upon him that he could not check or delay it and in the vigour and fury which the approaches of the height of it inspired him he made one fiercethrust that had almost put me by my guard and lodged it so far that i could feel the warm inspersion just within the exterior orifice which i had the cruelty not to let him finish there but threw him out again not without a most piercing loud exclamation as if the pain had put me beyond all regard of being overheard it was then easy to observe that he was more satisfied more highly pleased with the supposed motives of his baulk of consummation than he would havebeen at the full attainment of it it was on this foot that i solved to myself all the falsity i employed to procure him that blissful pleasure in it which most certainly he would not have tasted in the truth of things eased however and relieved by one discharge he now applied himself to sooth encourage and to put me into humour and patience to bear his next attempt which he began to prepare and gather force for from all the incentives of the touch and sight which he could think of by examining every individual part of my whole body which he declared his satisfaction with in raptures of applause kisses universally imprinted and sparing no part of me in all the eagerest wantonness of feeling seeing and toying his vigour however did not return so soon and i felt him more than once pushing at the door but so little in a condition to break in that i question whether he had the power to enter had i held it ever so open but this he then thought me too little acquainted with the nature of things to have any regret or confusion about and he kept fatiguing himself and me for a long time before he was in any state to resume his attacks with any prospect of success and then i breathed him so warmly and kept him so at bay that before he had made any sensible progress in point of penetration he was deliciously sweated and wearied out indeed so that it was deep in the morning before he achieved his second letgo about half way of entrance i all the while crying and complaining of his prodigious vigour and the immensity of what i appeared to suffer splitting up with tired however at length with such athletic drudgery my champion began now to give out and to gladly embrace the refreshment of some rest kissing me then with much affection and recommending me to my repose he presently fell fast asleep which as soon as i had well satisfied myself of i with much composure of body so as not to wake him by any motion with much ease and safety too played of mrs coles device for perfecting the signs of my virginity in each of the head bedposts just above where the bedsteads are inserted into them there was a small drawer so artfully adapted to the mouldings of the timberwork that it might have escaped even the most curious search which drawers were easily opened or shut by the touch of a spring and were fitted each with a shallow glass tumbler full of a prepared fluid blood in which lay soaked for ready use a sponge that required no more than gently reaching the hand to it taking it out and properly squeezing between the thighs when it yelded a great deal more of the red liquid than would save a girls honour after which replacing it and touching the spring all possibility of discovery or even of suspicion was taken away and this was not the work of the fourth part of a minute and of which ever side one lay the thing was equally easy and practicable by the double care taken to have each bedpost provided alike true it is that had he waked and caught me in the act it would at least have covered me with shame and confusion but them that he did not was with the precautions i took a risk of a thousand to one in my favour  at ease now and out of all fear of any doubt or suspicion on his side i addressed myself in good earnest to my repose but could obtain none and in about half an hours time my gentleman waked again and turning towards me i feigned a sound sleep which he did not long respect but girding himself again to renew the onset he began to kiss and caress me when now making as if i just waked i complained of the disturbance and of the cruel pain that this little rest had stole my senses from eager however for the pleasure as well of consummating an entire triumph over my virginity he said every thing that could overcome my resistance and bribe my patience to the end which now i was ready to listen to from being secure of the bloody proofs i had prepared of his victorious violence though i still thought it good policy not to let him in yet a while i answered then only to his importunities in sighs and moans â€œthat i was so hurt i could not bear it i was sure he had done me a mischief that he had he was such a bad manâ€ at this turning down the clothes and viewing the field of battle by the glimmer of a dying taper he saw plainly my thighs shift and sheet all stained with what he readily took for a virgin effusion proceeding from his last half penetration convinced and transported at which nothing could equal his joy and exultation the illusion was complete no other conception entered his head but that of his having been at work upon an unopened mine which idea upon so strong an evidence redoubled at once his tenderness for me and his ardour for breaking it wholly up kissing me then with the utmost rapture he comforted me and begged my pardon for the pain he had put me to observing withal that it was only a thing in course but the worst was certainly past and that with a little courage and constancy i should get it once well over and never after experience any thing but the greatest pleasure by little and little i suffered myself to be prevailed on and giving as it were up to the point of him i made my thighs insensibly spreading them yield him liberty of access which improving he got a little within me when by a well managed reception i worked the female screw so nicely that i kept him from the easy midchannel direction and by dexterous wreathing and contortions creating an artificial difficulty of entrance made him win it inch by inch with the most laborious struggles i all the while sorely complaining till at length with might and main winding his way in he got it completely home and giving my virginity as he thought the coup le grace furnished me with the cue of setting up a terrible outcry whilst he triumphant and like a cock clapping his wings over his downtrod mistress pursued his pleasure which presently rose in virtue of this idea of a complete victory to a pitch that made me soon sensible of his melting period whilst i now lay acting the deep wounded breathless frightened undone no longer maid  you would ask me perhaps whether all this time i enjoyed any perception of pleasure i assure you little or none till just towards the latter end a faintish sense of it came on mechanically from so long a struggle and frequent fret in that ever sensible part but in the first place i had no taste for the person i was suffering the embraces of on a pure mercenary account and then i was not entirely delighted with myself for the jades part i was playing whatever excuses i might plead for my being brought into it but then this insensibility kept me so much the mistress of my mind and motions that i could the better manage so close a counterfeit through the whole scene of deception  recovered at length to a more shew of life by his tender condolences kisses and embraces i upbraided him and reproached him with my ruin in such natural terms as added to his satisfaction with himself for having accomplished it and guessing by certain observations of mine that it would be rather favourable to him to spare him when he some time after feebly enough came on again to the assault i resolutely withstood any further endeavours on a pretext that flattered his prowess of my being so violently hurt and sore that i could not possibly endure a fresh trial he then graciously granted me a respite and the next morning soon after advancing i got rid of further importunity till mrs cole being rung for by him came in and was made acquainted in terms of the utmost joy and rapture with his triumphant certainty of my virtue and the finishing stroke he had given it in the course of the night of which he added she would see proof enough in bloody characters on the sheets  you may guess how a woman of her turn of address and experience humoured the jest and played him off with mixed exclamations of shame danger compassion for me and of her being pleased that all was so well over in which last i believe she was certainly sincere and now as the objection which she had represented as an invincible one to me lying the first night at his lodgings which were studiously calculated for freedom of intrigues on the account of my maiden fears and terrors at the thought of going to a gentlemans chambers and being alone with him in bed was surmounted she pretended to persuade me in favour to him that i should go there to him whenever he pleased and still keep up all the necessary appearances of working with her that i might not lose with my character the prospect of getting a good husband and at the same time her house would be kept safer from scandal all this seemed so reasonable so considerate to mr norbert that he never once perceived that she did not want him to resort to her house lest he might in time discover certain inconsistencies with the character she had set out with to him besides that this plan greatly flattered his own ease and views of liberty  leaving me then to my much wanted rest he got up and mrs cole after settling with him all points relating to me got him undiscovered out of the house after which as i was awake she came in and gave me due praises for my success behaving too with her usual moderation and disinterestedness she refused any share of the sum i had thus earned and put me into such a secure and easy way of disposing of my affairs which now amounted to a kind of little fortune that a child of ten years old might have kept the account and property of them safe in its hands  i was now restored again to my former state of a kept mistress and used punctually to wait on mr norbert at his chambers whenever he sent a messenger for me which i constantly took care to be in the way of and managed with so much caution that he never once penetrated the nature of my connections with mrs cole but indolently given up to ease and the town dissipations the perpetual hurry of them hindered him from looking into his own affairs much less to mine  in the mean time if i may judge from my own experience none are better paid or better treated during their reign than the mistress of those who enervate by nature debaucheries or age have the least employment for the sex sensible that a woman must be satisfied some way they ply her with a thousand little tender attentions presents caresses confidences and exhaust their inventions in means and devices to make up for the capital deficiency and even towards lessening that what arts what modes what refinements of pleasure have they not recourse to to raise their languid powers and press nature into the service of their sensuality but here is their misfortune that when by a course of teasing worrying handling wanton postures lascivious motions they have at length accomplished a flashy enervate enjoyment they at the same time light up a flame in the object of their passion that not having the means themselves to quench drives her for relief into the next persons arms who can finish their work and thus they become bawds to some favourite tried and approved of for a more vigorous and satisfactory execution for with women of our turn especially however well our hearts may be disposed there is a controlling part or queenseat in us that governs itself by its own maxims of state amongst which not one is stronger in practice with it than in the matter of is dues never to accept the will for the deed  mr norbert who was much in this ungracious case though he professed to like me extremely could but seldom consummate the mainjoy itself with me without such a length and variety of preparations as were at once wearisome and inflammatory  sometimes he would strip me stark naked on a carpet by a good fire when he would contemplate me almost by the hour disposing me in all the figures and attitudes of body that it was susceptible of being viewed in kissing me in every part the most secret and critical one so far from excepted that it received most of that branch of homage then his touches were so exquisitely wanton so luxuriously diffused and penetrative at times that he had made me perfectly rage with titillating fires when after all and much ado he had gained a shortlived erection he would perhaps melt it away in a washy sweat or a premature abortive effusion that provokingly mocked my eager desires or if carried home how faultered and unnervous the execution how insufficient the sprinkle of a few heatdrops to extinguish all the flames he had kindled  one evening i cannot help remembering that returning home from him with a spirit he had raised in a circle his wand had proved too weak to lay as i turned the corner of a street i was overtaken by a young sailor i was then in that spruce neat plain dress which i ever affected and perhaps might have in my trip a certain air of restlessness unknown to the composure of cooler thoughts however he seized me as a prize and without farther ceremony threw his arms round my neck and kissed me boisterously and sweetly i looked at him with a beginning of anger and indignation at his rudeness that softened away into other sentiments as i viewed him for he was tall manly carriaged handsome of body and face so that i ended my stare with asking him in a tone turned to tenderness what he meant at which with the same frankness and vivacity as he had begun with me he proposed treating me with a glass of wine now certain it is that had i been in a calmer state of blood than i was had i not been under the dominion of unappeased irritation but i do not know how it was my pressing calls his figure the occasion and if you will the powerful combination of all these with a start of curiosity to see the end of an adventure so novel too as being treated like a common streetplyer made me give a silent consent in short it was not my head that i now obeyed i suffered myself to be towed along as it were by this manofwar who took me under his arm as familialry as if he had known me all his lifetime and led me into the next convenient tavern where we were shown into a little room on one side of the passage here scarce allowing himself patient till the drawer brought in the wine called for he fell directly on board me when untucking my handkerchief and giving me a snatching buss he laid my breasts bare at once which he handled with that keenness of gust that abridges a ceremonial evermore tiresome than pleasing on such pressing occasions and now hurrying towards the main point we found no conveniency to our purpose two or three disabled chairs and a rickety table composing the whole furniture of the room without more ado he plans me with my back standing against the wall and my petticoats up and coming out with a splitter indeed made it shine as he brandished it in my eyes and going to work with an impetuosity and eagerness bred very likely by a long fast at seat went to give me a taste of it i straddled i humoured my posture and did my best in short to buckle to it i took part of it in but still things did not go to his thorough liking changing them in a trice his system of battery he leads me to the table and with a masterhand lays my head down on the edge of it and with the other canting up my petticoats and shift bares my naked posteriors to his blind and furious guide it forces its way between them and i feeling pretty sensibly that it was not going by the right door and knocking desperately at the wrong one i told him of itâ€â€œpoohâ€ says he â€œmy dear any port in a stormâ€ altering however directly his course and lowering his point he fixed it right and driving it up with a delicious stiffness made all foam again and gave me the tout with such fire and spirit that in the fine disposition i was in when i submitted to him and stirred up so fiercely as i was i got the start of him and went away into the melting swoon and squeezing him whilst in the convulsive grasp of it drew from him such a plenteous bedewal as pointed to my own effusion perfectly floated those parts and drowned in a deluge all my raging conflagration of desire  when this was over how to make my retreat was my concern for though i had been so extremely pleased with the difficult between this warm broadside poured so briskly into me and the tiresome pawing and toying to which i had owed the unappeased flames that had driven me into this step now i was cooler i began to apprehend the danger of contracting an acquaintance with this however agreeable stranger who on his side spoke of passing the evening with me and continuing our intimacy with an air of determination that made me afraid of its being not so easy to get away from him as i could wish in the mean time i carefully concealed my uneasiness and readily pretended to consent to stay with him telling him i should only step to my lodgings to leave a necessary direction and then instantly return this he very glibly swallowed on the notion of my being one of those unhappy streeterrants who devote themselves to the pleasure of the first ruffian that will stoop to pick them up and of course that i would scarce bilk myself of the hire by not returning make the most of the job thus he parted with me not before however he had ordered in my hearing a supper which i had the barbarity to disappoint him of my company too  but when i got home and told mrs cole my adventure she represented so strongly to me the nature and dangerous consequences of my folly particularly the risks to my health in being so openlegged and free that i not only took resolutions never to venture so rashly again which i inviolably preserved but passed a good many days in continual uneasiness lest i should have met with other reasons besides the pleasure of that rencounter to remember it but these fears wronged my pretty sailor for which i gladly make him this reparation  i had now lived with mr norbert near a quarter of a year in which space i circulated my time very pleasantly between my amusements at mrs coles and a proper attendance on that gentleman who paid me profusely for the unlimited complaisance with which i passively humoured every caprice of pleasure and which had won upon him so greatly that finding as he said all that variety in me alone which he had sought for in a number of women i had made him lose his taste for inconstancy and new faces but what was yet at least agreeable as well as more flattering the love i had inspired him with bred a deference to me that was of great service to his health for having by degrees and with much pathetic representations brought him to some husbandry of it and to insure the duration of his pleasures by moderating their use and correcting those excesses in them he was so addicted to and which had shattered his constitution and destroyed his powers of life in the very point for which he seemed desirous to live he was grown more delicate more temperate and in course more healthy his gratitude for which was taking a turn very favourable for my fortune when once more the caprice of it dashed the cup from my lips  his sister lady l for whom he had a great affection desiring him to accompany her down to bath for her health he could not refuse her such a favour and accordingly though he counted on staying away from me no more than a week at farthest he took his leave of me with an ominous heaviness of heart and left me a sum far above the state of his fortune and very inconsistent with the intended shortness of his journey but it ended in the longest that can be and is never but once taken for arrived at bath he was not there two days before he fell into a debauch of drinking with some gentlemen that threw him into a high fever and carried him off in four days time never once out of a delirium had he been in his senses to make a will perhaps he might have made favourable mention of me in it thus however i lost him and as no condition of life is more subject to revolutions than that of a woman of pleasure i soon recovered my cheerfulness and now beheld myself once more struck off the list of kept mistresses and returned into the bosom of the community from which i had been in some manner taken  mrs cole still continued her friendship and offered me her assistance and advice towards another choice but i was now in ease and affluence enough to look about me at leisure and as to any constitutional calls of pleasure their pressure or sensibility was greatly lessened by a consciousness of the ease with which they were to be satisfied at mrs coles house where louisa and emily still continued in the old way and my great favourite harriet used often to come and see me and entertain me with her head and heart full of the happiness she enjoyed with her dear baronet whom she loved with a tenderness and constancy even though he was her keeper and what is yet more had made her independent by a handsome provision for her and hers i was then in this vacancy from any regular employ of my person in my way of business when one day mrs cole in the course of the constant confidence we lived in acquainted me that there was one mr barville who used her house just come to town whom she was not a little perplexed about providing a suitable companion for which was indeed a point of difficulty as he was under the tyranny of a cruel taste that of an ardent desire not only of being unmercifully whipped himself but of whipping others in such sort that though he paid extravagantly those who had the courage and complaisance to submit to his humour there were few delicate as he was in the choice of his subjects who would exchange turns with him so terribly at the expense of their skin but what yet increased the oddity of this strange fancy was the gentleman being young whereas it generally attacks it seems such as are through age obliged to have recourse to this experiment for quickening the circulation of their sluggish juices and determining a conflux of the spirits of pleasure towards those flagging shrivelly parts that rise to life only by virtue of those titillating ardours created by the discipline of their opposites with which they have so surprising a consent  this mrs cole could not well acquaint me with in any expectation of my offering for service for sufficiently easy as i was in my circumstances it must have been the temptation of an immense interest indeed that could have induced me to embrace such a job neither had i ever expressed nor indeed felt the least impulse or curiosity to know more of a taste that promised so much more pain than pleasure to those that stood in no need of such violent goads what then should move me to subscribe myself voluntarily to a party of pain foreknowing it such why to tell the plain truth it was a sudden caprice a gust of fancy for trying a new experiment mixed with the vanity of approving my personal courage to mrs cole that determined me at all risks to propose myself to her and relieve her from any further lookout accordingly i at once pleased and surprised her with a frank and unreserved tender of my person to her and her friends absolute disposal on this occasion  my good temporal mother was however so kind as to use all the arguments she could imagine to dissuade me but as i found they only turned on a motive of tenderness to me i persisted in my resolution and thereby acquitted my offer of any suspicion of its not having been sincerely made or out of compliment only acquiescing then thankfully in it mrs cole assured me â€œthat bating the pain i should be put to she had no scruple to engage me to this party which she assured me i should be liberally paid for and which the secrecy of the transaction preserved safe from the ridicule that otherwise vulgarly attended it that for her part she considered pleasure of one sort or other as the universal port of destination and every wind that blew thither a good one provided it blew nobody any harm that she rather compassionated than blamed those unhappy persons who are under a subjection they cannot shake off to those arbitrary tastes that rule their appetites of pleasures with an unaccountable control tastes too as infinitely diversified as superior to and independent of all reasoning as the different relishes or palates of mankind in their viands some delicate stomach nauseating plain meats and finding no savour but in highseasoned luxurious dishes whilst others again pique themselves upon detesting themâ€  i stood now in no need of this preamble of encouragement or justification my word was given and i was determined to fulfill my engagements accordingly the night was set and i had all the necessary previous instructions how to act and conduct myself the dining room was duly prepared and lighted up and the young gentleman posted there in waiting for my introduction to him  i was then by mrs cole brought in and presented to him in a loose dishabille fitted by her direction to the exercise i was to go through all in the finest linen and a thorough white uniform gown petticoat stocking and satin slippers like a victim led to sacrifice whilst my dark auburn hair falling in dropcurls over my neck created a pleasing distinction of colour from the rest of my dress  as soon as mr barville saw me he got up with a visible air of pleasure and surprise and saluting me asked mrs cole if so fine and delicate a creature would voluntarily submit to such sufferings and rigours as were the subject of his assignation she answered him properly and now reading in his eyes that she could not too soon leave us together she went out after recommending to him to use moderation with so tender a novice  but whilst she was employing his attention mine had been taken up with examining the figure and person of this unhappy young gentleman who was thus unaccountably condemned to have his pleasure lashed into him as boys have their learning  he was exceedingly fair and smooth complexioned and appeared to me no more than twenty at most though he was three years older than what my conjectures gave him but then he owed this favourable mistake to a habit of fatness which spread through a short squab stature and a round plump fresh coloured face gave him greatly the look of a bacchus had not an air of austerity not to say sternness very unsuitable even to his shape of face dashed that character of joy necessary to complete the resemblance his dress was extremely neat but plain and far inferior to the ample fortune he was in full possession of this too was a taste in him and not avarice  as soon as mrs cole was gone he seated me near him when now his face changed upon me into an expression of the most pleasing sweetness and good humour the most remarkable for its sudden shift from the other extreme which i found afterwards when i knew more of his character was owing to a habitual state of conflict with and dislike of himself for being enslaved to so peculiar a lust by the fatality of a constitutional ascendant that rendered him incapable of receiving any pleasure till he submitted to these extraordinary means of procuring it at the hands of pain whilst the constancy of this repining consciousness stamped at length that cast of sourness and severity on his features which was in fact very foreign to the natural sweetness of his temper  after a competent preparation by apologies and encouragement to go through my part with spirit and constancy he stood up near the fire whilst i went to fetch the instruments of discipline out of a closet hard by these were several rods made each of two or three strong twigs of birch tied together which he took handled and viewed with as much pleasure as i did with a kind of shuddering presage  next we took from the side of the room a long broad bench made easy to lie at length on by a soft cushion in a callicocover and everything being now ready he took his coat and waistcoat off and at his motion and desire i unbuttoned his breeches and rolling up his shirt rather above his waist tucked it on securely there when directing naturally my eyes to that humoursone mastermovement in whose favour all these dispositions were making it seemed almost shrunk into his body scarce showing its tip above the sprout of hairy curls that clothed those parts as you may haveseen a wren peeping its head out of the grass  stooping them to untie his garters he gave them to me for the use of tying him down to the legs of the bench a circumstance no farther necessary than as i suppose it made part of the humour of the thing since he prescribed it to himself amongst the rest of the ceremonial  i led him then to the bench and according to my cue played at forcing him to lie down which aftersome little show of reluctance for formsake he submitted to he was straightway extended flat upon his belly on the bench with a pillow under his face and as he thus tamely lay i tied him slightly hand and feet to the legs of it which done his shirt remaining trussed up over the small of his back i drew his breeches quite down to his knees and now he lay in all the fairest broadest display of that part of the backview in which a pair of chubby smoothcheeked and passing white posteriors rose cushioning upwards from two stout fleshful thighs and ending their cleft or separation by an union at the small of the back presented a bold mark that swelled as it were to meet the scourge  seizing now one of the rods i stood over him and according to his direction gave him in one breath ten lashes with much goodwill and the utmost nerve and vigour of arm that i could put to them so as to make those fleshy orbs quiver again under them whilst he himself seemed no more concerned or to mind them than a lobster would a fleabite in the mean time i view intently the effect of them which to me at last appeared surprisingly cruel every lash had skimmed the surface of those white cliffs which they deeply reddened and lapping round the side of the furthermost from me cut specially into the dimple of it such livid weals as the blood either spun out from or stood in large drops on and from some of the cuts i picked out even the splinters of the rod that had stuck in the skin nor was this raw work to be wondered at considering the greenness of the twigs and the severity of the infliction whilst the whole surface of the skin was so smoothstretched over the hard and firm pulp of flesh that filled it as to yield no play or elusive swagging under the stroke which thereby took place the more plump and cut into the quick  i was however already so moved at the piteous sight that i from my heart repented the undertaking and would willing had given over thinking he had full enough but he encouraging and beseeching me earnestly to proceed i gave him ten more lashes and then resting surveyed the increase of bloody appearances and at length steeled to the height by his stoutness in suffering i continued the discipline by intervals till i observed him wreathing and twisting his body in a way that i could plainly perceive was not the effect of pain but of some new and powerful sensation curious to dive into the meaning of which in one of my pauses of intermission i approached as he still kept working and grinding his belly against the cushion under him and first stroking the untouched and unhurt side of the fleshmount next me then softly insinuating my hand under his thigh felt the posture things were in forwards which was indeed surprising for that machine of him which i had by its appearance taken for an impalpable or at least a very diminutive subject was now in virtue of all that smart and havoc of his skin behind grown not only to a prodigious stiffness of erection but to a size that frighted even me a nonpareil thickness indeed the head of it alone filled the utmost capacity of my grasp and when as he heaved and wriggled to and fro in the agitation of his strange pleasure it came into view it had something of the air of a round fillet of veal and like its owner squab and short in proportion to its breadth but when he felt my hand there he begged i would go on briskly with my jerking or he should never arrive at the last stage of pleasure  resuming then the rode and the exercise of it i had fairly worn out three bundles when after an increase of struggles and motion and a deep sigh or two i saw him lie still and motionless and now he desired me to desist which i instantly did and proceeding to untie him i could not but be amazed at his passive fortitude on viewing the skin of his butchered mangled posteriors late so white smooth and polished now all one side of them a confused cutwork of weals livid flesh gashes and gore insomuch that when he stood up he could scarce walk in short he was in sweetbriars  then i plainly perceived on the cushion the marks of a plenteous effusion and already had his sluggard member run up to its old nestlingplace and enforced itself again as if ashamed to shew its head which nothing it seems could raise but stripes inflicted on its opposite neighbours who were thus constantly obliged to suffer for his caprice  my gentleman had now put on his clothes and recomposed himself when giving me a kiss and placing me by him he sat himself down as gingerly as possible with one side off the cushion which was too sore for him to bear resting any part of his weight on  here he thanked me for the extreme pleasure i had procured him and seeing perhaps some marks in my countenance of terror and apprehension of retaliation on my own skin for what i had been the instrument of his suffering in his he assured me â€œhe was ready to give up to me any engagement i might deem myself under to stand him as he had done me but that if i proceeding in my consent to it he would consider the difference of my sex its greater delicacy and incapacity to undergo painâ€ reheartened at which and piqued in honour as i thought not to flinch so near the trial especially as i well knew mrs cole was an eyewitness from her stand of espial to the whole of our transaction i was now less afraid of my skin than of his not furnishing me with an opportunity of signalizing my resolution  consonant to this disposition was my answer but my courage was still more in my head than in my heart and as cowards rush into danger they fear in order to be the sooner rid of the pain of that sensation i was entirely pleased with his hastening matters into execution  he had then little to do but to unloose the strings of my petticoats and lift them together with my shift navelhigh where he just tucked them up loosely and might be slipt up higher at pleasure then viewing me round with great seeming delight he laid me at length on my face upon the bench and when i expected he would tie me as i had done him and held out my hands not without fear and a little trembling he told me â€œhe would by no means terrify me unnecessarily with such a confinement for that though he meant to put my constancy to a trial the standing it was to be completely voluntary on my side and therefore i might be at full liberty to get up whenever i found the pain too much for meâ€ you cannot imagine how much i thought myself bound by being thus allowed to remain loose and how much spirit this confidence in me gave me so that i was even from my heart careless how much my flesh might suffer in honour of it  all my back parts naked half way up were now fully at his mercy and first he stood at a convenient distance delighting himself with a gloating survey of the attitude i lay in and of all the secret stores i thus exposed to him in fair display then springing eagerly towards me he covered all those naked parts with a fond profusion of kisses and now taking hold of the rod rather wantoned with me in gentle inflictions on those tender trembling masses of my flesh behind than in any way hurt them till by degrees he began to tingle them with smarter lashes so as to provoke a red colour into them which i knew as well by the flagrant glow i felt there as by his telling me they now emulated the native roses of my other cheeks when he had thus amused himself with admiring and toying with them he went on to strike harder and more hard so that i needed all my patience not to cry out or complain at least at last he twigged me so smartly as to fetch blood in more than one lash at sight of which he flung down the rod flew to me kissed away the starting drops and sucking the wounds eased a good deal of my pain but now raising me on my knees and making me kneel with them straddling wide that tender part of me naturally the province of pleasure not of pain came in for its share of suffering for now eyeing it wistfully he directed the rod so that the sharp ends of the twigs lighted there so sensibly that i could not help wincing and writhing my limbs with smart so that my contortions of body must necessarily throw it into infinite variety of postures and points of view fit to feast the luxury of the eye but still i bore every thing without crying out when presently giving me another pause he rushed as it were on that part whose lips and round about had felt this cruelty and by way of reparation glued his own to them then he opened shut squeezed them plucked softly the overgrowing moss and all this in a style of wild passionate rapture and enthusiasm that expressed excess of pleasure till betaking himself to the rod again encouraged by my passiveness and infuriated with this strange taste of delight he made my poor posteriors pay for the ungovernableness of it for now showing them no quarter the traitor cut me so that i wanted but little of fainting away when he gave over and yet i did not utter one groan or angry expostulation but in my heart i resolved nothing so seriously as never to expose myself again to the like severities  you may guess then in what a curious pickle those soft fleshcushions of mine were all so red raw and in fine terribly clawed off but so far from feeling any pleasure in it that the recent smart made me pout a little and not with the greatest air of satisfaction receive the compliments and aftercaresses of the author of my pain  as soon as my clothes were huddled on in a little decency a supper was brought in by the discreet mrs cole herself which might have piqued the sensuality of a cardinal accompanied with a choice of the richest wines all which she set before us and went out again without having by a word or even by a smile given us the least interruption or confusion in those moments of secrecy that we were not yet ripe to the admission of a third too  i sat down then still scarce in charity with my butcher for such i could not help considering him and was moreover not a little piqued at the gay satisfied air of his countenance which i thought myself insulted by but when the now necessary refreshment to me of a glass of wine and a little eating all the time observing a profound silence had somewhat cheered and restored me to spirits and as the smart began to go off my good humour returned accordingly which alteration not escaping him he said and did every thing that could confirm me in and indeed exalt it  but scarce was supper well over before a change so incredible was wrought in me such violent yet pleasingly irksome sensations took possession of me that i scarce knew how to contain myself the smart of the lashes was now converted into such a prickly heat such fiery tinglings as made me sigh squeeze my thighs together shift and wriggle about my seat with a furious restlessness whilst these itching ardours thus excited in those parts on which the storm of discipline had principally fallen detached legions of burning subtile stimulating spirits to their opposite spot and centre of assemblage where their titillation raged so furiously that i was even stinging made with them no wonder then that in such a taking and devoured by flames that licked up all modesty and reserve my eyes now charged brimful of the most intense desire fired on my companion very intelligible signal of distress my companion i say who grew in them every instant more amiable and more necessary to my urgent wishes and hopes of immediate ease  mr barville no stranger by experience to these situations soon knew the pass i was brought to soon perceived my extreme disorder in favour of which removing the table out of the way he began a prelude that flattered me with instant relief to which i was not however so near as i imagined for as he was unbuttoned to me and tried to provoke and rouse to action his unactive torpid machine he blushingly owned that no good was to be expected from it unless i took it in hand to reexcite its languid loitering powers by just refreshing the smart of the yet recent bloodraw cuts seeing it could no more than a boys top keep up without lashing sensible then that i should work as much for my own profit as his i hurried my compliance with his desire and abridging the ceremonial whilst he leaned his head against the back of a chair i had scarce gently made him feel the lash before i saw the object of my wishes give signs of life and presently as it were with a magic touch is started up into a noble size and distinction indeed hastening then to give me the benefit of it he threw me down on the bench but such was the refreshed soreness of those parts behind on my leaning so hard on them as became me to compass the admission of that stupendous head of his machine that i could not possibly bear it i got up then and tried by leaning forwards and turning the crupper on my assailant to let him at the back avenue but here it was likewise impossible to stand his bearing so fiercely against me in his agitations and endeavours to enter that way whilst his belly battered directly against the recent sore what should we do now both intolerably heated both in a fury but pleasure is ever inventive for its own ends he strips me in a trice stark naked and placing a broad setteecushion on the carpet before the fire oversets me gently topsy turvy on it and handling me only at the waist whilst you may be sure i favoured all my dispositions brought my legs round his neck so that my head was kept from the floor only by my hands and the velvet cushion which was now bespread with my flowing hair thus i stood on my head and hands supported by him in such manner that whilst my thighs clung round him so as to expose to his sight all my back figure including the theatre of his bloody pleasure the centre of my fore pair fairly bearded the objest of its rage that now stood in fine condition to give me satisfaction for the injuries of its neighbours but as this posture was certainly not the easiest and our imaginations wound up to the height could suffer no delay he first with the utmost eagerness and effort just liplodged that broad acornfashioned head of his instrument and still befriended by the fury with which he had made that impression he soon stuffed in the rest when now with a pursuit of thrusts fiercely urged he absolutely overpowered and absorbed all sense of pain and uneasiness whether from my wounds behind my most untoward posture or the oversize of his stretcher in an infinitely predominant delight when now all my whole spirits of life and sensation rushing impetuously to the cockpit where the prize of pleasure was hotly in dispute and clustering to a point there i soon received the dear relief of nature from these overviolent strains and provocations of it harmonizing with which my gallant spouted into me such a potent overflow of the balsamic injection as softened and unedged all those irritating stings of a new species of titillation which i had been so intolerably maddened with and restored the ferment of my senses to some degree of composure  i had now achieved this rare adventure ultimately much more to my satisfaction than i had bespoken the nature of it to turn out nor was it much lessened you may think by sparks lavish praises of my constancy and complaisance which he gave weight to by a present that greatly surpassed my utmost expectation besides his gratification to mrs cole  i was not however at any time reenticed to renew with him or resort again to the violent expedient of lashing nature into more haste than good speed which by the way i conceive acts somewhat in the manner of a dose of spanish flies with more pain perhaps but less danger and might be necessary to him but was nothing less so than to me whose appetite wanted the bridle more than the spur  mrs cole to whom this adventurous exploit had more and more endeared me looked on me now as a girl after her own heart afraid of nothing and on a good account hardly enough to fight all the weapons of pleasure through attentive then in consequence of these favourable conceptions to promote either my profit or pleasure she had special regard for the first in a new gallant of a very singular turn that she procured for and introduced to me  this was a grave staid solemn elderly gentleman whose peculiar humour was a delight in combing fine tresses of hair and as i was perfectly headed to his taste he used to come constantly at my toilet hours when i let down my hair as loose as nature and abandoned it to him to do what he pleased with it and accordingly he would keep me an hour or more in play with it drawing the comb through it winding the curls round his fingers even kissing it as he smoothed it and all this led to no other use of my person or any other liberties whatever any more than if a distinction of sexes had not existed  another peculiarity of taste he had which was to present me with a dozen pairs of the whitest kid gloves at a time these he would divert himself with drawing on me and then biting off their finger ends all which fooleries of a silly appetite the old gentleman paid more liberally for than most others did for more essential favours this lasted till a violent cough seizing and laying him up delivered me from this most innocent and insipid trifler for i never heard more of him after his first retreat  you may be sure a byjob of this sort interfered with no other pursuit or plan of life which i led in truth with a modesty and reserve that was less the work of virtue than of exhausted novelty a glut of pleasure and easy circumstances that made me indifferent to any engagements in which pleasure and profit were not eminently united and such i could with the less impatience wait for at the hands of time and fortune as i was satisfied i could never mend my pennyworths having evidently been served at the top of the market and even been pampered with dainties besides that in the sacrifice of a few momentary impulses i found a secret satisfaction in respecting myself as well as preserving the life and freshness of my complexion louisa and emily did not carry indeed their reserve so high as i did but still they were far from cheap or abandoned though two of their adventures seemed to contradict this general character which for their singularity i shall give you in course beginning first with emilys  louisa and she went one night to a ball the first in the habit of a shepherdess emily in that of a shepherd i saw them in their dresses before they went and nothing in nature could represent a prettier boy than this last did being so fair and well limbed they had kept together for some time when louisa meeting an old acquaintance of hers very cordially gives her companion the slip and leaves her under the protection of her boys habit which was not much and of her discretion which was it seems still less emily finding herself deserted sauntered thoughtless about a while and as much for coolness and air as any thing else at length pulled off her mask and went to the sideboard where eyed and marked out by a gentleman in a very handsome domino she was accosted by and fell into chat with him the domino after a little discourse in which emily doubtless distinguished her good nature and easiness more than her wit began to make violent love to her and drawing her insensibly to some benches at the lower end of the masquerade room got her to sit by him where he squeezed her hands pinched her cheeks praised and played with her fine hair admired her complexion and all in a style of courtship dashed with a certain oddity that not comprehending the mystery of poor emily attributed to his falling in with the humour of her disguise and being naturally not the cruellest of her profession began to incline to a parley on those essentials but here was the stress of the joke he took her really for what she appeared to be a smockfaced boy and she forgetting her dress and of course ranging quite wide of his ideas took all those address to be paid to herself as a woman which she precisely owed to his not thinking her one however this double error was pushed to such a height on both sides that emily who saw nothing in him but a gentleman of distinction by those points of dress to which his disguise did not extend warmed too by the wine he had plyed her with and the caresses he had lavished upon her suffered herself to be persuaded to go to a bagnio with him and thus losing sight of mrs coles cautions with a blind confidence put herself into his hands to be carried wherever he pleased for his part equally blinded by his wishes whilst here gregious simplicity favoured his deception more than the most exquisite art could have done he supposed no doubt that he had lighted on some soft simpleton fit for his purpose or some kept minion broken to his hand who understood him perfectly well and entered into his designs but be that as it would he led her to a coach went into it with her and brought her to a very handsome apartment with a bed in it but whether it was a bagnio or not she could not tell having spoken to nobody but himself but when they were alone together and her inamorato began to proceed to those extremities which instantly discover the sex she remarked that no description could paint up to the life the mixture of pique confusion and disappointment that appeared in his countenance joined to the mournful exclamation â€œby heavens a womanâ€ this at once opened her eyes which had been shut in downright stupidity however as if he had meant to retrieve that escape he still continued to toy with and fondle her but with so staring an alteration from extreme warmth into a chill and forced civility that even emily herself could not but take notice of it and now began to wish she had paid more regard to mrs coles premonitions against ever engaging with a stranger and now an excess of timidity succeeded to an excess of confidence and she thought herself so much at his mercy and discretion that she stood passive throughout the whole progress of his prelude for now whether the impressions of so great a beauty had even made him forgive her sex or whether her appearance or figure in that dress still humoured his first illusion he recovered by degrees a good part of his first warmth and keeping emily with her breeches still unbuttoned stript them down to her knees and gently impelling her to lean down with her face against the bedside placed her so that the double way between the double rising behind presented the choice fair to him and he was so fairly set on a misdirection as to give the girl no small alarms for fear of losing a maidenhead she had not dreamt of however her complaints and a resistance gentle but firm checked and brought him to himself again so that turning his steeds head he drove him at length in the right road in which his imagination having probably made the most of those resemblances that flattered his taste he got with much ado to his journeys end after which he led her out himself and walking with her two or three streets length got her a chair when making her a present not any thing inferior to what she could have expected he left her well recommended to the chairmen who on her directions brought her home  this she related to mrs cole and me the same morning not without the visible remains of the fear and confusion she had been in still stamped on her countenance mrs coles remark was that her indiscretion proceeding from a constitutional facility there were little hopes of any thing curing her of it but repeated severe experience mine was that i could not conceive how it was possible for mankind to run into a taste not only universally odious but absurd and impossible to gratify since according to the notions and experience i had of things it was not in nature to force such immense disproportions mrs cole only smiled at my ignorance and said nothing towards my undeception which was not affected but by ocular demonstration some months after which a most singular accident furnished me and which i will here set down that i may not return again to so disagreeable a subject  i had on a visit intended to harriet who had taken lodgings at hamptoncourt hired a chariot to go out thither mrs cole having promised to accompany me but some indispensable business intervening to detain her i was obliged to set out alone and scarce had i got a third of my way before the axletree broke down and i was well off to get out safe and unhurt into a publichouse of a tolerable handsome appearance on the road here the people told me that the stage would come by in a couple of hours at farthest upon which determining to wait for it sooner than lose the jaunt i had got so far forward on i was carried into a very clean decent room up one pair of stairs which i took possession of for the time i had to stay in right of calling for sufficient to do the house justice  here whilst i was amusing myself with looking out of the window a single horsechaise stopt at the door out of which lightly leaped two young gentlemen for so they seemed who came in only as it were to bait and refresh a little for they gave their horse to be held in readiness against they came out and presently i heard the door of the next room where they were let in and called about them briskly and as soon as they were served i could just hear that they shut and fastened the door on the inside  a spirit of curiosity far from sudden since i do not know when i was without it prompted me without any particular suspicion or other drift or view to see what they were and examine their persons and behaviour the partition of our rooms was one of those moveable ones that when taken down served occasionally to lay them into one for the conveniency of as larger company and now my nicest search could not shew me the shadow of a peephole a circumstance which probably had not escaped the review of the parties on the other side whom much it stood upon not to be deceived in it but at length i observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot which i took to conceal some flaw but then it was so high that i was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it which i did as soft as possible and with a point of a bodkin soon pierced it and opened myself espial room sufficient and now applying my eye close i commanded the room perfectly and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about entirely to my imagination in frolic and innocent play  the eldes might be on my nearest guess towards nineteen a tall comely young man in a white fustian frock with a green velvet cape and cut bobwig  the youngest could not be above seventeen fair ruddy completely well made and to say the truth a sweet pretty stripling he was too i fancy a country lad by his dress which was a green plush frock and breeches of the same white waistcoat and stockings a jockey cap with his fellowish hair long and loose in natural curls  but after a look of circumspection which i saw the eldest cast every way round the room probably in too much hurry and heat not to overlook the very small opening i was posted at especially at the height it was whilst my eye close to it kept the light from shining through and betraying it he said something to his companion that presently changed the face of things  for now the elder began to embrace to press and kiss the younger to put his hands into his bosom and give him such manifest signs of an amorous intention as made me conclude the other to be a girl in disguise a mistake that nature kept me in countenance for for she had certainly made one when she gave him the male stamp  in the rashness then of their age and bent as they were to accomplish their project of preposterous pleasure at the risk of the very worst of consequences where a discovery was nothing less than improbable they now proceeded to such lengths as soon satisfied me what they were  for presently the eldest unbuttoned the others breeches and removing the linen barrier brought out to view a white shaft middle sized and scarce fledged when after handling and playing with it a little with other dalliance all received by the boy without other opposition than certain wayward coyness ten timesmore alluring than repulsive he got him so turned round with his face from him to a chair that stood hard by when knowing i suppose his office the ganymede now obsequiously leaned his head against the back of it and projecting his body made a fair mark still covered with his shirt as he thus stood in a side view to me but fronting his companion who presently unmasking his battery produced an engine that certainly deserved to be put to a better use and very fit to confirm me in my disbelief of the possibility of things being pushed to odious extremities which i had built on the disproportion of parts but this disbelief i was now cured of as by my consent all young men should likewise be that their innocence may not be betrayed into such snares for want of knowing the extent of their danger for nothing is more certain than that ignorance of advice is by no means a guard against it  slipping then aside the young lads shirt and tucking it up under his clothes behind he shewed to the open air those globular fleshy eminences that compose the mount peasants of rome and which now with all the narrow vale that intersects them stood displayed and exposed to his attack nor could i without a shudder behold the dispositions he made for it first then moistening well with spittle his instrument obviously to make it glib he pointed he introduced it as i could plainly discern not only from its direction and my losing sight of it but by the writhing twisting and soft murmured complaints of the young sufferer but at length the first straits of entrance being pretty well go through every thing seemed to move and go pretty currently on as on a carpet road without much rub or resistance and now passing one hand round his minions hips he got hold of his redtopped ivory toy that stood perfectly stiff and shewed that if he was like his mother behind he was like his father before this he diverted himself with whilst with the other he wantoned with his hair and leaning forward over his back drew his face from which the boy shook the loose curls that fell over it in the posture he stood him in and brought him towards his so as to receive a long breathed kiss after which renewing his driving and thus continuing to harass his rear the height of the fist came on with its usual symptoms and dismissed the action  the criminal scene they acted i had the patience to see to an end purely that i might gather more facts and certainty against them in my design to do their deserts instant justice and accordingly when they had readjusted themselves and were preparing to go out burning as i was with rage and indignation i jumped down from the chair in order to raise the house upon them but with such an unlucky impetuosity that some nail or ruggedness in the floor caught my foot and flung me on my face with such violence that i fell senseless on the ground and lay there some time before any one came to my relief so that they alarmed i suppose by the noise of my fall had more than the necessary time to make a safe retreat this they effected as i learnt with a precipitation nobody could account for until when come to myself and composed enough to speak i acquainted those of the house with the whole transaction i had been evidence to  when i came home again and told mrs cole this adventure she very sensibly observed to me that â€œthere was no doubt of the due vengeance one time or other overtaking these miscreants however they might escape for the present and that had i been the temporal instrument of it i should have been put to a great deal more trouble and confusion than i imagined that as to the thing itself the less said of it was the better but that though she might be suspected of partiality from its being the common cause of womankind out of whose mouths this practice tended to take something more than bread yet she protested against any mixture of passion with a declaration extorted from her by pure regard to truth which was that whatever effect this infamous passion had in other ages and other countries it seemed a peculiar blessing on our air and climate that there was a plaguespot visibly imprinted on all that are tainted with it in this nation at least for that among numbers of that stamp whom she had known or at least were universally under the scandalous suspicion of it she would not name an exception hardly to one of them whose character was not in all other respects the most worthless and despicable that could be stript of all the manly virtues of their own sex and filled up with only the worst vices and follies of ours that in fine they were scarce less execrable than ridiculous in their monstrous inconsistence of loathing and contemning women and at the same time apeing all their manners airs lisps scuttle and in general all their little modes of affectation which become them at least better than they do these unsexed male missesâ€  but here washing my hands of them i replunge into the stream of my history which i may very properly ingraft a terrible sally of louisas since i had some share in it myself and have besides engaged myself to relate it in point of countenance to poor emily it will add too one more example to thousands in confirmation of the maxim that women get once out of compass there are no lengths of licentiousness that they are not capable of running  one morning then that both mrs cole and emily were gone out for the day and only louisa and i not to mention the housemaid were left in charge of the house whilst we were loitering away the time in looking through the shop windows the son of a poor woman who earned very hard bread indeed by mending of stockings in a stall in the neighbourhood offered us some nosegays ranged round a small basket by selling of which the poor boy eked out his mothers maintenance of them both nor was he fit for any other way of livelihood since he was not only a perfect changeling or idiot but stammered so that there was no understanding even those sounds his halfdozen animals ideas at most prompted him to utter  the boys and servants in the neighbourhood had given him the nickname of goodnatured dick from the soft simpletons doing every thing he was bid at the first word and from his naturally having no turn to mischief then by the way he was perfectly well made stout cleanlimbed tall of his age as strong as a horse and withal pretty featured so that he was not absolutely such a figure to be snuffled at neither if your nicety could in favour of such essentials have dispensed with a face unwashed hair tangled for want of combing and so ragged a plight that he might have disputed points of shew with any heathen philosopher of them all  this boy we had often seen and bought his flowers out of pure compassion and nothing more but just at this time as he stood presenting us his basket a sudden whim a start of wayward fancy seized louisa and without consulting me she calls him in and beginning to examine his nosegays culls out two one for herself another for me and pulling out half a crown very currently gives it him to change as if she had really expected he could have changed it but the boy scratching his head made his signs explain his inability in place of words which he could not with all his struggles articulate  louisa at this says â€œwell my lad come up stairs with me and i will give you your dueâ€ winking at the same time to me and beckoning me to accompany her which i did securing first the streetdoor that by this means together with the shop became wholly the care of the faithful housemaid  as we went up louisa whispered me â€œthat she had conceived a strange longing to be satisfied whether the general rule held good with regard to this changeling and how far nature had made him amends in her best bodily gifts for her denial of the sublimer intellectual ones begin at the same time my assistance in procuring her this satisfactionâ€ a want of complaisance was never my vice and i was so far from opposing this extravagant frolic that now bit with the same maggot and my curiosity conspiring with hers i entered plump into it on my own account  consequently soon as we came into louisas bedchamber whilst she was amusing him with picking out his nosegays i undertook the lead and began the attack as it was not then very material to keep much measures with a mere natural i made presently free with him though at my first motion of meddling his surprise and confusion made him receive my advances but awkwardly nay insomuch that he bashfully shied and shied back a little till encouraging him with my eyes plucking him playfully by the hair sleeking his cheeks and forwarding my point by a number of little wantonnesses i soon turned him familiar and gave nature her sweetest alarm so that aroused and beginning to feel himself we could amidst all the innocent laugh and grin i had provoked him into perceive the fire lighting in his eyes and diffusing over his cheeks blend its glow with that of his blushes the emotion in short of animal pleasure glared distinctly in the simpletons countenance yet struck with the novelty of the scene he did not know which way to look or move but tame passive simpering with his mouth half open in stupid rapture stood and tractably suffered me to do what i pleased with him his basket was dropt out of his hands which louisa took care of  i had now through more than one rent discovered and felt his thighs the skin of which seemed the smoother and fairer for the coarseness and even the dirt of his dress as the teeth of negroes seem the whiter for the surrounded black and poor indeed of habit poor of understanding he was however abundantly rich in personal treasures such as flesh firm plump and replete with the juices of youth and robust wellknit limbs my fingers too had now got within reach of the true the genuine sensitive plant which instead of shrinking from the touch joys to meet it and swells and vegetates under it mine pleasingly informed me that matters were so ripe for the discovery we meditated that they were too mighty for the confinement they were ready to break a waistband that i unskewered and a rag of a shirt that i removed and which could not have covered a quarter of it revealed the whole of the idiots standard of distinction erect in full pride and display but such a one it was positively of so tremendous a size that prepared as we were to see something extraordinary it still out of measure surpassed our expectation and astonished even me who had not been used to trade in trifles in fine it might have answered very well the making a skew of its enormous head seemed in hue and size not unlike a common sheeps heart then you might have trolled dice securely along the broad back of the body of it the length of it too was prodigious then the rich appendage of the treasurebag beneath large in proportion gathered and crisped up round in shallow furrows helped to fill the eye and complete the proof of his being a natural not quite in vain since it was full manifest that he inherited and largely too the prerogative of majesty which distinguishes that otherwise most unfortunate condition and gave rise to the vulgar saying â€œthat a fools bauble is a ladys playfellowâ€ not wholly without reason for generally speaking it is in love as it is in war where the longest weapon carries it nature in short had done so much for him in those parts that she perhaps held herself acquitted in doing so little for his head  for my part who had sincerely no intention to push the joke further than simply satisfying my curiosity with the sight of it alone i was content in spite of the temptation that stared me in the face with having raised a maypole for another to hang a garland on for by this time easily reading louisas desires in her wishful eyes i acted the commodious part and made her who sought no better sport significant terms of encouragement to go through stitch with her adventure intimating too that i would stay and see fair play in which indeed i had in view to humour a new born curiosity to observe what appearances active nature would put on in a natural in the course of this her darling operation  louisa whose appetite was up and who like the industrious bee was it seems not above gathering the sweet of so rare a flower though she found it planted on a dunghill was but too readily disposed to take the benefit of my cession urged then strongly by her own desires and emboldened by me she presently determined to risk a trial of parts with the idiot who was by this time nobly inflamed for her purpose by all the irritation we had used to put the principles of pleasure effectually into motion and to wind up the springs of its organ to their supreme pitch and it stood accordingly stiff and straining ready to burst with the blood and spirits that swelled it to a bulk no i shall never forget it  louisa then taking and holding the fine handle that so invitingly offered itself led the ductile youth by that mastertool of his as she stept backward towards the bed which he joyfully gave way to under the incitations of instinct and palpably delivered up to the goad of desire  stopped then by the bed she took the fall she loved and leaned to the most gently backward upon it still holding fast what she held and taking care to give her clothes a convenient toss up so that her thighs duly disclosed and elevated laid open all the outward prospect of the treasury of love the roselipt overture presenting the cockpit so fair that it was not in nature even for a natural to miss it nor did he for louisa fully bent on grappling with it and impatient of dalliance or delay directed faithfully the point of the batteringpiece and bounded up with a rage of so voracious appetite to meet and favour the thrust of insertion that the fierce activity on both sides effected it with such pain of distention that louisa cried out violently that she was hurt beyond bearing that she was killed but it was too late the storm was up and force was on her to give way to it for now the manmachine strongly worked upon by the sensual passion felt so manfully his advantages and superiority felt withal the sting of pleasure so intolerable that maddening with it his joys began to assume a character of furiousness which made me tremble for the too tender louisa he seemed at this juncture greater than himself his countenance before so void of meaning or expression now grew big with the importance of the act he was upon in short it was not now that he was to be played the fool with but what is pleasant enough i myself was awed into a sort of respect for him by the comely terrors his motions dressed him in his eyes shooting sparks of fire his face glowing with ardours that gave another life to it his teeth churning his whole frame agitated with a raging ungovernable impetuosity all sensibly betraying the formidable fierceness with which the genial instinct acted upon him butting then and goring all before him and mad and wild like an owerdriven steer he ploughs up the tender furrow all insensible to louisas complaints nothing can stop nothing can keep out a fury like his with which having once got its head in its blind rage soon made way for the rest piercing rending and breaking open all obstruction the torn split wounded girl cries struggles invokes me to her rescue and endeavours to get from under the young savage or shake him off but alas in vain her breath might as soon have strength to have quelled his rough assault or put him out of his course and indeed all her efforts and struggles were managed with such disorder that they served rather to entangle and fold her the faster in the twine of his boisterous arms so that she was tied to the stake and obliged to fight the match out if she died for it for his part instinctridden as he was the expressions of his animal passion partaking something of ferocity were rather worrying than kisses intermixed with ravenous lovebites on her cheeks and necks the prints of which did not wear out for some days after  poor louisa however bore up at length better than could have been expected and though she suffered and greatly too yet ever true to the good old cause she suffered with pleasure and enjoyed her pain and soon now by dint of an enraged enforcement the brutemachine driven like a whirlwind made all smoke again and wedging its way up to the utmost extremity left her in point of penetration nothing to fear or to desire and now  â€œgorged with the dearest morsel of the earthâ€ shakespeare   louisa lay pleased to the heart pleased to her utmost capacity of being so with every fibre in those parts stretched almost to breaking on a rack of joy whilst the instrument of all this overfullness searched her senses with its sweet excess till the pleasure gained upon her so its point stung her so home that catching at length the rage from her furious driver and sharing the riot of his wild rapture she went wholly out of her mind into that favourite part of her body the whole intenseness of which was so fervously filled and employed there alone she existed all lost in those delirious transports those extasies of the senses which her winking eyes the brightened vermilion of her lips and cheeks and sighs of pleasure deeply fetched so pathetically expressed in short she was now as mere a machine as much wrought on and had her motions as little at her own command as the natural himself who thus broke in upon her made her feel with a vengeance his tempestuous mettle he battered with their active loins quivered again with the violence of their conflict till the surge of pleasure foaming and raging to a height drew down the pearly shower that was to allay this hurricane the purely sensitive idiot then first shed those tears of joy that attend its last moments not without an agony of delight and even almost a roar of rapture as the gush escaped him so sensibly too for louisa that she kept him faithful company going off in consent with the old symptoms a delicious delirium a tremendous convulsive shudder and the critical dying oh and now on his getting off she lay pleasuredrenched and regorging its essential sweets but quite spent and gasping for breath without other sensation of life than in those exquisite vibrations that trembled still on the strings of delight which had been too intensively touched and which nature had so ravishingly stirred with for the senses to be quickly at peace from  as for the changeling whose curious engine had been thus successfully played off his shift of countenance and gesture had even something droll or rather tragicomic in it there was now an air of sad repining foolishness superadded to his natural one of no meaning and idiotism as he stood with his label of manhood now lank unstiffened becalmed and flapping against his thighs down which it reached half way terrible even in its fall whilst under the dejection of spirit and flesh which naturally followed his eyes by turns cast down towards his struck standard or piteously lifted to louisa seemed to require at her hands what he had so sensibly parted from to her and now ruefully missed but the vigour of nature soon returning dissipated the blast of faintness which the common law of enjoyment had subjected him to and now his basket rebecame his main concern which i looked for and brought him whilst louisa restored his dress to its usual condition and afterwards pleased him perhaps more by taking all his flowers off his hands and paying him at his rate for them than if she had embarrassed him by a present that he would have been puzzled to account for and might have put others on tracing the motives of  whether she ever returned to the attack i know not and to say truth i believe not she had had her freak out and had pretty plentifully drowned her curiosity in a glut of pleasure which as it happened had no other consequence than that the lad who retained only a confused memory of the transaction would when he saw her forget her in favour of the next woman tempted on the report of his parts to take him in louisa herself did not long outstay this adventure at mrs coles to whom by the bye we took care not to boast of our exploit till all fear of consequences were clearly over for an occasion presenting itself of proving her passion for a young fellow at the expense of her discretion proceeding all in character she packed up her toilet at half a days warning and went with him abroad since which i entirely lost sight of her and it never fell in my way to hear what became of her  but a few days after she had left us two very occasion not to wrong our training at mrs coles especially favourites and free of her academy easily obtained her consent for emilys and my acceptance of a party of pleasure at a little but agreeable house belonging to one of them situated not far up the river thames on the surrey side  every thing being settled and it being a fine summer day but rather of the warmest we set out after dinner and got to our rendezvous about four in the afternoon where landing at the foot of a neat joyous pavilion emily and i were handed into it by our esquires and there drank tea with a cheerfulness and gaiety that the beauty of the prospect the serenity of the weather and the tender politeness of our sprightly gallants naturally led us into  after tea and taking a turn in the garden my particular who was the master of the house and had in no sense schemed this party of pleasure for a dry one proposed to us with that frankness which his familiarity at mrs coles entitled him to as the weather was excessively hot to bathe together under a commodious shelter that he had prepared expressly for that purpose in a creek of the river with which a sidedoor of the pavilion immediately communicated and where we might be sure of having our diversion out safe from interruption and with the utmost privacy  emily who never refused anything and i who ever delighted in bathing and had no exception to the person who proposed it or to those pleasure it was easy to guess it implied took care on this occasion not to wrong our training at mrs coles and agreed to it with as good a grace as we could upon which without loss of time we returned instantly to the pavilion one door of which opened into a tent pitched before it that with its marquise formed a pleasing defense again the sun or the weather and was besides as private as we could wish the lining of it embossed cloth represented a wild forest foliage from the top down to the sides which in the same stuff were figured with fluted pilasters with their spaces between filled with flower vases the whole having a pay effect croon the eye wherever you turned it  then it reached sufficiently into the water yet contained convenient benches round it on the dry ground either to keep our clothes or or in short for more uses than resting upon there was a sidetable too loaded with sweetmeats jellies and other eatables and bottles of wine and cordials by way of occasional relief from any rawness or chill of the water or from any faintness from whatever cause and in fact my gallant who understood chere entiere perfectly and who for taste even if you would not approve this specimen of it might have been comptroller of pleasures to a roman emperor had left no requisite towards convenience or luxury unprovided  as soon as we had looked round this inviting spot and every preliminary of privacy was duly settled strip was the word when the young gentlemen soon dispatched the undressing each his partner and reduced us to the naked confession of all those secrets of person which dress generally hides and which the discovery of was naturally speaking not to our disadvantage our hands indeed mechanically carried towards the most interesting part of us screened at first all from the tufted cliff downwards till we took them away at their desire and employed them in doing them the same office of helping off with their clothes in the process of which there passed all the little wantonnesses and frolics that you may easily imagine  as for my spark he was presently undressed all to his shirt the forelappet of which as he leaned languishingly on me he smilingly pointed to me to observe as it bellied out or rose and fell according to the unruly starts of the motion behind it but it was soon fixed for now taking off his shirt and naked as a cupid he shewed it me at so upright a stand as prepared me indeed for his application to me for instant ease but though the sight of its fine size was fit enough to fire me the cooling air as i stood in this state of nature joined to the desire i had of bathingfirst enabled me to put him off and tranquillize him with the remark that a little suspense would only set a keener edge on the pleasure leading them the way and shewing our friends an example of continency which they were giving signs of losing respect to we went hand in hand into the stream till it took us up to our necks where the no more than grateful coolness of the water gave my senses a delicious refreshment from the sultriness of the season and made more alive more happy in myself and in course more alert and open to voluptuous impressions  here i laved and wantoned with the water or sportively played with my companion leaving emily to deal with hers at discretion mine at length not content with making me take the plunge over head and ears kept splashing me and provoking me with all the little playful tricks he could devise and which i strove not to remain in his debt for we gave in short a loose to mirth and now nothing would serve him but giving his hand the regale of going over every part of me neck breast belly thighs and all the et caetera so dear to the imagination under the pretext of washing and rubbing them as we both stood in the water no higher now than the pit of our stomachs and which did not hinder him from feeling and toying with that leak that distinguishes our sex and it so wonderfully watertight for his fingers in vain dilating and opening it only let more flame than water into it be it said without a figure at the same time he made me feel his own engine which was so well wound up as to stand even the working in water and he accordingly threw one arm round my neck and was endeavouring to get the better of that harsher construction bred by the surrounding fluid and had in effect one his way so far as to make me sensible of the pleasing stretch of those nether lips from the indriving machine when independent of my not liking that awkward mode of enjoyment i could not help interrupting him in order to become joint spectators of a plan of joy in hot operation between emily and her partner who impatient of the fooleries and dalliance of the bath had led his nymph to one of the benches on the green bank where he was very cordially proceeding to teach her the difference betwixt jest and earnest  there setting her on his knee and gliding one hand over the surface of that smooth polished snowwhite skin of hers which now doubly shone with a dewbright lustre and presented to the touch something like what one would imagine of animated ivory especially in those rubynippled globes which the touch is so fond of and delights to make love to with the other he was lusciously exploring the sweet secret of nature in order to make room for a stately piece of machinery that stood upreared between her thighs as she continued sitting on his lap and pressed hard for instant intromission which the tender emily in a fit of humour deliciously protracted affected to decline and elude the very pleasure she sighed for but in a style of waywardness so prettily put on and managed as to render it ten times more poignant then her eyes all amidst the softest dying languishment expressed ait once a mock denial and extreme desire whilst her sweetness was zested with a coyness so pleasingly provoking her moods of keeping him off were so attractive that they redoubled the impetuous rage with which he covered her with kisses and kisses that whilst she seemed to shy from or scuffle for the cunning wanton contrived such sly returns of as were doubtless the sweeter for the gust she gave them of being stolen ravished  thus emily who knew no art but that which nature itself in favour of her principal end pleasure had inspired her with the art of yielding coyd it indeed but coyd it to the purpose for with all her straining her wrestling and striving to break from the clasp of his arms she was so far wiser yet than to mean it that in her struggles it was visible she aimed at nothing more than multiplying points of touch with him and drawing yet closer the folds that held them every where entwined like two tendrils of a vine intercurling together so that the same effect as when louisa strove in good earnest to disengage from the idiot was now produced by different motives  mean while their emersion out of the cold water had caused a general glow a tender suffusion of heightened carnation over their bodies both equally white and smoothskinned so that as their limbs were thus amorously interwoven in sweet confusion it was scarce possible to distinguish who they respectively belonged to but for the brawnier bolder muscles of the stronger sex  in a little time however the champion was fairly in with her and had tied at all points the true lovers knot when now adieu all the little refinements of a finessed reluctance adieu the friendly feint she was presently driven forcibly out of the power of using any art and indeed what art must not give way when nature corresponding with her assailant invaded in the heart of her capital and carried by storm lay at the mercy of the proud conqueror who had made his entry triumphantly and completely soon however to become a tributary for the engagement growing hotter and hotter at close quarters she presently brought him to the pass of paying down the dear debt to nature which she had no sooner collected in but like a duellist who has laid his antagonist at his feet when he has himself received a mortal wound emily had scarce time to plume herself upon her victory but shot with the same discharge she in a loud expiring sigh in the closure of her eyes the stretchout of her limbs and a remission of her whole frame gave manifest signs that all was as it should be  for my part who had not with the calmest patience stood in the water all this time to view this warm action i leaned tenderly on my gallant and at the close of it seemed to ask him with my eyes what he thought of it but he more eager to satisfy me by his actions than by words or looks as we shoaled the water towards the shore showed me the staff of love so intensely set up that had not even charity beginning at home in this case urged me to our mutual relief it would have been cruel indeed to have suffered the youth to burst with straining when the remedy was so obvious and so near at hand  accordingly we took a bench whilst emily and her spark who belonged it seems to the sea stood at the sideboard drinking to our good voyage for as the last observed we were well under weigh with a fair wind up channel and fullfreighted nor indeed were we long before we finished our trip to cythera and unloaded in the old haven but as the circumstances did not admit of much variation i shall spare you the description  at the same time allow me to place you here an excuse i am conscious of owing you for having perhaps too much affected the figurative style though surely it can pass nowhere more allowable than in a subject which is so properly the province of poetry nay is poetry itself pregnant with every flower of imagination and loving metaphors even were not the natural expressions for respects of fashion and sound necessarily forbidden  resuming now my history you may please to know that what with a competent number of repetitions all in the same strain and by the bye we have a certain natural sense that those repetitions are very much to the taste what with a circle of pleasures delicately varied there was not a moment lost to joy all the time we staid there till late in the night we were reescorted home by our esquires who delivered us safe to mrs cole with generous thanks for our company  this too was emilys last adventure in our way for scarce a week after she was by an accident too trivial to detail to you the particulars found out by her parents who were in good circumstances and who had been punished for their partiality to their son in the loss of him occasioned by a circumstance of their over indulgence to his appetite upon which the so long engrossed stream of fondness running violently in favour of this lost and inhumanly abandoned child whom if they had not neglected enquiry about they might long before have recovered they were now so overjoyed at the retrieval of her that i presume it made them much less strict in examining the bottom of things for they seemed very glad to take for granted in the lump every thing that the grave and decent mrs cole was pleased to pass upon them and soon afterwards sent her from the country handsome acknowledgment  but it was not so easy to replace to our community the loss of so sweet a member of it for not to mention her beauty she was one of those mild pliant characters that if one does not entirely esteem one can scarce help loving which is not such a bad compensation neither owing all her weaknesses to good nature and an indolent facility that kept her too much at the mercy of first impressions she had just sense enough to know that she wanted leading strings and thought herself so much obliged to any who would take the pains to think for her and guide her that with a very little management she was capable of being made a most agreeable nay a most virtuous wife for vice it is probable had never been her choice or her fate if it had not been for occasion or example or had she not depended less upon herself than upon her circumstances this presumption her conduct afterwards verified for presently meeting with a match that was ready cut and dry for her with a neighbours son of her own rank and a young man of sense and order who took as the widow of one lost at sea for so it seems one of her gallants whose name she had made free with really was she naturally struck into all the duties of her domestic life with as much simplicity of affection with as much constancy and regularity as if she had never swerved from a state of undebauched innocence from her youth  these desertions had however now so far thinned mrs coles cluck that she was left with only me like a hen with one chicken but though she was earnestly entreated and encouraged to recruit her crops her growing infirmities and above all the tortures of a stubborn hip gout which she found would yield to no remedy determined her to break up her business and retire with a decent pittance into the country where i promised myself nothing so sure as my going down to live with her as soon as i had seen a little more of life and improved my small matters into a competency that would create in me an independence on the world for i was now thanks to mrs cole wise enough to keep that essential in view  thus was i then to lose my faithful preceptress as did the philosophers of the town the white crow of her profession for besides that she never ransacked her customers whose tastes too she ever studiously consulted she never racked her pupils with unconscionable extortions nor ever put their hard earnings as she called them under the contribution of poundage she was a severe enemy to the seduction for innocence and confined her acquisitions solely to those unfortunate young women who having lost it were but the juster objects of compassion among these indeed she picked out such as suited her views and taking them under her protection rescued them from the danger of the public sinks of ruin and misery to place or for them well or ill in the manner you have seen having then settled her affairs she set out on her journey after taking the most tender leave of me and at the end of some excellent instructions recommending me to myself with an anxiety perfectly maternal in short she affected me so much that i was not presently reconciled to myself for suffering her at any rate to go without me but fate had it seems otherwise disposed of me  i had on my separation from mrs cole taken a pleasant convenient house at marylebone but easy to rent and manage from its smallness which i furnished neatly and modestly there with a reserve of eight hundred pounds the fruit of my deference to mrs coles counsels exclusive of clothes some jewels and some plate i saw myself in purse for a long time to wait without impatience for what the chapter of accidents might produce in my favour  here under the new character of a young gentlewoman whose husband was gone to sea i had marked me out such lines of life and conduct as leaving me a competent liberty to pursue my views either out of pleasure or fortune bounded me nevertheless strictly within the rules of decency and discretion a disposition in which you cannot escape observing a true pupil of mrs cole  i was scarce however well warm in my new abode when going out one morning pretty early to enjoy the freshness of it in the pleasing outlet of the fields accompanied only by a maid whom i had newly hired as we were carelessly walking among the trees we were alarmed with the noise of a violent coughing turning our heads towards which we distinguished a plain well dressed elderly gentleman who attacked with a sudden fit was so much overcome as to be forced to give way to it and sit down at the foot of a tree where he seemed suffocating with the severity of it being perfectly black in the face not less moved than frightened with which i flew on the instant to his relief and using the rote of practice i had observed on the like occasion i loosened his cravat and clapped him on the back but whether to any purpose or whether the cough had had its course i know not but the fit immediately went off and now recovered to his speech and legs he returned me thanks with as much emphasis as if i had saved his life this naturally engaging a conversation he acquainted me where he lived which was at a considerable distance from where i met him and where he had strayed insensibly on the same intention of a morning walk  he was as i afterwards learned in the course of the intimacy which this little accident gave birth to an old bachelor turned of sixty but of a fresh vigorous complexion insomuch that he scarce marked five and forty having never racked his constitution by permitting his desires to overtax his ability  as to his birth and conditions his parents honest and failed mechanics had by the best traces he could get of them left him an infant orphan on the parish so that it was from a charityschool that by honesty and industry he made his way into a merchants counting house from whence being sent to a house in cadiz he there by his talents and activity acquired not only a fortune but an immense one with which he returned to his native country where he could not however fish out so much as one single relation out of the obscurity he was born in taking then a taste for refinement and pleased to enjoy life like a mistress in the dark he flowed his days in all the ease of opulence without the least parade of it and rather studying the concealment than the shew of a fortune looked down on a world he perfectly knew himself to his wish unknown and unmarked by  but as i propose to devote a letter entirely to the pleasure of retracing to you all the particulars of my acquaintance with this ever to me memorable friend i shall in this transiently touch on no more than may serve as mortar to cement or form the connection of my history and to obviate your surprise that one of my blood and relish of life should count a gallant of three score such a catch  referring then to a more explicit narrative to explain by what progressions our acquaintance certainly innocent at first insensibly changed nature and run into unplatonic length as might well be expected from one of my condition of life and above all from that principle of electricity that scarce ever fails of producing fire when the sexes meet i shall only here acquaint you that as age had not subdued his tenderness for our sex neither had it robbed him of the power of pleasing since whatever he wanted in the bewitching charms of youth he atoned for or supplemented with the advantages of experience the sweetness of his manners and above all his flattering address in touching the heart by an application to the understanding from him it was i first learned to any purpose and not without infinite pleasure that i had such a portion of me worth bestowing some regard on from him i received my first essential encouragement and instructions how to put it in that train of cultivation which i have since pushed to the little degree of improvement you see it at he it was who first taught me to be sensible that the pleasures of the mind were superior to those of the body at the same time that they were so far from obnoxious to or incompatible with each other that besides the sweetness in the variety and transition the one served to exalt and perfect the taste of the other to a degree that the senses alone can never arrive at  himself a rational pleasurist as being much too wise to be ashamed of the pleasures of humanity loved me indeed but loved me with dignity in a mean equally removed from the sourness of forwardness by which age is unpleasingly characterized and from that childish silly dotage that so often disgraces it and which he himself used to turn into ridicule and compare to an old goat affecting the frisk of a young kid  in short every thing that is generally unamiable in his season of life was in him repaired by so many advantages that he existed a proof manifest at least to me that it is not out of the power of age to please if it lays out to please and if making just allowance those in that class do not forget that if must cost them more pains and attention than what youth the natural springtime of joy stands in need of as fruits out of season require proportionally more skill and cultivation to force them  with this gentleman who took me home soon after our acquaintance commenced i lived near eight months in which time my constant complaisance and docility my attention to deserve his confidence and love and a conduct in general devoid of the least art and founded on my sincere regard and esteem for him won and attached him so firmly to me that after having generously trusted me with a genteel independent settlement proceeding to heap marks of affection on me he appointed me by an authentic will his sole heiress and executrix a disposition which he did not outlive two months being taken from me by a violent cold that he contracted as he unadvisedly ran to the window on an alarm of fire at some streets distant and stood there nakedbreasted and exposed to the fatal impressions of a damp night air  after acquitting myself of the duty towards my deceased benefactor and paying him a tribute of unfeigned sorrow which a little time changed into a most tender graceful memory of him which i shall ever retain i grew somewhat comforted by the prospect that now opened to me if not of happiness at least of affluence and independence  i saw myself then in the full bloom and pride of youth for i was not yet nineteen actually at the head of so large a fortune as it would have been even the height of impudence in me to have raised my wishes much more my hopes to and that this unexpected elevation did not turn my head i owed to the pains my benefactor had taken to form and prepare me for it as i owed his opinion of my management of the vast possessions he left me to what he had observed of the prudential economy i had learned under mrs cole the reserve of which he saw i had made was a proof and encouragement to him  but alas how easily in the enjoyment of the greatest sweets in life in present possession poisoned by the regret of an absent one but my regret was a mighty and just one since it had my only truly beloved charles for its object  given him up i had indeed completely having never once heard from him since our separation which as i found afterwards had been my misfortune and not his neglect for he wrote me several letters which had all miscarried but forgotten him i never had and amidst all my personal infidelities not one had made a pins point impression on a heart impenetrable to the true love passion but for him  as soon however as i was mistress of this unexpected fortune i felt more than ever how dear he was to me from its insufficiency to make me happy whilst he was not to share it with me my earliest care consequently was to endeavour at getting some account of him but all my researches produced me no more light than that his father had been dead for some time not so well as even with the world and that charles had reached his port of destination in the south seas where finding the estate he was sent to recover dwindled to a trifle by the loss of two ships in which the bulk of his uncles fortune lay he was come away with the small remainder and might perhaps according to the best advice in a few months return to england from whence he had at the time of this my inquiry been absent two years and seven months a little eternity in love  you cannot conceive with what joy i embraced the hopes thus given me of seeing the delight of my heart again but as the term of months was assigned it in order to divert and amuse my impatience for his return after settling my affairs with much ease and security i set out on a journey for lancashire with an equipage suitable to my fortune and with a design purely to revisit my place of nativity for which i could not help retaining a great tenderness and might naturally not be sorry to shew myself there to the advantage i was now in pass to do after the report esther davis had spread of my being spirited away to the plantations for on no other supposition could she account for the suppression of myself to her since her leaving me so abruptly at the inn another favourite intention i had to look out for my relations though i had none but distant ones and prove a benefactress to them then mrs coles place of retirement lying in my way was not amongst the least of the pleasures i had proposed to myself in this expedition  i had taken nobody with me but a discreet decent woman to figure it as my companion besides my servants and was scarce got into an inn about twenty miles from london where i was to sup and pass the night when such a storm of wind and rain come on as made me congratulate myself on having got under shelter before it began  this had continued a good half an hour when bethinking me of some directions to be given to the coachman i sent for him not caring that his shoes should soil the very clean parlour in which the cloth was laid i stept into the hall kitchen where he was and where whilst i was talking to him i slantingly observed two horsemen driven in by the weather and both wringing wet one of whom was asking if they could not be assisted with a change while their clothes were dried but heavens who can express what i felt at the sound of a voice ever present to my heart and that it now rebounded at or when pointing my eyes towards the person it came from they confirmed its information in spite of so long an absence and of a dress one would have studied for a disguise a horsemans great coat with a stampup cape and his hat flapped but what could escape the alertness of a sense truly guided by love a transport then like mine was above all consideration or schemes of surprise and i that instant with the rapidity of the emotions that i felt the spur of shot into his arms crying out as i threw mine round his neck â€œmy life my soul my charlesâ€ and without further power of speech swooned away under the pressing agitation of joy and surprise  recovered out of my entrancement i found myself in my charmers arms but in the parlour surrounded by a crowd which this event had gathered round us and which immediately on a signal from the discreet landlady who currently took him for my husband cleared the room and desirably left us alone to the raptures of this reunion my joy at which had like to have proved at the expense of my life its power superior to that of grief at our fatal separation  the first object then that my eyes opened on was their supreme idol and my supreme wish charles on one knee holding me fast by the hand and gazing on me with a transport of fondness observing my recovery he attempted to speak and give vent to his patience of hearing my voice again to satisfy him once more that it was i but the mightiness and suddenness of the surprise continuing to stun him choked his utterance he could only stammer out a few broken halfformed filtering accents which my ears greedily drinking in spelt and put together so as to make out their sense â€œafter so long so cruel an absence my dearest fanny can it can it be youâ€ stifling me at the time with kisses that stopping my opening mouth at once prevented the answer that he panted for and increased the delicious disorder in which all my senses were rapturously lost however amidst this crowd of ideas and all blissful ones there obtruded only one cruel doubt that poisoned nearly all the transcendant happiness and what was it but my dread of its being too excessive to be real i trembled now with my fear of its being no more than a dream and of waking out of it into the horrors of finding it one under this fond apprehension imagining i could not make too much of the present prodigious joy before it would vanish and leave me in the desert again nor verify its reality too strongly i clung to him i clasped him as if to hinder him from escaping me again â€œwhere have you been how could you could you leave me say you are still mine that you still love me and thus thusâ€ kissing him as if i would consolidated lips with him â€œi forgive you forgive my hard fortune in favour of this restorationâ€  all these interjections breaking from me in that wildness of expression that justly passes for eloquence in love drew from him all the returns my fond heart could wish or require our caresses our questions our answers for some time observed no order all crossing or interrupting one another in sweet confusion whilst we exchanged hearts at our eyes and renewed the ratifications of a love unabated by time or absence not a breath not a motion not a gesture on either side but what was strongly impressed with it our hands locked in each other repeated the most passionate squeezes so that their fiery thrill went to the heart again  thus absorbed and concentered in this unutterable delight i had not attended to the sweet author of it being thoroughly wet and in danger of catching cold when in good time the landlady whom the appearance of my equipage which bye the bye charles knew nothing of had gained me an interest in for me and mine interrupted us by bringing in a decent shift of linen and clothes which now somewhat recovered into a calmer composure by the coming in of a third person i pressed him to take the benefit of with a tender concern and anxiety that made me tremble for his health  the landlady leaving us again he proceeded to shift in the act of which though he proceeded with all that modesty which became these first solemner instants of our remeeting after so long an absence i could not refrain certain snatches of my eyes lured by the dazzling discoveries of his naked skin that escaped him as he changed his linen and which i could not observe the unfaded life and complexion of without emotions of tenderness and joy that had himself too purely for their object to partake of a loose or mistimed desire  he was soon dressed in these temporary clothes which neither fitted him nor became the light my passion placed him in to me at least yet as they were on him they looked extremely well in virtue of that magic charm which love put into every thing that hetouched or had relation to him and where indeed was that dress that a figure like his would not give grace to for now as i eyed him more in detail i could not but observe the even favourable alteration which the time of his absence had produced in his person  there were still the requisite lineaments still the same vivid vermillion and bloom reigning in his face but now the roses were more fully blown the tan of his travels and a beard somewhat more distinguishable had at the expense of no more delicacy than what he could well spare given it an air of becoming manliness and maturity that symmetrized nobly with that air of distinction and empire with which nature had stamped it in a rare mixture with the sweetness of it still nothing had he lost of that smooth plumpness of flesh which glowing with freshness blooms florid to the eye and delicious to the touch then his shoulders were grown more square his shape more formed more portly but still free and airy in short his figure showed riper greater and perfecter to the experienced eye than in his tender youth and now he was not much more than two and twenty  in this interval however i picked out of the broken often pleasingly interrupted account of himself that he was at that instant actually on his road to london in not a very paramount plight or condition having been wrecked on the irish coast for which he had prematurely embarked and lost the little all he had brought with him from the south seas so that he had not till after great shifts and hardships in the company of his fellowtraveller the captain got so far on his journey that so it was having heard of his fathers death and circumstances he had now the world to begin again on a new account a situation which he assured me in a vein of sincerity that flowing from his heart penetrated mine gave him to farther pain than that he had not his power to make me as happy as he could wish my fortune you will please to observe i had not entered upon any overture of reserving to feast myself with the surprise of it to him in calmer instants and as to my dress it could give him no idea of the truth not only as it was mourning but likewise in a style of plainness and simplicity that i had ever kept to with studied art he pressed me indeed tenderly to satisfy his ardent curiosity both with regard to my past and present state of life since his being torn away from me but i found means to elude his questions by answers that shewing his satisfaction at no great distance won upon him to waive his impatience in favour of the thorough confidence he had in my not delaying it but for respect i should in good time acquaint him with  charles however thus returned to my longing arms tender faithful and in health was already a blessing too mighty for my conception but charles in distress charles reduced and broken down to his naked personal merit was such a circumstance in favour of the sentiments i had for him as exceeded my utmost desire and accordingly i seemed so visibly charmed so out of time and measure pleased at his mention of his ruined fortune that he could account for it no way but that the joy of seeing him again had swallowed up every other sense of concern  in the mean time my woman had taken all possible care of charless travelling companion and as supper was coming in he was introduced to me when i received him as became my regard for all of charless acquaintance or friends  we four then supped together in the style of joy congratulation and pleasing disorder that you may guess for my part though all these agitations had left me not the least stomach but for that uncloying feast the sight of my adored youth i endeavoured to force it by way of example for him who i conjectured must want such a recruit after riding and indeed he ate like a traveller but gazed at and addressed me all the time like a lover  after the cloth was taken away and the hour of repose came on charles and i were without further ceremony in quality of man and wife shown up together to a very handsome apartment and all in course the bed they said the best in the inn  and here decency forgive me if once more i violate thy laws and keeping the curtains undrawn sacrifice thee for the last time to that confidence without reserve with which i engaged to recount to you the most striking circumstances of my youthful disorders  as soon then as we were in the room together left to ourselves the sight of the bed starving the remembrance of our first joys and the thought of my being instantly to share it with the dear possessor of my virgin heart moved me so strongly that it was well i leaned upon him or i must have fainted again under the overpowering sweet alarm charles saw into my confusion and forgot his own that was scarce less to apply himself to the removal of mine  but now the true refining passion had regained throughout possession of me with all its train of symptoms a sweet sensibility a tender timidity lovesick yearnings tempered with diffidence and modesty all held me in a subjection of soul incomparably dearer to me than the liberty of heart which i had been long too long the mistress of in the course of those grosser gallantries the consciousness of which now made me sigh with a virtuous confusion and regret no real virgin in short in view of the nuptial bed could give more bashful blushes to unblemished innocence than i did to a sense of guilt and indeed i loved charles too truly not to feel severely that i did not deserve him  as i kept hesitating and disconcerted under this soft distraction charles with a fond impatience took the pains to undress me and all i can remember amidst the nutter and discomposure of my senses was some flattering exclamation of joy and admiration more specially at the feel of my breasts now set at liberty from my stays and which panting and rising in tumultous throbs swelled upon his dear touch and gave it the welcome pleasure of finding them well formed and unfailed in firmness  i was soon laid in bed and scarce languished an instant for the darling partner of it before he was undressed and got between the sheets with his arms clasped round me giving and taking with gust inexpressible a kiss of welcome that my heart rising to my lips stamped with its warmest impression concurring to my bliss with that delicate and voluptuous emotion which charles alone had the secret to excite and which constitutes the very life the essence of pleasure  mean while two candles lighted on a sidetable near us and a joyous wood fire threw a light into the bed that took from one sense of great importance to our joys all pretext for complaining of its being shut out of its share of them and indeed the sight of my idolized youth was alone from the ardour with which i had wished for it without other circumstance a pleasure to die of  but as action was now a necessity to desires so much on edge as ours charles after a very short prelusive dalliance lifting up my linen and his own laid the broad treasures of his manly chest close to my bosom both beating with the tenderest alarms when now the sense of his glowing body in naked touch with mine took all power over my thoughts out of my own disposal and delivered up every faculty of the soul to the sensiblest of joys that affecting me infinitely more with my distinction of the person than of the sex now brought my heart deliriously into play my heart which eternally constant to charles had never taken any part in my original sacrifices to the calls of constitution complaisance or interest but ah what became of me when as the powers of solid pleasure thickened upon me i could not help feeling the stiff stake that had been adorned with the trophies of my despoiled virginity bearing hard and inflexible against one of my thighs which i had not yet opened from a true principle of modesty revived by a passion too sincere to suffer any aiming at the false merit of difficulty or my putting on an impertinent mock coyness  i have i believe somewhere before remarked that feel of that favourite piece of manhood has in the very nature of it something inimitably pathetic nothing can be dearer to the touch nor can affect it with a more delirious sensation think then as a love thinks what must be the consummate transport of that quickest of our senses in their central seat too when after so long a deprival it felt itself reinflamed under the pressure of that peculiar sceptremember which commands us all but especially my darling elect from the face of the whole earth and now at its mightiest point of stiffness it felt to me something so subduing so active so solid and agreeable that i know not what name to give its singular impression but the sentiment of consciousness of its belonging to my supremely beloved youth gave me so pleasing an agitation and worked so strongly on my soul that it sent all its sensitive spirits to that organ of bliss in me dedicated to its reception there concentering to a point like rays in a burning glass they glowed they burnt with the intensest heat the springs of pleasure were in short wound up to such a pitch i panted now with so exquisitely keen an appetite for the eminent enjoyment that i was even sick with desire and unequal to support the combination of two distinct ideas that delightfully distracted me for all the thought i was capable of was that i was now in touch at once with the instrument of pleasure and the great seal of love ideas that mingling streams poured such an ocean of intoxicating bliss on a weak vessel all too narrow to contain it that i lay overwhelmed absorbed lost in an abyss of joy and dying of nothing but immoderate delight  charles then roused me somewhat out of this ecstatic distraction with a complaint softly murmured amidst a crowd of kisses at the position not so favourable to his desires in which i received his urgent insistance for admission where that insistance was alone so engrossing a pleasure that it made me inconsistently suffer a much dearer one to be kept out but how sweet to correct such a mistake my thighs now obedient to the intimations of love and nature gladly disclose and with a ready submission resign up the soft gateway to the entrance of pleasure i see i feel the delicious velvet tip he enters me might and main with oh my pen drops from here in the extasy now present to my faithful memory description too deserts me and delivers over a task above its strength of wing to the imagination but it must be an imagination exalted by such a flame as mine that can do justice to that sweetest noblest of all sensations that hailed and accompanied the stiff insinuation all the way up till it was at the end of its penetration sending up through my eyes the sparks of the lovefire that ran all over me and blazed in every vein and every pore of me a system incarnate of joy all over  i had now totally taken in loves true arrow from the point up to the feather in that part where making no new wound the lips or the original one of nature which had owed its first breathing to this dear instrument clung as if sensible of gratitude in eager suction round it whilst all its inwards embraced it tenderly with a warmth of gust a compressive energy that gave it in its way the heartiest welcome in nature every fibre there gathering tight round it and straining ambitiously to come in for its share of the blissful touch  as we were giving them a few moments pause to the the delectations of the senses in dwelling with the highest relish on this intimatest point of reunion and chewing the cud of enjoyment the impatience natural to the pleasure soon drove us into action then began the driving tumult on his side and the responsive heaves on mine which kept me up to him whilst as our joys grew too great for utterance the organs of our voices voluptuously intermixing became organs of the touch how delicious how poignantly luscious and now now i felt to the heart of me i felt the prodigious keen edge with which love presiding over this act points the pleasure love that may be styled the attic salt of enjoyment and indeed without it the joy great as it is is still a vulgar one whether in a king or a beggar for it is undoubtedly love alone that refines ennobles and exalts it  thus happy then by the heart happy by the senses it was beyond all power even of thought to form the conception of a greater delight than what i now am consummating the fruition of  charles whose whole frame was convulsed with the agitation of his rapture whilst the tenderest fires trembled in his eyes all assured me of a perfect concord of joy penetrated me so profoundly touched me so vitally took me so much out of my own possession whilst he seemed himself so much in mine that in a delicious enthusiasm i imagined such a transfusion of heart and spirit as that coalescing and making one body and soul with him i was he and he me  but all this pleasure tending like life from its first instants towards its own dissolution lived too fast not to bring on upon the spur its delicious moment of mortality for presently the approach of the tender agony discovered itself by its usual signals that were quickly followed by my dear lovers emanation of himself that spun out and shot feelingly indeed up the ravished indraught where the sweetly soothing balmy titillation opened all the juices of joy on my side which ecstatically in flow helped to allay the prurient glow and drowned our pleasure for a while soon however to be on float again for charles true to natures laws in one breath expiring and ejaculating languished not long in the dissolving trance but recovering spirit again soon gave me to feel that the true mettle spring of his instrument of pleasure were by love and perhaps by a long vacation wound up too high to be let down by a single explosion his stiffnesss till stood my friend resuming then the action afresh without dislodging or giving me the trouble of parting from my sweet tenant we played over again the same opera with the same harmony and concert our ardours like our love knew no remission and all the tide serving my lover lavish of his stores and pleasuremilked he overflowed me once more from the fulness of his oval reservoirs of the genial emulsion whilst on my side a convulsive grasp in the instant of my giving down the liquid contribution rendered me sweetly subservient at once to the increase of joy and to its effusions moving me so as to make me exert all those springs of the compressive exsuction with which the sensitive mechanism of that part thirstily draws and drains the nipple of love with much such an instinctive eagerness and attachment as to compare great with less kind nature engages infants at the breasts by the pleasure they find in the motion of their little mouths and cheeks to extract the milky stream prepared for their nourishment  but still there was no end of his vigour this double discharge had so far from extinguished his desires for that time that it had not even calmed them and at his age desires are power he was proceeding then amazingly to push it to a third triumph still without uncasing if a tenderness natural to true love had not inspired me with selfdenial enough to spare and not overstrain him and accordingly entreating him to give himself and me quarter i obtained at length a short suspension of arms but not before he had exultingly satisfied me that he gave out standing  the remainder of the night with what we borrowed upon the day we employed with unwearied fervour in celebrating thus the festival of our remeeting and got up pretty late in the morning gay brisk and alert though rest had been a stranger to us but the pleasures of love had been to us what the joy of victory is to an army repose refreshment every thing  the journey into the country being now entirely out of the question and orders having been given overnight for turning the horses heads towards london we left the inn as soon as we had breakfasted not without a liberal distribution of the tokens of my grateful sense of the happiness i had met with in it  charles and i were in my coach the captain and my companion in a chaise hired purposely for them to leave us the conveniency of a tãªteã tãªte  here on the road as the tumult of my senses was tolerably composed i had command enough of head to break properly to his the course of life that the consequences of my separation from him had driven me into which at the same time that he tenderly deplored with me he was the less shocked at as on reflecting how he had left me circumstances he could not be entirely unprepared for it  but when i opened the state of my fortune to him and with that sincerity which from me to him was so much a nature in me i beged of him his acceptance of it on his own terms i should appear to you perhaps too partial to my passion were i to attempt the doing his delicacy justice i shall content myself then with assuring you that after his flatly refusing the unreserved unconditional donation that i long persecuted him in vain to accept it was at length in obedience to his serious commands for i stood out unaffectedly till he exerted the sovereign authority which love had given him over me that i yielded my consent to waive the remonstrance i did not fail of making strongly to him against his degrading himself and incurring the reflection however unjust of having for respects of fortune bartered his honour for infamy and prostitution in making one his wife who thought herself too much honoured in being but his mistress  the plea of love then overruling all objections for him which he could not but read the sincerity of in a heart ever open to him obliged me to receive his hand by which means i was in pass among other innumerable blessings to bestow a legal parentage on those fine children you have seen by this happiest of matches  thus at length i got snug into port where in the bosom of virtue i gathered the only uncorrupt sweets where looking back on the course of vice i had run and comparing its infamous blandishments with the infinitely superior joys of innocence i could not help pitying even in point of taste those who immersed in gross sensuality are insensible to the so delicate charms of virtue than which even pleasure has not a greater friend nor vice a greater enemy thus temperance makes men lords over those pleasures that intemperance enslaves them to the one parent of health vigour fertility cheerfulness and every other desirable good of life the other of diseases debility barrenness selfloathing with only every evil incident to human nature  you laugh perhaps at this tailpiece of morality extracted from me by the force of truth resulting from compared experiences you think it no doubt out of character possibly too you may look on it as the paultry finesse of one who seeks to mask a devotee to vice under a rag of a veil impudently smuggled from the shrine of virtue just as if one was to fancy ones self completely disguised at a masquerade with no other change of dress than turning ones shoes into slippers or as if a writer should think to shield a treasonable libel by concluding it with a formal prayer for the king but independent of my flattering myself that you have a juster opinion of my sense and sincerity give me leave to represent to you that such a supposition is even more injurious to virtue than to me since consistently with candour and good nature it san have no foundation but in the falsest of fears that its pleasures cannot stand in comparison with those of vice but let truth dare to hold it up in its most alluring light then mark how spurious how low of taste how comparatively inferior its joys are to those which virtue gives sanction to and whose sentiments are not above making even a sauce for the senses but a sauce of the highest relish whilst vices are the harpies that infect and foul the feast the paths of vice are sometimes strewed with roses but then they are for ever infamous for many a thorn for many a cankerworm those of virtue are strewed with roses purely and those eternally unfading ones  if you do me then justice you will esteem me perfectly consistent in the incense i burn to virtue if i have painted vice in all its gayest colours if i have decked it with flowers it has been solely in order to make the worthier the solemner sacrifice of it to virtue  you know mr c o you know his estate his worth and good sense can you will you pronounce it ill meant at least of him when anxious for his sons morals with a view to form him to virtue and inspire him with a fixed a rational contempt for vice he condescended to be his master of the ceremonies and led him by the hand through the most noted bawdyhouses in town where he took care he should be familiarized with all those scenes of debauchery so fit to nauseate a good taste the experiment you will cry is dangerous true on a fool but are fools worth so much attention  i shall see you soon and in the mean time think candidly of me and believe me ever  madam yours etc etc etc x x x  the end
