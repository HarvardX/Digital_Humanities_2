eclogues uncertainty eclogue i to mr pope pope to whose reed beneath the beechen shade the nymphs of thames a pleased attention paid while yet thy muse content with humbler praise warbled in windsors grove her sylvan lays though now sublimely borne on homers wing of glorious wars and godlike cheifs she sing will thou with me revisit once again the crystal fountain and the flowery plain will thou indulgent hear my verse relate the various changes of a lovers state and while each turn of passion i pursue ask thy own heart if what i tell be true to the green margin of a lonely wood whose pendant shades oerlookd a silver flood young damon came unknowing where he strayed full of the image of his beauteous maid his flock far off unfed untended lay to every savage a defenseless prey no sense of interest could their master move and every care seemed trifling now but love a while in pensive silence he remained but though his voice was mute his looks complained at length the thoughts within his bosom pent forced his unwilling tongue to give them vent ye nymphs he cried ye dryads who so long have favored damon and inspired his song for whom retired i shun the gay resorts of sportful cities and of pompous courts in vain i bid the restless world adieu to seek tranquillity and peace with you though wild ambition and destructive rage no factions here can form no wars can wage though envy frowns not on your humble shades nor calumny your innocence invades yet cruel love that troubler of the breast too often violates your boasted rest with inbred storms disturbs your calm retreat and taints with bitterness each rural sweet ah luckless day when first with fond surprise on delias face i fixed my eager eyes then in wild tumults all my soul was tossed then reason liberty at once were lost and every wish and thought and care was gone but what my heart employed on her alone then too she smiled can smiles our peace destroy those lovely children of content and joy how can soft pleasure and tormenting woe from the same spring at the same moment flow unhappy boy these vain enquiries cease thought could not guard nor will restore thy peace indulge the frenzy that thou must endure and sooth the pain thou know not how to cure come flattering memory and tell my heart how kind she was and with what pleasing art she strove its fondest wishes to obtain confirm her power and faster bind my chain if on the green we danced a mirthful band to me alone she gave her willing hand her partial taste if ever i touched the lyre still in my song found something to admire by none but her my crook with flowers was crowned by none but her my brows with ivy bound the world that damon was her choice believed the world alas like damon was deceived when last i saw her and declared my fire in words as soft as passion could inspire coldly she heard and full of scorn withdrew without one pitying glance one sweet adieu the frighted hind who sees his ripened corn up from the roots by sudden tempests torn whose fairest hopes destroyed and blasted lie feels not so keen a pang of grief as i ah how have i deserved inhuman maid to have my faithful service thus repaid were all the marks of kindness i received but dreams of joy that charmed me and deceived or did you only nurse my growing love that with more pain i might your hatred prove sure guilty treachery no place could find in such a gentle such a generous mind a maid brought up the woods and wilds among could never have learnt the art of courts so young no let me rather think her anger feigned still let me hope my delia may be gained twas only modesty that seemed disdain and her heart suffered when she gave me pain pleased with this flattering thought the lovesick boy felt the faint dawning of a doubtful joy back to his flock more cheerful he returned when now the setting sun less fiercely burned blue vapors rose along the mazy rills and lights last blushes tinged the distant hills hope eclogue ii to mr doddington hear doddington the notes that shepherds sing notes soft as those of nightingales in spring nor pan nor phoebus tune the shepherds reed from love alone our tender lays proceed love warms our fancy with enlivening fires refines our genius and our verse inspires from him theocritus on ennas plains learnt the wild sweetness of his doric strains virgil by him was taught the moving art that charmed each ear and softened every heart o would thou quit the pride of courts and deign to dwell with us upon the vocal plain thee too his power should reach and every shade resound the praises of thy favorite maid thy pipe our rural concert would improve and we should learn of thee to please and love damon no longer sought the silent shade no more in unfrequented paths he strayed but called the nymphs to hear his jocund song and told his joy to all the rustic throng blessed be the hour he said that happy hour when first i owned my delias gentle power then gloomy discontent and pining care forsook my breast and left soft wishes there soft wishes there they left and gay desires delightful languors and transporting fires where yonder limes combine to form a shade these eyes first gazed upon the charming maid there she appeared on that auspicious day when swains their sportive rites to bacchus pay she led the dance  heavens with what grace she moved who could have seen her then and not have loved i strove not to resist so sweet a flame but gloried in a happy captives name nor would i now could love permit be free but leave to brutes their savage liberty and art thou then fond swain secure of joy can no reverse thy flattering bliss destroy has treacherous love no torment yet in store or have thou never proved his fatal power whence flowed those tears that late bedewed thy cheek why sighed thy heart as if it strove to break why were the desert rocks invoked to hear the plaintive accent of thy sad despair from delias rigor all those pains arose delia who now compassionates my woes who bids me hope and in that charming word has peace and transport to my soul restored begin my pipe begin the gladsome lay a kiss from delia shall thy music pay a kiss obtained twixt struggling and consent given with forced anger and disguised content no laureat wreaths i ask to bind my brows such as the muse on lofty bards bestows let other swains to praise or fame aspire i from her lips my recompense require hark how the bees with murmurs fill the plain while every flower of every sweet they drain see how beneath you hillocks shady steep the sheltered herds on flowery couches sleep nor bees nor herds are half so blessed as i if with my fond desires my love comply from delias lips a sweeter honey flows and on her bosom dwells more soft repose ah how my dear shall i deserve thy charms what gift can bribe thee to my longing arms a bird for thee in silken bands i hold whose yellow plumage shines like polished gold from distant isles the lovely stranger came and bears the fortunate canaries name in all our woods none boasts so sweet a note not even the nightingales melodious throat accept of this and could i add beside what wealth the rich peruvian mountains hide if all the gems in eastern rocks were mine on thee alone their glittering pride should shine but if thy mind no gifts have power to move phoebus himself shall leave the aonian grove the tuneful nine who never sue in vain shall come sweet suppliants for their favorite swain for him each blueeyd naiad of the flood for him each greenhaird sister of the wood whom often beneath fair cynthias gentle ray his music calls to dance the night away and you fair nymphs companions of my love with whom she joys the cowslip meads to rove i beg you recommend my faithful flame and let her often hear her shepherds name shade all my faults from her enquiring sight and show my merits in the fairest light my pipe your kind assistance shall repay and every friend shall claim a different lay but see in yonder glade the heavenly fair enjoys the fragrance of the breezy air  ah thither let me fly with eager feet adieu my pipe i go my love to meet  o may i find her as we parted last and may each future hour be like the past so shall the whitest lamb these pastures feed propitious venus on thy altars bleed jealousy eclogue iii to mr edward walpole the gods o walpole give no bliss sincere wealth is disturbed by care and power by fear of all the passions that employ the mind in gentle love the sweetest joys we find yet even those joys dire jealousy molests and blackens each fair image in our breasts o may the warmth of thy too tender heart never feel the sharpness of his venomed dart for thy own quiet think thy mistress just and wisely take thy happiness on trust begin my muse and damons woes rehearse in wildest numbers and disordered verse on a romantic mountains airy head while browzing goats at ease around him fed anxious he lay with jealous cares oppressed distrust and anger laboring in his breast  the vale beneath a pleasing prospect yields of verdant meads and cultivated fields through these a river rolls its winding flood adorned with various tufts of rising wood here half concealed in trees a cottage stands a castle there the opening plain commands beyond a town with glittering spires is crowned and distant hills the wide horizon bound so charming was the scene a while the swain beheld delighted and forgot his pain but soon the stings infixd within his heart with cruel force renewed their raging smart his flowery wreath which long with pride he wore the gift of delia from his brows he tore then cried may all thy charms ungrateful maid like these neglected roses droop and fade may angry heaven deform each guilty grace that triumphs now in that deluding face those altered looks may every shepherd fly and even thy daphnis hate thee worse than i say thou inconstant what has damon done to lose the heart his tedious pains had won tell me what charms you in my rival find against whose power no ties have strength to bind has he like me with long obedience strove to conquer your disdain and merit love has he with transport every smile adored and died with grief at each ungentle word ah no the conquest was obtained with ease he pleased you by not studying to please his careless indolence your pride alarmed and had he loved you more he less had charmed o pain to think another shall possess those balmy lips which i was wont to press another on her panting breast shall lie and catch sweet madness from her swimming eye  i saw their friendly flocks together feed i saw them hand in hand walk over the mead would my closed eyes had sunk in endless night ere i was doomed to bear that hateful sight where ever they passed be blasted every flower and hungry wolves their helpless flocks devour  ah wretched swain could no examples move thy heedless heart to shun the rage of love have thou not heard how poor see mr gays dione menalcas died a victim to parthenias fatal pride dear was the youth to all the tuneful plain loved by the nymphs by phoebus loved in vain around his tomb their tears the muses paid and all things mourned but the relentless maid would i could die like him and be at peace these torments in the quiet grave would cease there my vexed thoughts a calm repose would find and rest as if my delia still were kind no let me live her falsehood to upbraid some god perhaps my just revenge will aid  alas what aid fond swain would thou receive could thy heart bear to see its delia grieve protect her heaven and let her never know the slightest part of hapless damons woe i ask no vengeance from the powers above all i implore is never more to love  let me this fondness from my bosom tear let me forget that ever i thought her fair come cool indifference and heal my breast wearied at length i seek thy downy rest no turbulence of passion shall destroy my future ease with flattering hopes of joy hear mighty pan and all ye sylvans hear what by your guardian deities i swear no more my eyes shall view her fatal charms no more i will court the traitress to my arms not all her arts my steady soul shall move and she shall find that reason conquers love  scarce had he spoke when through the lawn below alone he saw the beauteous delia go at once transported he forgot his vow such perjuries the laughing gods allow down the steep hills with ardent haste he flew he found her kind and soon believed her true possession eclogue iv to lord cobham cobham to thee this rural lay i bring whose guiding judgment gives me skill to sing though far unequal to those polished strains with which thy congreve charmed the listening plains yet shall its music please thy partial ear and sooth thy breast with thoughts that once were dear recall those years which time has thrown behind when smiling love with honor shared thy mind the sweet remembrance shall thy youth restore fancy again shall run past pleasures over and while in stowes enchanting walks you stray this theme may help to cheat the summers day beneath the covert of a myrtle wood to venus raised a rustic altar stood to venus and to hymen there combined in friendly league to favor humankind with wanton cupids in that happy shade the gentle virtues and mild wisdom played nor there in sprightly pleasures genial train lurked sick disgust or late repenting pain nor force nor interest joined unwilling hands but love consenting tied the blissful bands thither with glad devotion damon came to thank the powers who blessed his faithful flame two milkwhite doves he on their altar laid and thus to both his grateful homage paid hail bounteous god before whose hallowed shrine my delia vowed to be for ever mine while glowing in her cheeks with tender love sweet virgin modesty reluctant strove and hail to thee fair queen of young desires long shall my heart preserve thy pleasing fires since delia now can all its warmth return as fondly languish and as fiercely burn o the dear gloom of last propitious night o shade more charming than the fairest light then in my arms i clasped the melting maid then all my pains one moment overpaid then first the sweet excess of bliss i proved which none can taste but who like me have loved thou too bright goddess once in idas grove did not disdain to meet a shepherds love with him while frisking lambs around you played concealed you sported in the secret shade scarce could anchises raptures equal mine and delias beauties only yield to thine what are you now my once most valued joys insipid trifles all and childish toys  friendship itself never knew a charm like this nor colins talk could please like delias kiss ye muses skilled in every winning art teach me more deeply to engage her heart ye nymphs to her your freshest roses bring and crown her with the pride of all the spring on all her days let health and peace attend may she never want nor ever lose a friend may some new pleasure every hour employ but let her damon be her highest joy with thee my love for ever will i stay all night caress thee and admire all day in the same field our mingled flocks well feed to the same spring our thirsty heifers lead together will we share the harvest toils together press the vines autumnal spoils delightful state where peace and love combine to bid our tranquil days unclouded shine here limpid fountains roll through flowery meads here rising forests lift their verdant heads here let me wear my careless life away and in thy arms insensibly decay when late old age our heads shall silver over and our slow pulses dance with joy no more when time no longer will thy beauties spare and only damons eye shall think thee fair then may the gentle hand of welcome death at one soft stroke deprive us both of breath may we beneath one common stone be laid and the same cypress both our ashes shade perhaps some friendly muse in tender verse shall deign our faithful passion to rehearse and future ages with just envy moved be told how damon and his delia loved soliloquy of a beauty in the country written at etonschool by the same twas night and flavia to her room retired with evening chat and sober reading tired there melancholy pensive and alone she meditates on the forsaken town on her raised arm reclined her drooping head she sighed and thus in plaintive accents said ah what avails it to be young and fair to move with negligence to dress with care what worth have all the charms our pride can boast if all in envious solitude are lost where none admire it is useless to excel where none are beaus it is vain to be a belle beauty like wit to judges should be shown both most are valued where they best are known with every grace of nature or of art we cannot break one stubborn country heart the brutes insensible our power defy to love exceeds a squires capacity the town the court is beautys proper sphere that is our heaven and we are angels there in that gay circle thousand cupids rove the court of britain is the court of love how has my conscious heart with triumph glowed how have my sparkling eyes their transport showed at each distinguished birthnight ball to see the homage due to empire paid to me when every eye was fixed on me alone and dreaded mine more than the monarchs frown when rival statesmen for my favor strove less jealous in their power than in their love changed is the scene and all my glories die like flowers transplanted to a colder sky lost is the dear delight of giving pain the tyrant joy of hearing slaves complain in stupid indolence my life is spent supinely calm and dully innocent unblest i wear my useless time away sleep wretched maid all night and dream all day go at set hours to dinner and to prayer for dullness ever must be regular now with mama at tedious whisk i play now without scandal drink insipid tea or in the garden breathe the country air secure from meeting any tempter there from books to work from work to books i rove and am alas at leisure to improve  is this the life a beauty ought to lead were eyes so radiant only made to read these fingers at whose touch even age would glow are these of use for nothing but to sow sure erring nature never could design to form a huswife in a mould like mine o venus queen and guardian of the fair attend propitious to thy votrys prayer let me revisit the dear town again let me be seen  could i that wish obtain all other wishes my own power would gain blenheim writ at the university of oxford in the year      by the same parent of arts whose skilful hand first taught the towering pile to rise and formed the plan with fair proportion architect divine minerva thee to my adventurous lyre assistant i invoke that means to sing blenhemia monument of british fame thy glorious work for thou the lofty towers did to his virtue raise whom often thy shield in peril guarded and thy wisdom steered through all the storms of war  thee too i call thalia sylvan muse who love to rove along the shady paths and verdant bowers of woodstocks happy grove there tuning sweet thy rural pipe while all the dryad train attentive listen let thy warbling song paint with melodious praise the pleasing scene and equal these to pindus honored shades when europe freed confessed the saving power of marleroughs hand britain who sent him forth chief of confederate hosts to fight the cause of liberty and justice grateful raised this palace sacred to her leaders fame a trophy of success with spoils adorned of conquered towns and glorying in the name of that auspicious field where churchills sword vanquished the might of gallia and chastisd rebel bavar  majestic in its strength stands the proud dome and speaks its great design hail happy chief whose valor could deserve reward so glorious grateful nation hail who paidst his service with so rich a meed which most shall i admire which worthiest praise the hero or the people honor doubts and weighs their virtues in an equal scale not thus germania pays the uncancelld debt of gratitude to us  blush caesar blush when thou beholdst these towers ingrate to thee a monument of shame can thou forget whence they are named and what an english arm did for thy throne that day but we disdain or to upbraid or imitate thy guilt steel thy obdurate heart against the sense of obligation infinite and know britain like heaven protects a thankless world for her own glory nor expects reward pleased with the noble theme her task the muse pursues untird and through the palace roves with evernew delight the tapstry rich with gold and gay with all the beauteous paint of various colored silks disposed with skill attracts her curious eye here ister rolls his purple wave and there the granic flood with passing squadrons foams here hardy gaul flies from the sword of britain there to greece effeminate persia yields  in arms opposed marlbrough and alexander vie for fame with glorious competition equal both in valor and in fortune but their praise be different for with different views they fought this to subdue and that to free mankind now through the stately portals issuing forth the muse to softer glories turns and seeks the woodland shade delighted not the vale of tempe famed in song or idas grove such beauty boasts amid the mazy gloom of this romantic wilderness once stood the bower of rosamonda hapless fair sacred to grief and love the crystal fount in which she used to bathe her beauteous limbs still warbling flows pleased to reflect the face of spenser lovely maid when tired she sits beside its flowery brink and views those charms which only rosamond could once excel but see where flowing with a nobler stream a limpid lake of purest waters rolls beneath the widestretchd arch stupendous work through which the danube might collected pour his spacious urn silent a while and smooth the current glides till with an headlong sorce broke and disordered down the steep it falls in loud cascades the silversparkling foam glitters relucent in the dancing ray in these retreats reposed the mighty soul of churchill from the toils of war and state splendidly private and the tranquil joy of contemplation felt while blenheims dome triumphal ever in his mind renewed the memory of his fame and soothed his thoughts with pleasing record of his glorious deeds so by the rage of faction home recalled lucullus while he waged successful war against the pride of asia and the power of mithridates whose aspiring mind no losses could subdue enriched with spoils of conquered nations back returned to rome and in magnificent retirement past the evening of his life  but not alone in the calm shades of honorable ease great marlbro peaceful dwelt indulgent heaven gave a companion to his softer hours with whom conversing he forgot all change of fortune or of taste and in her mind found greatness equal to his own and loved himself in her  thus each by each admired in mutual honor mutual fondness joined like two fair stars with intermingled light in friendly union they together shone aiding each others brightness till the cloud of night eternal quenched the beams of one thee churchill first the ruthless hand so death tore from thy consorts side and called thee hence to the sublimer seats of joy and love where fate again shall join her soul to thine who now regardful of thy fame erects the column to thy praise and sooths her woe with pious honors to thy sacred name immortal lo where towering on the height of yon aerial pillar proudly stands thy image like a guardian god sublime and awes the subject plain beneath his feet the german eagles spread their wings his hand grasps victory its slave such was thy brow majestic such thy martial port when gaul fled from thy frown and in the danube sought a refuge from thy sword  there where the field was deepest stained with gore on hochstets plain the theater of thy glory once was raised a meaner trophy by the imperial hand extorted gratitude which now the rage of malice impotent beseeming ill a regal breast has levelled to the ground mean insult this with better auspices shall stand on british earth to tell the world how marlbro fought for whom and how repaid his services nor shall the constant love of her who raised this monument be lost in dark oblivion that shall be the theme of future bards in ages yet unborn inspired with chaucers fire who in these groves first tuned the british harp and little deemed his humble dwelling should the neighbor be of blenheim house superb to which the throng of travelers approaching shall not pass his roof unnoted but respectful hail with reverence due such honor does the muse obtain her favorites  but the noble pile my theme demands my voice  o shade adored marlbrough who now above the starry sphere dwellst in the palaces of heaven enthroned among the demigods deign to defend this thy abode while present here below and sacred still to thy immortal fame with tutelary care preserve it safe from times destroying hand and cruel stroke of factious envys more relentless rage here may long ages hence the british youth when honor calls them to the field of war behold the trophies which thy valor raised the proud reward of thy successful toils for europes freedom and britannias fame that fired with generous envy they may dare to emulate thy deeds  so shall thy name dear to thy country still inspire her sons with martial virtue and to high attempts excite their arms till other battles won and nations saved new monuments require and other blenheims shall adorn the land to the reverend dr ayscough at oxford writ from paris in the year      by the same say dearest friend how roll thy hours away what pleasing study cheats the tedious day do thou the sacred volumes often explore of wise antiquitys immortal lore where virtue by the charms of wit refined at once exalts and polishes the mind how different from our modern guilty art which pleases only to corrupt the heart whose cursed refinements odious vice adorn and teach to honor what we ought to scorn do thou in sage historians joy to see how roman greatness rose with liberty how the same hands that tyrants durst control their empire stretched from atlas to the pole till wealth and conquest into slaves refined the proud luxurious masters of mankind do thou in lettered greece each charm admire each grace each virtue freedom could inspire yet in her troubled states see all the woes and all the crimes that giddy faction knows till rent by parties by corruption sold or weakly careless or too rashly bold she sunk beneath a mitigated doom the slave and tutress of protecting rome does calm philosophy her aid impart to guide the passions and to mend the heart taught by her precepts have thou learnt the end to which alone the wise their studies bend for which alone by nature were designed the powers of thought  to benefit mankind not like a cloistered drone to read and doze in undeserving undeserved repose but reasons influence to diffuse to clear the enlightened world of every gloomy fear dispel the mists of error and unbind those pedant chains that clog the freeborn mind happy who thus his leisure can employ he knows the purest hours of tranquil joy nor vexed with pangs that busier bosoms tear nor lost to social virtues pleasing care safe in the port yet laboring to sustain those who still float on the tempestuous main so lock the days of studious quiet spent so boil in wisdom found divine content so cambray worthy of a happier doom the virtuous slave of louis and of rome good dr hough worster thus supports his drooping age far from courtflattry far from partyrage he who in youth a tyrants frown defied firm and intrepid on his countrys side her boldest champion then and now her mildest guide o generous warmth o sanctity divine to emulate his worth my friend be thine learn from his life the duties of the gown learn not to flatter nor insult the crown nor basely servile court the guilty great nor raise the church a rival to the state to error mild to vice alone severe seek not to spread the law of love by fear the priest who plagues the world can never mend no foe to man was ever to god a friend let reason and let virtue faith maintain all force but theirs is impious weak and vain me other cares in other climes engage cares that become my birth and suit my age in various knowledge to improve my youth and conquer prejudice worst foe to truth by foreign arts domestic faults to mend enlarge my notions and my views extend the useful science of the world to know which books can never teach or pedants show a nation here i pity and admire whom noblest sentiments of glory fire yet taught by customs force and bigot fear to serve with pride and boast the yoke they bear whose nobles born to cringe and to command in courts a mean in camps a generous band from each low tool of power content receive those laws their dreaded arms to europe give whose people vain in want in bondage blessed though plundered gay industrious though oppressed with happy follies rise above their fate the jest and envy of each wiser state yet here the muses deigned a while to sport in the short sunshine of a favoring court here boileau strong in sense and sharp in wit who from the ancients like the ancients writ permission gained inferior vice to blame by flattering incense to his masters fame here moliere first of comic wits excelled whatever athenian theaters beheld by keen yet decent satire skilled to please with morals mirth uniting strength with ease now charmed i hear the bold corneille inspire heroic thoughts with shakespeares force and fire now sweet racine with milder influence move the softened heart to pity and to love with mingled pain and pleasure i survey the pompous works of arbitrary sway proud palaces that drained the subjects store raised on the ruins of the oppressed and poor where even mute walls are taught to flatter state and painted triumphs style ambition great the victories of louis xiv painted in the galleries of versailles  with more delight those pleasing shades i view where conde from an envious court withdrew chantilly  where sick of glory faction power and pride sure judge how empty all who all had tried beneath his palms the weary chief reposed and lifes great scene in quiet virtue closed with shame that other famed retreat i see adorned by art disgraced by luxury st cloud  where orleans wasted every vacant hour in the wild riot of unbounded power where feverish debauch and impious love stained the mad table and the guilty grove with these amusements is thy friend detained pleased and instructed in a foreign land yet often a tender wish recals my mind from present joys to dearer left behind o native isle fair freedoms happiest seat at thought of thee my bounding pulses beat at thought of thee my heart impatient burns and all my country on my soul returns when shall i see thy fields whose plenteous grain no power can ravish from the industrious swain when kiss with pious love the sacred earth that gave a burleigh or a russel birth when in the shade of laws that long have stood propd by their care or strengthened by their blood of fearless independence wisely vain the proudest slave of bourbons race disdain yet oh what doubt what sad presaging voice whispers within and bids me not rejoice bids me contemplate every state around from sultry spain to norways icy bound bids their lost rights their ruined glories see and tells me these like england once were free to mr poyntz ambassador at the congress of soissons in the year      written at paris by the same o thou whose friendship is my joy and pride whose virtues warm me and whose precepts guide thou to whom greatness rightly understood is but a larger power of being good say poyntz amidst the toils of anxious state does not thy secret soul desire retreat do thou not wish the task of glory done thy busy life at length might be thy own that to thy loved philosophy resigned no care might ruffle thy unbended mind just is the wish for sure the happiest meed to favored man by smiling heaven decreed is to reflect at ease on glorious pains and calmly to enjoy what virtue gains not him i praise who from the world retired by no enlivening generous passion fired on flowery couches slumbers life away and gently bids his active powers decay who fears bright glorys awful face to see and shuns renown as much as infamy but blessed is he who exercised in cares to private leisure public virtue bears who tranquil ends the race he nobly run and decks repose with trophies labor won him honor follows to the secret shade and crowns propitious his declining head in his retreats their harps the muses string for him in lays unbought spontaneous sing friendship and truth on all his moments wait pleased with retirement better than with state and round the bower where humbly great he lies fair olives bloom or verdant laurels rise so when thy country shall no more demand the needful aid of thy sustaining hand when peace restored shall on her downy wing secure repose and careless leisure bring then to the shades of learned ease retired the world forgetting by the world admired among thy books and friends thou shall possess contemplative and quiet happiness pleased to review a life in honor spent and painful merit paid with sweet content yet though thy hours uncloggd with sorrow roll though wisdom calm and science feed thy soul one dearer bliss remains to be possessed that only can improve and crown the rest  permit thy friend this secret to reveal which thy own heart perhaps would better tell the point to which our sweetest passions move is to be truly loved and fondly love this is the charm that smooths the troubled breast friend to our health and author of our rest bids every gloomy vexing passion fly and tunes each jarring string to harmony even while i write the name of love inspires more pleasing thoughts and more enlivening fires beneath his power my raptured fancy glows and every tender verse more sweetly flows dull is the privilege of living free our hearts were never formed for liberty some beauteous image well imprinted there can best defend them from consuming care in vain to groves and gardens we retire and nature in her rural works admire though grateful these yet these but faintly charm they may delight us but can never warm may some fair eyes my friend thy bosom fire with pleasing pangs of ever gay desire and teach thee that soft science which alone still to thy searching mind rests slightly known thy soul though great is tender and refined to friendship sensible to love inclined and therefore long thou can not arm thy breast against the entrance of so sweet a guest hear what the inspiring muses bid me tell for heaven shall ratify what they reveal a chosen bride shall in thy arms be placed with all the attractive charms of beauty graced whose wit and virtue shall thy own express distinguished only by their softer dress thy greatness she or thy retreat shall share sweeten tranquillity or soften care her smiles the taste of every joy shall raise and add new pleasure to renown and praise till charmed you own the truth my verse would prove that happiness is near allied to love verses to be written under a picture of mr poyntz by the same such is thy form o poyntz but who shall find a hand or colors to express thy mind a mind unmoved by every vulgar fear in a false world that dares to be sincere wise without art without ambition great though firm yet pliant active though sedate with all the richest stores of learning fraught yet better still by native prudence taught that fond the griefs of the distressed to heal can pity frailties it could never feel that when misfortune sued never sought to know what sect what party whether friend or foe that fixed on equal virtues temperate laws despises calumny and shuns applause that to its own perfections singly blind would for another think this praise designed an epistle to mr pope from rome    0 by the same immortal bard for whom each muse has wove the fairest garlands of thaonian grove preserved our drooping genius to restore when addison and congreve are no more after so many stars extinct in night the darkened ages last remaining light to thee from latian realms this verse is writ inspired by memory of ancient wit for now no more these climes their influence boast fallen is their glory and their virtue lost from tyrants and from priests the muses fly daughters of reason and of liberty nor baiae now nor umbrias plain they love nor on the banks of nar or mincius rove to thamess flowery borders they retire and kindle in thy breast the roman fire so in the shades where cheered with summer rays melodious linnets warbled sprightly lays soon as the faded falling leaves complain of gloomy winters unauspicious reign no tuneful voice is heard of joy or love but mournful silence saddens all the grove unhappy italy whose altered state has felt the worst severity of fate not that barbarian hands her fasces broke and bowed her haughty neck beneath their yoke not that her palaces to earth are thrown her cities desert and her fields unsown but that her ancient spirit is decayed that scared wisdom from her bounds is fled that there the source of science flows no more whence its rich streams supplied the world before illustrious names that once in latium shined born to instruct and to command mankind

unfelt before impart ii is it glad summers balmy breath that blows from the fair jessmine and the blushing rose her balmy breath and all her blooming store of rural bliss was here before often have i

can bestow was given to me in this auspicious bower iv here first my lucy sweet in virgin charms was yielded to my longing arms and round our nuptial bed hovering with purple wings the idalian boy shook from his radiant torch the blissful fires of innocent desires while venus scattered myrtles over her head whence then this strange increase of joy he only he can tell who matched like me if such

grief of grief surpassing every other woe far as the purest bliss the happiest love can on thennobled mind bestow exceeds the vulgar joys that move our gross desires inelegant and low ii ye tufted groves ye gently falling rills ye high oershadowing hills ye lawns gaysmiling with eternal green often have you my lucy seen but never shall you now behold her more nor will she now with fond delight

would the dryads of these woods rejoice to hear her heavenly voice for her despising when she deigned to sing the sweetest songsters of the spring the woodlark and the linnet pleased no more the nightingale was mute and every shepherds flute was cast in silent scorn away while all attended to her sweeter lay ye larks and linnets now resume your song and thou melodious philomel again thy plaintive story tell for death has stopped that tuneful tongue whose music could alone your warbling notes excel iv in vain i look around over all the wellknown ground my lucys wonted footsteps to

never bore a share nor with endearing art would heal thy wounded heart of every secret grief that festerd there nor did her fond affection on the bed of sickness watch thee and thy languid head whole nights on her unwearied arm sustain and charm away the sense of pain nor did she crown your mutual flame with pledges dear and with a fathers tender name xvi o best of wives o dearer far to me than

sly enchaunter overtook overhent clad like a fairy knight in armor gay with painted shield and spear right forward bent in knightly fashion guise and show of courage hardiment that aye prepared was for bloody fight whereat the fairy elfin knight with speeches gent him first saluted who well as he might him fair salutes again as beseems seems courteous knight x then began he discourse or argument purpose frame of valiant deeds achieved by foreign knights of might valor prowess great and mighty fame which emulation breeds in virtuous breast and kindles martial heat of arts and sciences for warrior proper fit meet and knight that would in feats of arms excel or him who rather liefer choosing calm retreat with peace and gentle virtue aye would dwell who have their triumphs like as has bellona fell xi these as he said beseemed knight to know and all be they in fairylond ytaught where every art and all fair virtues grow yet various climes with various fruits are fraught and such in one has full perfection reached raught the which no skill may in another rear so glozd the enchaunter till he has him brought to a huge rock that clomb so high in air that from it he hardly uneath the murmuring surge mote hear xii thence the salt wave beyond in prospect wide a spacious plain the false enchaunter showed with goodly castles decked on every side and silver streams that down the champain flowed and washed the vineyards that beside them stood and groves of myrtle als the lamp of day his orient beams displayed withouten cloud which lightly on the glistening waters play and tinge the castles woods and hills with purple ray xiii so fair a landscape charmed the wondering knight and eke the breath of morning fresh and sweet inspired his jocund spirit with delight and ease of heart for soft persuasion meet then him the traitor base began fair entreat and from the rock as downward they descend of that blessed land his praises can repeat till he him moved has with him to to go wend so to the billowy shore their hasty march they bend xiv there in a painted bark all trim and gay whose sails full glad embraced the wanton wind there sat a stranger man or woman wight in quaint array that seemed of various garbs together atone combined of europe afric east and western inde als round about him many creatures stood of several nations and of diverse kind apes serpents birds with human speech endowed and monsters of the land and wonders of the flood xv he was to weet a mighty traveller who curiosity thereafter was called hight and well he knew each coast and harbor fair and every nations latitude and site and how to steer the wandering bark aright so to him strait the false enchaunter bore and with him likewise brought the redcross knight then fairly him besought to waft them over swift flew the dancing bark and reached the adverse shore xvi there when they landed were them ran to greet a bevy bright of damsels gent and gay who with soft smiles and salutation sweet and courteous violence would force them stay and rest them in their bower not far away their bower that most luxuriously was adorned set forth dight with all the dainties of air earth and sea all that mote please the taste and charm the sight the pleasure of the board and charm of beauty bright xvii als might he therein hear a mingled sound of feast and song and laughing jollity that in the noise was all distinction drowned of graver sense or musicks harmony yet were there some in that blithe company that aptly could discourse of virtuous lore of manners wisdom and sound policy yet would not nould they often open their sacred store ne might their voice be heard mid riot and uproar xviii thereto the joys of idleness and love and luxury that besots the noblest mind and custom prevalent at distance drove all sense and relish of a higher kind whereby the soul to virtue is refined instead whereof the arts of slavery were taught of slavery perverse and blind that vainly boasts her native liberty yet wears the chains of pride of lust and gluttony xix of which the redcross knight right well aware would in no wise agree with them to go albeit with courtly glee their leader fair called hight politessa him did kindly woo but all was false pretense and hollow show false as the flowers which to their breasts they tied or those which seemed in their cheeks to glow for both were false and not by nature died false rivals of the spring and beautys rosy pride xx then from behind them straitway began advaunce an uncouth stripling quaintly habited as for some revel mask or antic dance all checkered over with yellow blue and red als in a vizor black he shrouds his head the which he tossed to and fro amain and often eft his lathy falchion brandished as if he meant fierce battle to attempt darrain and like a wanton ape eft skipd he on the plain xxi and est about him skipd a gaudy throng of youthful gallants frolic trim and gay chanting in careless notes their amourous song matched with like careless gests like amourous play als were they gorgeous dressed in rich array and well accepted of that female train whose hearts to joy and mirth devoted aye each proffered love receive without disdain and part without regret from each latefavourd swain xxii and now they do accord in wanton dance to join their hands upon the flowery plain the whiles with amourous leer and eyes askaunce each damsel fires with love her glowing swain till allimpatient of the tickling pain in sudden laughter forth at once they break and ending so their dance each tender twain to shady bowers forthwith themselves betake deep hid in myrtle groves beside a silver lake xxiii thereat the redcross knight was much enmovd and began his heart with indignation swell to view in forms so made to be beloved ne faith ne truth ne heavenly virtue dwell but lust instead and falsehood child of hell and glutton sloth and love of gay attire and sooth to say them well could parallel their lusty lovers paramours in vain desire well fitted to each dame was every gallant squire xxiv yet when their sovereign calls them forth to arms their sovereign whose commands behests they most revere right wisely can they menage wars alarms and wield with valor great the martial spear so that their name is dreaded far and near oh that for liberty they so did fight then need not fairyland their prowess fear ne give in charge to her adventurous knight their friendship to beware and sensedeluding slight xxv but not for liberty they wagen war but solely to please aggrate their mighty lord

applied and in that school of servitude ere while had learned to bow and grin and flatter and beguile xxvii for to that seminary of fashions vain the rich and noble from all parts repair where grown enamored of the gaudy train and courteous haviour gent and debonair they cast to imitate such semblaunce fair and deeming meanly of their native land their own rough virtues they disdain to wear and back returning dressed by foreign hond ne other matter care ne other understond xxviii wherefore the enchaunter vile who sore was grieved to see the knight reject those damsels gay wherewith he thought him sure to have deceived was minded to that court him to convey and daze his eyes with majestys bright ray so to a stately castle he him brought which in the midst of a great garden lay and wisely was by cunning craftsmen wrought and with all riches decked surpassing human thought xxix there underneath a sumptuous canopy that with bright ore and diamonds glittered far sat the swollen form of royal pride surquedry and deemed itself by all means omnino allgates some creature rare while its own haughty state it mote compare with the base countenance of the vassal fry that seemed to

sooth that all he did or said from his own motion and free grace did rise and that he justly hight immortal great and wise xxxi and eke to each of that fame gilded train that meekly round that lordly throne did stand was by that wizard tied a magic chain whereby their actions all he mote command and rule with hidden influence the land yet to his lord he outwardly did bend and those same magic chains within his hand did seem to place albeit by the end he held them fast that none them from his gripe mote rend xxxii he was to weet an old and wrinkled mage deep read in all the arts of policy and from experience grown so crafty sage that none his secret counsels mote descry ne search the mines of his deep subtlety thereto fair peace he loved and cherished and traffic did promote and industry whereby the vulgar were in quiet fed and the proud lords in ease and plenty wallowed xxxiii thence all the gorgeous splendour of the court since since the sole business of the rich and great

treated both by edward and his son the prince of wales with all the regard due to the quality and virtue of so great a prince to alleviate his captivity edward entertained him and the other french prisoners with diversions of various kinds among which a tournament he held at windsor on the   d of april to solemnize the feast of st george the patron of the order of the garter held the chief

holy mounts dispensed at once their oracles and laws till fierce paulinus and his roman bands them and their gods defying drove them thence to seek for shelter in hibernian shades yet still enamored

cause of honor virtue and celestial truth under the name and holy patronage of cappadocian george britannias saint such is the plan by generous edward formed a plan of glory that beyond the reach of his own conquering arms shall propagate the sovereignty of britain and erect her monarchs into judges of mankind but from this days decisions from the choice of his first colleagues shall succeeding

the labrinths of the human mind nor blush for this good end yourselves to wear fallacious forms to plead the cause of false but specious merit at his throne appear in borrowed shapes and there with artful guile when the shrill trumpet cites the candidates urge your pretensions all the power employ of wit and eloquence edward i trust the trial shall abide which shall but tend to manifest that not from arrogance but conscious virtue has he thus assumed above all other kings to be the judge and great rewarder of heroic deeds nor wholly unassisted will i leave my royal charge but with blessed influence clear his intellectual eye from the dim mists it happily has contracted from a long unebbing current of felicity unhopd unequalled triumphs from the view of captive monarchs and the glittering throng who at his summons from all climates come to take as from their sovereign honors new when heaven tries mortals in unusual ways it is fit it should afford unusual aid now sages to yon

end of which is a royal canopy with the figure of st george and the motto of the garter honi soit qui mal y pense beneath it embroidered in gold under this canopy appears seated on an elevation of two or three steps king edward in the habit of the order of the garter with a scepter in his right hand and a globe in his left on his left hand is seated queen philippa with a crown upon her head and dressed in a royal mantle of crimson velvet powdered with embroidered garters and an enameled that the ladies of the knights of the garter wore this ensign of the order upon their left arms may be

imperial robes of france and on the same side but a step lower sits edward the black prince in the robes belonging to the prince of wales next to queen philippa are seated the rest of edwards children and next to the black prince on the other side stand the french prisoners and a great number of lords etc richly dressed on the floor at some distance stands garter king at arms in the habit of his office holding in his hand a garter with the grand collar of the order near him stand other heralds ushers attendants etc flourish of trumpets kettledrums etc after which edward rising up from his throne addresses himself to the assembly edward that hither from your distant residence by solemn invitation noble guests i have entreated your illustrious train misconstrue not to levity and pride or ostentatious vain magnificence unworthy the grave majesty of kings unworthy your attention my renown this bright assemblage of the wise the brave the noble the magnificent the fair the ornaments of europe have i sought to grace the pomp of virtue to adorn with noblest offerings her unspotted shrine attracting thus to her divine commands the awful veneration of mankind this was the cause great princes this the call the voice of virtue not of englands king that with respectful zeal ye heard and followed from burgundys rich vineyards from the meads of hainault and brabant the rocky wave of danube from germanias warlike towers imperial mother of an hundred states from spain long exercised by moorish arms from italys fair princedoms and the walls of seawashd venice adrias haughty spouse with me then all ye virtuous by what style recorded in the registers of fame knights senators or soldiers ermind lords or sceptered princes from whatever clime ye come ennobled by heroic acts with me unite the splendour of your names to dignify the erection of a new and noble order which to heavens high praise and to heavens champion cappadocian george on this his holy festival i mean to found a recompense for worthiest deeds thus as the orient sun adored of old by prostrate persia owed his deity less to that genial and benignant heat that cherishes and warms the seeds of life than to those gorgeous beams that deck with gold and crimson the gay portals of the morn so shall this rising order owe its fame and brightest luster to the splendid train of lords and purple princes who are met this day to usher and adorn its birth nor deem that to allure heroic minds my private interests partially to serve to list the valiant in ambitions cause and form a league of conquest i have laid in subtie policy this great design edward being engaged in a war with france for the obtaining that crown in order to draw into england great multitudes of foreigners with whom he might negociate either for their personal service or aids of troops to assist him in that undertaking ordered during the truce that then subsisted between the two crowns publication to be made of a great tournament to be held at windsor an expedient says rapin which could not fail of success because it was entirely agreeable to the taste of that age accordingly many persons of distinction came over to all of whom he gave an honorable reception caressing them in such a manner that they could never sufficiently admire his politeness magnificence and liberality to render these entertainments the more solemn and to free himself also from the ceremonies to which the difference of rank and condition would have subjected him he caused a circular hall of boards to be run up at windsor  00 feet in diameter there it was that he feasted all the knights at one table which was called the round table in memory of the great arthur who as it is pretended instituted an order of knighthood by that name next year he caused a more solid building to be erected that he might continue yearly the same diversions during that time he treated with these several lords about the aids wherewith each could furnish him in proportion to his forces his rival king philip could not see without jealousy spaniards italians germans flemings and frenchmen themselves flock to england to assist at these tournamrnts he suspected some hidden design in these entertainments and to break edwards meosures caused the like to be published in his dominions which meeting with success proved a countermine to edwards main design so that he did not long continue to keep up his round table from thence however it is generally agreed he took the first hint of instituting the order of the garter but as his purpose in erecting this order was very different from that which had induced him to revive arthurs round table as he had in this no private views no ambitious scheme of engaging such as should be admitted into this fraternity to assist him in his wars he thought proper in order to obviate the like jealousies and suspicion as had alarmed king philip to signify by his motto the purity of his intentions and to retort shame upon all those who should put any malignant construction upon his design in instituting this order this therefore i take to be the true meaning and import of the famous motto honi soit qui mal y pense the not understanding the purport of which gave rise in all probability to that vulgar story of the countess of salisburys garter rejected by all the best writers ashamed be he who with malignant eye so reads my purpose and be he accursed whoever in aftertimes shall so pervert this sacred institution to the world i here consign it to the good and great of every age and clime and them alone now sound the trumpet bid the candidates with confidence appear and urge their claims  flourish of trumpets etc which is answered by another trumpet from without then enter a grandee of spain magnificently

sons waging incessant war ere long regained their ancient realms of leon arragon and rich castillia in which great exploits my brave progenitors by valor zeal and loyalty distinguished from their kings gained those high honors princely signories and proud prerogatives which have extolled the name of guzman to such envied grandeur that scarce above it towers the regal throne these honors undiminishd undefiled to me delivered down might well content a vulgar mind but spirits highly born are full of generous and aspiring thoughts and use the vantage ground of rank and power but to ascend still higher thus i come thy garter to solicit pleased great prince with thee to be enrolled thy brother knight and fearing no repulse nobility as nearest in her orbit first receives the beams of majesty alone can bear the fullness of that glory which oerpowrs inferior natures virtues self would blush did she at once approach too near the throne but the young eagle born amid the blaze of

thou therefore proved thy self deserving to be called their son to thee their prosperous virtues have indeed transmitted lineal rank and titles proud by them more hardly gained for which thou standst to custom and the indulgence of thy country indebted guzman in a large account which thou must first discharge by noble deeds ere thou can style those dignities thine own this if thou have not paid why do thou seek like thriftless prodigals to swell the debt and overwhelm thy self with obligations virtue is honor and the noblest titles are but the public stamps set on the ore to ascertain its value to mankind it were a kind of treason to my crown to mark base metal with the royal impress and put off lazy pride in virtues name would thou attain my garter seek it there where thy heroic ancestors acquired their glorious honors in the embattled field among the squadron of the warlike moors or in the council of thy king by truth and wisdom equal to the important trust be what thy fathers were and then return to ask the pledge of merit from my hand and be the fit companion of a king exit spaniard flourish of trumpets etc which as before is answered by another trumpet from

bands and honest intercourse of mutual trade had thou by these humane and generous arts which thy mistaken pride so much disdains enriched at once thy country and thy self then not unworthy had thou been to wear the brightest marks of honor but thy wealth the baseborn child of sordid usury that foe to commerce nurse of idleness stains and degrades thee from thy noble birth nor in the usurer can i discern the senator of genoa  to enlarge the mind with generous sentiments to raise its aims by virtuous emulation here i sit but not to gild with honors beams that selfish passion which congeals the heart and stops the streams of sweet benevolence mean avarice the vice of narrowest souls incapable of glory  wealth thou say can buy even empire and to julius gave dominion over his country  fatal

the goths the huns and vandals from their barren hills and rugged woods descending to their steel subject the roman gold yet i deny not the power and use of riches to the wise and good in public or in private life they are the means of virtue and best serve the noblest purposes but in the use not in the bare possession lies the merit show me thy merit then thy bounteous acts public munificence or

plains by isther rhine and po hungarian and bohemian flemish french venetian spanish guelph and ghibeline whence in just confidence secure i come this military honor to demand due to my toils and service to my wounds my laurels and that generous love of glory which without any call or public cause or private animosity alone raised my strong arm and drew my dreadful sword wherever mars his crimson flag displayed that was my country thither swift i bore my ready valor and the dauntless band of various nations under my command prepared to sell their blood their limbs their lives nor where the right nor where the justest cause deigned we to ask  those intricate debates we left to lazy penmen in the shade of coward ease while our impetuous fire still bore us forward ardent to pursue through dangers roughest paths the steps to fame on such a spirit should thy favor smile but let me wonder edward that so long thy ear the vain pretensions could endure of men unknown to war attendants meet on some luxurious asiatick court or female distaffreign but suiting ill the presence of a monarch great in arms had thou to those inglorious sons of peace thy martial order given the

shrine the wise their incense offer whence inspired they draw divine ambition and heroic scorn of vulgar prejudices vulgar fears virtues the peoples idol and by them rewarded well with popular applause that idle breath the gift and prize of fools it is thine to govern not to court mankind nor on their smiles precarious to depend but nobly force them to depend on thine o sacred sir can

of enfranchisement not due it seems from monarchs to their slaves but know vile counselor of infamy that i disdain thy politics those false and shallow politics by which my sire weakjudging edward was betrayed to shame and foul destruction while to such as thee his ear and heart incautious he resigned and was indeed their slave not englands king by maxims different far have i sustained the strength and splendour of my regal state on the broad basis of true wisdom fixed with solid firmness by encouraging the generous love of virtue and of fame that source of valor pledge of victory by granting to my subjects what indeed is their inherent right security the cheerful father of content and peace of industry and opulence which fills with smiling multitudes the land and pays in willing subsidies that princes care who lays up treasure in his peoples hearts by holding with a firm impartial hand the steady scale of justice not alone betwixt my subjects in their private rights but in the general more important cause betwixt the crown and them the different claims of freedom and of just prerogative transgressing not myself by boundless power nor suffering others to transgress those laws that in their golden chain together bind for common good the whole united state but more than all by guarding from contempt or impious violation that supreme protectress of all government and law religion

all my subject nations to call down from heavenly wisdom her eternal fire a fixed secure felicity beyond the force of human prudence to attain these are my arts of government those arts by which my british crown i have advanced above the imperial diadem above the pride of africks or of asias thrones i would not tell thee this but that thou seem a stranger to my fame as to my realm and to the real greatness of a king whose sacred dignity by thee traduced much it behooves a king to vindicate not by rejecting only with disdain thy arrogant pretensions but in thee dishonouring and branding with reproach thy tenets also the pernicious lore of tyrants and usurpers which thy tongue blaspheming justice government and law has in a land of freedom dared to vent hence from my kingdom with thy quickest speed lest the revenge of an insulted king with sudden ruin intercept thy flight exit politician king john permit me edward to thy royal voice to add my suffrage also and with thee protest against this coward policy that meanly skulks behind opprobrious fraud and low unprincely artifice i feel a virtue in my heart a generous pride that tells me kings were clothed with majesty encircled

borrowed characters have stood before thy sage tribunal to prefer the claims of valor wealth nobility and those soft specious flatterers who beneath the rosy wreaths of pleasure and of love conceal the sickly and disgustful brow of riot and debauch and often win from weak unmanly princes the rich prize to virtue due and wisdom not to these the cankers of a state but least of all due to that traitor to his king and country who laboring to build up the regal throne beyond its due proportion and the strength of those foundations which the laws have laid oerwhelms the people and at once oerturns his royal master places him at best on an uneasy tottering pinnacle the mark of execration and reproach these claims have thou rejected like a king discerning in mankind and knowing well the value of his favors like a king deserving the high office of the judge and arbiter of europe like a king equal to his great fame and worth the care of those immortal spirits who this day have quitted their celestial residence to view and to approve thy glorious deeds but edward be not thou amazed to find that those who lately for thy favor sued were not the personages they assumed o king thou art beset with counterfeits the very opposites to us who seem far better than they are for flattery camelionlike accommodates with care to the courthue his changeful countenance and when a prince is brave magnanimous and high in spirit then ambition wears a face of dignity and nothing breathes but lofty enterprises conquest power and schemes of glory to the sovereign ear pretending love and care for his renown with more than duteous zeal  of these beware for as the theban queen in fables old was by the specious guile of fraudful jove in her amphitryons form to guilt betrayed so by these counterfeits are kings seduced even in the most beloved suspectless shape to take a traitor to their royal arms but thou shall know them edward by their works and of this truth be most assured that he who in his private commerce with mankind is mean dishonest interested false can never be true to thee nor can he love his prince who feels not for his countrys good thus warned we leave thee mighty prince be firm be constant in the paths of fair renown think it thy duty to revere thyself the sacred laws of chivalry the wise injunctions by thy order laid on all the garterd knights so shall thy fame remain the great example of all future kings farewell for lo the genius of thy realm with all his pomp attended comes to share and grace the glories of this signal day these clouds of fragrance

watch the british empire still intent to check alternately the incroaching waves of regal power and popular liberty i chief attentive near the royal throne take up my watchful station to infuse my sage and moderate counsels in those ears which wisdom has prepared and purified to relish honest though unpleasing truth thus am i always though invisible attendant edward on thy glorious deeds but on this solemn day have i vouchsafed to manifest my presence to declare not in those whispers which have often spoke peace to thy conscious heart but audibly and evident to all the assent of heaven to the great business which has gathered here this troop of princes from all nations round hence all may know that virtue has a train more bright than earthly empire can command know that those actions which are great and good receive a nobler sanction from the free and universal voice of all mankind which is the voice of heaven than from the highest the most illustrious act of regal power this

regards the tuneful tongue it is senseless rapture all and empty song no pollio sheds his genial influence round no varus listens whilst the groves resound even those who most the muses charms admire

when stayed reflection comes uncalled at last and gray experience counts each folly past untuned and harsh the sweetest strains appear and loudest paeans but fatigue the ear it is true the man of verse though born to ills too often deserves the very fate he feels when vainly frequent at the great mans board he shares in every vice with every lord makes to their taste his sober sense submit and against his reason madly arms his wit heaven but in justice turns their serious heart to scorn the wretch whose life belies his art he only he should haunt the muses grove whom youth might reverence

kind regard with partial fondness views this humble bard even you he dreads  ah kindly cease to raise unwilling censure by exacting praise just to itself the jealous world will claim a right to judge to give or cancel fame and if the officious zeal unbounded flows the friend too partial is the worst of foes platonis apologia behold the athenian sage whose piercing mind had traced the wily labrinths of mankind when now condemned he leaves his infant care to all those evils man is born to bear not to his friends alone the charge he yields but nobler hopes on juster motives builds bids even his foes their future steps attend and dare to censure if they dared offend would thus the poet trust his offspring forth or bloomed our britain with athenian worth would the brave foe the imperfect work engage with honest freedom not with partial rage what just productions might the world surprise what other popes what other maros rise but since by foes or friends alike deceived too

heart when i meet with your eyes in my sleep now no longer thy image i see nor the first of my thoughts when i wake is of thee when from thee no more of thy absence i plain when with thee i feel

thought a grace when first the fixed arrow i plucked from my heart oh methought i should die so severe was the smart but from power so oppressive to set myself clear torments greater than dying with patience i would bear when limd the poor bird thus with eagerness strains nor regrets the lost plume so his freedom he gains the loss of his plumage small time will restore and once tried the false twig it can cheat him no more the old flame never flatter yourself to believe while it dwells on my tongue in my heart still must live our dangers when past with delight we repeat what in suffering was pain to remembrance is sweet it is thus when the soldier returns from the wars he fights over his old battles and vaunts of his scars with pleasure the captive his liberty gained the fetters thus shows which once held him enchaind thus i talk and i still will talk on while i may nor heed i though you disbelieve what i say i ask not that phoebe my talk should approve let her too if she can talk

new boldness gained offending thus forgiving thus we lay long time entranced with the alternate play till warned too soon by envious night we part the thrilling joy still flutters round my heart
