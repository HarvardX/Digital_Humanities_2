such only can the following trifles hope to be accepted and that they are truly such is the only apology the author can make for having wished to address them to him whose qualities ennoble rank and adorn both public and private life  that this is not the style of dedication but the language of truth the world can attest or the writer would blush to use it he is equally sensible of and grateful for the honor of being permitted to subscribe himself  his graces highly obliged and very obedient humble servant thomas hull  preface the following little compositions which i have dignified with the title of moral tales have been the employment of several leisure hours at different periods of time some of them have been written many years as the respective dates specify but none of them printed till now except the last in the second volume of which further mention shall be made in its proper place  mr addison describes himself as always being possessed of a disposition to examine such old prints and ballads as he saw pasted upon the walls of cottages etc i have not only discovered the same turn in myself and i would i could find something else more similar to that excellent writer but i have ever even from childhood felt my attention peculiarly engaged by stories related in company which have contained in them any thing of the mavelous and supernatural hence it is probably that i have so long retained many of the singular events whereon the ensuing compositions are founded  i have been i can say it with great truth repeatedly urged to publish them by friends who have seen the manuscripts  the reader perhaps will call them very partial friends it may be so and i am ready to acknowledge that after a careful revisal they are much better calculated to elicit the approbation of a kind heart than to obtain the commendation of a critical judgment  henry or virtue its own reward  addressed to john beard esquire        musa nec immemores nos sinit esse tui from an inscription in

bosom grew when yonder point arose to view with premature belief elate i fondly thought indulgent fate would spare the produce of my toil to make my homely dwelling smile presumptuous thought  i could not save the scantiest pittance from the wave afresh i feel each throb each fear each horror of the former year again i see the day overcast again i hear the hollow blast again i hear the billows roar again they burst upon the shore again i see my vessel lost and all my earthly wishes crossed all that should be the means of life of comfort to a faithful wife all that an infant race should save deep buried in a watery grave yet conscious rectitude of heart can mavelous relief impart to the endurings of that breast where guilt was never known a guest and innocence precludes despair though woe a while may harbor there o had i but the means again to tempt the fortune of the main hope whispers still i could remove the sorrows of the hearts i love and know thou not old edmund cried who had his pensive course descried and often had listened to the tale which howel squandered in the gale  have thou not heard to whom pertain the acres of that rich domain which over yon fertile summit spreads

honest hands have toiled in vain to set the active spirit free from scorn that curse of penury and bid the wellintending mind regain its rank among mankind his bounteous deeds i often hear his name

prospects round me grew what numbers did my friendship court what numbers proffer me support but now the flattering dream is over now means and prospects are no more nor have i should thy lord extend his bounteous help one single friend who would my guarantee become should i return successless home no god and god alone must be the needy mans security within his eyes big sorrows tide swelled high and further speech denied old edmund of his woe partook and left the beach with grieved look but ere the fall of evening shade in sorrow to his lord conveyed afflicted howels fallen state his various strokes of adverse fate which alcon pondered in his breast while darkness lulled the world to rest soon as the sun with gladsome ray illumines the ensuing day alcon obscured in mean disguise with edmund to the seabeach hies poor howel as was wont they find sighing his sorrows to the wind edmund his pensive steps pursues and the preceding theme renews while alcon slowly loitring near partakes it with attentive ear why will thou not old edmund cries pursue the measure i advise to alcon thy distress reveal he may repair for he can feel again poor howels doubts outweigh his hopes as on the former day he lays anew each sorrow bare his diffidence and his despair and as before his plainings end  i must not to thy words attend not having now one single friend who would my guarantee become lest i return successless home no god and god alone must be the needy mans security i take thy surety alcon cries doffing in haste his rough disguise from me thou shall have means again to try thy fortunes on the main and god and god alone shall be the needy mans security poor howel tries in vain to speak convulsive sobs his uttrance check with bursting tears at length bedewed tears only spoke his gratitude when alcon o how meek the mind thus by benevolence refined the generous alcon turned aside as though his grace he strove to hide while such a joy dilates his heart as goodness only can impart such joy as they alone can know who feel the blessings they bestow not only stores of merchandise his large munificence supplies but to console the adventrers mind for his dear mourners left behind he vows their guardian to become till howel shall review his home their parting sigh their sad embrace allayed by such transcendant grace once more the merchant rears the sail greeting with smiles the rising gale and as he quits the lessening shores repeated prayers for alcon pours five tedious years have now gone over and blessed him with a wondrous store beyond even hopes extent his gains have recompensed his anxious pains now his return his thought employs now he anticipates the joys at honored alcons foot to lay his bounteous loan  to wipe away the tears a sorrowing wife had shed to raise her sad declining head and with returning comfort cheer his little ones now doubly dear his newaccumulated hoard within one precious casket stored with care he seals and on the case that nothing might the mark efface not even the brine of dashing waves his benefactors name engraves this done the crew with joy behold the canvas to the wind unfold serenely placid is the air the point

unfold as wound his feelings to behold for every newadvancing wave some added sight of horror gave here human bodies swollen in death there gasping in their latest breath who sore their dimming eye balls strain towered land they never must reach again while alcon with compassions eye roams over this scene of misery the sculptured casket strikes the shore which held the shipwreckd howels store and as the ebbing waves retreat the casket lies at alcons seet with eager haste and wild surprise into the strange contents he pries scarce had he spied the mass within and howels grateful tribute
