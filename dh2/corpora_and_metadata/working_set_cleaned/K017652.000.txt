an account of the rise progress and state of the london infirmary supported by charitable and voluntary subscription for the relief of sick and diseased manufacturers seamen in merchant service and their wives and children from the first institution on the  d of november    0 to the   th of may      inclusive  give that you may receive  london printed in the year of our lord       an account of the london infirmary of all circumstances that affect the mind of man with compassion reasons for the institution no one seems to touch it so nearly as the seeing our fellow creatures laboring with diseases and even perishing under them for want of proper and timely assistance for who that is not savage in nature can pass regardless by those numbers of miserable objects who daily present themselves to us and whose various diseases were all other motives silent would be as so many tongues which at once speak their own anguish and excite our pity as the characteristick of the english is to be humane and beneficent so nothing shows it more than institutions of a public nature such as hospitals and infirmaries which are here better regulated and supplied with necessaries than in any other country whatsoever some there are of royal endowment and established revenue and others of more modern institution erected and supported by the generous and voluntary contributions of good and welldisposed persons but all these are by experience known to be no ways adequate to the numbers that seek assistance from them for as they can take in no more patients than they have beds or give medicine to more than what their income will allow many poor unhappy creatures must be unavoidably lost for it is a truth well known that though the city of london is more populous and by its trade and navigation the laboring part thereof are more subject to accidents and diseases than the common people of paris yet it appears from the annual printed accounts that the hotel dieu alone contains more patients at one time than all our hospitals and infirmaries together if such provision is made for the diseased inhabitants of paris those of london more immediately require our regard particularly the british manufacturers and seamen as they are the chief support of both our foreign and domestic trade  the strength and security of great britain depending chiefly on its naval power the wisdom of the legislature has showed a peculiar concern for the comfort and happiness of such infirm and disabled seamen as have been engaged in the service of the royal navy but for seamen employed only in the service of the merchant and trading part of the kingdom or the wives and families of such in distress by sickness no desirable public provision has yet been made or particularly instituted for their relief nor are our numerous poor industrious manufacturers and artificers or their wives and children by any particular donations or establishment sufficiently provided for under the calamity of bodily diseases and casualties though in such afflicting and melancholy circumstances they are incapable of providing for themselves or families by their usual labor and industry  these considerations have induced many benevolent and public spirited noblemen gentlemen merchants and others to turn their thoughts upon raising by public subscription a londoninfirmary where british sailors in the merchants service their wives and children and poor british manufacturers their wives and children are daily admitted and find relief in distress by sickness or casualties and this without any difficulty or expense of admittance  in order to answer the ends proposed situation a large house was taken in prescotstreet goodmansfields which situation was judged the most convenient as being near the usual abodes of manufacturers and seafaring men in the merchants service and at a considerable distance from any hospital  the house is spacious and convenient regulation of the house contains about forty beds properly and airily disposed is furnished with linen and all necessary conveniences the matron a sober and discreet woman has the charge of the house and furniture the direction of the nurses and other servants and sees the diet and medicines administered according to order under her are nurses and watchers in proportion to the number of patients of experienced honesty and tenderness who are guided by written orders to prevent misconduct of any kind proper diet for the patients has been settled by the gentlemen of the faculty engaged in this charity and is fixed up in the wards for the satisfaction of the patients and their friends  a physician and surgeon of reputation are appointed and attend daily physicians and surgeons from eleven to one without any fee or reward and give their advice to all such poor diseased objects as think proper to come in those hours whether recommended or not and other physicians and surgeons of character attend and advise in all dangerous or extraordinary cases  the dispensary is furnished with drugs dispensary which being first viewed and reported good by a committee for that purpose are bought at the best hand and compounded at the infirmary where an apothecary resides who constantly and solely attends the business thereof  no officers or servants are permitted upon pain of expulsion to take of any tradesmen patients or other persons any fee reward or gratification of any kind directly or indirectly for any service done or to be done on account of this infirmary  and as the governors of this charity are desirous that the utmost regard may be had to the souls of the patients chaplain as well as their bodies a clergyman of the church of england has generously undertaken without any gratuity to read prayers and perform the other duties of his function at the infirmary  every subscriber of five guineas yearly is a governor of this charity qualification of a governor and is entitled to send in as many patients as there are vacancies of beds but if they cannot be received as inpatients they are relieved as outpatients every gentleman giving a benefaction of thirty guineas at once will be a governor for life  all subscriptions are during pleasure and smaller sums from welldisposed persons will be thankfully received and acknowledged  four governors in rotation every month business of governors with any others that are pleased attend weekly in order to receive and dismiss patients supervise the proceeding of the house and do such business as is usually done by committees at other hospitals and report the same at the next quarterly or general meeting there is a general meeting of the governors every quarter before whom a report is made from the weekly committees all bylaws are then confirmed all vacancies filled up and accounts audited also an annual general meeting of all subscribers to revise and confirm the general account of proceedings which will immediately after be published for the satisfaction of the public  the accounts are kept in a regular mercantile manner and the names of the patients their employment place of abode disorder the issue of the case and the name of the subscriber who sent them are inserted in several columns in a book for that purpose and are always ready for the inspection of subscribers as also the statutes and bylaws for the particular regulation of this infirmary  all poor sick and lame proper objects who are recommended or appear to the committee to be truly necessitous are received from the hours of eleven to one who are supplied with advice medicine diet washing lodging and every comfortable assistance during their cure no persons with incurable or infectious distempers or of known ability to pay for their cures are admitted to partake of this charity but all accidents are received at any hour of the day or night  this is the plan of our proceedings and though this work is but in its infancy yet such has been the extraordinary encouragement given to it by numbers of distinguished humanity that we have the satisfaction to assure the public that since the  d of november    0 it has pleased god to bless us with such success that upwards of  000 distressed objects have been relieved at the london infirmary and from laboring under the oppression of some of the most malignant diseases and unhappy accidents have been reinstated in their honest and industrious capacities of working whereby the public again enjoy the benefit of their labor they and their poor families preserved from perishing and prevented from being a constant encumbrance to the community  the subscribers are desired to take notice that if any patients shall not conform to the rules of the house or are guilty of any misbehaviour they will be discharged for such irregularity and never more relieved by this charity  there was a proposal in the daily advertiser of the   th of may      for erecting an hospital infirmary surgery chapel and school for relieving of poor aged and otherwise disabled seamen in the merchants service their wives and children by a subscription to be set on foot amongst the merchants owners masters and officers of ships and common seamen who were to pay certain quarterly sums according to their several ranks which with the contributions of worthy people might have been sufficient for the desired end as the london infirmary already begun is calculated to relieve all those who are disabled by sickness or accidents and their wives and children and answers that proposal in part and may be the foundation of the whole we hope those who had so charitably joined in supporting that subscription will as readily interest themselves in this which if it pleases god to continue his favor and prosper the undertaking may in time by such encouragement be extended to the whole benefit proposed by that advertisement  such persons therefore as are inclined to encourage and promote so laudable a work are desired to send their subscriptions or benefactions to mr thomas minors banker in lombard street who will give proper receipts for the same and any person inclined by his last will to bequeath a legacy to this charity is desired to direct it to be paid to the treasurer for the time being of the london infirmary in goodmans fields and that his receipt shall be a good discharge for the same
