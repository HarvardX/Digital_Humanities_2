translated from the danish history of saxogrammaticus     observations on the use shakespeare has made of the foregoing story in his tragedy of hamlet     shakespeare illustrated the history of dorastus and fawnia before christianity appeared in the world there reigned in bohemia a king named pandosto who was married to a princess of exquisite beauty and consummate virtue called bellaria the harmony that subsisted between this royal couple gave the greatest satisfaction to all their subjects whose happiness was greatly increased by the felicity of their sovereigns  at the end of the first year of their marriage bellaria was delivered of a son who was named garrinter the bohemians upon this occasion made great rejoicings over all the kingdom and the king as well to express his own satisfaction at this happy incident as to comply with the desires of the people appointed justs and tournaments in honor of the young prince to which not only many foreign noblemen resorted but also several neighboring kings and princes came to exercise their valor and judgment at these martial entertainments  the sports lasted twenty days during which time the king made a general feast for all his subjects and the kings and princes who had been royally entertained returned home to their respective countries full of admiration of the great magnificence of pandosto  the smiles of fortune are seldom sincere or lasting the fickle goddess weary of bestowing favors upon pandosto while he was wholly taken up in the enjoyment of them prepared a sad reverse of fate for him and the lovely bellaria pandosto from his earliest youth had contracted and maintained a strict friendship and correspondence with egistus the young king of sicily  this prince being desirous of showing that neither time nor distance of place could weaken the force of his affection for pandosto resolved to visit him in his own dominions to congratulate him upon his marriage and the birth of a son for this purpose he ordered a small fleet to be prepared and with a small but select number of attendants arrived in bohemia  pandosto and his queen with a numerous retinue went to meet egistus at his landing and carried him to the palace in the midst of most expensive shows and magnificent arches which had been prepared and erected for his reception  pandosto whose heart overflowed with grateful transport for this demonstration of friendship in egistus entreated his queen to show all imaginable respect and esteem to a prince whom he loved so much and to whom he was so highly obliged  the sweet bellaria who had no other will but that of her husband was easily prevailed upon to comply with a request to which her own inclinations naturally incited her for the noble qualities she observed in egistus had already produced suitable effects in a mind that being virtuous and sensible to the highest degree itself could not choose but love those perfections in another  bellaria therefore as well in obedience to her husbands commands as in consequence of the friendship she had conceived for egistus gave him every day a thousand innocent marks of her esteem which that prince who admired and loved her perfections with all the warmth of a disinterested friend did not fail to return with every instance of gratitude and respect  this mutual esteem gave rise to an easy confidence and familiar intercourse between them so that pandosto being often engaged with his ministers in affairs of state bellaria and egistus passed away the time in his absence in various discourses and innocent amusements all which at first was very pleasing to pandosto  but that unhappy prince either because he was conscious of the superior merit of egistus or through the natural bent of his disposition began to look with suspicious eyes on a friendship and familiarity which he had been so solicitous to form doubtful and uneasy thoughts arose in his mind he reflected on the irressistable charms of bellaria and the manly beauty and noble qualities of egistus and thought it impossible that two persons so formed to please should be insensible to each others merit  these doubts having entered his mind he fed his growing jealousy with continual observations on the looks and words of his friend and wife and prejudiced as he now was their innocent familiarity appeared to him to be a convincing proof of their guilty passion suspicion was now changed to absolute certainty he no longer looked upon egistus as his friend and guest but as the destroyer of his honor and the violater of his queen  a violent hatred succeeded the tender affection he once bore to egistus and those smiles of love with which he had always been accustomed to behold the charming bellaria gave place to sullen reserve and gloomy frowns racked with the tormenting remembrance of his fancied wrongs the desire and hope of revenge afforded him some intervals of ease  he resolved therefore to poison egistus and while his mind was laboring how to execute his cruel purpose with security his words and behavior still wore an appearance of friendship and respect  pandosto had a cup bearer named franion whom because he had always shown an inviolable attachment to his person he believed it would be easy to persuade to execute his purposed vengeance on the king of sicily  to this man therefore the jealous monarch communicated his ungenerous design and promised him a large reward if when the next time that egistus called for drink at his table he would put poison in his cup  franion shuddered with horror at this inhuman proposition and with all the freedom of a good man and a faithful subject he endeavored to dissuade his king from his barbarous purpose he represented to him that murder was an unpardonable offense to the gods and abhorred by all mankind that such unnatural crimes not only drew down the wrath of heaven upon the perpetrators of them but the revenge of men he urged to him the sacred laws of hospitality that egistus was his guest his friend and ally that any cruelty committed upon his person would brand his name with perpetual infamy and sow the lasting seeds of discord and hatred between the sicilians and bohemians and that even his own subjects would murmur at such an unexampled piece of cruelty and treachery  these arguments had no force with the determined pandosto who persisting still in his cruel resolution gave franion his choice either to poison egistus and be rewarded with riches and honors or to suffer death for his disobedience  franion staggered by these dreadful threatenings on one hand and allured by those great promises on the other told pandosto that he would obey him and as soon as a fair opportunity offered he would poison egistus  the king was very well pleased with this promise and resolved as soon as his designed vengeance on egistus was executed to sacrifice bellaria in the same manner to his abused love and injured honor  when the king was departed franion having no longer that dreadful object before his eyes threatening death and torments if he did not murder the innocent prince began to reflect seriously upon the horrid deed he had engaged to perform murder he thought however secretly and securely committed might for a time avoid danger but never wholly escape punishment that no balm no lenitive could heal the stings of a wounded conscience and the guilt of innocent blood would always be accompanied with remorse and horror  he reflected that though he was a subject his king had no right to his obedience when his commands were contrary to the express will and pleasure of the gods to whom he owed a higher duty  he considered that the peaceful calm of a contented mind in an humble condition was preferable to the restless turbulence of dignity and riches when purchased with crimes and stained with blood and that honest poverty was infinitely better than shameful grandeur  seeing therefore that he must either die with a clear mind or live with a foul and spotted conscience his soul was so perplexed between these two extremes that he could take no rest at last he determined to discover the affair to egistus and for that purpose he went to his apartments and desiring a private audience of the king of sicily he was admitted to his presence and in a few words laid open the whole conspiracy against him  the brave and generous are not easily induced to believe those they love are capable of baseness and ingratitude egistus judging of pandostos heart by the rectitude of hs own told franion with a severe countenance that he would not entertain a thought to the prejudice of the king of bohemias honor  pandosto continued he is my friend and ally no suspicion has ever yet interrupted our mutual affection i did not come here to invade his territories to seduce his subjects from their allegiance or to conspire with his enemies since therefore i have given him no cause to seek my death i cannot believe him guilty of so unjust and treacherous a design but rather suspect the information you have given me to be the effect of a combination among the bohemians to create a variance between me and their king  franion replied that it was dangerous to dally with the rage of an incensed and secret enemy that if the bohemians had intended any harm to him they might easily accomplish it without revealing their conspiracy that it was unkind therefore in his majesty to misconstrue his zeal for his preservation into a treacherous design for that his intention was to prevent treason not to become a traitor  he urged him then to fly with speed into sicily if he hoped to escape the danger which threatened him and begged his majesty would permit him to go along with him when if he did not fully prove that pandosto had designed to poison him he desired that his imagined treachery might be punished with the most cruel torments  egistus weighing the matter thoroughly in his mind gave many thanks to franion and promising if he arrived safe in sicily to reward him royally he desired him to contrive the method of their escape  franion went immediately to consult with the admiral of egistuss fleet and it was agreed between them that it should be put in readiness to sail as soon as a fair wind and opportunity offered  in the mean time franion amused pandosto with hopes of soon having his so much desired revenge accomplished telling him that he was employed in preparing and compounding so subtle a poison that the moment it was swallowed would procure immediate death  pandosto received this news with a malignant joy every hour seeming an age to his impatient fury till his revenge was satiated with the death of those who had offended him  egistus being informed that a favorable gale had sprung up conveyed himself and his sicilians by the assistance of franion out of a postern gate of the city with such secresy and expedition that they got on board their ships without the least suspicion and spreading all their sails to the wind soon lost sight of bohemia  as soon as pandosto was informed that egistus had fled away in the night and that franion was gone with him he let loose all his rage upon his queen whom he accused of conspiring with egistus and the traitor franion and commanded she should be led to prison  the bohemians were all alarmed and suspected some treason and the furious pandosto believing the queen not only guilty of dishonouring his bed but of projecting the flight of egistus sent his guards with orders to seize her  the innocent bellaria not expecting the impending storm was playing with her little son garrinter when the guards with much reluctance came to execute the kings demands  the queen was at first astonished and turned pale but recollecting herself and assuming all the noble pride of conscious innocence and affronted virtue she gave her hand to the captain of the guard and without murmuring suffered him to lead her to her prison where she spent the time in patient sorrow and absolute resignation  pandosto mad with the disappointment of his revenge upon egistus resolved it should fall doubly heavy on the head of the injured bellaria he therefore caused it to be proclaimed throughout all his dominions that the queen had committed adultery with egistus and with his cup bearer franion had conspired his death  though the queens life had hitherto appeared blameless yet this confident proclamation and the flight of the king of sicily and franion raised many suspicions against her in the minds of the people who notwithstanding daily offered up prayers for her deliverance  her youth her beauty the sweetness of her manners but above all her misfortunes excited every ones compassion  but the cruel pandosto in whose rocky bosom pity could find no access resolved to load the unfortunate bellaria with every kind of infamy and hardship he would not allow her to be treated in the prison with the respect due to the rank she once held but caused her to be served and attended with the most cruel neglect  the cruelties he exercised on the queen did but in part satisfy his revenge he longed to make egistus feel the weight of his fury but this monarch was so powerful by his allies having married the emperor of russias daughter that he despaired of ever being able by open force to accomplish his revenge  the unhappy queen being informed of the vile accusation against her so openly proclaimed conscious of her own spotless innocence and the integrity of egistus earnestly entreated that she might be brought to a public trial confronted with her accuser and allowed to answer for herself  but the king was so inflamed with rage and jealousy that he would not receive her petition and while the poor queen was thus languishing under the weight of her calamities and hopeless of redress she perceived herself to be quick with child  so affecting an incident in her melancholy condition drew complaints from her which softening the rugged temper of her keeper he caused the king to be immediately informed of it not doubting but the news would induce him to set her at liberty  the queens pregnancy however produced quite a contrary effect for the king no sooner heard of it than starting up in a violent fury he swore bellaria and her bastard should die even though the gods themselves should say no  the queen notwithstanding so many cruel afflictions was happily delivered of a daughter and pandosto immediately declared his resolution to have both the mother and child burnt  the noblemen of his court used all the arguments their reason and humanity could furnish them with to prevail upon him to change his barbarous purpose but all they could do was to prevent the murder of the child  the queens doom he told them was irrevocably fixed but though at the earnest solicitations of his nobles he promised the child should not be put to death yet the resolution he took concerning it was little less cruel since by it he only meant to protract its fate  he sent a person to the prison with orders to take the infant from its wretched mother and putting it into a boat and launching it into the sea leave it to the mercy of the wind and waves  the guards who assisted at this barbarous deed moved by the sweet countenance of the innocent babe could not help accusing the king of great cruelty nevertheless fear of his resentment obliged them to execute his commands  they put the child into a boat covering it with boughs to preserve it from the inclemency of the weather and set it into the ocean when immediately so great a storm arose that it was with much difficulty they got to shore again  this horrid deed accomplished the king assembled his nobles and counselors and bellaria was brought into court where she heard the charge against her read  the queen who saw nothing but her death would satisfy the incensed king confiding in her own innocence assumed all the courage her unhappy condition required and with a noble haughtiness demanded to have law and justice for mercy said she i do not expect let my accusers therefore appear in court and give their evidences before my face  pandosto replied that the witnesses were of such credit that their words alone were sufficient that for her indeed it was her part to deny such a monstrous crime and forswear herself seeing that she had overcome all sense of shame and remorse in committing it nevertheless added he you shall die and die a most cruel and ignominious death  the queen not terrified by these threats replied without any emotion that to proceed to punishment without proof was rigor not law  the nobles approved of what she said and required that her accusers should be sworn and openly examined and if the queens guilt was fully proved his majesty might condemn her to suffer the punishment ordained by the law for such offenses  the king answered that in this case he could and would dispense with the law and that the nobles should take his word for sufficient evidence otherwise he would make the proudest of them repent it  this threat struck them all dumb but bellaria who despaired of life and dreaded infamy more than death said if his will must be the law the jurys verdict will be useless then falling on her knees she conjured the king by the love he bore to the young prince garrinter his son that he would grant her one request which was to send six of his nobles in whom he placed the greatest confidence to the island of delphos and there consult the oracle of apollo concerning the crimes she was accused of  pandosto could not refuse so reasonable a request and having named six ambassadors to be dispatched with all speed to delphos he committed the queen to close imprisonment till their return  the ambassadors performed their voyage in three weeks and as soon as they landed at delphos they went to the temple of apollo and with great devotion offered sacrifices to the god and gifts to his priests according to custom and then humbly besought an answer to their demands  they had not kneeled long at the altar when apollo with a loud vice said bohemians what you find behind the altar take and depart they obeyed the oracle and found a scroll of parchment which the priest commanded them not to open but in the presence of the king  the ambassadors assured him of their exact obedience to his injunctions and their devotions being finished they left the temple and sailed with a fair wind for bohemia where they soon arrived and hastened to court  pandosto received them very graciously and they after giving him an account of their voyage presented the divine scroll to him entreating him at the same time since the queens life or death her innocence or guilt was contained in that sacred writing that he would summon the nobility to meet in the judgment hall and before them and the accused queen cause the oracle to be read  the king approved of their advice and on the day appointed the king and the nobles being all assembled in the court the queen was brought to the bar and thus spoke  how i have led my life before egistus came into bohemia i appeal pandosto to thy conscience and to the immortal gods they only know whether i am guilty of the crimes whereof i am accused for me i here protest my innocence and for the truth of what i say i refer myself to the divine oracle  here bellaria being silent the king commanded one of his nobles to open the scroll which he did and read aloud the following words which were written in letters of gold  the oracle suspicion is no proof jealousy is a partial judge bellaria is chaste egistus blameless franion a true subject pandosto treacherous his babe innocent and the king shall die without an heir if that which is lost be not found  after the oracle was read the court resounded with joyful acclamations the queens innocence thus manifested filled every heart with transport  the king beginning now to be ashamed of his rash jealousy and unjust suspicions not daring to approach the wronged bellaria desired his nobles to implore her to forgive the injuries he had offered her and stung with remorse and horror at his past actions he publicly confessed his design against the life of egistus  while he was thus laying open his own treachery a messenger came hastily into the court and informed the king that the prince garrinter was dead  bellaria whose soul had been overwhelmed with joy by the divine oracle which had declared her innocence was seized with such an excess of sorrow at these dreadful tidings that her tender heart not able to support the force of these contrary extremes burst with the mighty weight and sinking down she expired in a moment  the king became senseless at this dreadful sight and being carried to the palace notwithstanding all the endeavors of the physicians he lay speechless three days  the bohemians were in the utmost despair nothing but mourning and complaints were to be seen and heard the death of the queen and prince and the extreme danger the king was in filled the whole city with grief and consternation at length he recovered his senses and his speech and this news in some measure revived the drooping bohemians  but the kings despair was so violent that he attempted to murder himself and was with difficulty prevented by his nobles who used all the arguments they could think of to calm his mind and persuade him to bear his misfortunes patiently  their dutiful cares at last succeeded the king grew more patient and resigned and gave orders for the interment of his queen and son which was performed in the most solemn and splendid manner  once in every day he went to bellarias tomb and with tears of penitence and sorrow lamented her unhappy fate and his own misfortunes  here we must leave this distressed prince for a while to relate what befell the royal infant whom we left floating on the ocean  the boat in which it was laid being tossed for two days with the wind and sea and every moment ready to perish in the waves it pleased the gods to direct it at last to the coast of sicily where it was drove on shore  it fortunately happened that a shepherd who had missed one of his sheep not finding it in any of the covers hard by came to the seaside in hopes it was there browsing on the seaivy and hearing the voice of a child which he at first mistook for the bleating of a sheep went to the sands and saw a boat driven on ground he immediately waded toward it and discovered a most beautiful babe lying at the bottom wrapped in a scarlet mantle embroidered with gold and a chain of rich jewels about its neck  the shepherd astonished at this adventure beholding the beauty of the infant and the riches that were about it began to think it was some little divinity and was going to adore it when the weak cries of the child who seemed to be just perishing with cold and hunger persuaded him it was a mere mortal  compassion took the place of reverence he approached the child took it into his arms and supposing by the extraordinary magnificence of its dress that it was of noble birth he resolved to carry it to the king  as he was wrapping the mantle close about it to preserve it better from the cold a bag of money fell from it at his feet which he taking up was so captivated with the sight that changing his design he determined to breed up the infant himself and apply the money to his own use then returned a bye way to his cottage lest any one should perceive what he carried in his arms  as soon as he entered the door the child began to cry which alarming his wife who supposed he was bringing home a bastard to nurse she rated him very severely for his infidelity  the shepherd begged her to be pacified and told her if she would be secret and cautious their fortunes were made for ever then putting the child in her arms he produced the gold and jewels he found with it which so pleased the poor woman that she resolved to nurse the child carefully and make their neighbors believe it was their own  the gold and jewels they concealed and the shepherd returned to the care of his flocks while his wife employed herself in nursing the foundling to whom they gave the name of fawnia  in a few years after the shepherd purchased a good farm and from tending the flocks of other people became master of a considerable one himself  when fawnia arrived at the age of ten years porrus and mopsa for so her supposed father and mother were called committed the care of their flocks to her and the young shepherdess whose beauty at those early years was the astonishment and admiration of all that beheld her applied herself with the utmost diligence to her pastoral employment so that every thing prospered under her hands  porrus now purchased land which he designed to leave fawnia at his death and she growing to fifteen years old many of the rich farmers sons made their addresses to her  the fair shepherdess was not the only admiration and wonder of the country her wit and judgment was equal to her beauty and those uncommon charms of mind and person made her even be talked of at court  she who believed herself to be the daughter of porrus was not elated with the praises that were bestowed on her but with a sweet humility conformed to the lowliness of her condition and tended her flocks with the utmost diligence and care  though she was not vain of the graces of her person yet her rural habit was always exactly neat her lovely hair was bound up with a graceful negligence and she took care to choose the freshest and most becoming flowers to compose the garland which shaded her charming face from the sun  the king of sicily had only one son named dorastus a beautiful and accomplished youth of whom the sicilians had great hopes  the king desirous of seeing him married before he died sent an ambassador to the king of denmark to demand the princess euphania his daughter and the heir to his dominions in marriage for the prince of sicily  the king of denmark agreeing to the proposal egistus acquainted his son with the treaty he had entered into he enlarged on the beauty and virtues of the princess euphania on the advantages of an alliance with the king of denmark and concluded with praising the gods for the happy success of his negotiation  dorastus heard all this with such apparent indifference that the king was amazed and asked him if he had any objection to the match  the prince answered coldly that his heart was yet a stranger to love that all women were indifferent to him and that marriage was an engagement he had no inclination to enter into  the king extremely offended with this reply threatened him with the severest effects of his displeasure if he did not endeavor to conform to his will and finding the prince continued in a sullen silence and would give him no satisfaction he quitted him in great displeasure  dorastus was sensibly afflicted at his fathers anger and ardently wished he could conquer that repugnance he felt in his soul to marriage that he might not offend him by an absolute refusal but the more he struggled to overcome that dislike which forced him to seem disobedient to his father the deeper he found it rooted in his breast  a short time after this discourse had passed between the king and the prince there happened to be a meeting of all the shepherds daughters in sicily  fawnia was chosen queen for the day and dressed in her best clothes presided over their rural sports the day being past in such innocent diversions as shepherdesses when evening approached they separated and fawnia desiring a neighboring sheperdess to go with her to see if her flock was folded dorastus who was returning from hawking met the two virgins as they were going home and struck with admiration at the beauty of fawnia he stopped and asked her several trifling questions in order to have an opportunity of gazing on her  fawnia aswered him with so much sprightly wit and so graceful an air that the prince already half vanquished by the charms of her person was wholly subdued by those of her mind love offended at the former obstinacy of this young rebel resolved now to make him feel the utmost effects of his power and with the keenest arrow in his quiver pierced that once insensible heart  the prince sighed with pain and pleasure he could not remove his eyes from the lovely face of fawnia which was all overspread with a rosy blush he saw her confusion and ashamed of his own weakness he resolved to force himself away and clapping spurs to his horse he hastily bid the shepherdesses farewell and rode home to the palace  fawnia who had surveyed the prince with a curious eye began as soon as he was gone o praise him to her companion she admired his youth his beauty his sweet affability the pleasing theme transported her beyond her usual moderation her thoughts were full of the princes perfections she could not find words sufficient to express her admiration she perceived at length and blushed at her indiscretion and remained silent and composed during the rest of their walk  she took leave of her companion at the door of her cottage and retired to bed full of a pleasing anxiety for which her inexperienced innocence could not yet find a name  the prince whose mind was still more restless and uneasy than fawnias because he better understood the nature of his distemper passed the night in various and tormenting thoughts fain would he have banished the sweet image of fawnia from his remembrance but love had engraved it too deeply in his heart and finding his endeavors to forget her fruitless he sought to excuse and justify his passion by reflecting on the inevitable charms of her that caused it  oh cruel oh injurious fortune cried he transported with the bright idea to hide such perfection in a cottage and lavish crowns and scepters often on deformity  oh fawnia was that enchanting form made only to grace the fields were these bright eyes ordained to shine in humble vales and only bless rude swains with their love darting beams was that sprightly wit and those native graces of thy mind given thee to be for ever clouded in a cottage  ah no it cannot be the gods are just and equal in their dispensations and though they did not make you born a princess they did more and made you deserving to be one i am their instrument to raise you to the rank for which nature designed you and which no other can so worthily fill  the amorous prince paused at these words then suddenly giving way to new reflections how would it please my father cried he to know that my heart is capable of love oh divine law feared by all men because honored by the gods themselves  but alas dorastus added he breathing a deep and dreadful sigh who is it that is the object of thy passion a rural maid the daughter of a simple shepherd does this match suit with the dignity of thy birth thou who art the son of a king and heir to a powerful kingdom ah let me rather die than poorly submit to such a shameful weakness for it is better to perish nobly than to live with contempt  the wavering prince resting a while upon this thought endeavored to collect his whole force of reason to support a resolution which seemed worthy of himself but love who laughed at all his vain attempts to elude his power again impressed the lovely image of fawnia upon his fancy  oh beauty said the sighing prince how absolute is thy empire over the heart sweet and imperious tyrant thou shall be obeyed i yield to thy irresistible force yes fawnia lovely and adorable fawnia thou shall be mine thy humble birth shall be no obstacle to my desires  the gods themselves have not disdained to love jupiter was enamoured of danae and the bright apollo woed the inexorable daphne these were mortal beauties and they were deities why then though a prince may not i love a shepherdess but their passions were dishonorable mine is pure and chaste it is true and herein i surpass the gods be still then oh my soul for it is decreed fawnia the adorable fawnia shall be mine  the prince having thus taken his resolution his mind grew easy and composed but it was far otherwise with the charming shepherdess strange and unusual dreams perplexed her roving fancy the whole night  that homely couch which before had only supplied calm and unrufled slumbers and cheerful dreams of pleasant labor and innocent amusements past now gave birth to anxious wishes delusive hopes and uneasy repinings  she awaked but not as usual refreshed with her repose her renewed spirits sparkling in her cheerful eyes and eager to begin the rural labors of the day but heavy languishing and full of uneasy perturbations she rose before her wonted hour and thinking to banish the various thoughts which tormented her by industrious toils she drove her flocks to the field shifted the folds and doubled her mornings work at last fatigued and breathless she sat down at the foot of a tree and thus began to accuse the folly and presumption of her new passion  unfortunate fawnia said she softly sighing thy shepherdesss hook expresses thy mean condition and thy desires show thy aspiring mind ah simple maid thoughts above fortune bring contempt it is for the eagle only to gaze on the sun art thou not a poor shepherdess the daughter of a country swain be content then to stand securely in the vale and do not by endeavoring to climb the hills hazard the danger of a fall but oh love is a powerful lord and will be obeyed i love dorastus ah the more wretched i the less cause i have to hope will eagles catch at flies or cedars stoop to brambles dorastus is a prince and knows what his station requires of him i am the poor daughter of a shepherd and forget my humble condition  cease then to love unhappy fawnia or if thou can not do that conceal at least thy wrong placed passion for it is better to die with grief than live with shame but oh gods why did you give me a soul capable of the most exalted passion and yet place me in a condition which makes that passion presumption  the lovely shepherdess having thus given vent to her uneasy thoughts rose up and began to walk round her flock gathering up he straggling sheep to prevent them from gong among the corn and while she was thus employed endeavored to conquer her too much raised desires by contemplating her mean estate and the apparent impossibility of ever accomplishing her wishes  mean time dorastus consumed away with impatient desire his former pleasures now grew tasteless to his sense company was tedious music only soothed his sweet disorder and added fuel to his fires  weary at length of the intolerable restraint his pride had forced him to lay upon his wishes he resolved to satisfy his longing eyes with another sight of the sweet but dangerous fawnia  for this purpose he stole secretly out of the palace and without any attendants took his way to the fields where he had first seen the beauteous shepherdess fawnia  there he walked some time without meeting with the object his passionate eyes were every where in search of enraged at his disappointment a thousand times he cursed both love and fortune and just as he was resigning himself to the most bitter despair for his ill success in this first attempt a casual glance discovered fawnia to him sitting on the side of a hill selecting the most beautiful flowers out of a large heap which in sweet confusion were scattered about her to make a fresh garland for her head  the passionate prince stood at a little distance for some moments contemplating her with an excess of wonder and delight when fawnia happening to look up she met his ardent gaze and this sudden and unexpected sight gave her so much emotion that her fair face was in an instant dyed with a rosy blush  she rose however from her seat and curtsied to the prince but with such native elegance and grace that dorastus who could not conceive how a country maid bred up in the fields and woods could have so much politeness in her manner was lost in astonishment and admiration  fair virgin said he approaching her either your poverty is great or the life of a shepherdess is very sweet that you can take such delight in rural labors is it because you are so like a nymph that you resolve to imitate the nymphs and waste your days in woods and lawns tell me sweet maid what pleasures are there in a country life to balance ts fatigue  sir said fawnia with an enchanting bashfulness to be contented is to be rich that condition is most to be coveted in which here is most tranquillity as we shepherdesses are not born to honor and little beholden o beauty so fame or fortune is beneath our care we are not solicitous for any thing ut the necessaries of life we think our raiment fine if it preserves us sufficiently from the cold and our food dainty if it suffices appetite our greatest enemy is the wolf and our chief care is to keep our flocks in security we spend the day in rural songs and delight more in talking of pan and country sports than venus and her trifling toys our toil is to shift our folds but the attending our flocks is only an agreeable amusement our wealth consists in not desiring more than we possess our honor in not aiming to be higher than we are envy looks not so low as a shepherd shepherds do not raise their thoughts to ambition we are rich because we are content with our poverty and proud only in knowing we have no cause to be proud  dorastus was charmed with this sprightly answer oh thought he if this fair creatures birth was equal to her wit and beauty she would be a wife for the greatest prince in the world  i perceive fawnia said the prince addressing himself to her again that it is owing to your not being acquainted with the enjoyments of a court that you are so contented with a country life i commend your wit and prudence but i pity your poverty and low condition will you forsake your fathers cottage and attend on a lady a court  it is dangerous sir answered fawnia to tempt fortune she is a fickle goddess and often raises poor mortals only to throw them down again i was born to toil for the court and not live in it and am entirely satisfied with my present condition  ah fawnia said dorastus with a sigh he could not suppress i guess the cause of your fondness for a rural life you love a country shepherd  sir replied fawnia smiling pardon me if i tell you you have not guessed right shepherds alas they cannot love they are so simple and maids must not if they are no older than i am  in my opinion pretty one said the prince maids ought to love because they are young cupid is a child and the goddess of love is painted young  age may indeed be painted with false colors said fawnia and youth may have actions too forward but what art too little conceals in one ignorance reveals in the other  dorastus who thought this conversation the most pleasing of any he ever had would have perhaps drawn it out to a considerable length but perceiving some of his attendants approaching he was willing to know a little more of her heart before he parted from her  perhaps fawnia said he taking her hand i love thee if so you must needs yield me your heart for i am a prince you know and may command you  i acknowledge your power sir said fawnia in all just and reasonable things but with submission i must say my heart is only at my own disposal constrained love is force and force you have no right to use over me and believe me it is not a vain beast i make when i tell you that poor as i am i set so great a value upon my chastity that i would rather die than be the mistress of the greatest king upon earth and my birth is so mean and grovelling that i am not fit to be a farmers wife  the lovely shepherdess ended these words with a sigh which escaped her unawares  the prince after a little pause replied it seems then fawnia that you cannot love dorastus  yes said fawnia precipitately when dorastus becomes a shepherd  the princes attendants being now come near he hastily went to meet them leaving fawnia alone and pensive her imagination filled with a thousand new ideas  she seated herself again at the foot of the hill revolving in her mind all the prince had said to her and this second view of him together with the affability of his behavior and some flattering hopes she began to entertain entirely completed the conquest of her heart  for some moments she resigned herself up to the most soothing reflections but when the lowness of her condition rushed upon her thoughts and broke the sweet delusion she was so fond of then she began to blame the extravagance of her wishes and tried to recollect her scattered reason  ah fawnia whispered she why do thou gaze at the sun and grasp at wind stars are to be beheld at a distance not aimed to be touched with the hand hopes are to be measured by fortune not impelled by desire and falls come by climbing high not by sitting low but what then added she after a little pause must all fall who endeavor to rise because some do no happiness comes by chance and fortune winds those threads which the destinies spin alas what strange perplexity am i in favored by a prince yet obliged through prudence to reject that favor denial in my words and desire at the bottom of my heart i love dorastus yet i seem displeased with his courtship ah it is our sexs fault to fly from those we eagerly wish to meet but take heed fawnia said she sighing for if the prince is repulsed by thy shyness thou will severely repent for unless he loves thou must die ah die then simple maid for dorastus only jests with thee dorastus cannot stoop to love a shepherdess sit down then in thy sorrow and pine in secret ah me how am i changed i was wont to pass away my days in cheerful songs now i waste them in sighs and complaints  while fawnia was thus giving vent to the tender anxieties of her soul the approach of night put her in mind that it was time to put her sheep in the fold which having done with a heavy heart she hastened to her poor cottage  while love made this havoc in the innocent breast of fawnia he raged with such violence in the heart of the passionate prince in which the pride of royal birth maintained an unequal conflict that sinking under the force of those contrary passions he became a prey to melancholy and despair he loathed his food sleep fled from his eyes he grew pale and wan and fell into a languishing disease  the king amazed at the alteration in his son and trembling for his life ordered the attendance of the ablest physicians in his kingdom but their art was all in vain  the prince himself grew apprehensive of the danger he was in he found he could not live without fawnia and thought it great folly to die for what it was in his power to obtain honor long opposed the gratification of his desires but love resistless love at length prevailed  the prince wholly abandoning himself to the power of this sweet tyrant procured a shepherds habit and a crook and making them to be conveyed to a secret place he went privately out of the palace and attiring himself in those rural weeds took his way to the place where his charming shepherdess fed her flocks  as he went along some uneasy reflections arose in his mind when he surveyed his homely dress  ah dorastus said he to himself what a strange alteration is here a prince transformed to a peasant does this wild folly suit with the dignity of thy birth but indeed thy habit suits well with thy grovelling thoughts this is thy proper dress thou were always disguised before oh gods for what crime am i assigned this penance oh love what a fond idiot have thou made of me  yet why should i blush at this disguise have not the heavenly deities descended to earth and changed their glorious forms for love love made jupiter a bull neptune a ram and apollo like myself a shepherd if they who were gods submitted to that allcompelling power shall i who am a mortal dare to rebel against it  while the prince was thus justifying the strange effects of his passion by those great examples he spied fawnia at a distance running after one of her sheep which had strayed from the rest the sight of that lovely face suppressed in a moment all other emotions but those of love and joy  he flew toward her and she who did not know him in that disguise but thought it was some genteel young shepherd coming to meet her secretly wished it had been her lot to have placed her affections upon such a one whom with reason she might have loved and hoped to have obtained  the princes nearer approach convinced her of her mistake she sighed and blushed with pleasure and surprise and stopping curtsied to him with her usual gracefulness  dorastus taking her hand pressed it with passionate tenderness to his heart and then fixing an ardent kiss upon it begged her to sit down and listen to him a few moments  the lovely shepherdess trembling with the mixed emotions which love hope and fear excited in her soul sat down with him under the shade of a spreading oak and the prince after gazing on her for some time with a fixed attention thus spoke  you wonder fawnia no doubt at my strange apparel but if you knew my thoughts you would wonder more the one indeed disgraces my outward shape but the others disturb my mind  i love you fawnia for how can i do otherways formed as you are to inspire all who see you with that passion you promised to love me when i became a shepherd behold your prince transformed to a country swain now then i claim the performance of your promise since i have fulfilled your desire  it is true my lord said fawnia you are changed in appearance but it is in appearance only painted eagles are not eagles and zuexis grapes as i have read were only painted grapes rich ornaments do not make princes nor rural weeds a swain shepherds are not called so because they wear pastoral attire and have a crook and scrip but because they attend their flocks and take care of their rural affairs this apparel therefore has not made a shepherd of a prince but makes a prince appear like a shepherd  had i been born a shepherd replied dorastus i should have loved you willingly and being a prince i am constrained to love you do not then with an unseasonable coyness reject a passion which you only could have inspired now is your time to love and be beloved while that sweet bloom glows in your charming face and every feature smiles with the gaiety of youth have you not observed the fate of these beautiful flowers with which you so often adorn your lovely hair they bud they bloom they wither and are neglected such is your beauty fawnia in youth it is praised admired and coveted in age forgotten and despised yield then to virtuous love for notwithstanding the inequality of our conditions i mean to make you my wife  fawnia transported with surprise and joy at this unhoped for declaration no longer kept up her forced indifference but beholding the prince with a languishing sweetness her face being all overspread with blushes ah my lord said she i am ashamed to discover the thoughts which have long filled my mind ought i beggar as i am to own my desires have reached at a prince oh dorastus i dare not say i love you because you are the son of a great king and i am a poor shepherdess but the gods know how i have honored dorastus receive then my humble my dutiful affection and look on me as your handmaid ever ready to obey your will in all things which are not prejudicial to my honor  dorastus overjoyed at this sweet and modest confession of her love for him embraced her with a passionate tenderness calling all the gods to witness the vows he made her of everlasting love and fidelity and now the lovers began to consult upon the measures they should take to be united for ever  dorastus who knew his father would be excessively enraged at such a match told fawnia there could be no safety for them in sicily and that therefore he would provide a sufficient quantity of money and jewels to support them till some favorable change happened in their affairs and with the treasure fly into italy and there solemnize their nuptials  this proposal was agreed to with great joy by fawnia who trembled at the thoughts of the kings discovering their love believing that nothing less than death would be inflicted on her for her presumption she therefore urged the prince to make the necessary preparations for their flight with the utmost speed lest fortune should cruelly prevent their intentions  the prince whose eager passion prompted him no less than her fears to hasten their departure assured her all should be ready in a few days and now the approaching night warning them to depart he took leave of fawnia with a tender embrace and repairing to the place where he had left his clothes threw off his shepherds frock and returned to the palace  fawnia was so transported with the unexpected tide of good fortune which had come rushing on her that for some time she could hardly persuade herself that all was not a dream but when the tumult of her joy was a little allayed and calmer reflections succeeding convinced her of the reality of her happiness she thanked the gods devoutly for their amazing bounty to her and beseeched them to continue their favor and protection to her and her beloved prince  in the mean time dorastus lost no opportunity of seeing his lovely shepherdess she drove her flocks to the fields every day and continued to watch them as usual not from any delight she now took in her pastoral employment but in the dear hope of seeing her beloved lord  dorastus notwithstanding he always came to meet his fawnia in the habit of a shepherd was at last discovered by some that knew him to be the prince so that his frequent visits to fawnia making much noise among the country people some of porruss neighbors out of good will to the old shepherd advised him to keep his daughter at home and keep a strict eye over her lest by going so often to the field she should bring him home a young son at last for that the young prince came often to her and would certainly if he had not yet delude her and make her his concubine  this news greatly surprised and alarmed the good old man who after thanking his neighbors for their kind informations hastened home to his wife and calling her aside and wringing his hands the tears fast falling down his aged cheeks o wife said he i fear i fear our daughter fawnia has committed sin and that she will buy repentance at a dear rate i have sad news to tell you my neighbors tell me that the young prince dorastus looks upon fawnia with a wistful eye and if that is the case i would not give a wisp of straw for her honesty at the years end  i tell thee wife that beauty is a great snare to entrap young men and fair words and fine promises are great enemies to a maidens honesty the poor may entreat and be refused but princes if entreaties will not o may command and then who can resist them  but it is a hard case though said the old man sobbing where the lust of a prince is he law and that he should bind poor folks to that which he himself freely breaks  take heed what you say said the good wife with a sagacious look speak no more than you should lest you hear what you would not do what you can but no more than you may great streams may be stopped by art but not by force take care of yourself lest by endeavoring to save fawnias honesty you lose your own head it is dangerous the proverb says to play with edged tools and bad to sport with princes remember the wolf had his skin stripped over his ears for looking into the lions den  you speak like a fool said porrus who could not relish his wifes sage council if the king should hear that dorastus loves our daughter his fury would be such that we might lose our goods if not our lives a thought has just now entered my head by which i will prevent the kings being offended with us and perhaps it may not displease the prince i will carry the chain and jewels i found with fawnia to the king and confess that she is not my daughter and tell him the whole story of my finding her the king may perhaps take her under his own care and then whatever happens we shall be blameless  the good wife was well enough pleased with this proposal and it was resolved between them to take the first opportunity of speaking to the king  in the mean time dorastus had communicated his design of leaving sicily to a faithful domestic who had attended his person from his childhood named capnio this man at first endeavored to dissuade him from so rash and dangerous an enterprise but finding the prince determined to depart he ceased to trouble him with any more fruitless expostulations and prepared to assist him in the prosecution of a design which though he did not approve he saw it was impossible to prevent unless by betraying his master to the king a piece of treachery he could not bring himself to commit being bound as well by his own inclinations as a sacred oath the prince had made him take to the contrary  he therefore with great secrecy and expedition provided a vessel to transport them to italy and the prince having furnished himself with a great quantity of money and jewels gave orders to capnio to get some rich apparel for fawnia the baggage was all safely conveyed on board and the master of the ship perceiving the wind likely to be favorable in a few hours he gave capnio notice that they must come on board early the next morning  capnio having informed the prince of this he sent him to fawnia desiring her to be in the fields by break of day where he would meet her and carry her to the port  she slept but little that night love fear and anxious expectation kept her waking at the first dawn of light she rose and unfolding her sheep drove them to the fields giving many a longing look for her beloved prince at last he appeared on horseback she ran eagerly to meet him and he dismounting after printing a hasty kiss upon her trembling lips took her up behind him and galloped as fast as possible to the haven where the ship lay  the sailors perceiving him at a distance rowed to shore with their boat and taking in the lovers carried them safe on board where we must leave them to see what happened at land  porrus having heard that the king intended to take the air that morning put on his holiday clothes and taking the chain and jewels he found with fawnia concealed in his bosom he took his way to the palace intending to watch the kings coming out at the gate  fortune determining to favor the lovers a little longer flung capnio who was hasting to the port with a casket in the old mans way  capnio seeing him taking the road to the palace and knowing him to be the father of fawnia asked him where he was going so early  porrus who knew him to be a courtier replied that prince dorastus had dealt very hardly with him i have but one daughter said the good man who to say the truth has some share of beauty i have reason to apprehend the prince has seduced her and i am going to complain to his majesty of this injury  capnio immediately foreseeing all the fatal consequences that might attend the old mans complaint at that critical time resolved to prevent it and therefore began to wheedle him by blaming the prince for so unworthy a design and added because he was a poor man and had no friends to stand by him himself would assist him in all he could but said he you will lose your labor if you go to the palace for the king designs to take the air to day on board a ship that lies in the harbor and is already set out therefore if you will be ruled by me as i am going to give them notice of his majestys coming that they may be prepared to receive him i will take you with me and place you so conveniently that you shall have all the liberty you can desire to make your complaint  porrus thanked his new friend with great submission for his proffered kindness and went with him to the port still complaining of the prince but concealed the chain and jewels and mentioned nothing concerning fawnias being a foundling  the sailors seeing capnio sent a boat for him but now porruss heart failed he began to suspect some design upon him and when capnio asked him to go into the boat he refused under pretense of being afraid of the sea capnio pressed him but to no purpose whereupon as there was no time to be lost he ordered the mariners who came in the boat to carry him in by force  porrus now saw he was betrayed but thinking it would be fruitless to cry out or exclaim against his false friend he civilly entreated him and the sailors to be kind to him and pity his condition who was but a poor man and lived by his labor and should be undone if he was absent long from his flocks  but they were as deaf to his entreaties as the winds and waves to the prayers of sinking mariners and laughed to see him so much afraid having reached their ship they obliged him to go on board where the first objects he cast his eyes on were the prince and fawnia  she being dressed in rich apparel he scarce knew her at first so much was her native beauty heightened by the magnificence of her clothes in which she appeared with such a graceful ease that it seemed as if she had never been accustomed to any other  porrus stood gazing on her at a distance greatly astonished at what he saw and wondering where it would end and the prince and fawnia who were equally surprised to see him there eagerly asked capnio for what purpose he was come  capnio informed them that he met him as he was going to complain to the king of the injury he suspected the prince had offered him in the person of his daughter and that he had prevented his design by artifice and brought him forcibly to the ship adding that it was absolutely necessary they should take him with them to italy otherwise their discovery would be inevitable  the prince approved this advice but fawnia who loved and respected the old shepherd as her father heard this resolution with great concern  porrus understanding that he should be carried from his wife his country and friends into a strange land burst into tears and complaints and falling on his knees earnestly entreated dorastus to pardon his rash folly and permit him to return home assuring him he would be as secret as the grave but the prince could not be prevailed upon by all his protestations to hazard the danger of a discovery and though fawnia herself with tears conjured him to grant her fathers request he continued obstinate in his refusal assuring her their ruin was inevitable if he complied fawnia then applied herself to comfort the old man as well as she could and the ship with a fair gale pursued her voyage  while this passed at sea egistus who intended to hunt that morning the prince departed sent to desire his sons company in that diversion hoping it would help to remove the melancholy which had of late hung upon him  the gentleman of his bedchamber returned answer that the prince went that morning very early to walk as he supposed in the grove as was his daily custom whereupon he king sent some of his attendants to look or the prince in that place but they coming ack without him the king attended by his noles went to the chase and after spending the day in hunting returned to the palace surrized at not finding his son yet come home e ordered strict search to be made for him is not appearing that night filled him with a housand uneasy apprehensions and the next day messengers were dispatched all over the ingdom to seek for him  the unhappy king at length supposing he ad fallen a prey to the wild beasts in the orest ordered several parties of horse to our the country round and if possible bring m some intelligence of his fate  some of these men meeting a fisherman ear the seaside mending his nets they enired if he had seen or heard any thing of e prince and he very ingenuously told them at a few days ago he had seen the prince ith fawnia the daughter of porrus the old hepherd himself and capnio all go on board  ship which instantly put off to sea  this news was immediately carried to the ing who full of surprise and grief orered the wife of porrus to be brought before m and examined her himself concerning e flight of her husband and daughter with s son  the old woman told the king that her eighbours had informed her husband the rince was too familiar with his daughter he apprehending something worse would follow and hearing his majesty intended to hunt a few days ago he rose early in the morning with an intention to complain to his majesty of the injury he feared the prince intended to do fawnia and added with tears that she had never seen her husband since  egistus perceiving the unfeigned simplicity with which she told her tale dismissed her but reflected so deeply upon the dishonorable action his son had committed that he fell into a fever and continued so weak and ill that his physicians had no hopes of his recovery  but dorastus who regarded neither father country nor crown now he was in possession of his beloved fawnia never troubled himself about the grief his strange flight would occasion the king and all the sicilians but resigned himself wholly up to the contemplation of his present happiness which he would not have quitted for all the empires in the world  the winds for some time seemed to favor their flight and they steered their course to italy without any interruption but one morning the sky began to be overcast with clouds the winds grew high the sea swelled and at last a storm ensued which raged during three days with such unceasing fury that the ship was so much damaged the sailors expected every moment it would sink  poor fawnia was almost dying with her fears but the sight of dorastus who never left her a moment yielded her some comfort amidst the horrors of approaching death on the fourth morning the storm abated and the sailors discovered land which they soon knew to be the coast of bohemia  their confused shouts of joy gave dorastus to understand they were in sight of some harbor and with tears of joy and tenderness he congratulated fawnia on their safety  but when he was told it was the coast of bohemia upon which they were driven remembering the enmity there was between the king of that country and his father whom he had sought to poison he was greatly perplexed not knowing what to do or whether it was better to trust to the fury of the winds and waves than the treachery and cruelty of the inhuman pandosto  capnio who saw it was impossible to expect any safety at sea advised the prince to conceal his name and country and take up his residence in some small village till they could procure a ship to carry them to italy  dorastus approved this scheme and ordered capnio to bid the ships crew give out that his name was meleagrus a gentleman of trapalonia and assure them in his name of a large reward for their secrecy  this done they went on shore and hired lodgings at a farm house in a village a mile distant from the chief city of bohemia as soon as they were recovered from the fatigues they had endured at sea during the storm dorastus impatient to be united to his beloved fawnia gave capnio orders to make preparations for their marriage  but in the mean time the fame of fawnias beauty was spread through all the village and from thence reached the city and at last the court nothing was talked of but the lovely stranger whose wonderful beauty was the subject of general admiration  pandosto though at that time above sixty years old was fired with the reports he continually heard of this young miracle and was resolved to see her and being informed they affected great privacy and lodged in a very mean house he determined to have them seized on suspicion of their being spies and brought before him in order to be examined by himself  accordingly he sent a small party of his guards to apprehend them who coming to the house where they lodged informed them that they must come before the king  dorastus not in the least daunted by this message took fawnia by the hand and leaving porrus to take care of the treasure followed the guards together with capnio  being introduced to the king they paid their obeisance to him with a respectful confidence that might have persuaded him of their innocence had he really suspected them to have come into his country with any bad intention  but the king at the first glance of fawnia was so astonished at her wonderful beauty that forgetting what he had to do for several minutes he stood motionless like a statue not able to remove his eyes from that enchanting object recovering himself at last he turned to dorastus and asked him sternly who he was of what country and with what intent he had landed in bohemia sir said dorastus with a countenance unchanged and a resolute tone of voice my name is meleagrus a knight born and bred up in trapalonia this young woman whom i intend to make my wife is a native of italy from whence i brought her the reason i have so small a train is that her friends being unwilling to consent to her marriage i took her away privately with an intent to carry her to trapalonia as we were sailing a violent storm arose which drove us upon this coast and i propose to stay no longer here than till our ship is refitted and put into a condition to pursue her voyage  pandosto either not satisfied or pretending not to be satisfied with this account rose from his seat in a rage meleagrus said he i am not to be imposed upon by this unlikely tale this lady appears to be of a much higher quality than you represent her and by the graceful loveliness of her person fitter to be the wife of a great prince than a simple knight as you declare yourself to be  you have stolen away this young lady from her unhappy parents like a false traitor and as you have made them miserable by your theft will no doubt shortly make her so too therefore till i can be thoroughly informed of her birth and till you have produced a certificate from trapalonia to confirm the account you have given of yourself i will detain ye all in bohemia  the noble mind of dorastus could but ill brook the base suspicions and injurious language of pandosto and almost forgetting the character he assumed he looked on him with a frown of anger and disdain and with a haughty accent thus replied  it is unworthy the honor and dignity of a prince to reproach any man with having committed scandalous crimes without any proof of his guilt or even suspicion to form a belief on inoffensive strangers ought to be treated with kindness and benevolence not with distrust and cruelty which is contrary to the laws of nations and the customs of all civilized people but the gods will severely revenge the cause of those who through inability to right themselves are obliged to put up with wrongs and injuries  pandosto was so enraged at this bold and resolute language that he immediately ordered his guards to carry the audacious stranger to prison and likewise ordered all the ships crew to be put in a close dungeon for fawnia he ordered an apartment in the palace to be prepared and recommended her to the care of some of the court ladies  dorastus heard the order for his confinement with a contemptuous silence and followed the guards without deigning to cast a look on the enraged king and only by a passionate glance at fawnia expressed the anguish of his soul at being thus torn from her  she with streaming eyes saw him depart and retiring to the apartment allotted for her esigned herself up to the deepest despair and ontinued wholly insensible of all the consoations that were offered her  mean time pandosto in whose old bosom love had again kindled a flame lost no oportunity of seeing the beauteous stranger t first he fancied he was only giving way to  pleasing amusement when he sought the ight and conversation of fawnia but he oon perceived that she was become necessary o his happiness  his restless anxiety when he was absent om her his disordered wishes when with er the perturbations of his mind when he ought of meleagrus convinced him that is unknown virgin had conquered his heart e blushed at his own weakness he reflected n his advanced age his exalted rank on er youth beauty and mean condition d sought for reasons against his yielding to e force of his misplaced passions reasons  found many but love was stronger n them all  in vain he represented to himself that fawnia loved the unknown knight and that a heart already prepossessed with a young and amiable object was not likely to yield to his solicitations his passion seemed to gather strength from the obstacles which opposed it and he resolved if persuasions failed to make use of all his power to compel fawnia to his desires  for this purpose he sent a messenger to her one day when he was walking in a park behind his palace to tell her he wanted to speak to her  fawnia went to him unwillingly and as she approached the king taking her hand walked with her a few steps then stopping suddenly he looked earnestly at her a moment and thus spoke  fawnia i am charmed with thy  and beauty i pity thy distressed situation an am willing to make thy fortune provide thou will forsake that despicable knight wh brought thee hither  he is unworthy  possess an object so lovely thou art fit for the embraces of a king and if thou will yie to be my mistress i will advance thee bo to dignity and riches  i little expected replied fawnia with noble disdain to hear a proposal so base a so unworthy the majesty of a king from pandosto is it for you sir for one of yo dignity and age to attempt to seduce an uhappy virgin whom fortune and your own injustice has put into your power but know my lord that your endeavors to engage me from meleagrus are all in vain he won my heart by honorable love and he only shall possess it my unhappy fate drove me into your dominions where i have been separated from meleagrus and am persecuted by you but these misfortunes cannot lessen my love or shake my constancy true love like true virtue gathers strength and firmness from distress no though your majesty has imprisoned my lover without any cause contrary to all the laws of hospitaity and justice and by that means i am eft alone and without any protection in your court yet think not that the most terrible threats or most alluring temptations can make me consent to any thing that is dishoourable i have a noble mind though the gods have been pleased to cover it with pleean clay i cannot be terrified by threats r soothed by flatteries into a base complince therefore be assured i would rather huse to be the wife of meleagrus and share ith him the greatest miseries that cruel forne can inflict than be the concubine of andosto and live in all the splendour he can estow  the king though greatly surprised and rplexed with this resolute answer of fawa yet would not give over his solicitatis when he found he could not prevail upon her to yield to his desires by promises of wealth and grandeur to herself he swore that he would not only set meleagrus at liberty but that he would confer honors and dignities on him and raise him to a rank equal to the greatest of his noblemen  but fawnia replied that she would not purchase his liberty ardently as she loved him with the loss of her honor and pandosto seeing her so fixed in her resolution not to forsake meleagrus would press her no further at that time and left her to herself  fawnia as soon as she was alone began with sighs and tears to bewail this new misfortune which had befallen her anticipating by her fears the distresses her refusal of the kings offers might bring upon dorastus and herself  oh unfortunate fawnia said she how well has thy presumption in daring to love a prince been punished by the calamities thou endurest at present and those greater ones which thou have reason to expect ah fond and inconsiderate maid had thou been contented with the humble condition of a shepherdess in which thou were born thou had escaped these evils but thy rash folly has not only undone thyself but ruined him whose happiness is and ought to be dearer to thee than thy own  oh dorastus dorastus thou who were born a prince art now a prisoner for my sake those hands which were formed for scepters are loaded with shameful irons for me unworthy me what miseries has thy fatal passion for the wretched fawnia brought upon thee too lovely and too generous prince thou had been still great and happy but for me oh that by my death i could free thee from thy unworthy bonds but alas thy freedom can only be procured by the sacrifice of my honor and that sacrifice thou would never consent to no my dear prince it is only by my fidelity to thee that i can requite thy wondrous love and here i swear by the immortal gods no temptations no threats not even of death itself shall ever make me forsake thee  fawnia having thus given vent to the secret sorrows of her soul retired to her apartment in the palace and past the melancholy hours in bewailing the confinement of her beloved prince and offering up prayers to the gods for his deliverance  mean time dorastus in a close prison loaded with irons like a common criminal and now a thousand bitter reflections rose in his mind rage and shame at the unworthy treatment he received made him sometimes regret his ill placed passion which had brought him into so wretched a condition  but this thought seldom dwelt long upon his mind and he was more ready to accuse the gods of cruelty and injustice for divideing him from fawnia and subjecting him to such miseries than to repent the folly that had caused them  oh wretched dorastus would he cry when assaulted by a vainly suppressed remorse ought thou in reason to repine at thy fate are not worse punishments if possible than what thou now endurest due to thy unworthiness and folly could thou expect to be favored by heaven thou who did forget the duties of thy station and have disgraced thy rank and dignity the wrath of heaven is levelled at the wretch who disobeys his father and oppresses his old age with shame and sorrow thou have done this dorastus and may with reason expect the severest punishments will be inflicted on thee behold me then ye gods ready to suffer all your vengeance and willing to expiate my offense by death but on me on me only let loose all your fury spae the lovely the innocent fawnia shield and defend her helpless youth from the inhuman tyranny of pandosto and if my death can procure her safety hasten it ye heavenly powers and let my punishment atone for all  while the two lovers thus groaned under the cruel tyranny of pandosto his passion for fawnia gave him no less disquiet her denials instead of abating increased his unlawful desires his discontent appeared in every look and action so tha his courtiers who saw him always disturbed and uneasy wondered from whence the sudden alteration proceeded  though the resolute behavior of fawnia in the last interview he had with her gave him no reason to hope for any change in her sentiments yet being impatient to see her again and assail her virtue with new solicitations he ordered her to be brought privately into his apartment  fawnia with great reluctance suffered herself to be conducted to his presence and the king as soon as he saw her ordered all his attendants to withdraw and with a soothing look and voice thus spoke to her  well charming fawnia have you considered upon the purport of my last conversation with you when we walked together in the park are you become less obstinate and more wise will you prefer the love of a king to the affection of a miserable knight i persuade myself you are not so insensible to the charms of ambition as not to think it better to be the favorite of a king than the wife of a poor subject  my lord replied fawnia i am sensible that i am in your power and have indeed severely felt the arbitrary exertion of it is it just is it reasonable my lord to inflict upon innocent persons such punishments as are only due to guilty ones what crime has meleagrus committed against you that he must be loaded with chains and confined in a horrible prison and what right have you over my person that you detain me here in your palace and force me to listen to your infamous proposals meleagrus has never attempted to seduce your subjects from their allegiance to you why then do you attempt to allure me from the fidelity i owe to him but know unjust prince though fortune has put my person in your power my mind can never be subdued but disdains alike your promises and threats i have vowed to keep myself for my beloved meleagrus and nothing but death shall prevent my keeping that vow  is it possible then said pandosto that you can persist in refusing the love of a king for the sake of that wretched man foolish and ungrateful girl you say you are in my power yet i forbear to use it to your prejudice and what i might compel by force am contented only to sue for by prayers yield then and reward my ardent passion with your love meleagrus shall be set at liberty your countrymen discharged and all that your utmost wishes can suggest shall be fulfilled by a king who burns in love for you  why do you talk of love replied fawnia with a beautiful disdain you who are a stranger to that godlike passion alas it is profanation to call the inclination you have for me by the name of love such love as yours my lord is worse than death to a modest virgin and to avoid it i will freely sacrifice my life well may you threaten me with your power you who are capable of making so ill an use of it but know lascivious prince that all your power is insufficient to force me to a crime the gods abhor and since i dare die to preserve my honor your impious attempt will gain you nothing but eternal infamy  pandosto enraged at her unalterable love for meleagrus and fixed resolution to refuse his offer ordered her with eyes sparkling with fury to quit his presence swearing at the same time that unless she disposed herself soon to yield to his desires he would force her to comply whatever might be the consequences  fawnia not in the least terrified at his menaces quitted his apartment and retired to her own arming her soul with fortitude to escape his threatened force by death if heaven afforded her not some other means of relief  in the mean time the king of sicily was informed by some bohemian merchants who had discovered meleagrus to be dorastus that his son was in bohemia and confined in prison by the king  egistus though extremely offended with his son for his disobedience and desertion of him yet could not hear of the shameful treatment he received from pandosto without feeling great affliction and reflecting that bellaria and himself had been cleared by the oracles of apollo of the crime the king suspected them guilty of he did not doubt but pandosto would send back his fugitive son at the request of his ambassadors  he therefore ordered a small fleet well manned to be prepared and giving a commission to some of his principal nobles to demand the prince of pandosto they embarked and set sail for bohemia  pandosto received the sicilian ambassadors with great respect which filled them with hopes of returning to their master with success and soon after their arrival related to them the adventure of the trapalonian knight who he said had come into his dominions in a very suspicious manner bringing with him a young lady named fawnia and no attendants but a shepherd and an old man  the ambassadors immediately perceived this trapalonian knight was no other than their prince dorastus but they dissembled the matter for the present till the king granted them a public audience and then in the name of their sovereign they demanded the prince of sicily of him who was in his dominions under the name of meleagrus  they then proceeded to acquaint his bohemian majesty that the prince of sicily had contrary to the will of the king his father quitted the kingdom and carried with him a young maid named fawnia the daughter of an old shepherd called porrus and that capnio one of the princes attendants had accompanied him in his flight  they concluded with telling the king that it was the request of their sovereign egistus that prince dorastus should be freed from his confinement and sent home with them and that capnio porrus and his daughter fawnia should be put to death  pandosto heard this embassy with great astonishment and willing to reconcile himself to egistus and to show how much he desired to renew their long interrupted friendship he resolved punctually to execute his will and to sacrifice fawnia both to his policy and his injured love  he therefore sent orders immediately for the release of dorastus who was greatly surprised at this unexpected favor but he was still more so when being conducted into the kings presence he saw several noblemen belonging to his fathers court who as soon as he appeared approached and paid their duties to him with the utmost respect  pandosto rising from his chair of state embraced him with many expressions of tenderand respect mingling apologies for what had passed while his birth and quality were unknown then seating him on his right hand he declared to him the purport of the embassy he had received from the king his father  dorastus in great confusion to find the cause of his flight was thus publicly known held down his head to hide the blushes which overspread his face but when the king went on to relate the punishment that he was required to inflict upon fawnia and that other partners of his flight he was not able to conceal the strong emotions of his soul but in the most passionate terms he exclaimed against the cruelty and injustice of his father and earnestly conjured pandosto not to execute so inhuman a sentence  the king without being moved by his entreaties ordered fawnia capnio and porrus to be brought before him and giving way to the fury of his resentment against fawnia whose noble resistance had changed the former love he bore her into hatred he accosted the trembling maid with these reproachful words  mean and contemptible wretch said he how durst thou raise thy dazzled eyes to honor and in thy base born soul nourish the flames of ambition was it for thee thou beggar to entertain hopes of marrying a prince and practice arts to induce the son of a great king to forsake his country to gratify thy insolent desires but know thou dangerous siren death shall be the reward of thy daring ambition and thou old doting fool said he to the pale trembling porrus whose insolent folly has prompted thy daughter to this rash undertaking thy life shall pay for thy presumption  but for thee capnio added the enraged king death is too easy a punishment thy treason and falsehood merits something worse i therefore condemn thee to have thy eyes put out and till thou die grind continually in a mill like a blind horse  dorastus whom the sentence that was past on fawnia had thrown into a silent agony of grief rage and despair perceiving they were about to lead her away rose up to speak in her defense but overcome with the violence of these different emotions he sunk down again in his chair without any appearance of life  by the timely assistance of the kings physicians he recovered his senses and at their instances he was removed from the sight of fawnia who as soon as he was taken out of the room spoke in this manner  if my death will be the means of procuring peace and happiness for prince dorastus who is my betrothed lord and whose sacred vows the gods have heard and registered in heaven and which no power on earth can dissolve i am then content to die but my innocent and tender passion for him i shall carry to my grave my last breath shall be spent in begging blessings for him in imploring the gods to shed their choicest gifts upon him that when he succeeds to the throne of his father he may rule his subjects with prudence equity and moderation for wisdom and mercy are divine attributes and a monarchs true safety and happiness consists in the love and not the fear of his people behold me then o king prepared to suffer all the rigor of your sentence but oh my father what has he done that his gray and venerable hairs must by violence be brought to the grave alas he is absolutely innocent of the engagement between the prince and me he neither counseled my flight nor consented to accompany me in it but was brought forcibly on board the ship and compelled to be the partner of our voyage must he then die for an involuntary crime oh unjust and cruel destiny  but who art thou king pandosto who judge thus the subjects of another king who not having committed any thing worthy of punishment since they came into thy territories have nevertheless passed sentence of death upon them but something within me says thou have a power to judge fawnia be it so then and welcome death which will bring me to those regions of bliss where eternal justice mercy and compassion reigns  the old shepherd moved with the affectionate entreaties of fawnia in his favor and perceiving there was no more hope of life resolved before he died to discover that she was not his daughter and after entreating a few moments audience spoke thus  king of bohemia and ye noble ambassadors of sicily seeing that i am though innocent condemned to die i am willing to disburthen my conscience of a secret i have too long concealed i will tell ye as much as i know and no more than is true fawnia who has been disdained as a vile beggar is not my daughter i found her and thus it happened being a poor shepherd in sicily and living by keeping other mens flocks upon a certain day one of my sheep straying down to the seaside i went to look for it and saw a little boat driven upon the sands wherein i found a babe about six days old wrapped in a scarlet mantle with a chain about its neck compassion moved me to take care of the child and being covetous of the treasure i had found with it i carried it home to my wife who nursed it as her own and when it grew up set it to keep sheep this lady fawnia is the child whom i found and here is the chain and the jewels that were about her who she is and of what parentage i know not but i solemnly declare she is not mine  pandosto who had with difficulty restrained his emotions while porrus war speaking as soon as he was silent impatiently demanded to know the season of the year when he found this babe the boat in which it was laid and several other circumstances and fully satisfied with his answers he suddenly sprung from his seat and in a rapture of paternal affection he catched fawnia in his arms bathing her tender face which he pressed close to his own with tears of surprise and joy and crying in broken accents oh fawnia my long lost daughter i am thy father fawnia  these exclamations and sudden passion filled all that were present with amazement especially fawnia who stood motionless with surprise her lovely face expressing at once the extremes of joy hope fear and wonder  pandosto as soon as the first violence of his transports was abated sent for dorstus who was by this time perfectly restored to his senses and holding fawnia by the hand he declared that she was his daughter of whom his wife bellaria had been delivered while she lay under the false suspicion of adultery and was therefore by his orders exposed in an open boat to the fury of the waves he then ordered porrus to tell the prince where he had found her and his relation finished he again embraced her and publicly acknowledged her for his daughter  fawnia now assured of the reality of her happiness indulged her joy at this unexpected good fortune dorastus was transported out of himself and the sicilians no longer repined at their princes choice but rejoiced in the expectation that the enmity which had so long subsisted between egistus and pandosto would now be changed into a firm friendship and perpetual peace between the kingdoms of sicily and bohemia  the news was soon spread through pandostos dominions the streets rung with exclamations of joy for the kings having found his daughter and that there was now a lawful heir to the crown of bohemia nothing but magnificent shows were every where to be seen and the most extravagant demonstrations of joy  the king conferred the honor of knighthood on old porrus who had been so long the reputed father of fawnia and causing a noble fleet to be put in readiness to sail he embarked with dorastus fawnia and the sicilian ambassadors with a numerous retinue and soon arrived at sicily where he was kindly received by egistus who was perfectly satisfied with his sons fortune  the nuptial ceremonies between the prince and princess were performed with great magnificence and soon after pandosto giving way to a thousand gloomy reflections which the consideration of his unjust jealousy of bellaria his designed cruelty to egistus but above all his unnatural passion for his daughter had inspired a deep melancholy seized his spirits which turning to a phrenzy he one night took advantage of the absence of his attendants and stabbed himself with a dagger  his death was much lamented by dorastus fawnia and the good egistus his body being embalmed the young king and queen of bohemia took leave of the king of sicily their father and carried the corpse of the deceased monarch with them to bohemia where the funeral obsequies were performed with great splendour and they ascended the throne to the universal joy of the whole kingdom  observations on the use shakespeare has made of the foregoing novel in his play called the winters tale the fable of the winters tale polixenes king of bohemia and leontes king of sicilia having been bred together in their youth and maintained a strict friendship and correspondence with each other after they succeeded to the thrones of their fathers polixenes desirous of seeing again his beloved companion pays him a visit in his own dominions where after staying a considerable time he proposes to take leave and return to his own kingdom but leontes unwilling to part with him presses him to a loner stay polixenes refuses whereupon leontes desires his queen hermione to solicit him she obeys and polixenes at her request consents to remain a little longer in bohemia  leontes takes occasion from the earnestness of his wifes entreaties and the easy compliance of polixenes to suspect them both f adultery and growing furious with jeaousy he endeavors to persuade camillo one of his courtiers whom he had made cup bearer to polixenes to poison him  camillo promises to perform his orders but secretly discovers them to the king of bohemia who thus warned makes his escape by night accompanied by his preserver camillo  leontes enraged at their flight and supposing that his queen was privy to it publicly accuses her of adultery with polixenes and of conspiring with camillo to take away his life  hermione is sent to prison where she is delivered of a daughter paulina an old lady friend to the queen carries the child to leontes who swears it is a bastard and threatens to have both it and the mother burnt being with difficulty dissuaded from this cruel resolution he orders antigonous the husband of paulina to carry the child to some desert place quite out of his dominions and there leave it  antigonous being instructed in a dream how to dispose of it carries it into bohemia and leaves it in a wood but as he is returning to his vessel he is devoured by a wild bear and the ship is wrecked  leontes having sent messengers to delpho to consult the oracle of apollo concerning hi queens infidelity as soon as they return the queen is brought to her trial and her accusation being read which she courageously denies and refers to the oracle it is broke open and read aloud and pronounces her inher inocence  the king declares the oracle is false and orders the court to proceed in the trial when a messenger brings him an account of the sudden death of the prince his son the queen falls into a swoon at this news and is carried out  leontes believing the death of his son to be a punishment for his profanation in denying the truth of the oracle repents his unjust accusation of hermione asks pardon of apollo and resolves to make his queen amends for the injuries he had offered her  while he is making these penitent resolutions paulina enters and informs him the queen is dead leontes in great affliction vows to visit her tomb once in every day while he lives and weep ever it  in the mean time the little perdita his daughter is found by a bohemian shepherd who breeds it up as his own child prince florizel the son of polixenes falls in love with perdita and resolves to marry her the king his father discovers his intention and threatens perdita with death if she ever again presumes to receive his sons addresses camillo who ardently desired to visit his own country sicilia and his old master leontes persuades prince florizel since he was determined not to quit perdita to steal her away and carry her to sicilia and feign an embassy from his father to leontes which would secure him a kind reception  florizel goes on board a ship with perdita and sails to sicilia where he is received with great friendship by leontes but immediately after king polixenes himself arrives having been persuaded by camillo to follow his son and prevent his marriage with perdita  the supposed father of perdita having been decoyed on board the princes vessel as he was going to the king to discover how he came by perdita and to show him the tokens he found with her she is by his means discovered to be the daughter of leontes  paulina overjoyed at this happy discovery invites the two kings with the prince and princess to her house to see a statue of hermione which she says is just finished they follow her and she shows them hermione herself who they supposed dead standing upon pedestal after they have gazed on her some time still thinking it was a statue of the deceased queen paulina orders the music to play and bids the statue descend which it does and is discovered to be the living hermione  leontes receives her again with transport prince florizel is married to his beloved perdita and the good old paulina is rewarded with another husband in the room of her lost antigonous  it has been mentioned as a great praise to shakespeare that the old paltry story of dorastus and fawnia served him for a winters tale but if we compare the conduct of the incidents in the play with the paltry story on which it is founded we shall find the original much less absurd and ridiculous  if shakespeare had even improved the story and cleared it of great part of its inconsistencies yet he would still have been accountable for what remained for why indeed did he choose a subject so faulty for the story of a play his claim to praise would have been but very small by making what was bad better since he was free in the choice of his subject but certainly he can have no pretensions to it at all by changing bad to worse that he has done so will be easily proved by examining some of the principal incidents as they are differently managed by the novelist and the poet  the kings jealousy is the foundation of all the adventures that followed but extravagant as its consequences are in both yet the rise and progress of this terrible passion is better accounted for in the novel than the play in the first we are told that pandosto charmed with the friendly visit egistus paid him in his dominions desired the queen to treat her royal guest with the respect and esteem that was due to his merit and the friendship he had for him the queen like an obedient wife complies with her husbands directions and perhaps overacts her part the king begins to think he has been too officious the innocent familiarity between his wife and friend creates suspicions which meeting with a mind prepared by a natural distrustfulness to receive them produces those sparks of jealousy which his interested observations on all their looks words and actions afterward blew into a flame  this account of the kings jealousy does not absolutely clash with probability but let us see how shakespeare manages it in the play the two kings make their first appearance in the second scene in high friendship and confidence polixenes reminding his friend of the length of his visit tells him he is now resolved to be gone  leontes not able to part with him presses him earnestly to stay longer polixenes urges the necessity of his speedy departure and truly as he observes nine months is a great while for a good king to be out of his own dominions  leontes after many fruitless entreaties reproaches his queen for not endeavoring to detain polixenes she in obedience to his commands presses him to gratify her lord by a little longer stay polixenes complies at her request and certainly he must be a very ill bred monarch had he done otherwise  all this conversation passes in the presence of leontes who from hence takes occasion to be jealous and passes in an instant from the greatest confidence security and friendship imaginable to the last extremity of jealousy and rage what wonderful contrivance is here the legerdemain who shows you a tree that buds blossoms and bears ripe fruit in the space of five minutes does not put so great a cheat on the senses as shakespeare does on the understanding for this jealousy of one minutes growth we see take root before our eyes and so far from there being the smallest progression in the several actions of budding blossoming and bearing ripe fruit that we have the first and the last at one and the same instant  the extravagant effects of the kings rage and jealousy are carried far enough in all conscience in the novel and shakespeare is not a whit more moderate only he has altered a circumstance which entirely destroys the little probability the novelist had preserved in the relation  in the story the king being in his own mind firmly persuaded of the queens guilt rders her to be imprisoned and the daughter at she was delivered of in prison to be burnt  the entreaties of his courtiers he reverses the sentence past on the child and commands it to be exposed in a boat but declares that his queen shall die  she insists upon being confronted with her accusers whereupon she is brought to a trial but finding she was likely to meet with no justice in a court overruled by the power of her husband she on her knees protests her innocence and entreats the king to consult the oracle of apollo concerning the crimes of which she was accused this so reasonable a request being made in open court the king could not refuse it and therefore sends ambassadors to delphos who return with the answer of the god which being read declares her innocence and the king is satisfied  shakespeare makes the king in the height of his frenzy of jealousy send himself to the oracle of apollo and in the mean time commit the most barbarous cruelties on his queen and child how inconsistent is this why does he consult the oracle if he is resolved to proceed to extremities before the answer arrives the request comes very naturally from the queen in the novel and the kings compliance with it is very well accounted for but in the play nothing can be more absurd than that the king should be reasonable enough to consult voluntarily the gods concerning the infidelity of his wife and while the answer was expected and her guilt yet doubtful punish her with as much rigor as if the oracle had declared her an adultress her again the paltry story has the advantage of the play let us go on to examine a few more of the incidents  in the novel the persons who perform the hateful office of exposing the infant princess are some of the kings guards  in the play it is a nobleman of high rank who had courage enough to reprove the king for his violent and unjust jealousy yet basely submits to take an oath to perform his commands though he had reason to think they would not be very mild and still more basely keeps that oath though it enjoins him to carry the innocent babe to a desert and there leave it to the mercy of the wild beasts  in the novel the accidents that happen to the exposed infant are governed by chance the boat into which it was put being left in the midst of the ocean is driven by the winds to the coast of bohemia and being spied by a shepherd is drawn to land  in the play antigonous who is bound by oath to leave the child in some desert place quite out of its fathers dominions is warned in a dream by its unhappy mother to call the infant perdita and carry it to bohemia and there leave it  antigonous obeys and this done it is absolutely necessary he should never return to sicily otherwise it may be discovered where the princess is left and all the future adventures would fall to the ground therefore a bear rushes out of the woods and devours him the goodnatured bear as it should seem resolved not to spoil the story passes by the little princess who is to make so great a figure hereafter and a convenient storm arising splits the ship in which she was brought thither so that all the sailors perishing though they were near enough the shore to have saved themselves no one is left to cary back any account of the affair to sicily and thereby prevent the adventures which are to follow  all this is very wonderful shakespeare multiplies miracle upon miracle to bring about the same events in the play which chance with much more propriety performs in the novel  the loves of the young prince of bohemia and the royal shepherdess are carried on much in the same manner by the poet as the novelist shakespeare has even borrowed some of the thoughts from the latter in this speech of florizel to perdita  the gods themselves humbling their deities to love have taken the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter became a bull and bellowed the green neptune a ram and bleated and the firerobd god golden apollo a poor humble swain as i seem now their transformations were never for a piece of beauty rarer nor in a way so chaste since my desires run not before my honor nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith dorastus speaks almost the same words in the novel the gods themselves have not disdained to love jupiter was enamoured of danae and the bright apollo wooed the inexorable daphne these were mortal beauties and they were deities why then though a prince may not i love a shepherdess but their passions were dishonorable mine is pure and chaste it is true and herein i surpass the gods be still then o my soul for it is decreed fawnia the adorable fawnia shall be mine  the escape of the two lovers is very differently managed in the novel and play in the first the prince being pressed by his father to marry resolves to leave sicily with fawnia and fly into italy where he intended to live concealed till his fathers death or that he could reconcile him to his marriage with the beautiful shepherdess having procured a ship and a sufficient quantity of money and jewels he meets fawnia early in the morning and carries her to the port they embark and steer their course for italy but are driven by contrary winds to bohemia where they are obliged to land  in the play florizel disguised in the habit of a shepherd for the sake of perdita assists at a sheepshearing feast the king his father being informed of his sons resort to the house of a shepherd goes there disguised with his confidant camillo and comes very opportunely to hear the prince his son declare his passion for the fair shepherdess publicly and his intentions of marrying her nay he carries his indiscretion so far as to join hands with her before all the country people who are present can any thing be more absurd  the king sufficiently informed of his sons designs discovers himself and forbids the bans this is indeed a terrible stroke one would be puzzled to think how the lovers will escape for is it not natural to suppose that the enraged king will keep his son in a strict confinement to prevent this unequal match but it happens quite otherwise for the king after some severe menaces goes back to his palace and leaves his son at liberty to run away with the country girl which he accordingly does  the part camillo acts in this affair is not more consistent he longs to see again his old master leontes and his native country sicilia which he had quitted to preserve polixenes and because this monarch loved him so well that he could not bear his absence and gently denied him permission to go camillo betrays the confidence he reposed in him consents to the princes flight and advises him to take refuge in sicilia in hopes that polixenes to whom he intended to discover where the prince was gone would follow him and thus he might again return to his own country  this double treachery and selfinterested views are very inconsistent with the character of so honest a man as camillo is represented to be besides the contrivance is absolutely ridiculous for what reason had the prince to suppose that leontes who passionately desired to be reconciled to the king his father whom he had so greatly injured would offend him anew by protecting his son who had fled from him in order to marry a poor shepherdess for he could not expect the story however he disguised it would be long concealed from him and why should camillo suppose that polixenes when he was informed of his sons flight would quit his dominions to follow him and put his person again in the power of a king who had once designed to murder him was it not more likely that he would send ambassadors to demand the prince of leontes who would then have an opportunity of showing if his penitence was sincere by sending him back again but shakespeare has fallen into all these absurdities in order to bring the chief characters in his play together at sicilia though for some of them there was not the least occasion  the several incidents that lead to the discovery of fawnia are conducted with some shadow of probability in the novel but are much the worse for shakespeares alterations  in the novel capnio the princes confidant as he is hastening after him to the port meets the father of fawnia going to court and suspecting his design he artfully persuades him to follow him and partly by stratagem and partly by force carries him on board the vessel in which the prince and fawnia were embarked the old man had taken with him when he left his house the chain and jewels he found with fawnia in order to show them to the king and relate the manner in which he found her but being prevented in this design by capnio who obliged him to be the companion of their flight he very prudently continues to conceal from fawnia the circumstance of her birth and to secure to himself a respectful treatment from the prince and her suffers her still to believe him her father but when at bohemia the king of sicilias ambassadors discover who they are and the old shepherd and fawnia are by the king of bohemia ordered to be put to death for deluding the prince of sicily he then declares that fawnia is not his daughter and produces the chain and jewels he found with her as proofs that her birth was not mean the king at the sight of these tokens knows and acknowledges his daughter  thus these circumstances are altered by shakespeare  the prince having changed clothes with a cheating pedlar escapes with his mistress to the ship the pedlar immediately overhears a conversation between the reputed father of perdita and his son in which it is resolved that he shall carry the jewels to the king and declare how he found perdita the pedlar supposing it would be an advantage to the prince to know this decoys the old shepherd and his son aboard now one would imagine that all must come out but see what strange accidents conspire to hinder it  the pedlar though he overheard the old shepherd say that perdita was a foundling and not his daughter neglects to tell the prince this important circumstance though it was with that very design he came and forced the two clowns along with him  perdita though her father and brother are in the same vessel with her never sees or speaks to them the old shepherd and his son make no attempts to speak to her and the prince has so little consideration for the father and brother of his beloved that he takes no notice of them how wonderful is all this the most unlikely things imaginable fall out to postpone the discovery of perdita till their arrival at sicily  the novel makes the wife of the jealous king die through affliction for the loss of her son shakespeare seems to have preserved her alive for the sake of her representing her own statue in the last scene a mean and absurd contrivance for how can it be imagined that hermione a virtuous and affectionate wife would conceal herself during sixteen years in a solitary house though she was sensible that er repentant husband was all that time consuming away with grief and remorse for her death and what reason could she have for choosing to live in such a miserable confinement when she might have been happy in the possession of her husbands affection and have shared his throne how ridiculous also in a great queen on so interresting an occasion to submit to such buffoonery as standing on a pedestal motionless her eyes fixed and at last to be conjured down by this magical command of paulina  music awake her strike it is time descend be stone no more approach strike all that look upon with marvel come i will fill your grave up stir nay come away bequeath to death your numbness for from him dear life redeems you after this solemn incantation her majesty comes down from the pedestal and embraces her husband and her new found daughter for whose sake she declares she had preserved her life  to bring about this scene ridiculous as it is shakespeare has been guilty of many absurdities which would be too tedious to mention and which are too glaring to escape the observation of the most careless reader  the novel has nothing in it half so low and improbable as this contrivance of the statue and indeed wherever shakespeare has altered or invented his winters tale is greatly inferior to the old paltry story that furnished him with the subject of it  sir thomas hanmer in his edition of shakespeare has this note at the beginning of the winter tale  this country here called bithynia has in all former editions been printed bohemia an inland kingdom situated nearly in the center of europe whereas many of the great incidents of the play turn upon its being a maritime country of which polixenes was the king this is a blunder and an absurdity of which shakespeare in justice ought not to be thought capable and as he has turned quite anew the story contained in the old paltry book of dorastus and fawnia changing most of the main circumstances and all the names of the persons it is probable he removed this impropriety and placed the scene in bithynia which the ignorance and negligence of the first transcribers or printers might corrupt and bring back again to bohemia by a less variation in the letters than they have been guilty of in numberless other places of this work  shakespeare in his two gentlemen of verona makes protheus travel from verona to milan by sea yet both those cities are inland and both more than eighty miles distant from the sea unless this blunder can be also charged upon the transcribers or printers it is reasonable to suppose that shakespeare who was guilty of the one might be so of the other  the menaechmi a comedy of plautus translated from the french of monsieur gueudiville  the persons the prologue menaechmus of epidamnum son of moschus and theusimarcha and brother of sosicles an old man father of the wife of menaechmus of epidamnum the wife of menaechmus of epidamnum erotia the mistress of menaechmus of epidamnum physician peniculus parasite of menaechmus of epidamnum a servant of menaechmus of epidamnum slaves cylindrus cook to menaechmus of epidamnum and erotia menaechmus sosicles brother to menaechmus of epidamnum messenion slave of menaechmus sosicles the epilogue  scene epidamnum in macedonia  prologue i begin gentlemen with telling you that i wish you all as well as myself here is a comedy of plautus which i bring you and entreat you will give it a favorable attention listen now to the subject of the play and be silent i shall endeavor to comprise it in as few words as possible  it is customary with poets in their comedies to make one believe that all passes at athens to the end that the subject may appear entirely grecian and may be more esteemed by the spectators as for me i shall not pretend to say that what we are going to represent here to day happened in any other place than where it really did  the subject of this piece is truly grecian yet notwithstanding that it is not attick but sicilian and what i have hitherto said is only the introduction to it  in explaining the argument to you i shall not amuse myself with showing you patterns only but present you with the whole piece for it is my intention to be very full in the exposition of this intrigue  there was formerly at syracuse a good plain simple man a merchant by profession his wife was delivered of two sons at one birth who so perfectly resembled each other that the nurse who suckled them and the mother who bore them were not able to distinguish the one from the other this i was told by a person who saw them for my own part i never did see them and i tell you so that you may not be deceived  when these two children arrived to the age of seven years their father took one of them with him on board a vessel which he had loaded with merchandise and carried him to tarentum whither he went to trade leaving the other at home with his mother  it happened that when they arrived at tarentum they were celebrating games which as it is usual with public spectacles drew together great numbers of people  the little boy straying from his father was taken up by a merchant of epidamnum who carried him into his own country the fathers affliction for the loss of his son was so great that it deprived him of his senses and a few days after of his life  this news being carried to syracuse the grandfather of the two children understanding that one of them was taken away at tarentum and that the father was dead changed the name of his grandson who remained with him and gave him that of his brother that was lost whom he had loved extremely and was desirous of preserving the remembrance of he called him therefore menaechmus a name that was common to himself as well as to the twins  this circumstance i remember very well having heard it proclaimed by the public criers and that you may avoid mistakes i inform you beforehand that these twin brothers have both the same name  but i must now return to epidamnum is there any one among you who has occasion for any thing from that country if there be he needs only to speak and command me freely however he must understand that it will be necessary to give me money to enable me to perform his commission for to give me no money would be a very great folly and to give me money a still greater i return then to the place from whence i came nevertheless i do not budge from this spot  this merchant of epidamnum of whom i have spoken so much and who took away one of the twin brothers had no children but in every thing else he was very rich he adopted therefore the stolen child bred him up as his own son married him to a woman with a large fortune and made a will by which he left him his whole estate one day when he went into the country t rained violently and being obliged to pass a very rapid river not far from the city the force of the stream carried away this ravisher of children and hurried him to the furies in spite of his teeth  behold now the young man established a epidamnum in possession of a great fortune his brother brought up at syracuse is this da arrived at epidamnum with his servant it search of this other brother for this reason the city of epidamnum will be the scene of this comedy when we play another the scene also shall be changed for you know the subjects are not always the same sometimes we play a merchant of slaves sometimes a young debauchee sometimes a poor man a beggar a king a parasite or a fortune tellers  the menaechmi of plautus act i scene i peniculus the parasite the name of peniculus which i bear was given me by the young people of the city because when i am at table i know so well how to make it clean thse masters who load their fugitive slaves with chains are in my opinion guilty of great folly for a poor wretch who sees a new evil added to those he suffered before is but the more incited to commit new rogueries and to avoid punishment by flight these people never fail of extricating themselves out of difficulties sometimes they force open the lock with a file sometimes they break the hinges of the door with a stone all the precautions one takes with them are useless the best way to prevent a servant from flying is to attach them to ones self by good nourishment tie these sort of animals to a good rack and give them plenty of provender and take my word for it they will not run away whatever fault they have committed they may be easily guarded if you make use of these chains to retain them the ligaments of the jaws are so pliant that the more they are stretched the closer they may be drawn  for a proof of this i am going to the house of menaechmus to get myself tied in this manner and voluntary submit to a sentence which has been long ago passed upon me menaechmus is a man who not only feeds people well but even gives them a new birth and new life he is the first man in the world for performing wonderful cures he is blessed with a noble appetite himself you would say that each of his repasts is a feast so well he knows how to furnish a table there is nothing to be seen on all sides but pyramids of dishes so that if one wants any thing from the other end of the table one is obliged to raise ones self quite up from the bed to reach it  i have been many days absent from him during which time i have remained shut up at home with my dear little family for i cannot eat or drink any thing that does not cost me very dear therefore i am sometimes obliged to fast for want of money i am now going to visit menaechmus  but his door opens  it is himself who is coming out  scene ii menaechmus of epidamnum peniculus menaechmus to his wife within if you were not foolish and unreasonable

affects thy sense have thou a delicate nose   peniculus ah in such a case i my single self can diire better than the whole college of augurs together   menaechmus well then apply thy nostrils to this robe which i carry under my cloak smell it as thou should well what scent has it why do thou pause   peniculus one must smell the top of a womans habit for it is from that place the nose is affected with a scent one can never get rid of afterward   menaechmus pleasant peniculus smell it here then why do thou turn aside   peniculus not without reason faith   menaechmus what reason what does it smell of  answer me   peniculus it smells of three things at once theft a whore and a sumptuous repast   menaechmus i am going from hence to carry it to erotia my mistress and will order her at the same time to get a supper prepared for herself for thee and me and when we are seated at table we will protract the debauch even till the rising of the morning sta   peniculus you speak like an oracle shall i knock at the door   menaechmus knock  but stay  stay a little   peniculus gods death sir how long will you delay the sublime pleasure of eating and drinking   menaechmus knock then  but knock

moment at the sun i beseech you see how the luster of that glorious luminary is obscured in the presence of this divine person   scene iii erotia peniculus and menaechmus erotia good morrow menaechmus my dearest and most valued lover   peniculus and pray what am i   erotia you are not one of my troop   peniculus treat me at least as a soldier in the corpse de reserve who is in time to fill up the place of another   menaechmus give orders to have every thing made ready for the battle i design to have to day at your house   erotia i shall not fail   menaechmus he and i will drink valiantly in this battle thou shall judge which of us two soldiers shows most courage in emptying the glasses for it belongs to thee as our general to conduct the army consider also with what champion thou will enter the lists this night ah my love how i hate my wife when i look upon thee she becomes insupportable to me   erotia nevertheless you cannot refrain from having something of hers about you nay you even wear her clothes what ornament is this tray that you wear on your body   menaechmus it formerly belonged to my wife but now it is thine my fair one   erotia if you go on at this rate my love you will certainly march at the head of my amorous troop and be preferred to all those to whom i sell my pleasurable nights   peniculus a curtezan when she sees the prey ready to fall into her hands will not give herself time to flatter and caress but if you loved menaechmus madam you would already have snatched away half of his nose with the eagerness of your kisses   menaechmus hold my cloak peniculus while i perform the vow i have made and consecrate these spoils to my goddess   peniculus give it me but before you pull off the robe let us see you dance in it as i do dance i conjure you in the name of the great hercules   menaechmus me do thou bid dance by the said great hercules i believe thou art mad   peniculus if i am mad certainly you are not much wiser however pull off the robe then since you will not dance   menaechmus i have stolen this robe to day but not without exposing myself to great danger hercules in my opinion undertook a less hazardous enterprise when he forced the girdle from hippolita the queen of the amazons then i did in robbing my wife of this habit receive it from my hands my dear erotia it is yours and you deserve it since you are the only woman in the world that has that sweetness and complacency which i expect in the person i love it is thus that those whose hearts are truly subjected ought to make known their tenderness for the beloved object   peniculus yes those who desire to ruin themselves and ride post to the hospital and beggary   menaechmus it is a year since i bought this robe for my wife it cost me four minae   peniculus and so there are four minae thrown away   menaechmus do thou know my charmer what i expect from three   erotia tell me and your will shall be exactly performed   menaechmus give orders then for a great repast to be prepared at thy house there will be only us three do not delay to send to the market for whatever can be found there the most delicate but above all dont forget to have some pigs cheeks a ham a lambs head and hogs puddings and such other delicious meats as may when well seasoned excite a voracious appetite but the business must be done immediately   erotia by fenus there shall be nothing wanting depend upon it you shall have all you desire   menaechmus we will go to the public square we will not stay long and at our return we will seek in the bottle for patience till dinner is ready   erotia return when you please my love you shall find every thing ready   menaechmus let it be done then with all possible diligence  will you come peniculus   peniculus that i will by hercules i will follow you i will accompany you i will watch you carefully i would not leave you a moment for the world what a fool should i be if i did when the fortune of a god awaits me   erotia who is there some of you bid cylindrus my cook come hither  there is not a moment to lose do you hear there   scene iv erotia cylindrus erotia take a basket and some money thou have three crowns have thou not   cylindrus yes madam i have   erotia go then to market and buy provision to make an excellent repast but without prodigality i tell you before hand there are but three   cylindrus with submission madam who are these three   erotia menaechmus his parasite and me   cylindrus you increase the number by seven for the parasite himself will eat a much as eight persons so i reckon there will be ten at table   erotia i have named the guests do you take care of the rest   cylindrus look upon all as already done you may sit down to table when you will   erotia dont trifle away the time   cylindrus i will return in a moment   end of the first act act ii scene i menaechmus sosicles messenion his slave menaechmus in my opinion my dear messenion these seafearing men know no greater pleasure in the world than when after a long voyage they first discover land   messenion with submission sir i think the pleasure is still more sensibly felt by those who after a tedious absence from their own country behold again the well known port and are ready to touch the shore but tell me i beseech you sir what are we come to do here at epidamnum are you resolved to imitate the sea and go round all the islands   menaechmus we are come hither in search of a brother a twin brother whom i look upon as one half of myself   messenion but what do you imagine will be the issue of this search it is now six years since we have wandered on the sea in a vain expectation of finding him we have sailed round all istria spain the country of the massilia and illyria we have overrun all the adriatic sea barbarous greece and all the coasts of italy that are washed by the ocean had we been seeking for a needle in a bundle of hay we should have found it by this time provided it was not invisible in vain do we hope to find a dead man amongst the living for if he were still in being should we not have met with some one ever now who could have given some intelligence of him   menaechmus i am determined never to give over my search till i have found my brother or met with some person who having known him can certainly inform me that he is dead this pining anxiety will then be at an end and i will return to syracuse but till i have that satisfaction while life animates this body i will not cease to wander about the world and seek him every where too sensibly do i feel the force of fraternal affection to quit easily the hope of seeing my brother again   messenion truly sir you desire what can never possibly happen in good faith we would do much better to return home unless you design to write a history of the whole earth   menaechmus no more of these satirical speeches good sir but beware of drawing my anger upon thee and do not imagine thou can oblige me by thy importunities to follow thy impertinent councils   messenion how well sir do you remind me that i am a slave you have said a great deal in very few words nothing could be more clearly expressed nevertheless it cannot prevent me from telling you my thoughts  vouchsafe sir to favor me with a moments attention when i examine our purse when i count the pieces that are in it by my faith sir i find we have not sufficient to maintain us much longer it is light very light by hercules therefore if you do not make haste home it is probable you may soon see it empty and instead of finding your brother you will yourself fall into the jaws of necessity and misery for you must know sir the people of epidamnum practice but little the virtue of hospitality they are a voluptuous people and immoderately addicted to drinking this city is full of slanderers and flatterers men without justice and probity there are here also a great number of courtezans who as it is said are the most alluring and most dangerous of all that ever practiced the trade in a word this city is called epidamnum for this reason that every stranger who enters it is damned   menaechmus it is fit then that i should be cautious and look about me give me my purse   messenion what will you do with it   menaechmus what you have just now said fills me with fear   messenion and what is it you fear pray   menaechmus that you may play me some damned trick in epidamnum for i know thou art a great debauchee messenion and art cursedly fond of women now i am easily excited to anger and in those moments i am no longer master of myself therefore by keeping my money in my own possession i shall guard against two inconveniences thou will not have it in thy power to be guilty of any extravagances and consequently i shall not have any cause to be angry with thee   messenion very well sir there is your purse keep it yourself that i may be as chaste as a vestal and you as peaceable as a lamb   scene ii cylindrus menaechmus sosicles messenion cylindrus i have bought provision sufficient to make an excellent repast for my three guests a repast worthy of my superior skill in cookery but what do i see menaechmus at our door already woe to my poor shoulders the eaters are ready to set down to table before i am returned from market with the victuals that i am to dress for them i must speak to him good morrow mr menaechmus   menaechmus now the gods bless thee fellow do thou know me   cylindrus know you sir a pleasant question by hercules where are your companions   menaechmus my companions whom do thou mean friend   cylindrus your parasite for example   menaechmus my parasite the fellow is certainly mad   messenion did i not tell you sir this city was full of sharpers   menaechmus pray young man who is this parasite thou take of   cylindrus peniculus   messenion cylindrus is surprised at not seeing the parasite peniculus with menaechmus whom he takes for the menaechmus of epidamnum and asks where he is messenion eplies he has it safe in his portmantua the equivocatin is pleasant enough cylindrus speaks of a man messenion affects to believe he means a brush for that intrument was in latin called peniculus from pene or cauda  tail it being generally made of one oh i have it here safe in my portmantua   cylindrus you come in good time sir for dinner i am just returned from the market where i have bought what will make a delicious repast   menaechmus answer me young man at what price do they sell here the white hogs that are destined for sacrifices   cylindrus they are a crown a piece   menaechmus see here is a crown which i will give thee on condition that thou will purchase with it one of those hogs and let it be offered for thy cure for whoever thou art it is certain thou art mad to importune in this manner a man with whom thou art not acquainted   cylindrus i am cylindrus dont you know my name   menaechmus what is thy name to me go about thy business i solemnly declare i know thee not and what is more i do not desire to know thee   cylindrus however sir i have the honor to know you your name is menaechmus i think   menaechmus ay now thou speak like a man in the senses that is indeed my name but where is it thou have seen me before   cylindrus ah mighty well where have i seen yo you who are a lover of erotia my fair mtress   menaechmus by hercules i am not in love with a woman nor do i know who thou art   cylindrus strange how can you say so is it not i who so often fill your glass when you are merry at our house   messenion oh that i had a good cudgel in my hand that i might break the head of this fellow   menaechmus and so you often fill my glass you say i who am but this moment arrived at epidamnum and was never here before in my life   cylindrus is it possible you can with a good conscience deny what i say   menaechmus deny it yes by hercules do i   cylindrus and perhaps you will deny also that that house yonder is not yours and that you do not actually dwell in it   menaechmus may the gods confound all the males and females that dwell in it i say   cylindrus certainly this gentlemans brain is cracked or he would not curse himself in this terrible manner hark sir   menaechmus what would thou   cylindrus take my word for it sir your brain is a little disordered you would do well with that crown you promised me some time ago to buy a hog for an expiatory sacrifice for yourself for by hercules mr menaechmus you are certainly under the influence of an evil spirit to curse thus and sport with the anger of the gods   menaechmus detestable rascal how he plagues me   cylindrus ha faith he is in one of his pleasant humors he often jests and diverts himself with me for provided his wife be not with him he is always in good spirits and rallies incomparably   menaechmus what is that thou say   cylindrus faith i know not what to say you puzzle me so confoundedly here look into this basket if you please sir do you think i have bought provision sufficient for you three will what  have here make a repast good enough for you your parasite and your mistress   menaechmus what parasite what mistress do you talk of fellow   messenion what fury excites thee to torment this gentleman as thou do   cylindrus pray what business have you with me i know not who you are suffer me to speak without being interrupted by you to this gentleman whom i know very well and to whom i have the honor to be known   menaechmus by the temple of pollux fellow thou art mad i know not if thou were always so but at present thou art absolutely mad that is certain   cylindrus good sir jest no longer i beseech you i am going to dress all these good things and put them by an excellent seasoning into a fit state to be devoured i assure you sir all shall be ready in a little time therefore do not go far from the door but walk here near he fumes of the kitchen have you any commands to your venus   menaechmus i command thee to go hang thyself   cylindrus but by hercules i think you would do better to come in and seat yourself at table and drink a few bumpers while i prepare your dinner pray do sir  nay if you will not i cannot help it  i will go in myself and inform madam erotia that you are here perhaps she will prevail upon you to come into the house and divert yourself you will pass your time much better there than here   menaechmus i am at last delivered from this madman by pollux this beginning seems to be no bad proof of what you told me of these impostors of epidamnum   messenion be upon your guard then sir it is absolutely necessary for by what i can understand from this fool the mistress he talks of is certainly a courtezan   menaechmus but how should he know my name i am really surprised at it   messenion by hercules there is nothing surprising in it you are not acquainted with the arts of these courtezans when any foreign vessels arrive they send their slaves to the port to observe the passengers that come ashore when they see a young man who seems fit for their purpose they enquire his name his family and country they accost him flatter and sooth him and draw him so dexterously into their snares that he is lost in love before he enters the city ah sir we are certainly attacked by a pirate vessel of which we have good reason to be afraid   menaechmus by jupiter thy advice seems to be just and reasonable   messenion i shall be convinced that you think so if i see you take all those necessary and prudent measures which may prevent your dashing yourself against this dangerous rock   menaechmus favor me with a moments silence i beseech you the door opens let us see who comes out   messenion with your leave then i will discharge myself of this heavy burden here you rowers who are the feet of your vessels take it to your care   scene iii erotia cylindrus menaechmus socicles messenion eriota speaking to her servants within leave the door open go i do not want your attendance take care to make every thing ready within doors you cylindrus perform your part well and you girls prepare the couches for the table burn the perfumes that my lovers may be dissolved in luxury and ease and nothing may be wanting to complete the voluptuousness of the feast magnificence and pleasures ruin our gallants but enrich us but where is this teizing man who my cook tells me is walking before my door oh i see him the most generous the most agreeable of all my lovers how much am i obliged to him for the presents he is continually bestowing on me i will treat him as i ought with all the distinction due to his merit and give him the preference to all my other lovers it is fit i accost and speak to him first my love what do thou here why do not come into my house thou who art more welcome to it than to thine own nay it is more thine than mine for thou art master both of it and me every thing is ready according to thy order all is prepared every wish shall be gratified dinner is served there is nothing to hinder thee from placing thyself at table   menaechmus to whom does this woman think she is speaking   erotia certainly to you my dear   menaechmus have we ever had the least occasion to speak to each other before pray where did our acquaintance first commence   erotia venus my tutelary deity desirous of making me happy brought thee first in my way thee whom i love more than the whole race of mankind besides and by the temple of castor in preferring thee to all other men i do thee but justice for it is to thy liberalities alone that i am indebted for all the pleasures i enjoy   menaechmus certainly messenion this woman is either mad or her senses much disordered by wine that without knowing me or having ever seen me before she speaks to me as to the best friend she has in the world   messenion did i not foretell all this would happen sir ah i knew it well there is nothing more common here it is the leaves only at present which are falling on you but if we stay here three days longer mark my prediction you will be crushed by the trees themselves the courtezans in this city have a wonderful address a charming dexterity in emptying purses but with your leave i will venture to attack her myself good morrow madam will you permit me to speak a few words to you   erotia very willingly what have you to say to me   messenion i desire much to know where you have been acquainted with this gentleman   erotia here at epidamnum we have been long acquainted   messenion at epidamnum you say you have been long acquainted with him but how in the name of the furies can this be since he but this day arrived at epidamnum and was never here before   erotia pooh this is only to divert yourself we will pursue this jest within come my dear menaechmus let us go into the house we shall be more at our ease there   menaechmus by the temple of pollux this woman knows my name i am astonished how could this happen   messenion the trull has a good nose she has smelt your purse already you should have left it to my care   menaechmus faith thou art in the right i have been guilty of great folly in taking the charge of the money upon myself here take it again and now i shall see whether the purse or my person is the object of her love   erotia come my love let us go in the repast it ready   menaechmus certainly no invitation was ever more agreeable however madam be pleased to accept my thanks for your kind offer and dispense with me from accepting of it   erotia since it is so why did you order a great repast to be prepared   menaechmus i have i ordered it   erotia yes you nothing is more certain than that you ordered a delicate repast for yourself and your parasite   menaechmus what parasite gods death how the woman raves   erotia your parasite peniculus   menaechmus who is this peniculus this sponge this brush to clean shoes   erotia i protest you counterfeit ignorance perfectly well this peniculus then is one who affords you a great deal of amusement this peniculus is in body and soul the same identical person that was with you when you brought me the robe that you had secretly stolen from your wife   menaechmus very convincing by jupiter what will she not invent at last so i have robbed my wife of a robe and presented it to you seriously madam your head is a little touched or like a gelding you sleep standing   erotia what pleasure can you find in making me your jest will you pretend to deny what passed before as many witnesses as are present at this instant   menaechmus explain yourself more clearly what is it that i deny   erotia that you have given me to day a robe of your wifes   menaechmus and that i deny again and will always deny it i never had a wife and thanks to the gods i have none at present i never in my whole life entered any house in epidamnum i never was in the city i have dined in my ship and was but just come on shore when i met you here   erotia oh venus how wretched am i what ship do you speak of   menaechmus a ship made of wood which for a long time has been under sail sails casts anchor is refitted and has received many blows with a hammer it is exactly like the working place of a skinner one stake stands near another   erotia cease to torment me with this idle raillery come in i conjure thee i begin to grow impatient no more of this jest but give me your hand and come in with me   menaechmus believe me madam i am not the person whom you seek you take me for another   erotia do i not know you well are you not menaechmus the son of moschus is it not said that you was born at syracuse in sicily where agathocles reigned after him pinthia then linaro who at his death left the kingdom to hieron who is now upon the throne   menaechmus all this madam is very true   messenion oh jupiter this woman certainly came from your country she knows you so perfectly   menaechmus by hercules i cannot contradict or refuse her any longer   messenion ah sir what do i hear take care how you give way to this inclination if you once enter her house you are a lost man   menaechmus i will not let so favorable an occasion escape me be silent then i command thee i am resolved to acquiese in all she says there is no great matter in lying a little when it will procure me a good inn where the entertainment shall cost me nothing madam i have opposed every thing you said a long time but it was through fear that my servant would discover the affair of the robe and repast to my wife now if you please i will go in with you   erotia i am satisfied and pardon you for your malice in tormenting me thus long but tell me do you wait here for your parasite   menaechmus i do not wait for him i have no inclination to see him and if he comes i should be glad you would not permit him to enter   erotia by venus i will obey you willingly but i have one favor to entreat of you   menaechmus speak my queen command me freely what is it you would have me do   erotia i would have this fine robe you have given me carried to the workman to be made fit for my shape and to have some little ornaments of my own taste and invention added to it   menaechmus by hercules the design is excellent go my dear i see you dont want prudence the robe will by this means appear entirely new and if even my wife should see it she will not be able to know it again   erotia oblige me then by taking it to the workman yourself when you go from hence you promise me to do so dont you my love   menaechmus look upon it as already done i give thee my word of love to perform it   erotia let us go in then   menaechmus do then step in my fair i will follow thee immediately i must speak one word to my servant messenion  come hither   messenion your pleasure sir   menaechmus softly i have a desire to know   messenion what   menaechmus i must   messenion what must you   menaechmus the business is begun   messenion what business   menaechmus well well i know thou would be giving me advice   messenion and i know you value it but little   menaechmus the beast is taken i tell thee i hold my prey in my hand how dexterously have i managed her i am going to give a loose to mirth in the mean time thou and thy companions go to some inn and before night return and fetch me   messenion ah sir you know not these courtezans believe me you would do much better to follow my council   menaechmus be silent i say to thee if i am guilty of any folly it is my self that will suffer this is no business of thine by what i have observed this woman is very silly and easily imposed upon it is she and not i that will be the dupe   messenion ah i die he is lost   menaechmus why do thou not go   messenion i fly sir ah my master is plunging himself into an abyss from whence he will never come out it is so the pirates vessel carries off our barque at last but i am a fool to pretend to govern my master  have i forgot my duty he bought me for his slave not for his governor let me remember that follow me boys i must come back in good time to fetch my master   end of the second act act iii scene i peniculus during these thirty years which i have lived i have never been guilty of so wicked so unhappy an action as this day my cruel destiny led me into an assembly where while i lost my time in gaping and staring about me menaechmus escaped me ah without doubt he is gone to the house of his mistress and was not willing that i should accompany him and be a witness of his pleasures may the gods pour down their fiercest wrath upon him who first introduced assemblies and thereby hindered people who have important affairs upon their hands from pursuing their business assemblies ought only to be composed of indolent and idle persons such ought to be summoned to appear and when they dont obey be punished by large fines a great many of the inhabitants of this city eat always alone and in private citizens wholly useless to their country who have never performed the least service to the commonwealth mean sordid wretches that invite no person to their table and are never invited to others such as these ought regularly to assist at assemblies and public meetings  if this excellent order this useful custom had been observed i should not to day have had the misfortune of losing so plentiful and delicious a repast for i am as well assured that menaechmus had once a design to treat me this day as i am among the number of the living however i will go to him as late as it is i have always hopes of finding some remains of the feast this thought alone consoles me and raises my depressed spirits but is not that menaechmus himself that i see he is coming out with a crown of flowers on his head ah miserable that i am the feast is finished they are risen from table by all the furies i am come too late   scene ii menaechmus sosicles peniculus menaechmus if i bring you back to day your robe fitted to your shape and adorned as you desire will you be contented my charmer i will have it done in such a manner that you yourself shall not be able to know it again   peniculus so so he is going to carry the robe to the workman after having filled himself well with meat and wine without giving the poor parasite his share by hercules i will forfeit my illustrious name i will cease to be myself rather than not demand the cause of this affront and gratify my vengeance on the author of it here will i watch the motions of my new enemy and when i have penetrated into his designs i will accost him and have a conference with him   menaechmus ye gods who cannot die although sometimes ye desire death immortal gods is there a man in the world on whom in one day you have conferred so many benefits and who expected them so little i have eaten of most delicious fare i have drank plentifully and what is still better i have possessed a charming courtezan and to complete my good fortune i carry away with me a rich robe which erotia would have done well to have given me to remember her by for by the faith of an honest man she shall never see it again   peniculus how securely the gentleman disburthens his heart of its gaiety and now that his belly is full without doubt he diverts himself at my expense and laughs in his sleeve at the fast i have kept while he was indulging himself over his good cheer   menaechmus she pretends that i have given her this fine robe and that i stole it from my wife i would not undeceive her but began to flatter and caress her as if i had been the most passionate of her lovers i agreed to all she said answered yes or no as she pleased

such daring injustice for can you deny that a share of this feast was not my lawful inheritance   menaechmus what is the meaning of this outrage young man what business have you ever had with me and why do you load with such injurious reproaches a man entirely unknown to you do you want to oblige me to pay you for the ill names you have called me with as many good blows with my cudgel   peniculus

have no acquaintance with you but whoever you are for your own sake cease your injurious language and torment me no longer with your mistaken reproaches   peniculus dare you thus confidently deny that

epidamnum peniculus the parasite wife how can i think of living with a husband who robs me of my clothes to present to his mistress   peniculus in the name of jupiter madam make no noise you will spoil all if you will be directed by me you shall surprise this unfaithful husband in the very fact come this way i beseech you your husband has drank plentifully and intoxicated as he is he would not neglect carrying the robe he robbed you of to day to the workman he had a festal crown upon his head ha what do i see here the very same crown by hercules now i hope you do not doubt me he has

revenged   wife your advice is very good i shall follow it and truly i dont need many persuasions to it   peniculus let us retire this way a little we will rush out upon him at once and surprise him   scene ii menaechmus of epidamnum his wife and peniculus menaechmus we have a custom here that is no less foolish than troublesome and yet the wisest and best of us continue to observe it exactly we are extremely desirous of having a great number of dependants and of being perpetually solicited by clients but never give ourselves the trouble to enquire whether they are good or bad we never concern ourselves about their probity their integrity or the merit of their cause all we desire to know is if they are rich if the client is poor though his behavior be ever so unexceptionable yet he passes for a man who has very bad principles if he be rich however wicked and base his life and manners yet we extol him for a man of great virtue there are some who regard neither law or equity who are continually persecuting their patrons who deny to have received what has been given them and who having acquired large fortunes by usury and swearing falsely delight in continually involving themselves and others in lawsuits when they have determined on a day to have their causes pleaded they acquaint their advocates or patrons with it and whatever crimes they have committed they must defend them whether the cause be pleaded before the people before the praetor or before the judge  a client of this sort has been the cause of all my mortification to day he disappointed me in all my designs and robbed me of those hours i had resolved to dedicate to pleasure i have pleaded for him before the ediles and after a great deal of wicked disputation i offered the adverse party conditions equally cruel and unjust and mindful of my disappointment went no farther in my pleading than what was just necessary to form an engagement upon the pleaders on both sides were obliged to lay down a certain sum of money which each party looked upon as the reward of victory this money was called a fine because it was the designed punishment of a lawsuit unjustly undertaken  well what did my client why he gave security i protest i never saw a man so clearly so manifestly convicted the crimes he was accused of were proved upon him by three witnesses may all the gods punish him for the voluptuous hours he has made me lose this day and may heaven chastise me also for my folly in going to the assembly and depriving myself of a delicious day  i ordered a good repast to be prepared and i know my mistress waits for me with great impatience i could not help this delay i left the assembly as soon as possible i do not doubt but erotia will be extremely offended but she will be appeased by reflecting on the fine robe i stole from my wife to present to her   peniculus do you hear is it i that have made him confess this villainy what do you say to this   wife i say that i am very unhappy in a husband   peniculus but did you understand what he said   wife too well oh gods too well   menaechmus if i act wisely i shall certainly go in here where i shall be more at my ease than at home and swim in luxury and pleasure   wife stay wretch for this time i will disappoint you detection and shame have overtaken you thou shall pay back with interest the robe you have robbed me of this is the consequence of such liberalities were you such a fool as to imagine such crimes could be long concealed or committed with impunity   menaechmus what do you mean wife what is the matter   wife excessive assurance dare you ask me what is the matter   menaechmus would you have me ask this man then   peniculus no coaxing  it will signify nothing go on madam maintain your rights as you ought   menaechmus what cause have i given you peniculus to treat me so ill   wife you ought to know   peniculus he is not ignorant of the reason i have to cmplain of him but the wicked wretch pretends to know nothing about it   menaechmus but come explain this business to me   wife the robe   menaechmus what robe   wife who was it that carried away my robe   peniculus what are you afraid sir   menaechmus yes faith of one thing i confess this robe makes me tremble   peniculus it is your turn now i trembled heaven knows while you eat in my absence that exquisite repast to which you had invited me go on madam do not spare this perfidious husband let him feel the violence of your resentment   menaechmus will thou not be silent ungrateful as thou art   peniculus no by hercules i will not be silent he makes signs to me to say nothing   menaechmus by hercules thou lvest i made no sign either with my head or eyes   wife how unhappy how miserable am i   menaechmus in what are you unhappy tell me madam   peniculus this man has not his equal for impudence in the whole world with what confidence he denies a thing as clear as the sun   menaechmus i swear to thee wife by jupiter and all the immortal gods i did not make any sign to this fellow are you satisfied   peniculus you need not take much pains to persuade her to believe that stay stay sir we have not done with you yet pray come back   menaechmus come back for what   peniculus in my opinion you cannot do better than to go to the embroiderer and bring back the robe this is all you have for it now   menaechmus what robe is it that you both stun my ears with thus   wife what have i to do but be silent since he pretends to have forgot this disgraceful action   menaechmus have any of my slaves offended thee wife i know servants often answer saucily and it is difficult to govern them but you need only complain to me and i will chastise them severely i will make them observe their duty   peniculus you are merry sir   menaechmus you seem to labor with some violent uneasiness wife sorrow is painted on your face tell me the cause   peniculus you mock her certainly   menaechmus has any of the family offended her   peniculus you are pleasant you turn her into ridicule   menaechmus is it with me then that she is angry   peniculus aye now you speak seriously   menaechmus by pollux i never did her the least injury   peniculus now you begin to rally again   menaechmus tell me my dear wife what is the cause of your uneasiness   peniculus he begins to flatter now beware of him   menaechmus mischievous fellow cannot you hold your tongue it is your business to be neuter here i say nothing to you why then do you torment me   wife let my hand alone keep your caresses for your mistress   peniculus mind that sir another time make haste to devour the feast in my absence and afterward laugh at me insult me and throw your crown of flowers on the ground when you have eaten and drank plentifully   menaechmus what do thou mean i have not eaten to day i am yet fasting nor have i been with erotia since i parted from her with you   peniculus dare you deny it   menaechmus yes by hercules i dare and will maintain that your reproaches are as false as hell   peniculus most impudent of men did i not see you a moment ago come out of erotias house with a festal crown upon your head did you not treat me like a fool or a madman swear you knew me not and that you only this day arrived at epidamnum   menaechmus how is it possible i should have had this strange conversation with you since i have never seen you since we parted at the assembly till this moment   peniculus ah i know the very bottom of your heart you did not think i was capable of taking a severe revenge for the injury you did me but by hercules you was deceived for i have told all to your wife   menaechmus how what is it thou have told her   peniculus i have forgot take the trouble to ask her   menaechmus it is well rascal my dear wife what is it this rogue of a parasite has told you tell me why are you silent speak freely open your heart to me without disguise   wife as if you knew not the cause of my grief my rich robe is stolen from me   menaechmus is it possible your rich robe stolen say you what news is this you tell me   wife ought you to be surprised at this news   menaechmus if i knew how it happened i would procure you satisfaction   peniculus with what assurance he dissembles and pretends ignorance of the fact but it is all to no purpose your roguery cannot be concealed for by hercules i who know it have discovered all to your wife   menaechmus what have you discovered   wife since you have lost all shame and are resolved to persist in your falsehood hear me wretch i will tell you the cause of my uneasiness and what your parasite has informed me of my robe is stolen out of my house   menaechmus but seriously have you been robbed of a robe   peniculus subtle wretch how he equivocates the robe

villainous action but who is this menaechmus   wife yourself   menaechmus me me do you say   wife yes you i say   menaechmus who is my accuser   wife myself   peniculus and i also nay more i will prove that you stole away the robe to carry it to your mistress erotia   menaechmus i have i given a robe to any one   peniculus you you no other than you must we bring an owl hither to scream out you without ceasing in your ears your wife and i are fatigued with repeating this word so often   menaechmus i swear to you wife by jupiter and all the gods sure this will satisfy you that i have not given away your robe   peniculus and we swear to you by hercules that we do not lie   menaechmus then you know that i have not given away the robe i have only lent it for a little time upon condition that when the person who borrowed has made use of it once it shall be returned immediately   wife by the temple of castor i never lend any of your coats or cloaks to any person whatever it belongs to me only to lend my clothes and to you to do what you please with your own   menaechmus dont be uneasy your robe shall be brought back to you i will take that trouble upon myself   wife it will be your interest to do so for depend upon it if you do not bring back my robe you shall never come into my house again   menaechmus how will you shut my own doors upon me will you presume to banish me from my own house   peniculus but pray madam what reward will you bestow upon me for informing you of this roguery   wife when such an accident happens to you i will do you the same service you have done me   peniculus by the temple of pollux i am in no danger of such an accident happening to me for i have nothing to lose may the gods confound the husband and wife both i say what can i do now i must even go to the public square and see if i can fasten upon any body who will give me a meal for i have nothing more to expect from this ungrateful family   manaechmus so my better half imagines she has mortified me extremely by banishing me from home fool as if i had not another place to go to where i shall pass my time more agreeably than with a scolding wife if my wife is offended i have the consolation to think that my erotia will receive me with open arms she will not banish me from her no she will welcome me with transport  i will go to her immediately and entreat her to give me back this cursed robe which has occasioned so much noise and i will buy her a better hollo who is there what neither porter nor portress open the door i say and tell your mistress i am here   scene iii

to keep my mouth shut pray   wife dare you ask that question insolent shameless most wicked of all mortals   menaechmus hum  pray madam have you read history enough to know why the greeks called queen hecuba a bitch   wife not i    menaechmus because misfortunes having deprived this old princess of her senses she talked in the manner you do now and loaded every person she saw with abuse twas with justice therefore that the greeks gave her the appellation of bitch   wife it is absolutely impossible to bear with your irregularities any longer i would much rather choose to live like a widow the remainder of my days than with a husband that abandons himself to such monstrous excesses   menaechmus if you have resolution enough to live without man and abandon your spouse what is that to me pray is it the custom in epidamnum for women of distinction to fasten upon strangers just arrived and acquaint them with the secrets of their families   wife yes i repeat it our union shall be dissolved i would rather pass my days in the most rigid chastity than suffer any longer your horrible disorders   menaechmus by hercules with all my heart live a widow to eternity you have my free consent   wife but dare you insolent that you are dare you deny that you stole my robe when at this moment you wear it on your body as an ornament wretch how could you be guilty of such an action without blushing or rather without being ready to expire with shame   menaechmus by hercules madam this is past bearing and all the respect i owe your sex cannot hinder me from telling you that you are as bold as wicked to charge me with having robbed you of this robe when it was given me by a woman whom i believe you never saw to get altered for her   wife ah this is too much  they will make me desperate by castor i will send for my father and give him an exact account of your fine behavior who is there one of you go to my father and tell him i beg to see him immediately upon an affair of consequence now sir your debaucheries shall be all exposed i will paint you in your proper colors   menaechmus are you crazy mistress what debaucheries am i guilty of pray   wife when you rob me who am your wife and a too too faithful one for such a husband when you rob me i say of my clothes and jewels and give them publicly to your whore can you wonder that i complain of such treatment   menaechmus in the name of hercules madam i beseech you tell me if you can is there any drug any potion that if i drank would give me spirits to support your amazing boldness i would fain know who you take me for for my part i declare i know you not nor ever saw you before   wife though you divert yourself with turning me into ridicule yet sure you will have some consideration some respect for my father whom i have sent for ha here he comes look on him know you this venerable old man sir   menaechmus just as well as the prophet calchus i tell you this is the first time i ever saw him   wife wretch will thou deny that thou know me or my father   menaechmus yes by hercules and your grandfather also   wife amazing impudence   scene ii the old man fatherinlaw of menaechmus of epidamnum the wife of the same and menaechmus sosicles old man i am going to my daughters house as fast as my great age will permit me but well i know this walk will be very difficult for every step is slower than the former i sink under the weight of years and drag a heavy body which my limbs are hardly able to support my strength is almost gone i carry my years on my back like bad merchandise for this wicked old age whenever it comes brings with it a great many followers a crowd of inconveniences and natural defects in short old age is subject to so many miseries that if i undertook to recount them i should die before the detail was ended but besides the pain of being old which is not small i am assaulted by a new affliction that touches me sensibly my daughter has sent for me in a violent hurry she entreats that i will come immediately what can be the occasion of this message what accident has happened my imagination represents a thousand different things to me all equally tormenting  but what i am most surprised at is that my daughter has sent only a general message which gives me no light into the affair ah she would have done better to have spared me this anxiety by informing me exactly what the business is mean time i conjecture i divine and i am much deceived if i am not right some new family storm some domestic hurricane has occasioned this message women who bring large portions to their husbands expect to make them wear the yoke these women i say are generally very bad and if the poor husband endeavors but ever so little to maintain his right of superiority the house will be always full of noise the husbands indeed often abuse their power and then it is they who are in the wrong to render the conjugal state happy it is necessary that the authority of the husband ought to be exerted with prudence and the submission of the wife be bounded by reason by pollux it certainly is not for any trivial matter that my drughter has sent for me it is something of consequence but whatever it is i shall know presently ha do i not see this couple before the door of their house the husband has a discontented air his uneasiness is painted in his countenance how well have i guessed they are quarrelling ah i am seldom deceived i must begin my interposition by first speaking to the wife   wife my dear father   old man how do you my daughter am i welcome what good news have you for me but you look sad what is the cause why does your husband look so angrily on you you have certainly had a battle between you at least with your tongues tell me truly daughter which of you two is most in fault and merits most the paternal censure tell me in few words all i ought to be acquainted with either as judge or mediator   wife i must first assure you my dear father that i am guilty of no fault you may rely absolutely upon this testimony of my innocence though given by myself but at the same time father i declare to you that it is impossible for me to live any longer here i therefore conjure you to separate me from this man and take me home to you again   old man what is this i hear have you reasons sufficient to induce you to make me this demand   wife i am slighted i am despised and am obliged to bear the most cruel the most shocking indignities   old man who is it that treats you so unworthily   wife that man there who promised you to love me and make me happpy him who bears the name of husband to me and oh more wretched me whose wife i too certainly am   old man how often have i warned you my daughter to exert all your prudence in avoiding quarrels that neither your husband or you might have any occasion to make me complaints   wife but how can i obey you in this my father you suppose the thing possible but i swear to you solemnly it is not   old man is it to me you address yourself   wife yes if you will have the goodness to hear me   old man alas how many times have i recommended it to you daughter to conform to the will of your husband you ought never to observe where he goes or what he does or endeavor to pry into his diversions or intrigues   wife but he is in love with a professed courtezan who lives in our neighborhood   old man is he so faith i like him the better for it and to reward you for your diligence in discovering this intrigue i will do my best to forward it and engage your spouse in new gallantries   wife but alas sir his debaucheries are not confined to women alone he drinks there to excess and buries himself in voluptuousness in this infamous brothel   old man what is it to you where he drinks how far will you carry your insolence why do you not forbid him to go abroad or to invite any person to his table do you expect that husbands will relinquish their authority and take pleasure in serving their wives and becoming slaves to their unreasonable wills you might with equal justice expect your husband to sit amongst your maids and spin   wife alas father you did not come i find to be my patron my message has procured a good advocate for my husband you are here indeed at my request but you plead only against me   old man if your husband is faulty i declare myself against him and i shall condemn him more severely than i have done you from his advocate i shall become his accuser but since i find that he supplies you with every thing you want and maintains you in elegance and splendour in my opinion a woman of sense ought to be contented with these proofs of affection and endeavor to merit them by sweetness and complacency   wife ah father i have only told you the slightest of his faults  would you think it  this kind husband opens my cabinets takes away my clothes my gold my jewels to enrich and adorn his whore   old man oh if he does so he does very ill but on the other side if this should be a falsehood a calumny you are guilty of a most enormous crime in thus aspersing the innocence of your spouse   wife i can give you an immediate proof of the truth of what i say at this instant he has a robe and bracelet of mine about him he had given them to his mistress but finding i had discovered his baseness he brought back his booty apparently through shame and necessity   old man i will know from himself the bottom of this affair i will accost him and give him audience in his turn as a good and impartial judge is obliged to do your servant soninlaw i would fain know the occasion of your uneasiness you seem to be angry with your wife what is the subject of your dispute pray tell me   menaechmus good man whoever you are i take jupiter and all the gods to witness    old man upon what account why do you thus invoke the inhabitants of heaven   menaechmus i swear by jupiter and all his court that i have not offered the least injury whatever to this woman here she accuses me of no less than robbing her of a robe and this supposed crime is so strongly impressed on her imagination that she is ready to swear i am guilty of it but i beseech you sir take notice of what i am going to say if ever i was within the house of this lady i wish i may become the most miserable of all mortals   old man what do you say menaechmus are you mad can any thing be more extravagant than such a wish you swear you have never been within her house and yet it is there that you dwell surely this is a very wild and ridiculous sally   menaechmus and do you really say sir that i actually dwell in this house here   old man and do you sir dare to deny it   menaechmus yes by hercules and i will maintain it   wife then you will maintain a falsehood with the highest degree

the forest do thou call me to the chase i hear thy voice and would obey but cannot get loose from this place a furious woman like an enraged bitch seizes me on the left side and on the other an old man that stinks like a goat a man that made the innocent perish by bearing false witness against them   old man perish thyself thou abominable liar   menaechmus ha i hear apollo from the depth of his sanctuary he commands me to burn out the eyes of this wicked old man with two flaming flambeaux   wife alas my father we are lost he threatens to burn out our eyes   menaechmus have i not cause to complain they will have it that i am mad yet certainly they themselves have lost the use of their reason if ever they had any which indeed is much to be doubted   old man daughter a word with you   wife what shall we do father in this new disress   old man the best thing we can do i believe is to get some slaves to bind this madman and then carry him into the house where he may be confined before he commits greater disorders   menaechmus ha will you so faith i believe this will prove a scurvy jest after all if i dont extricate myself quickly out of their hands they will certainly carry me into the house and make me a prisoner  again i hear the voice of apollo he commands me not to spare my nails but to make a dreadful havoc in the face of this old man unless he goes away immediately to hang himself  yes great divinity you shall be obeyed nor will i fail to exercise the vigor of my arms upon the face of the woman also   old man fly fly my daughter secure yourself in the house i am afraid this madman will strike you   wife i go but oh my father take care that he does not escape alas unhappy woman that i am to see my husband in this miserable condition   menaechmus good i have succeeded in sending the fury hence i must now also put to flight this old wretch this long beard this tithon this shivering body this son of cignus with his white head great apollo you command me to bruise his sides to break his bones to crush his members and that with the very same stick which he carries in his hand to support his tottering steps with   old man stay where you are madman advance

take a saw with two edges i will grind his bones i will rip up his belly and cut his entrails to pieces   old man i must be upon my guard he keeps his eyes fixed upon me he has a menacing air he will certainly rush upon my poor skeleton and do me a mischief   menaechmus how many orders you give me at one time divine apollo what shall i do first ha thou say i must take a set of untamed furious horses and ascend a car to hunt this lion of getulia this stinking lion without teeth it is done  i am already mounted on the car i press the seat one hand grasps the reins the other holds aloft my weapon come on then my brave my valiant horses now show your swiftness your vigor and your courage make known your fire by the rapidity of your course let your steps be winged with lightning let the earth resound with the thunder of your hoofs   old man what do you threaten to tear me in pieces with your horses and to drive your car over my body   menaechmus again i feel the inspiring god he bids me spring upon that man and murder him ha who is the presumptuous wretch that dares to hold my horses and stop my car whoever he be he opposes the execution of your sentence great god he cancels the decree of apollo   old man alas this is indeed a dreadful disease immortal gods deign to have pity on us how has this horrible accident happened to him my soninlaw was once wise and discreet and all of a sudden his brain is distempered this misfortune requires a speedy remedy i must make haste and get a physician immediately   scene iii menaechmus sosicles menaechmus so i am at last delivered from these pleasant people who are determined to believe me mad and yet i am very certain that i am perfectly well but now that i am safe now that i am delivered from my persecutors what hinders me from making haste to my ship gentlemen grant me one favor if you please if the old man should return i entreat ye all and there is really a good number of you i entreat ye all i say not to tell him which way i have taken   scene iv old man i have sat so long that my back aches with anxiously waiting till the doctor returned from visiting his patients at last having finished his sick rounds the hateful fellow comes home he must be a man of eminent knowledge of an almost supernatural skill in his profession he recounts as two of his greatest exploits the having set the thigh of esculapius and the arm of apollo two admirable cures it must be confessed without the assistance of this wonderful operator the god of medicine himself would have had occasion for crutches and the glorious apollo for an arm of silver i really know not at present whether this man ought to be called a physician or a mechanic for if he has cured two divinities there cannot be a more glorious testimony of his skill or a greater honor for his profession but if he has only refitted two broken statues the exploit is not very extraordinary here he comes a most grave and comely personage how majestically slow he walks he is indeed a very admirable man   scene v physician old man physician you were speaking to me about the sickness of your soninlaw explain it to me now with more clearness let me know all the symptoms what is the disease that he is afflicted with is he tormented by phantoms specter or hobgoblins has he the distemper of the goddess ceres upon him conceal nothing is he lethargick hydropical or consumptive it is necessary that the physician should be told every thing   old man it is just the contrary mr doctor for i desired you to come hither in order to be informed by you what distemper my soninlaw is afflicted with and also with a hope of having him restored to health by your assistance   physician nothing is less difficult believe me good man your labor will not be in vain i promise you upon the faith of a physician that your soninlaw shall be cured from this day   old man i would have him treated with all imaginable care and nothing spared which may contribute toward the reestablishment of his health   physician do not you trouble yourself i will labor upon the patient with an indefatigable application i will fatigue myself so much with my endeavors to restore him that i will sigh six hundred times a day through weariness   old man hold sir there is your patient coming toward us   physician softly let us observe him let us see a little what he will do   scene vi menaechmus of epidamnum the old man his fatherinlaw and the physician menaechmus by pollux i certainly rose to day under a malignant influence a miserable day has it been to me this rascally parasite has discovered all my secrets this rogue this monster of ingratitude has in a moment plunged me into infamy and fear him who was my ulysses to whom i entrusted all my designs the guide and executioner of all my schemes he has betrayed his agamemnon and by his perfidy drawn me out of a most sweet and happy situation if i live i will take away his life but i talk like a fool is it not from my benevolence that he holds his life is he not supported by my wealth would he not have perished a hundred times by hunger but for me it is thus then that i will take away his life i will deprive him of my assistance as for this whore she maintains very well the honor of her character she does nothing unworthy her honest profession i entreated her to return me the robe that i might pacify my wife with it mark her extreme cunning and the lie she invented immediately to keep it she swears to me that she gave it me some hours ago  is it possible to carry impudence farther than this alas it must be confessed i am extremely miserable   old man do you hear what he says   physician he deplores his unhappiness   old man be so good to accost him   physician mr menaechmus your servant pray why do you stretch yourself thus you are not sensible of the hurt it does you this extension of your arms increases the violence of your distemper   menaechmus what does this quack mean go hang thyself with thy doctorial visions   physician do you feel any thing   menaechmus why should i not feel i have all my five senses   physician it will cost more than an acre of helebore to cure this head but let us try him again well sir what good news can you tell us   menaechmus what would you have me to tell you   physician answer precisely to the question i ask you is the wine you commonly drink white or red   menaechmus may the furies carry thee away with thy impertinent curiosity   physician by hercules his madness begins to seize him he grows wild   menaechmus why do you not ask me whether the bread i generally eat is purple red or yellow or enquire if the birds which are served up to my table have scales or the fish wings   old man good gods what extravagancies he utters do you not mark him doctor haste then and make him swallow some salutary potion before his distemper increases and he becomes quite furious   physician have patience be silent i want to interrogate him a little longer   old man aye aye according to the laudable customs of your art you murder the poor patients with the gravity of your nonsensical speeches   physician tell me do not you feel your eyes grow hard   menaechmus do you take me for a grasshopper   physician dont you perceive that your bowels make a great noise   menaechmus wh  bell is full my bowels are very peacea d sleep profoundly but when i  they growl horribly   physician this answer is wide from the purpose it denotes a distempered brain when you are in bd do you sleep easily are not your slumbers unquiet and interrupted do you generally sleep till day   menaechmus i always sleep well but when my mind is disturbed by the fear of some importunate creditor but may jupiter and all the gods confound thee thou eternal questioner when will thou have done   physician oh oh our man begins to grow furious these words alone ought to be sufficient to make you be on your guard   old man you are mistaken he is calmer at present and less abusive than he has been since his senses were first disordered it is not long since he called his wife an enraged bitch   menaechmus by your leave pray when did i use such a word   old man i say you are mad my friend quite mad and fit for chains   menaechmus how mad am i mad   old man yes you have you not threatened to crush me under the wheels of your chariot had i not heard your extravagancies with my own ears i would not thus freely have called you mad   menaechmus and with the same certainty i know that you have stolen the sacred crown of jupiter and that for this horrible sacrilege you was thrown into prison from whence you are now taken out to be hanged i know also that you have stabbed your father and sold your mother for a slave well fatherinlaw do i speak now like a man in my senses is it not fit to answer calumny with calumny and false imputations with others as false and more attrocious   old man doctor i conjure you lose no time what you are to do do quickly see you not how he is transported   physician the best thing you can do is to send the patient to my house   old man is this your opinion   physician certainly he will then be wholly under my care and i may treat his distemper my own way   old man do what you think most proper to be done   physician come mr menaechmus come along with me i will regale you well for these twenty days to come you shall drink nothing but helebore is not that fine   menaechmus rascal i will cut thy throat   physician come venerable father let us go and get some people to carry him to my house   old man how many are necessary   physician his distemper is so violent at present that no fewer than four lusty strong fellows will be necessary to carry him away   old man they shall be here in a moment mean time good mr esculapius watch your patient carefully dont let him escape   physician i watch him excuse me sir i have very urgent business nay you know i am obliged to go home and give the necessary orders for his reception go go send the slaves hither and let them bring him to my house immediately   old man he shall be there as soon as you   physician i will be gone then   old man adieu   scene vii menaechmus of epidamnum alone so they are gone my fatherinlaw and the physician and i am at last delivered from their hands great jupiter what adventure is to follow those which have happened to me this day they declare publicly here that i am mad it passes for certain so there is the reputation and honor of my poor brain dead and buried but how can this be for i am very sure that since my first entrance into life i have never been seized with any symptoms of this distemper is this black suspicion owing to malice or mistake it is strange it is unaccountable surely i am not mad i neither insult quarrel with or strike any persons that come in my way my mind is calm my thoughts are reasonable my behavior is not different from other people when i speak to them they reply when they speak to me i answer them again and with as much judgment as ever i did before it is not i then that am mad but those who reproach me with madness have their own brains cracked people that labor under such disorders suspect others to be what they are themselves  but this is not all that afflicts me for how shall i dispose of myself at present to which side shall i turn i dare not attempt to get into my own house for my lamb of a wife will refuse me entrance and from my mistress nothing is to be expected her door is shut against me no one will venture to introduce me we are upon such bad terms with each other  i have no other resource but to wait here for the approach of night my wife perhaps may be then seized with compassion and will permit me to take part of her bed  scene viii messenion the merit of a good slave consists in taking great care of his masters substance in laying it out wisely in being attentive to his interests in short a good slave should in his masters absence manage his money in the same manner as if he was present or rather with more circumspection  a wise domestic will always consider his shoulders more than his mouth he will think it more necessary to provide for the ease of his legs than for the filling his belly and have the reward he expects from his master continually before his eyes but what is the reward that a wicked idle slave has reason to hope for in what coin is he paid why with heavy stripes fetters grinding in mills cruel fatigues ravenous hunger and perishing cold these are the natural consequences of disobedience and guilt  as for me i am a declared enemy to all these things there is not one of them convenient not one that suits my taste or does not put me into a horrible fear it is for this reason that i am firmly resolved to be good for something and always prefer good service to bad i am not moved by harsh language or reproaches however undeserved for after all they are only words and words strike nothing but the air but as for blows your humble servant i am not for them i hate them mortally the impression they make is a little too strong  i must confess also that i eat much more willingly what the labors of others supply me with than my own bread made with flower of my grinding would taste very bitter but it goes down very pleasantly when done by the fatigue of my comrades therefore i am always ready to obey my masters commands i execute his orders punctually i serve him with diligence and alacrity and i find myself in a very happy situation with these my servile maxims  those slaves who because of their good behavior have nothing to fear and yet are naturally timid those slaves i say are generally most useful to their masters on the contrary those who are bold determined and arrogant are the greatest tremblers in the world when by their faults they have drawn the indignation of their masters upon them  thanks to the gods i have no reason to be afraid my master will in a little time reward me for my faithful service in the mean time this is my governing principle to do always what is most for the ease of my back  after having secured my masters servants and baggage in the inn as he commanded me i came back to wait his orders it is fit i knock at the door that he might be informed that i am here oh that i may be so happy as to see him come out safe and sound from this damned house but i fear i am come too late and that it will be after death the physician   scene ix the old man menaechmus of epidamnum slaves messenion old man to the slaves i conjure you by the gods and by men not to neglect any of my orders carry him immediately to the physicians house i have commanded you to do it and i now repeat my command obey then as you ought unless your backs and your thighs are of little consideration to you do not be frighted from your duty by his menaces  well why do you stand still why fix yourselves like statues in one posture is it thus you obey my orders you ought already to have laid him across your shoulders make haste i will go before you to the physicians   menaechmus i am undone what can this mean rascals why do you fall upon me what do you want why do you surround me thus voracious birds of prey whither do you want to convey me  ah i am ruined help dear fellowcitizens of epidamnum  i implore your relief hasten to my assistance and deliver me from these bloodhounds   messenion immortal gods what do i see oh misery my master my good master treated with the vilest indignity by all the furies they want to carry him away by force   menaechmus ah what brave man will have courage enough to embrace my interests and undertake my defense   messenion i will my dear master i will defend you while i have one drop of blood remaining oh wicked attempt oh execrable villainy ye citizens of epidamnum will ye suffer an honest free stranger to be treated like a slave and a criminal in the midst of your streets and in a city that is at peace with all the world can any thing dishonor you more be gone ye ministers of perfidy and violence and release the innocent whom you oppress   menaechmus generous unknown whoever you are i earnestly implore your assistance do not let me suffer so cruel and so public an affront   messenion yes sir i will assist you my arm and my life are at your service i will not suffer you to be injured if one of us must perish it is just that that i should be the person courage then master strike out i beseech you the eye of this rogue that holds you by the neck as for me i will deal my blows plentifully amongst these other gentlemen here by hercules villains you shall repent your having undertaken this task to day once more rascals will you leave my master at liberty   menaechmus by pluto i have got this rogues eye in my hand   messenion good very good he has something to remember you by off off ye robbers murderers villains   slaves mercy for the love of the great hercules mercy   messenion leave this gentleman then   menaechmus strike strike have no compassion on them who had the insolence to seize me   messenion if you would have me spare you fly leave this place be gone this instant and may the gods punish ye villains as ye deserve how what makes you lag behind your fellows there take that for being the hindmost by hercules a good blow thy face is in admirable order and now i am satisfied my work is done faith sir i came in good time you began to want my assistance   menaechmus may the gods be favorable to thee always generous stranger for it is certain without thy assistance this day had been fatal to me i should not have lived till sunset   messenion then sir i may hope you will reward my service with that good which exceeds every other liberty   menaechmus must i make thee free friend   messenion yes certainly you my master since you acknowledge i have saved your life   menaechmus is it me you call master you are deceived and take me for some other person   messenion how can i be deceived how can i take you for another person i do not understand you sir   menaechmus i swear by the father of the gods i am not your master   messenion good sir do not talk in this manner   menaechmus i tell you i am not your master i never had a slave capable of doing what you have done for me   messenion if you will not acknowledge me for your slave give me liberty to go where i please   menaechmus by hercules i will enfranchise thee as far as it is in my power be free my friend and go where thou will   messenion do you command me to do so sir   menaechmus yes by hercules i command thee by all the authority i have over thee   messenion oh my good my worthy master i will serve you still faithfully in the character of your new freed man   a slave companion of messenion i congratulate you messenion upon the liberty you have acquired   messenion by hercules my friend i do not in the least doubt but that your congratulation is sincere but sir i must entreat you will grant me one favor and that is that you will continue to command me any thing for your service with the same authority as when i was your slave i will stay with you and when you return home i will follow you   menaechmus no that must not be   messenion i will go immediately to the inn and bring the baggage and money your purse is sealed and put into your portmantua i will deliver it into your hands   menaechmus do so thou art a brave fellow   messenion i will give you back the purse in the same condition as when you confided it to my care have a little patience and wait for me here   menaechmus what am i to think of all this what wonderful accidents have happened to me this day some will not acknowledge me but impudently maintain that i am what i am not and from thence take occasion to shut me out of my house others pretend notwithstanding all my assurances to the contrary that i am their master the man who has just left me would engage himself to all the furies in hell that he is my slave and therefore i must give him freedom the madman has promised me a purse full of money if he keeps his word i shall very cheerfully take leave of him i will throw the reins over his neck and suffer him to go where he pleases for to be plain i shall be afraid that when he is restored to his senses he will remember the money he has given me and demand it back again perhaps with interest too my fatherinlaw and the physician treat me like a madman from whence can it proceed i am wrapped in wonder at it  let me consider am i awake or is all this a vision  no it is but too certain what then shall i do after so many storms i believe i cannot do better than to go to this courtezan and by prayers and flatteries prevail upon her to give me back the robe if i should have the goodluck to succeed with this woman who like all the rest of her trade is true to her own interest i will carry it home immediately and do not doubt but with such a passport i shall gain admittance and restore peace again to my family   scene x menaechmus sosicles messenion messenion have thou the impudence to persist in saying thou have seen and spoke to me a few minutes ago was there ever a more infamous falsehood i indeed commanded thee to come and fetch me or at least to meet me here neither of which thou did thou were taken up i suppose with some more agreeable business   messenion is it possible sir that you can speak so contrary to your own knowledge certainly you mean to divert yourself for you cannot have forget the service i did you just now did i not deliver you from four great mastiffs who were carrying you away by force you stormed you cried aloud for succor and called both gods and men to witness the horrible violence that you suffered in vain you struggled to free yourself from their arms i was destined to be your deliverer finding you in this danger i ran i flew to your assistance i fell furiously upon your ravishers and by a shower of dreadful blows i forced them to fly thus i again made you master of yourself and restored you to liberty this action which showed my ardent zeal for your safety moved your heart you thought and with reason that you could not reward so important a service with less than liberty therefore you made me free   menaechmus how have i made you free have i permitted you to go where you please   messenion there is nothing more certain   menaechmus and i protest that it has been long my resolution rather to sell myself for a slave than give you freedom how will you reconcile these contradictions   scene xi menaechmus of epidamnum menaechmus sosicles messenion menaechmus of epidamnum speaking as he comes out of erotias house by hercules though you should swear by all that is most dear to you that i have carried away the robe and the bracelet it would nevertheless be false you are all villainous liars   messenion oh heaven oh ye immortal gods what do i behold   menaechmus sosicles what is it you see   messenion your living mirror sir   menaechmus sosicles what do thou mean by that   messenion your other self never was there so perfect a resemblance   menaechmus by pollux if the idea i have of my own figure be true this man is not different from myself   menaechums of epidamnum well met again young man who ever thou art i shall look upon thee as my deliverer   messenion i conjure you sir by the great hercules tell me your name   menaechmus of epidamnum my name is menaechmus   menaechmus sosicles by the temple of pollux that is my name also   menaechmus of epidamnum i am of syracuse in sicily   menaechmus sosicles there was i also born and in that city am i settled   menaechmus of epidamnum what is it you say   menaechmus sosicles nothing but truth   messenion that i can witness for i ought to know this gentleman well since i am one of his slaves aye this is my master but in good faith i have taken you for him and firmly believed i belonged to you this mistake has been the cause of my giving my master offense and letting some imprudent and disrespectful words escape me for which i most humbly ask your pardon master   to menaechmus of epidamnum menaechmus sosicles sure thou art mad have thou forgot that this day you landed with me at epidamnum   messenion very true sir  yes without doubt it is you that are my master and as for you young gentleman with the deceitful appearance you must seek another slave i must bid you adieu my new master for i insist upon it that this is the true menaechmus   menaechmus of epidamnum and i insist upon it that it is i who am menaechmus   menaechmus sosicles what farce are we playing here you are menaechmus you say   menaechmus of epidamnum yes i say i am menaechmus the son of moschus a citizen of syracuse   menaechmus sosicles how are you the son of my father   menaechmus of epidamnum not that i know of young man i am the son of my own father and in naming him i had no design of claiming yours   messenion immortal gods accomplish i beseech you my hope although it be almost against hope itself yet oh may it please you to confirm my conjecture these two if i am not deceived are the twin brothers of syracuse i must consult with my master mr menaechmus   both what woudst thou   messenion i speak but to one at a time answer me which of you two have wandered a long time with me on the sea   menaechmus of epidamnum not i   menaechmus sosicles no certainly for it was me   messenion then it is with you i would speak be so good to come aside with me   menaechmus sosicles well what have thou to say to me now   messenion one of these two things must certainly be true either this man is an impostor and a cheat or he is your twin brother for my part i must confess the more i examine him the more i am lost in astonishment i never in my whole life beheld a man who so perfectly resembled another as he does you believe me sir for of this i am a better judge than you one drop of water is not more like another besides he says he is of the same city and country as you are therefore if you think proper we will interrogate him on some facts   menaechmus sosicles by hercules thy advice is good and i am much obliged to thee go on i conjure thee in the name of the gods to clear up this affair and if thou provest him to be my brother i will reward thee with liberty   messenion i am in great hopes of being able to give you this satisfaction my heart whispers success to me   menaechmus sosicles i will patiently wait the event   messenion well sir you who would make us believe you to be menaechmus will you maintain it   menaechmus of epidamnum yes and i will say nothing but what is true   messenion it is certain that my masters name is menaechmus you say you are of syracuse in sicily in that city was he born moschus you tell us was your father so was he my masters are you willing to give me your assistance in clearing up this matter to the satisfaction of you both   menaechmus of epidamnum well do thou deserve that i should comply with all thy demands and although i am free yet will i blindly obey thee as if thou had bought me for thy slave   messenion i do not doubt but that you will be found to be the twin brothers of syracuse born in one day of the same father and mother   menaechmus of epidamnum your words surprise me you fill me with astonishment and joy may the gods grant that you may be able to prove this clearly to me   messenion well then stand by each other and both of you answer precisely to the questions i shall ask you   menaechmus of epidamnum ask what you please i promise to answer you truly   messenion are you called menaechmus   menaechmus of epidamnum it is my true and only name   messenion and yours also sir   menaechmus sosicles nothing is more certain   messenion you declare yourself the son of moschus who when alive was a good and honest citizen of syracuse   menaechmus of epidamnum i repeat that declaration   menaechmus sosicles the same menaechmus was my father also   messenion you are then a syracusan   menaechmus of epidamnum certainly   messenion and you also my master   menaechmus sosicles yes thou know it   messenion hitherto all goes right your answers agree perfectly well but for a greater confirmation i beseech you sir the citizen of epidamnum that you will be pleased to tell us what you remember at the greatest distance of time   menaechmus of epidamnum i remember that my father took me with him to tarentum whither he went to trade at our arrival we stood to behold some games that were celebrating and i lost my father in the crowd i wandered about and at last fell into the hands of a rich citizen of this place who stole me away and brought me here to epidamnum   menaechmus sosicles supreme and all powerful jupiter bless me and crown thy work   messenion have patience master do not interrupt me how old were you when your father took you with him to tarentum   menaechmus of epidamnum seven years i remember i was then geting new teeth after this adventure happened to me i never more saw my father   messenion how many brothers were of you in the family   menaechmus of epidamnum we were but two as i remember   messenion which of you was the eldest   menaechmus of epidamnum i think we were of the same age   messenion how can that be   menaechmus of epidamnum it is not difficult to guess we were twins   menaechmus sosicles the gods at last are favorable   messenion i assure you sir if you interrupt me again i will not ask him any more questions i will be silent   menaechmus sosicles i had much rather be silent myself   messenion there yet remains one difficulty which i am afraid will not be easy to get over how happens it that your brother and you have the same name   menaechmus of epidamnum i dont know that we have as for myself i am called menaechmus and i was always called so but my brother had another name which if i remember right was sosicles   menaechmus sosicles ah it is too much one half of these proofs had been sufficient to convince me i cannot any longer contain my fraternal tenderness i must embrace him my dear brother my twin brother i i am sosicles   menaechmus of epidamnum but why are you called menaechmus   menaechmus sosicles when the family was informed that our father was dead and that you was lost our grandfather who always loved you more than me suppressed my name and gave me yours   menaechmus of epidamnum i believe all you tell me one little scruple remains which i beg you to remove   menaechmus sosicles most wllingly speak   menaechmus of epidamnum what was our mothers name   menaechmus sosicles theusimarcha   menaechmus of epidamnum the same come to my arms my dear brother whom for so many years i have not seen and whom i never thought to have seen again how happy has this unexpected meeting made me   menaechmus sosicles and oh how has it blessed me me my dear brother who have sought thee so long a time with incredible labor and fatigues but now they are all overpayd   messenion now master the behavior of the courtezan is explained she called you by your name and invited you to dinner believing you to be your brother   menaechmus of epidamnum by the temple of pollux i had ordered her to prepare a repast and intended to dine with her nay i gave her a robe which i stole to day from my wife   menaechmus sosicles is not this the robe you speak of brother   menaechmus of epidamnum by what chance did it come into your possession   menaechmus sosicles the woman who lives in that house invited me to dine with her she assured me that i had given her this habit i was very well entertained eat and drank plentifully and to complete my good fortune brought the robe away with me   menaechmus of epidamnum by the temple of pollux i am rejoiced that you fared so well upon my account this creature when she invited you in certainly mistook you for me   messenion well the affair is now finished i have fulfilled my

his comedy of errors shakespeares comedy of errors has been generally allowed to be founded on the menaechmi of plautus mr langbain in his account of the dramatic poets says that if it be not a just translation of it it is at least a paraphrase and in his opinion far beyond a translation called manaechmus printed at london       from this translation of plautuss menaechmi shakespeare certainly borrowed his comedy of errors but not being able to procure a copy of it and being wholly unacquainted with the latin tongue i have turned monsieur gueudivilles french translation of the menaechmi into english which although as i am informed it be not very literal as to the dialogue yet the plot the incidents and characters being exactly the same with the latin poets it will serve to show how much of the plot shakespeare has borrowed in his comedy of errors  that we may be the better able to trace him in his imitations it will be necessary to examine the comedy of errors scene by scene and take the story a little higher than the commencement of the action of the play  the cities of syracuse and ephesus being at war with each other a law was made in both by which it was provided that if any ephesian merchant was seen to traffic in syracuse or any syracusan merchant in ephesus his goods should be confiscated and himself condemned to death  an old merchant of syracuse named aegeon landing at ephesus is apprehended upon this law  here the action of the play begins as aegeon is leading to prison the duke of ephesus meeting him demands the cause of his having left his native country and coming to ephesus aegeon thereupon gives a long account of himself and his family which in order to understand well the following incidents i will transcribe  in syracusa was i born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me too had not our hap been bad with her i lived in joy our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factors death and he great store of goods at random leaving drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there she had not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguished but by names that very hour and in the selfsame inn a poor mean woman was delivered of such a burden maletwins both alike those for their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamnum had we sailed before the alwayswindobeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embraced yet the incessant weeping of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mourned for fashion ignorant what to fear forced me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means were none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinkingripe to us my wife more careful for the elder born had fastened him unto a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed fastened ourselves at the end of either mast and floating straight obedient to the stream were carried toward corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispersed those vapors that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas waxed calm and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidauris this but ere they came  oh let me say no more gather the sequel by what went before duke nay forward old man do not break off so for we may pity though not pardon thee  aegeon oh had the gods done so i had not now worthily termed them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encountered by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpless ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length the other ship had seized on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave helpful welcome to their shipwrecked guests and would have rest the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me severed from my bliss thus by misfortunes was my life prolonged to tell sad stories of my own mishaps  duke and for the sakes of them thou sorrowst for do me the favor to dilate at full what has befallen of them and thee till now  aegeon my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendant for his case was like rest of his brother but retained his name might bear him company in quest of him whom whilst i labored for a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i loved five summers have i spent in farthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hapless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbors men but here must end the story of my life and happy were i in my timely death could all my travels warrant me they live  here ends the first scene the appearance of aegeon is of no other use than to tell the spectators several circumstances antecedent to the action of the play which it is necessary they should be acquainted with this plautus does in his prologue  the story though borrowed from plautus is yet very different the circumstance of two brothers being so extremely like each other that it was impossible to distinguish them is highly improbable in the latin poet  shakespeare however doubles the miracle and presents us with two pair of twins instead of one with the same wonderful resemblance  plautus accounts very naturally for the brothers having both the same name the grandfather upon the loss of the eldest whom he loved best to preserve the remembrance of him gives his name to the youngest  shakespeare without assigning any reason for it makes the twin sons of aegeon be both called anthipholis and the twin brothers their slaves both dromio  the separation of the husband and wife and their children from whence all the diverting mistakes in the comedy of errors arise is brought about without the least regard to probability  aegeon sails from syracuse to epidamnum to settle his affairs there which were left in confusion by the death of his factor and his wife though near the time of her lyingin follows him for no reason indeed but to be delivered at an inn where a poor woman who like her having born two male twins she may buy them for slaves to her own sons and that returning to syracuse they may be shipwrecked and separated from each other  when the storm arises the merchant and his wife who as it should seem have a view to the diverting perplexities which are to follow fasten one antipholis and one dromio together so when the ship splits they are very conveniently separated had they like other fond parents been more sollicitous for the preservation of their own offspring than their little slaves and used their joint endeavors for that purpose only the father and mother and their twin sons might have been all taken up together by the corinthian vessel but thus equally dividing their affection between their children and their slaves and that excellent contrivance of fastening a twin of each sort together occasioned their falling into different hands and gave to each antipholis his dromio for the future business of the play  the mother and the elder antipholis being separated he and his little slave dromio are carried to ephesus where in process of time he is married to a rich lady and settles there here the younger antipholis comes to seek for his brother and his father afterward for him the old man is immediately seized and condemned to die as has been mentioned but the duke respites him for the space of one day in order to try if he can raise the sum of one thousand marks to buy his life  in the second scene antipholis of syracuse makes his appearance with the merchant of the city who informing him of what had happened to the syracusan merchant advises him to give out that he came from epidamnum  antipholis of syracuse sends his man dromio with a thousand marks to lay up safe at his inn and being left to himself declares the cause of his wandering about the world to be the hopes of finding his mother and brother whose loss he deplores while he is standing in the street dromio of ephesus comes up to him and taking him for his master tells him his dinner is ready and that his wife waits for him  antipholis deceived by the resemblance supposes this dromio to be his slave reproves him for his ill timed jests and asks him where he had left his money dromio talks of sixpence he had given him two or three days ago  antipholis asks for his thousand marks dromio tells him of his dinner his house his wife and presses him to come home antipholis at last in a fury strikes him dromio runs off and antipholis full of uneasiness about his money returns to his inn to look after it  in the second act the scene is the house of antipholis of ephesus his wife complains to her sister of her husbands long stay and wonders the slave she sent for him is not returned dromio then enters and humorously repeats what had past between his supposed master and him declaring that he believes him to be mad the wife frets and orders him to go back again and fetch him  the scene changes again to the street antipholis of syracuse enters and informs the audience that his money is safe and adds by computation and mine hosts report i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart yet notwithstanding this reflection the moment his own slave dromio of syracuse appears he reproaches him with his having denied receiving his gold and with talking to him about his wife and a dinner and though the poor fellow assures him that he never spoke such words to him and had not seen him since he sent him to the inn till now yet antipholis falls into a rage and beats him  a dialogue of puns and quibbles ensues between the master and man which is interrupted by the entrance of adriana the wife of antipholis of ephesus and her sister  adriana  this antipholis and this dromio  band and his slave reproaches him with his neglect of her and entreats him to come home to dinner  antipholis protests he does not know her and that he is but just arrived at ephesus the sister chides him and tells him his wife had sent for him home to dinner by dromio dromio is surprised and denies it antipholis who had had that message delivered to him by the other dromio storms at the slave for lying the fellow assures him he had never seen her antipholis asks how she could be acquainted with their names if he had not seen her before and informed her of them adriana vexed at this jesting as she thinks it entreats antipholis to go home with her and charges dromio to keep the gate for that day and let no one in to interrupt them  antipholis though amazed to the last degree at all this resolves at last to  say as they say and persevere so and in this mist at all adventures go in the third act the scene is the street before the house of antipholis of ephesus antipholis of ephesus and his slave dromio with a merchant and a goldsmith whom antipholis has invited to dine at his house enter  antipholis fearing lest his wife should be angry at his long stay desires the jeweller to excuse it by saying that he lingered at his house seeing the making of her bracelet and chides his man for having dared to tell him he met him on the mart and charged him with a thousand marks in gold and with having denied his wife and house he then knocks at his door but is refused entrance  adriana who supposes her husband is dining with her above is surprised at the fellow below who calls her wife and insists upon admittance and renews her orders to dromio of syracuse to keep the door shut  a smart dialogue follows between the two dromios the one within doors and the other without the husband and his guests not being suffered to enter he resolves to go and dine with a courtezan at the porcupine and desires the jeweller to bring the gold chain thither to him that as he says he may to spite his wife bestow it upon the courtezan and accordingly they all go off  in the next scene antipholis of syracuse makes love to luciana sister to adriana she upbraids him with his falsehood to his wife he swears he is not married to her sister and that he cannot be happy without her luciana threatens to acquaint his wife with his treachery and leaves him  his slave dromio then enters and antipholis from the strange accidents that had happened both to himself and his slave believing the place inhabited by witches resolves to be gone immediately and orders dromio to go to the harbor and bring him intelligence if any bark was to sail that night telling him he will walk in the mart till his return  dromio goes away to perform his commission and the same moment the jeweller angelo enters with the chain and gives it to antipholis of syracuse whom he takes for the other  antipholis denies that he had ever ordered such a chain to be made but the jeweller insisting that he had and telling him that he will call in the evening at his house for the money antipholis offers to pay him immediately lest as he says he should never see the chain or money more which the jeweller refusing and leaving him antipholis goes to the mart to wait for dromio which ends the third act  in the fourth act a merchant to whom the goldsmith angelo owes a sum of money demands instant payment or threatens to arrest him by an officer whom he has with him angelo tells him antipholis owed him just as much money as he was indebted to him for a gold chain which he had delivered to him a moment ago and desired him to go with him to his house to receive the money for it  antipholis of ephesus and his slave dromio enter as from the house of the courtezan where they had dined antipholis orders dromio to go and buy a ropesend that he may chastise his wife he says for locking him out of doors and that in the mean time he will go to the goldsmith but seeing him he reproaches him with not bringing the chain as he had promised  angelo desires him to pay the money for the chain to the merchant there present to whom he owes as much antipholis replies that he has not so much money about him but bids the jeweller take the gentleman and chain to his house and his wife would pay for it angelo says he gave him the chain and presses him to pay for it antipholis denies it the merchant weary of this altercation arrests the jeweller and he arrests antipholis  dromio of syracuse then enters and taking antipholis of ephesus for his master tells him that a ship is ready to sail and that he had carried their baggage on board as he commanded him antipholis calls him a madman and asks him for the ropesend which he had sent him to buy dromio tells him he sent him to the bay to see if any bark was ready to sail not for a rope  antipholis in a passion threatens him with future punishment and then orders him to go to adriana tell her he was arrested in the street and give her the key of his desk and bid her send the purse of ducats that was in it to him dromio remembers that adriana is the lady with whom they had dined and accordingly he goes thither tells her what had happened and she dispatches him away with the gold  the scene then changes to the street antipholis of syracuse enters alone and a moment after dromio of syracuse meets him and gives him the purse antipholis full of wonder questions his man about it and he talking enigmatically of arrests and durance antipholis thinks him distracted and prays earnestly to be delivered out of that city  the courtezan then enters and seeing the gold chain about antipholiss neck whom she takes for antipholis of ephesus who had dined with her she requires him to perform his promise and give her the chain instead of the diamond ring he had taken from her antipholis flies from her and dromio follows  the courtezan from this strange behavior concluding him mad resolves to go to his house and tell adriana that he had forcibly taken her ring from her hoping to recover it again by this means she goes out and antipholis of ephesus enters with the jailer whom he had desired to accompany him to his own house for money to release him as they are going thither dromio of ephesus returns with the rope he had been sent to buy his master asks him for the money he went to fetch from adriana dromio protests he had been sent not for money but for a ropesend antipholis violently enraged beats him and whilst he is thus employed his wife whom the courtezan had alarmed with an account of his being mad enters with one pinch a conjurer whom she employed to cure her husband of his frenzy  antipholis growing furious at this treatment his wife calls for people to bind him the jailer opposes it he being his prisoner but upon adrianas promising to pay him he suffers antipholis to be carried off and as adriana is going out with the rest antipholis and dromio of syracuse enters with their swords drawn and they supposing him to be the antipholis who they had just before sent away bound crying out for help and antipholis and dromio again set out for the port  in the fifth act the scene is a street before a priory the jeweller and merchant who arrested him appear and while they are discoursing about antipholiss denying that he received the chain antipholis and dromio of syracuse enter angelo seeing him with the chain about his neck reproaches him with having denied the receipt of it and refusing to pay for it antipholis protests he neither denied the one or the other the merchant hereupon taxes him with fashood antipholis draws his sword and as the merchant and he are fighting adriana enters cries out that he is mad and orders some people she had brought with her to bind both him and dromio and carry them home antipholis and dromio to avoid this take shelter in the monastery and immediately the lady abbess appears and demands the cause of the others thronging thither  adriana tells her that her husband who ran into her house is mad and that she wants to have him fetched from thence and carried home the abbess after cunningly questioning her concerning her behavior to her husband and taking advantage of her answers to prove that she had occasioned his disorders declares that she will not let him depart but undertake the cure herself  the duke that moment who is attending the execution of old aegeon enters and adriana throwing herself at his feet demands justice against the abbess whom she accuses of keeping her husband from her and recounts all the mad actions he had been guilty of that day the duke sends to bid the lady abbess come out and answer to this accusation and in the mean time a servant of adrianas enters and tells her that his master and dromio who had been left bound at home had broken loose and committed the most terrible outrages on the doctor and servants at home adriana who had seen him as she thought go into the priory a few minutes before insists upon it that this report is false when immediately antipholis and dromio of ephesus enter  antipholis complains to the duke of his wifes having locked him out of doors she declares that he had dined with her that day antipholis goes on to relate all that had happened to him the jeweller the merchant the courtezan his wife and her sister having been all deceived by the resemblance of the two antipholiss charge the one they are speaking to with all that had passed between them and the other his occasions a great deal of confusion and perplexity old aegeon on seeing antipholis of ephesus and taking him for his son antipholis whom he had parted from seven years before in the port of syracuse tells the duke that he has now found a friend who will pay his fine and save his life and accordingly goes up to him and naming him asks him if he does not know his father  antipholis protests he never saw him before the old man reminds him that it is seven years since they parted at syracuse and deplores his own misery in having been so soon forgotten by his own son antipholis tells him he never saw his father in his life nor was ever in syracuse which the duke confirmed  in the midst of this new perplexity the abbess enters with antipholis and dromio of syracuse all stand amazed at the exact likeness of the two gentlemen and their slaves the abbess spying aegeon owns herself to be emilia his wife the mother of those two antipholiss and informs him that she and the elder antipholis with the twin dromio were taken out of the sea by men of epidamnum but that some fishermen of corinth took away her son and dromio and left her with the epidamniens that what became of them afterward she never knew but that herself arrived to the fortune of being abbess of that priory  the two antipholiss being now discovered all the mistakes which arose from their resemblance are cleared up aegeon has his life given him by the duke and they all go into the priory to discourse more at large upon their several fortunes  the unity of time is exactly observed in the comedy of errors the incidents of this play take up the space of one day like those of the menaechmi but the action which in the last is single and the most simple that can possibly be is by shakespeare multiplied into several some of which are far from being either probable or necessary he has taken all the characters in the menaechmi except peniculus the parasite and the old man fatherinlaw to menaechmus of epidamnum and has added several others every one of the incidents he has likewise made use of but varied and added circumstances so freely that his play seems to be rather an imitation than as langbain calls it a translation or paraphrase of the menaechmi  the addition of the two dromios increases the business of the play but renders the object still more improbable which is sufficiently so in the menaechmi where but half the degree of credulity is necessary to make it be relished  the mistakes which arise from the resemblance of the twins are conducted with much less art by shakespeare than plautus  in the latin poet all appears the effects of chance in shakespeare of design the persons in his drama are hardly ever introduced with propriety they appear on the stage and go off again evidently for no other purpose than to give occasion for the blunders which ensue  thus antipholis of syracuse being resolved to leave ephesus sends dromio to the port to see if any vessel is ready to sail and bids him come to him to the mart where he will wait his return accordingly they separate and it may now be reasonably supposed that antipholis is gone thither but instead of that we find him a scene or two afterward standing in the same place where he is met either by the wife the friends or the servants of the other antipholis and after having with great difficulty disengaged himself from abundance of perplexing adventures again he declares he is going to the mart and goes off for that purpose and again he is found in the same place to give rise to new ones  in this manner the whole business of the comedy of errors is conducted those errors do not as in the play which shakespeare borrowed from arise out of a natural and probable succession of incidents but every thing is put out of its course to introduce them and each error is produced by an absurdity  the story of amleth translated from the danish history of saxogrammaticus in the reign of roderic horwendil and fengo sons of gerwendil had the garrison of jutland committed to them by the king horwendil was the bravest pirate on the sea and for the fame of his exploits envied by collar king of norway who sailed in pursuit of his rival they met they fought and the king was slain  the encounter of these heroes with the extraordinary manner of their meeting each other alone in the recesses of a wood with other circumstances as improbable as any in romance are related in the true style of such writings by saxogrammaticus in the third book of his danish history  after the death of collar and his sister selam horwendil having for three years given the greatest proofs of valor destines his rich spoils and choice prey for roderic that he might rise in his friendship grown familiar he obtains his daughter geruth in marriage and by her had a son amleth  fengo fired with envy at his brothers happiness is resolved by treachery to ruin him so that virtue is not always secure against the designs of such as are the nearest to and the most intimate with us for when an opportunity offered to commit fratricide he with bloody hand satiates the dire lust of his heart poisoned with envy and enjoying the wife of his murdered brother adds foul incest to his fratricide he who submits to one offense too readily offends again for one crime is often the provocation to another  he contrived this villainy with such art and impudence as to frame an excuse for his guilt from counterfeit benevolence and give to fratricide the color of love geruth was of so mild a disposition as never to give the least offense and yet he said she had incurred the severest hatred of her husband and that he had killed his brother for her sake and to save her thinking it ungenerous so gentle a lady and without gall should endure the extreme moroseness of that man  his success was equal to his wishes for princes may be deceived and made to believe untruths in courts where buffoonery is sometimes favored and malicious detraction honored fengo hesitated not with murderous hands to embrace a brothers wife and with equal villainy commits a double impiety  amleth sees this but that he might not raise suspicions in his uncle by an over prudent care for his own safety puts on the guise of folly and feigns himself distracted and by this sort of device he not only covers his design but saves himself he lazily stretched himself out every day before his mothers hearth rolling on the ground and covering himself with filth his face discolored and besmeared with gore and nastiness presented the ridiculous extravagance of a natural whatever he said was like the ravings of a madman whatever action he performed savoured of extreme ignorance in short you would not say he was a man but a ridiculous monster produced by fortune in a frenzy  sometimes sitting by the fire and raking the embers with his hand he would make wooden hooks and harden them in the fire and fasten the ends within one another that they might hold more firmly together and when asked what he was about would say he made sharp spikes to revenge his father  he was not a little laughed at for this answer the vanity of such a ridiculous performance was treated with contempt by all though it afterward was of use to him in the prosecution of his design  this ingenuity gave to those of better judgment the first suspicion of his subtilty the latent ability of the workman for greater matters was seen by his skill in lesser ones nor could it be thought that his senses were impaired who by the work of his hands discovered such ingenious artifice besides he preserved his heap of brands that he had burnt at the points to make them hard with the greatest care  there were those who asserting that he was of uncommon strength and quickness of parts that he hid his good sense under the pretense of folly and covered the deep design of his mind with crafty invention and that his advice could not be more readily discovered than by introducing to him at any time in his recesses a beautiful woman who might call forth his mind to the allurements of love  so prone is nature to the passion of love that no artifice can disguise it and it is too violent to be interrupted by policy and therefore if his ignorance were counterfeit he would when occasion offered yield obedience to the power of love  certain companions therefore are employed who should engage him to ride to distant parts of the forest and try him with that temptation  amongst them there happened to be a youth who had the same nurse with amleth and still preserved in his heart the regard that naturally arises in those who are brought up together  he preferring the remembrance of former fellowship to the present charge attends upon amleth with the rest of his appointed comrades with a purpose to inform rather than betray him which he could not doubt would happen at last if he discovered the least sign of a sound mind and especially if he should openly indulge the passion of love  which was no secret to amleth himself for when commanded to get on horseback he purposely seats himself so as to turn his back to the horses head and face his tail to which he began to apply the bridle as if he was by that part to govern the speed of his horse by means of this contrivance he baffles the design of his uncle and defeats his arts it was very ridiculous to see the horse go forward without the usual check of the reins the rider directing only the tail  amleth in the way met with a wolf amongst the trees his companions saying they had met with a young horse he replied there were few such in fengos troops by this modest and witty prevarication he rallied the riches of his uncle  when they added that he had made a sensible answer he affirmed that he intended that he might so to do not in any degree seem to favor a falsehood for desiring to be thought incapable of lying he blended craft and truth together that he might not seem entirely to deviate from veracity in whatever he said nor discover the richness of his parts by too much exactness  passing along the shore when his companions found the rudder of a shipwrecked vessel they said they had found a knife of prodigious size it is therefore fit says he to cut up a large ham meaning the sea indeed to which the size of the rudder did well agree passing also by the sandy clifts and being directed to look upon the beach as if it were corn he said the same was ground by the foaming billows of the sea this answer being commended by his attendant be assured them it was discreetly said by him  being left by them on purpose that he might with greater freedom indulge his lust in a private place he meets a girl sent by his uncle as if it were by chance and would have lain with her had not the fosterbrother warned him of the snare by a secret kind of information  for he considering how he might best discharge the office of an unknown monitor to his friend and prevent the danger of his wanton appetite fixed a straw he found on the ground in the tail of a buzze or be flying by and drove him toward the place where he knew amleth was by this act he conferred the greatest benefit on the unguarded youth  nor was this notice more cunningly conveyed than readily understood for amleth seeing the fly and the straw that he carried in his tail and having carefully considered it to be a tacit admonition to beware of frauds alarmed therefore with the suspicion of injurious designs against him that he might more securely indulge his wishes he catching the girl in his arms carries her a considerable distance into a marsh and unfrequented and after enjoyment earnestly entreats her not to declare it to any one  with equal concern therefore is silence urged and obtained for their being brought up together under the same guardians from their infancy produced the greatest familiarity between her and amleth  upon his return home being asked by every one whether he had gratified his lust he owned he had lain with the girl being asked again in what place he had done it or what pillow he had used answered the hoof of an animal that carries a burden oestrus or oestrum has a double signification either a gadbee as above or a coxcomb as in this place the comb of a cock and under an arched roof he had put all these particulars when under trial that he might avoid the telling a lie this account excited much laughter in those about him although for the jest sake he did not diminish any thing of the truth  the girl also being questioned kept her word with him and declared he had done nothing credit is given her and the rather as it appeared that his guards knew nothing of the matter then he who had marked the buzze for a token to show that the safety of amleth was owing to his conceit said that he was lately the only one who took care of him and that the young mans answer was to the purpose  nor was the merit of the token forgot he related how he saw the little carrier of the straw with hasty flight passing near him and that the straw was stuck in the hinder parts of his body as this relation excited greater laughter in the rest the friend of amleth was no less delighted with his prudence  all of them being defeated and unable to gain admittance into the secrets of this young mans stratagems one of the friends of fengo more presumptuous than politic denied that this unextricable scheme of subtilty could be unravelled by common artifice for he was too obstinate to be moved by trials of little moment an ordinary manner of trial would not reach such variety of craft but he had discovered by superior sagacity a more subtle manner of trying him not improper for execution but most effectual for the discovery of the thing proposed  the scheme was this that fengo should under the pretense of business of great consequence withdraw himself and amleth be shut up with his mother alone in her apartment care being taken to have a man who unknown to either of them should be placed in some secret part of the room unseen to hear attentively whatever passed in conversation between them for if the son was really in his senses he would have no difficulty in speaking freely to a mothers ear nor mistrust the fidelity of her that bore him and that he might not seem more forward to advise than ready to execute he desired himself to be the spy  fengo approved the scheme and sets out with the pretense of taking a long journey  mean while the projector having privately stole to the chamber where amleth and his mother were lay hid under the matt of the bed  but amleth was not the dupe of this treachery for suspecting that he might be overheard by some officious listener he has at first recourse to his accustomed folly and imitates the crowing of a cock and flapping his arms as if they were wings he jumps up and down upon the bed to try if any thing lay hid there and when he found a mass under his feet he examined the place with his sword and stabs the man who was underneath and dragging him forth put him to death cutting the body in pieces he boils them and pours them out through the sewer to be devoured by the hogs  and thus was the miserable body rendered undistinguishable from the dung of the stye  having escaped this snare he returns to his mothers apartment and when she with great lamentation and tears began to bemoan the want of understanding in her son now present why o worst of women says he do thou endeavor to disguise the foulest crime under a false species of wailing thou who sporting with the wantonness of a strumpet and yielding to the vile and impious condition of your second marriage embrace in your incestuous bosom the murderer of your husband and fawn upon and please with lewdest transport the very man who put to death the father of your offspring so mares are coupled with horses that subdued their foremates it is for beasts alone to be dragged to any and to every male by this example it appears that you have lost all memory of your former husband it is not without reason that i bear the resemblance of a fool for i cannot doubt that he who could destroy a brother would with like cruelty rage against his other kindred it is safer to wear the garb of folly than of sense and i must borrow a safeguard from the lowest species of madness yet the care of revenging my father is ever present to my mind but i wait for times and seasons the same place suits not with every scene or purpose against a dark and cruel mind much thought is requisite but for you to lament my madness is vain when you ought rather to deplore your own infamy you should therefore not lament anothers but your own failing for the rest be on your guard and keep the strictest silence by such reproach did he endeavor to recall his heartrent mother to the practice of former habits of virtue and to teach her to prefer the former flames of chaster love to the present criminal transports  fengo returns and of every one and every where enquires for his injudicious spy but he is no more to be found nor does any one remember to have seen him amleth in jest is asked whether he could discover any tracts of him and replies that he went in at the sewer fell to the bostom was kept down by the mud and devoured by the hogs who thronged to the draught which declaration though true seeming idle and foolish was treated as ridiculous  when fengo no longer doubted of the subtilty of his soninlaw he resolved to destroy him but was afraid to execute his purpose on account of his grandfather roderic and the displeasure of his own wife to cover his guilt by the service of another he purposes to have him destroyed by means of the king of britain thus desirous of concealing his cruelty he chooses rather to pollute his friend than to be thought infamous himself  amleth departing in secret directs his mother to furnish the hall with hangings well knotted together and at the expiration of a year to report him dead and celebrate his funeral obsequies and at that very time he promises to return  he is attended by two of fengos officers bearing letters inscribed on wood for that was once a famous manner of writing by which it was given in charge to the king of britain to destroy the young man that was sent to him  whilst these officers slept amleth examining their baggage discovers these tablets having read them he rubs out what was written therein and inserting other characters changes the tenor of the mandate from his own destruction to the death of his attendants nor satisfied with this alteration whereby he saves his own life and exposes that of his guards he adds as the earnest entreaty of fengo that the king of britain would bestow his daughter in marriage upon that youth he had sent him who was most wise and prudent  when they came to britain the envoys waited on the king and presented the instrument for their own destruction though they thought it threatened not them but their companion  the king taking no notice to them of the instructions delivered him entertains them with great magnificence and hospitality when amleth despising the splendour of the royal tables as if they contained but common food abstains in a surprising manner from the richest exhibition of dainties both in meats and drinks  all admired that a youth of foreign extract should nauseate the choicest dainties of the royal board and most excellent luxury as if it were coarse and homely fare  the banquet ended the king dismissed his friends that they might retire to rest but took care by one sent privately and hid in their apartments to be informed of the conversation of his guests when amleth being asked by his comrades why he abstained from the entertainment of yesterday as from poison replied that the bread was sprinkled with the contagion of blood that the wine tasted of the sword that the animal food savoured of the corpse of a dead man and was as offensive as the smell of a sepulcher  he added that the king had mean eyes that the queen in three instances resembled a servant railing not only at the feast but at the authors of it  his companions upbraiding him with his former want of understanding began to abuse him for having found fault with approved good things blamed what was proper and slandered with indecent language a great king and a queen of refined manners and treated with disgrace and indignity those who really deserved applause  which circumstances being related to the king by his officer he declared the wisdom or madness of him who had related such things of more than mortal growth in so few words to show such extent of knowledge he sent for the steward and enquired of him where he had the bread and when he was told that it was made by the baker to the household he asked again where the corn grew and if there was any sign of human slaughter in that place  he answered that there was a field not far off covered with the bones of men long since slain yet manifestly exhibiting the remains of ancient slaughter which he with expectation of greater plenty as the richer soil had sown with spring corn and therefore he did not know whether the bread might not have contracted a disagreeable taste  when the king heard this believing amleth had spoken truth he took care to know whence the bacon came  the man owned that the swine straying from his care had fed upon the carcass of a thief and so perhaps the meat might taste something like corruption  when the king found that his opinion was true demanded in this instaece likewise with what liquor he had mixed the drink as he knew it to be made of corn and water the situation of the spring being shown him he set about digging and found many swords eaten with rust from whence he supposed the water had contracted that smell  others said the drink was found fault with because in the draught he had met with bees that had been bred in the belly of a dead man and tasted of comb by which the king seeing there was sufficient reason to complain of the taste of these things finding that he himself was reproached on account of his eyes and knowing that this must allude to baseness of birth taking his mother aside demanded of her who was his father she declaring she knew no other than the king by threatening her with death unless she confessed he discovered himself to be the son of a servant  thus by the extorted confession he came to understand that his origin which had been reflected on was at least ambiguous he is confounded with shame at this discovery of his condition but no less charmed with the young mans wisdom and asked him why he had reproachfully slurred the queen as one of servile manners but whilst he laments that the gentle disposition of his wife was attacked by the discourse of his guest in the night he learns that her mother was a waiting woman and whereas he said she exhibited three defects of a servile nature they are these one that she dressed her head in the same manner as servants do another that she tucked up her gown in walking the third was that she picked her teeth with a skewer and eat the pickings of them he took notice that her mother was reduced to servitude by becoming a captive so that she was not less servile in her birth than her manners  such sagacity being reverenced by the king as if it were divine he gave him his daughter in marriage and received his affirmation of any thing as if it bore the testimony of heaven but as for his companions that he might perform the behest of his friends he hanged them up the next day which though an advantage amleth seemed to resent as an injury feigning a distress of mind and received money by way of composition from the king which he afterward took care secretly to melt down and pour into hollow staves  having stayed with him a year he obtains leave to depart and returns home again taking nothing out of the magazine of royal treasure but the hollow staves in which he had poured the gold when he arrived at jutland he resumed his old behavior changing his late elegance for the ridiculous manner he had before employed and when he entered the hall covered with nastiness where the funeral rites were celebrated he threw every body into great amazement because a false report had been spread of his death at length their astonishment was turned into laughter and the guests rallied each other upon the presence of him alive to whom they had performed honors as dead  when questioned concerning his companions he said showing the staves he held here is both the one and the other which was said with equal wit and truth for though it appeared an unmeaning speech to most who heard it yet swerved not from his customary regard to truth showing the compensation instead of the men that were executed  then mixing with the waiters that he might heighten the mirth of the table he supplied them with liquor with more than ordinary diligence and that his flowing habit might not obstruct his moving up and down he girt it round him with his belt and often with design drawing his sword he cut his fingers with the point care therefore was taken by those about him to fasten his sword in the scabbard with a nail  that he might the more securely effect his purpose he charged the nobility with excess of liquor till all were overcame with drinking and unable to walk were obliged to take up their rest in the hall and sleep where they had been feasting and when he observed them in a condition fit for his designs believing the execution of it was in his power he puts the brands he had formerly prepared into his bosom and then reentering the hall where the nobles lay stretched on the ground oppressed with sleep and surfeit he let fall the curtain his mother had wove by cutting the lines that held it round the sides of the room which he drew over them and fastened with the hooks in so artful a manner that not one of them though he strove with never so much strength could possibly get up  after this he sets fire to the room which spreading far and wide soon set the whole house in a blaze destroyed the palace and burnt all both those that continued asleep and those who labored to rise but in vain thence hasting to fengos apartment who had been before conducted thither by his attendants he took his sword that hung by his bed and put his own in its room then rousing his uncle he told him that his nobles were destroyed by fire that amleth was there and furnished with the hooks he had formerly made and was now present with him eager to inflict the vengeance due for his fathers death  on hearing this fengo jumps from his bed and was murdered while disappointed of his own he vainly endeavors to draw amleths sword o brave man and worthy everlasting renown who furnishing himself wisely with counterfeit folly covered more than human wisdom under the guise of a natural not only secured his own safety by that artifice but obtained the means of completely revenging his father and having so done it is left for every one to judge which was greater his bravery or wisdom  the end of the third book of the history of denmark by saxogrammaticus the next book opens with the convention of the nobles before whom amleth making an oration in which he owns and justifies his conduct all are moved some to pity some to tears and they proclaim him king  after this he repairs to britain to revisit his wife and fatherinlaw the king had long been under an engagement to revenge any injury to fengo and this prevails over his affection for a soninlaw but unwilling to execute this vengeance himself he sends him to hermutruda queen of scotland upon an embassy to court her for him his wife being dead and this scottish lady was reported to be of so cruel a temper as to put to death her suitors but she discovering the disposition and actions of amleth loves and prevails on him to marry her  they go to britain his first wife forgives him and her father attacking him with his forces is by the danes defeated and slain  amleth returns home again with both his wives where he finds viglet the successor of roderic who was dead this new sovereign had stripped his mother of her royal treasures and denied the right of her son to jutland  amleth at last is forced to engage him in unequal war and is slain and the fair hermutruda who had taken the camp and determined to share his fate willingly yielded herself to the conquerors arms viglet died in years and was succeeded by wermund  observations on the use shakespeare has made of the foregoing story in his tragedy of hamlet the fable of the tragedy of hamlet claudius the reigning king of denmark having secretly murdered his brother in order to possess himself of his throne afterward married his widow the ghost of the deceased king appears to some sentinels who were posted on the platform before the palace these soldiers tell marcellus their officer what they had seen and he acquainting horatio the friend of hamlet son to the deceased king with it these two gentlemen watch one night on the platform with an intention to speak to the apparition if it should appear the ghost at the accustomed hour appears horatio solemnly conjures it to speak and unfold the cause of its appearance but the ghost continues silent and stalks away  horatio thereupon resolves to tell hamlet what had happened the prince full of grief for his fathers death displeased at his mothers incestuous marriage and discontented with the behavior of his uncle immediately concludes from this account of his fathers spirit appearing that all was not well and declares to his two friends that he will watch with them that night on the platform and speak to the spirit  accordingly at midnight he meets them at the appointed place and the ghost soon after appearing hamlet in a most earnest and affecting manner conjures it to speak and acquaint him with the cause of its appearing the ghost beckens him to follow it his companions apprehending some danger might happen to his person endeavor to retain him hut in vain hamlet breaks from them and follows the ghost who bringing him to a remote place declares that he is the spirit of his father that he was poisoned in his garden by his brother who lusted for his wife and crown he then charges him to revenge his murder and vanishes  hamlet vows to fulfill his commands and to conceal the grief and indignation which prey upon his heart and his vowed purpose of revenge counterfeits madness which alarming the guilty king and troubling his mother they send for two of his schoolfellows to amuse him and engage him in diversions to abate the force of his melancholy  polonius an old lord very faithful to the kings interests and whose daughter ophelia hamlet is in love with from her report of a frantic visit he made her concludes he is mad for her she having according to his orders returned his letters and presents and refused to hear his professions as usual pollonius having as he thought discovered the cause of hamlets madness acquaints the king and queen with his suspicions ophelia is designedly thrown in his way while the king and polonius conceal themseves to hear their discourse  hamlet after uttering a great many sensible extravagancies leaves ophelia firmly convinced of his madness which she affectionately deplores but the king who had heard all his discourse being persuaded that love was not the cause of his melancholy and that there might be danger in it resolves to send him to england to demand the tribute the payment of the tribute which had been long neglected  polonius to whom he communicates this scheme approves of it but advises that the queen should first send for him and in a private conversation entreat him to discover the cause of his uneasiness  the king consents mean time hamlet having engaged some players to represent a piece something like the murder of his father invites the king and queen to the play and he doubting that the spirit that appeared to him might be a lying spirit resoves to make the play the test of the kings conscience he therefore desires his friend horatio to join with him in carefully observing the kings countenance during the representation of one particular scene which resembles the circumstance of his fathers death adding   if his occult guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it it a damned ghost that we have seen   accordingly the king is so much struck with that scene that he rises abruptly and goes out by which hamlet is convinced that the ghost had told him nothing but truth the queen then sends for hamlet with an intention to question him concerning his late behavior and polonius with her consent conceals himself behind the arras to hear their discourse  the queen being frighted at her sons rude treatment of her cries out for help polonius behind the arras echoes her and hamlet supposing it was the king who had concealed himself there kills him  after a severe lecture to his mother he charges her not to discover that his madness is feigned declares that he suspects some treason in the embassy he is sent on to england yet resolves to go and madly takes leave of the king and her for that purpose  ophelia at the news of her fathers being murdered by hamlet grows distracted her brother laertes fired by rage and grief raises a mutiny to revenge his father the king declares that he is innocent of his fathers death informs him of the manner of it and joins with him in conspiring the murder of hamlet  hamlet suspecting the letters his two schoolfellows carried to england contained some dangerous instructions concerning himself steals them and upon examining them finds therein an earnest request from his uncle to the king of england to put him to death on his arrival at his court  hamlet suppresses this letter and writes another in the name of his uncle to the same king in which he desires him to put the bearers of that letter to death this packet he lays in the place from whence he had taken the other  the next day they are attacked by a pyrate they fight and hamlet boarding it alone is taken prisoner and his two companions continue their voyage to england  hamlet prevails upon the pirates to land him in denmark the king hearing of his return urges laertes who breathes nothing but revenge against him to kill him treacherously as they are fencing with foils to which he will engage him by pretending to lay a wager on his superior skill at that exercise  laertes consents and adds that he will anoint the point of his sword with a strong poison that if he draws blood he may be sure to kill him  in the mean time the distracted ophelia is accidentally drowned the king the queen and her brother attend her funeral as soon as she is laid in the earth laertes in a transport of grief leaps into her grave hamlet understanding that it is ophelia whom they had buried wildly asserting his claim as a lover to superior sorrow leaps into the grave likewise where laertes quite overcome with rage and grief furiously fastens on him they are with difficulty parted by the kings command and some time after the king as if nothing had happened sends a message to hamlet requesting him to fence with laertes for a considerable wager hamlet obeys they meet in a hall the king and queen being present  the king to make sure work after drinking hamlets health poisons the wine and offers the cup to hamlet he refuses it and the queen not knowing that the wine is poisoned drinks though the king endeavors to prevent her laertes wounds hamlet with the poisoned rapier in the scuffle they change weapons and hamlet wounds laertes they both bleed the queen is seized with the agonies of death she tells her son that the wine is poisoned and expires  laertes full of remorse for the treachery he had been guilty of confesses the whole contrivance and the part the king had in it hamlet stabs the king with the poisoned sword that had wounded both him and laertes and upon the kings calling for help obliges him to drink of the wine he had poisoned  the king dies and hamlet and laertes exchanging forgiveness with each other both expire hamlet with his last breath commanding his friend horatio who would have killed himself to live and do justice to his fame by declaring his story to the world  the translation of the story of amleth from the danish history of saxogrammaticus i was favored with by a friend the story itself is full of ridiculous fancies wild and improbable circumstances and as it is conducted has more the appearance of a romance than an historical fact  that shakespeare founded his tragedy of hamlet upon it is very plain but is it uncertain whether he saw a literal translation of it or met with the incidents dressed up like a novel and perhaps with those alterations which he has adopted in his play all the principal circumstances are the same in the play as the history in both a prince murders his brother usurps his dignity and marries his widow the son of the murdered prince resolves to revenge his father for that purpose he feigns himself mad and at last accomplishes his design several of the lesser circumstances are also as exactly copied and others have afforded hints for new ones  amleth has a private interview with his mother and kills the spy who had been appointed to overhear their conversation hamlet likewise visits the queen in her apartment and kills polonius who had concealed himself behind the hangings  when the spies are removed the discourse of the two princes is much the same they reproach their mothers with their incestuous marriage sharply reprove them for their crimes declare their madness to be feigned and enjoin them to secresy  the embassy to england is designed after the history shakespeare indeed makes hamlet after two days absence be set on shore again at denmark and amleth in the history arrives in england has his companions hanged and marries the kings daughter before he comes back but shakespeares plan required the immediate return of hamlet however the contrivance of changing the letters are the same and of punishing the treacherous bearers of them shakespeare makes those bearers the schoolfellows and professed friends of hamlet a circumstance which heightens their baseness and justifies the artifice he uses to procure their punishment  the design of entrapping amleth by means of a girl has not been wholly neglected by shakespeare though he manages this incident much more decently ophelia with whom he is in love is ordered to throw herself in his way and the king and his confident listen to their conversation it is very easy to see he took the hint of this stratagem from the story though it is very differently conducted for ophelia is not a loose wanton as in the history but a woman of honor with whom he is in love the accidental killing of her father and her distraction which was caused by it is all his own invention and would have made a very affecting episode if the lady had been more modest in her frenzy and the lover more uniformly afflicted for her death for at his first hearing it he expresses only a slight emotion presently he jumps into her grave fiercely demands to be buried with her fights with her brother for professing to love her then grows calm and never thinks of her any more  the ghost is wholly the invention of shakespeare as is likewise the kings concerted scheme with laertes to kill hamlet treacherously as they fenced or if he failed to poison the wine the king is killed by hamlet both in the history and the play but in the play he is stabbed in the midst of his friends guards and attendants in the history as he is rising in confusion from his bed and unable to draw his sword to defend himself  here the historian romantic as his relation seems has the advantage of the poet in probability after amleth has secured his uncles attendants taken away his sword from him and placed his own which was fastened to the scabbard in its stead it was not difficult for him to kill him disarmed and without any assistance  but shakespeare makes hamlet execute his vengeance on the king in a public hall crowded with his attendants and guards and surrounded by his friends none of these offer to assist him and hamlet has leisure enough after he has stabbed him to make him drink some of the wine he had poisoned lest his sword had not completed the work  the queens death by drinking ignorantly of the poisoned wine is a beautiful stroke of the poets the history shows her unfortunate but shakespeare makes the same man who seduced her to wickedness be her involuntary murderer and at once the cause and punisher of her guilt  shakespeare has with reason been censured for the catastrophe of this tragedy the brave the injured hamlet falls with the murderers he punishes one fate overwhelms alike the innocent and the guilty in the history we find he did not live long after the severe revenge he took for his fathers murder but was unfortunately killed in battle shakespeare would not so far deviate from the history as to leave him happy and in peace though he has hastened his death as well as changed the manner of it he is killed by the treacherous contrivance of the king and laertes is the instrument of that treachery which is afterward turned upon himself  as laertes is a subordinate character in the play it seems to be a fault in shakespeare to show him with a similitude of manners under the same circumstances and acting upon the same principles as hamlet his hero laertes is brave and generous his father is murdered basely as he is informed duty and honor incite him to revenge his death and he does so  this sameness of character and parity of circumstances with the hero lessens his importance and almost divides our attention and concern between them an effect which shakespeare certainly did not intend to produce nor can it be lessened by the consideration of the treacherous measures laertes was prevailed upon to enter into against hamlet who had murdered his father in this he does not differ much from hamlet who did not attempt by open force to revenge his fathers murder on his uncle but designed to accomplish it by subtilty and craft  the same equality is preserved in their deaths and in their actions throughout the play laertes wounds hamlet with the poisoned weapon in the scuffle they change rapiers and hamlet wounds laertes and they exchange forgiveness with each other before they die  thus has shakespeare undesignedly no doubt given us two heroes instead of one in this play the only difference between them is that one of them is a prince the other a nobleman and but for this slight distinction the play might have been as well called the tragedy of laertes as hamlet  it ought to be observed that shakespeare has not been led into this error by the history the character of laertes and all the circumstances relating to him is his own which he has introduced by making the spy who is killed father of laertes  the madness of hamlet seems to be less essential to the play than the history in the latter it affords him the means of executing a contrivance which absurd as it is secures the accomplishment of his revenge but in the play it is of no other use than to enliven the dialogue unless its usefulness may be deduced from its bringing on such accidents as it was assumed to prevent for hamlets madness alarms the kings suspicion and that produces the treacherous embassy to england which failing the contrivance of the poisoned rapier followed and that does the business  but since the kings conscious guilt and terror might reasonably have created a distrust of hamlet and that distrust and a desire of security induced him to seek his death what need had shakespeare to make his heros sense and discretion appear doubtful by showing him feigning a madness destructive to his safety and which he himself knows to be so and yet persists in  shakespeare has indeed followed the history in making hamlet feign himself mad but that madness being of no consequence to the principal design of the play as it is in the history or if of consequence it hurts the reputation of his hero it is certainly a fault for at least he only produces the same events by a blunder which might have happened without it  the violation of poetical justice is not the only fault that arises from the death of hamlet the revenging his fathers murder is the sole end of all his designs and the great business of the play and the noble and fixed resolution of hamlet to accomplish it makes up the most shining part of his character yet this great end is delayed till after hamlet is mortally wounded he stabs the king immediately upon the information of his treachery to himself thus his revenge becomes interested and he seems to punish his uncle rather for his own death than the murder of the king his father  finis books printed for a
