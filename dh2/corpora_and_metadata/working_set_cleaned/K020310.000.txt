prologue and epilogue would not have published them had it not been customary to print them with the play he is very sensible that they can have little or no merit in the reading their effect wholly depending upon the characters which speak them and the novelty of introducing them they were likewise written at a very short warning for the author of the play had not provided these usual and therefore necessary parts of the performance which mr garrick thought proper to provide at all events  dramatis personae barbarossa mr mossop achmet mr garrick othman mr havard sadi mr davies aladin

advertisement tragedy as it was anciently composed has been ever held the gravest moralest and most profitable of all other poems hence philosophers and other gravest writers as cicero plutarch and others frequently cite out of tragic poets both to adorn and illustrate their discourse the apostle paul himself thought it not unworthy to insert a verse of a greek poet into the text of holy scripture  heretofore men in highest dignity have labored not a little to be thought able to compose a tragedy of that honor dionysius the elder was no less ambitious than before of his attaining to the tyranny augustus caesar also had begun his ajax but unable to please his own judgment left it unfinished sencca the philosopher is by some thought the author of those tragedies at least the best of them that go under that name gregory nazianzen a father of the church thought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a tragedy which is entitled christ suffering this is mentioned to vindicate tragedy from the small esteem or rather infamy which in the account of many it undergoes at this day  so sar the great milton who strengthened these examples by his own the author has nothing more to add save only that he has aimed to write this piece in its essential parts according to the model of ancient tragedy so far as modern ideas and manners would permit and he is so gratefully senssble of that favorable reception it has met with from the public that in every future attempt he will assuredly labor to merit their farther regarcs by keeping in his eye the same great originals  barbarossa act   enter othman and a slave othman a stranger say thou that inquires of othman  slave he does and waits admittance  othman did he tell his name and quality  slave that he declined but called himself thy friend  othman where did thou see him  slave even now while twilight closed the day i spied him musing amid the ruins of yon tower that overhangs the flood on my approach with aspect stern and words of import dark he questioned me of othman then the tear stole from his eye but when i talked of power and courtly honors here conferred on thee his frown grew darker all i wished he cried is to confer with him and then to die  othman what may this mean  conduct the stranger to me exit slave perhaps some worthy citizen returned from voluntary exile to algiers once known in happier days enter sadi ah sadi here my honored friend  sadi stand off  pollute me not these honest arms though worn with want disdain thy gorgeous trappings earned by foul dishonor  othman forbear thy rash reproaches for beneath this habit which to thy mistaken eye bespeaks my guilt i wear a heart as true as sadis to my king  sadi why then beneath this cursed roof this black usurpers palace dare thou to draw infected air and live the slave of insolence why lick the dust beneath his feet who laid algiers in ruin but age which should have taught thee honest caution has taught thee treachery  othmam mistaken man could passion prompt me to licentious speech like thine   sadi peace false one peace the slave to power still wears a pliant tongue  o shame to dwell with murder lust and rapine  did he not come from the depths of barcas solitude with fair pretense of faith and firm alliance did not our grateful king with open arms receive him as his guest o fatal hour did he not then with hot adultrous eye gaze on the queen zaphira yes twas lust lust gave the infernal whisper to his soul and bade him murder if he would enjoy o complicated horrors hellborn treachry then fell our country when good selim died yet thou pernicious traitor unabashd can wear the murdrers badge  othman yet hear me sadi   sadi what can dishonor plead  othman yet blame not prudence  sadi prudence the stale pretense of every knave the traitors ready mask  othman yet still i love thee yet unprovoked by thy intemperate zeal bethink thee  might i not insult thy flight with the foul names of fear or perfidy did thou not fly when barbarossas sword reekd with the blood of thy brave countrymen what then did i  beneath this hated roof in pity to my widowed queen   sadi in pity  othman yes sadi heaven is witness pity swayed me  sadi words words dissimulation all and guilt  othman with honest guile i did inroll my name in the black list of barbarossas friends in hope that some propitious hour might rise when heaven would dash the murderer from his throne and give young selim to his orphand people  sadi indeed can thou be true  othman by heaven i am  sadi why then dissemble thus  othman have i not told thee i held it vain to stem the tyrants power by the weak sallies of an illtimed rage  sadi enough i find thee honest and with pride will join thy councils this my faithful arm wasted with misery shall gain new nerves for brave resolves can aught my friend be done can aught be dared  othman we groan beneath the scourge this very morn on false pretense of vengeance for the foul murder of our honored king five guiltless wretches perished on the rack our longlovd friends and bravest citizens selfbanishd to the desert mourn in exile while the fell tyrant lords it over a crew of abject sycophants the needy tools of power usurped and a degenerate train of slaves in arms  sadi o my devoted country  but say the widowed queen  my heart bleeds for her  othman if pain be life she lives but in such woe as want and slavery might view with pity and bless their happier lot hemmed round by terrors within this cruel palace once the seat of every joy through sevn long tedious years she weeps her murdered lord her exiled son her people fallen the murderer of her lord returning now from conquest over the moors tempts her to marriage spurred at once by lust and black ambition but with noble firmness surpassing the female she rejects his vows scorning the horrid union meantime he with ceaseless hate pursues her exiled son and  oh detested monster he weeps sadi yet more deeds of cruelty just heaven  othman his rage pursues the virtuous youth even into foreign climes ere this perhaps he bleeds a murdering ruffian is sent to watch his steps and plunge the dagger into his guiltless breast  sadi is this thy faith tamely to witness to such deeds of horror give me thy poignard lead me to the tyrant what though surrounding guards   othman repress thy fury thou will alarm the palace wilt involve thyself thy friend in ruin haste thee hence haste to the remnant of our loyal friends and let maturer councils rule thy zeal  sadi yet let us never forget our princes wrongs remember othman and let vengeance rise how in the pangs of death and in his gore weltring we found our prince the deadly dagger deep in his heart was fixed his royal blood the lifeblood of his people over the bath ran purple o remember and revenge  othman doubt not my zeal but haste and seek our friends near to the western port almanzor dwells yet unseducd by barbarossas power he will disclose to thee if aught be heard of selims safety or what more i dread of selims death thence best may our resolves be drawn hereafter but let caution guide thee for in these walks where tyranny and guilt usurp the throne wakeful suspicion dwells and squinteyed jealousy prone to pervert even looks and smiles to treason  sadi i obey thee near to the western port thou say  othman even there close by the blasted palm tree where the mosque oerlooks the city haste thee hence my friend i would not have thee found within these walls flourish and hark  these warlike sounds proclaim the approach of the proud barbarossa with his train begone   sadi may dire disease and pestilence hang over his steps  farewell  remember othman thy queens thy princes and thy countrys wrongs  exit sadi othman when i forget them be contempt my lot yet for the love i bear them i must wrap my deep resentments in the specious guise of smiles and fair deportment  enter barbarossa guards etc barbarossa valiant othman are these vile slaves impaled  othman my lord they are  barbarossa did not the rack extort confession from them  othman they died obdurate while the melting crowd murmured out pity for their groans and anguish  barbarossa curse on their womanish hearts what pity slaves whom my supreme decree condemned to torture are you not all my slaves to whom my nod gives life or death  othman to doubt thy will is treason  barbarossa i love thee faithful othman but why sits that sadness on thy brow for often i find thee musing and sad while joy for my return my sword victorious and the moor toerthrown resounds through all my palace  othman mighty warrior the soul intent on offices of love will often neglect or scorn the weaker proof which smiles or speech can give  barbarossa well be it so to guard algiers from anarchys misrule i sway the regal scepter who deserves shall meet protection and who merits not shall meet my wrath in thunder  but it is strange that when with open arms i would receive young selim would restore the crown which death reft from his fathers head  he scorns my bounty shuns me with sullen and obdurate hate and proudly kindles war in foreign climes against my power who saved his bleeding country  othman it is strange indeed   enter aladin aladin brave prince i bring thee tidings of high concernment to algiers and thee young selim is no more  othman indeed  barbarossa indeed  why that astonishment he was our bitterest foe  othman so perish all thy causeless enemies  barbarossa what says the rumor how died the prince and where  aladin the rumor tells that flying to oran he there begged succors from ferdinand of spain tinvade algiers  barbarossa from christian dogs  othman how league with infidels  aladin and there held council with the haughty spaniard to conquer and dethrone thee but in vain for in a dark encounter with two slaves wherein the one fell by his dauntless valor selim at length was slain  barbarossa ungrateful boy often have i courted him to meet my kindness but still in vain he shunned me like a pestilence nor could i ever behold him since the down covered his manly cheek  how many years numbered he  othman i think scarce thirteen when his father died and now some twenty  barbarossa othman now for proof of undissembled service  well i know thy longexperiencd faith has placed thee high in the queens confidence the crown i wear yet totters on my head till marriagerites have made her mine othman she must be won plead thou my cause of love bid her dry up her fruitless tears paint forth her long delays wake all thy eloquence make her but mine and such unsought reward shall crown thy zeal as shall outsoar thy wishes  othman mighty king where duty bids i go  barbarossa then haste thee othman ere yet the rumor of her sons decease has reached her ear ere yet the mournful tale has whelmed her in a new abyss of woe and quenched all soft affection save for him tell her i come borne on the wings of love  haste  fly  i follow thee exit othman now aladin now fortune bears us to the wished for port we ride secure on her most prosperous billow this was the rock i dreaded do not think the attempt was greatly daring  aladin ay and necessary what booted it to cut the old serpent off while the young adder nested in his place  barbarossa true we have conquered now algiers is mine without a rival thus great souls aspire and boldly snatch at crowns beyond the reach of coward conscience  yet i wonder much omar returns not omar whom i sent on this high trust i fear it is he has fallen did thou not say two slaves encountered selim  aladin ay two it is rumored so  barbarossa and that one fell  aladin even so by selims hand while his companion planted his happier steel in selims heart  barbarossa omar i fear is fallen from my right hand i gave my signet to the trusty slave and bade him send it as the certain pledge of selims death if sickness or captivity or wayward fate should thwart his quick return  aladin the rumor yet is young perhaps foreruns the trusty slaves approach  barbarossa well wait the event meantime give out that now the widowed queen has dried her tears prepared to crown my love by marriagerites spread wide the flattering tale for if persuasion win not her consent power shall compel  aladin it is indeed a thought which prudence whispers  barbarossa thou brave aladin have been the firm companion of my deeds soon shall my friendships warmth reward thy faith  this night my will devotes to feast and joy for conquest over the moor hence aladin and see the nightwatch close the palace round exit aladin now to the queen my heart expands with hope let high ambition flourish in selims blood its root is struck from this the rising stem proudly shall branch over africs continent and stretch from shore to shore enter irene what drowned in tears still with thy folly thwart each purpose of my soul when pleasures spring beneath our feet thou spurnst the proffered boon to dwell with sorrow  why these sullen tears  irene let not these tears offend my fathers eye they are the tears of pity from the queen i come thy suppliant  barbarossa on some rude request what would thou urge  irene thy dread return from war and proffered love have opened every wound the soft and lenient hand of time had closed if ever gentle pity touched thy heart now let it melt urge not thy harsh command to see her her distracted soul is bent to mourn in solitude she asks no more  barbarossa she mocks my love how many tedious years have i endured her coyness had not war and great ambition called me from algiers ere this my power had reaped what she denies but there is a cause which touches on my peace and bids me brook no more her false delays  irene o frown not thus sure pity never deserved a parents frown then look more kindly on me let thy consenting pity mix with mine and heal the woes of weeping majesty unhappy queen  barbarossa what means that gushing tear  irene oh never shall irene taste of peace while poor zaphira mourns   barbarossa is this my child perverse and stubborn  as thou love thy peace dry up thy tears what damp the general triumph that echoes through algiers which now shall pierce the vaulted heaven as soon as fame shall spread young selims death my empires bitterest foe  irene o generous selim  barbarossa ah there is more in this tell me irene on thy duty tell me as thou do wish i would not cast thee off with an incensed fathers curses on thee now tell me why at this detested name afresh thy sorrow streams  irene yes i will tell thee for he is gone and dreads thy hate no more my father knows that scarce five moons are past since the moors seized and sold me at oran a hopeless captive in a foreign clime  barbarossa too well i know and rue the fatal day but what of this  irene why should i tell what horrors did then beset my soul  often have i told thee how midst the throng a youth appeared his eye bright as the morning star  barbarossa and was it selim did he redeem thee  irene with unsparing hand he paid the allotted ransom and ocrbade avarice and appetite at his feet i wept dissolved in tears of gratitude and joy but when i told my quality and birth he started at the name of barbarossa and thrice turned pale yet with recovery mild go to algiers he cried protect my mother and be to her what selim is to thee  even such my father was the generous youth who by the hands of bloody bloody men lies numbered with the dead  barbarossa amazement chills me was this thy unknown friend concealed from me false faithless child  irene could gratitude do less he said thy hate pursued him thence conjured me not to reveal his name  barbarossa thou treacherous maid to stoop to freedom from thy fathers foe  irene alas my father he never was thy foe  barbarossa what  plead for selim away he merited the death he found oh coward traitress to thy fathers glory thou should have lived a slave  been sold to shame been banished to the depth of howling deserts been aught but what thou art rather than blot a fathers honor by a deed so vile  hence from my sight  hence thou unthankful child beware thee shun the queen nor taint her ear with selims fate yes she shall crown my love or by our prophet she shall dread my power  exit barbarossa irene unhappy queen to what new scenes of horror art thou doomed o cruel father hapless child whom pity compels to call him cruel  generous selim poor injured queen who but entreats to die in her dear fathers tents thither good queen my care shall speed thee while suspicion sleeps what though my frowning father pour his rage on my defenseless head yet innocence shall yield her firm support and conscious virtue gild all my days could i but save zaphira let the storm beat i will weep and pray till she and heaven forget my father ever was cruel  act ii zaphira and female slaves discovered zaphira when shall i be at peace  o righteous heaven strengthen my fainting soul which fain would rise to confidence in thee  but woes on woes overwhelm me first my husband now my son both dead both slaughtered by the bloody hand of barbarossa sweet content farewell farewell sweet hope grief is my portion here o dire ambition what infernal power unchaind thee from thy native depth of hell to stalk the earth with thy destructive train murder and lust to waste domestic peace and every heartfelt joy enter othman o faithful othman our fears were true my selim is no more  othman has then the fatal story reached thine ear inhuman tyrant  zaphira strike him heaven with thunder nor let zaphira doubt thy providence  othman twas what we feared accuse not heavens high will nor struggle with the tenfold chain of fate that links thee to thy woes o

barbarossa he means to see thee   zaphira curses blast the tyrant does he assume the name of king  othman he does  zaphira o title vilely purchased by the blood of innocence by treachry and murder may

surviving prop can thou devise no secret means by which i may escape this hated palace with undaunted step i would roam the waste to reach my fathers vales of dear mutija  can no means be found to fly these blackning horrors that surround me  othman that hope is vain the tyrant knows thy hate hence day and night his watchful guards surround thee impenetrable as walls of adamant curb then thy mighty griefs justice and truth he mocks as shadows rouse not then his anger let soft persuasion and mild eloquence redeem that liberty which stern rebuke would rob thee of for ever  zaphira cruel task for royalty to bow  an injured queen to kneel for liberty and oh to whom even to the murderer of her lord and son o perish first zaphira yes i will die for what is life to me my dear dear lord my hapless child yes i will follow you  othman will thou not see him then  zaphira i will not othman or if i do with bitter imprecation more keen than poison shot from serpents tongues i will pour my curses on

there paint my countless woes his kindling rage shall wake the valleys into honest vengeance the sudden storm shall pour on barbarossa and every glowing warrior steep his shaft in deadlier poison to revenge my wrongs  othman there spoke the queen but as thou love thy freedom touch not on selims fate thy soul will kindle and passion mount in flames that will consume thee  zaphira my murdered son yes to revenge thy death i will speak a language which my heart disdains  othman peace peace the tyrant comes now injured queen plead for thy freedom hope for just revenge and check each rising passion  exit othman enter barbarossa barbarossa hail sovereign fair thrice honored queen in whom beauty and majesty conspire to charm behold the conquror whose deciding voice can speak the fate of kingdoms at thy feet lies conquered by thy power  zaphira o barbarossa no more the pride of conquest ever can charm my widowed heart with my departed lord my love lies buried i should meet thy flame with sullen tears and cold indifference then turn thee to some happier fair whose heart may crown thy growing love with love sincere for i have none to give  barbarossa love never should die it is the souls cordial it is the fount of life therefore should spring eternal in the breast one object lost another should succeed and all our life be love  zaphira urge me no more  thou might with equal hope woo the cold marble weeping over a tomb to meet thy wishes but if generous love dwell in thy breast vouchsafe me proof sincere give me safe convoy to my native vales of dear mutija where my father reigns  barbarossa o blind to proffered bliss what fondly quit this lofty palace and the envied pomp of empire for an arabs wandering tent where the mock chieftain leads his vagrant tribes from plain to plain as thirst or famine sways obscurely vain and faintly shadows out the majesty of kings  far other joys here shall attend thy call the winged bark for thee shall traverse seas and every clime be tributary to zaphiras charms to thee exalted fair submissive realms shall bow the neck and swarthy kings and queens from the fardistant niger and the nile drawn captive at my conquering charriotwheels shall kneel before thee  zaphira pomp and power are toys which even the mind at ease may well disdain but ah what mockery is the tinsel pride of splendour when by wasting woes the mind lies desolate within  such such is mine overwhelmed with ills and dead to every joy envy me not this last request to die in my dear fathers tents  barbarossa thy suit is vain   zaphira thus kneeling at thy feet   barbarossa thou thankless fair thus to repay the labors of my love had i not siezd the throne when selim died ere this thy foes had laid algiers in ruin i checked the warring powers and gave you peace  zaphira peace do thou call it what can worse be feared from the wars rage than violence and blood have not unceasing horrors marked thy reign through sevn long years thy slaughtring

ought while night drew on we leapt upon our prey full at his heart brave omar aimed the poignard which selim shunning wrenchd it from his hand then plunged it in his breast i hasted on too late to save yet i revenged my friend my thirsty dagger with repeated blow searched every artery they fell together gasping in folds of mortal enmity and thus in frowns expired  barbarossa well have thou sped thy dagger did its office faithful achmet and high reward shall wait thee  one thing more  be the thought fortunate  go seek the queen for know the rumor of her selims death has reached her ear hence

shunned the impending uproar  othman there is a solemn horror in the night too that pleases me a general pause through nature the winds are hushed   sadi and as i passed the beach the lazy billow scarce could lash the shore nor star peeps through the firmament of heaven   selim and lo  where eastward over the sullen wave the waining moon deprived of half her orb rises in blood her beam wellnigh extinct faintly contents with darkness  bell tolls hark  what meant that tolling bell  othman it rings the midnight watch  sadi this was the signal  come othman we are called the passing minutes chide our delay brave othman let us hence  selim one last embrace  nor doubt but crowned with glory we soon shall meet again but oh remember amid tumults rage remember mercy stain not a righteous cause with guiltless blood warn our brave friends that we unsheath the sword not to destroy but save nor let blind zeal or wanton cruelty ever turn its edge on age or innocence or bid us stab where the most pitying angel in the skies that now looks on us from his blessed abode would wish that we should spare  othman so may we prosper as mercy shall direct us  selim farewell friends  sadi intrepid prince farewell  ex oath and sadi selim now sleep and silence brood over the city  the devoted sentinel now takes his lonely stand and idly dreams of that tomorrow which shall never come in this dread interval o busy thought from outward things descend into thyself search deep my heart bring with thee awful conscience and firm resolve that in the approaching hour of blood and horror i may stand unmoved nor fear to strike where justice calls nor dare to strike where she forbids  why bear i then this dark insidious dagger  it is the badge of vile assassins of the coward hand that dares not meet its foe  detested thought yet  as foul lust and murder though on thrones triumphant still retain their hellborn quality so justice groaning beneath countless wrongs quits not her spotless and celestial nature but in the unhallowed murderers disguise can sanctify this steel then be it so  witness ye powers of heaven that not from you but from the murdrers eye i wrap myself in night  to you i stand revealed in noontide day  oh could i arm my hand with war then like to you arrayed in storm and fire my swiftavenging thunder should blast this tyrant but since fate denies that
