i to be your sancho while your knight errantship is running away with this dulcinea del toboso   wilson i have given orders that my postchaise shall wait in the broad way by exeterchange and the moment the lady steps from her chair to the chaise the postilions will crack their whips and drive away like lightning   mervin you are a romantic fellow  how can you possibly imagine that your hotheaded scheme to run away with this young lady can ever be executed   wilson from the justice of my cause jack   mervin justice  make that out and my conscience will be easy   wilson did not her fathers uncle who was a good lawyer and cheated my father of threefourths of his fortune leave her near thirty thousand pounds  now this is my reasoning  sir tobys uncle ran away with some thousands from my father i shall run away with sir tobys daughter this will bring the said thousands back to me again with which i will pay off old scores strike a balance in my favor and get a good wife into the bargain  there is justice for you   mervin aye justice with a vengeance but why must sir toby be punished for the sins of his uncle   wilson i will ease your conscience there too  my mother at my fathers death took me a boy to sir toby and my lady to solicit their kindness for me  he gave me half a crown to buy gingerbread and her ladyship who was combing a fat lapdog muttered  there was no end of maintaining poor relations   mervin i have not a qualm left  but did you really pass for a strolling player last summer to have a pretense of being near her fathers house   wilson yes i did and as polonius says was accounted a good actor   mervin what could put that unaccountable frolic in your head   wilson to gain the favor of sir tobys family as a strolling player which i could not as a poor relation  they are fond of acting to madness and my plan succeeded i was so altered they did not know me  they liked me much came to a benefit which i pretended to have invited me to their house and miss met me privately after i had played ranger and lothario   mervin aye aye when a young ladys head is crammed with combustible scraps of plays  she is always ready primd and will go off if you will allow me a pun the very first opportunity   wilson i discovered myself to the young lady and her generosity was so great that she resolved to marry me to make me amends  there are refined feelings for you   mervin aye double refined  she is more romantic than you will  but did not you run a great risque of losing her when she knew you was only a gentleman and not a player   wilson read that letter and tell me if my castles are built in the air gives a letter   mervin reads i shall be with my papa and mama to see a rehearsal at drury lane playhouse on tuesday morning if my present inclinations hold and my heart does not fail me i may convince honest ranger what confidence i have in his honor  postscript  if i dont see you then i dont know when i shall see you for we return into the country next week    wilson well what think you   mervin o she will run away with you most certainly    wilson i must not lose time then looking at his watch i must go and take my stand that the deer may not escape me   mervin and i will go and take mine to help you to carry off the venson  this is very like poaching will  but how will you get admittance into drurylane theater   wilson i was very near being disappointed there for unluckily the acting manager who scarce reached to my third button cocked up his head in my face and said i was much too tall for a hero  however i got the liberty of the scenes by desiring to rehearse hamlet next week  but i hope to cross the tweed with the fair ophelia before that time and finish my stage adventures by appearing the first time in the character of a good husband   mervin success attend you   wilson  this is the day makes me or marrs for ever and for aye  if i succeed i shall be restored to my fathers estate drink claret and live like a gentleman with the wife of my heart  and egad for aught i know stand for the county   mervin if not  you must be confined to your little one hundred and twenty pounds a year farm make your own cheese marry the curates daughter have a dozen children and brew the best october in the parish   wilson which ever way fortune will dispose of me i shall be always happy to see my friends and never shall forget my obligations to thee my dear jack shakes him by the hand   mervin well well  let us away  we have too much business to mind compliments exeunt severally   scene ii the playhouse two women sweeping the stage first woman come betty dust away dust away girl the managers will be here presently there is no lying in bed for them now we are up early and late all hurry and bustle from morning to night i wonder what the deuce they have got in their heads   second woman why to get money mrs besom to be sure the folks say about us that the other house will make them stir their stumps and they will make us stir ours if they are in motion we must not stand still mrs besom   first woman ay ay girl they have met with their match and we shall all suffer for it  for my part i cannot go through the work if they are always in this plaguey hurry i have not drank a comfortable dish of tea since the house opened   second woman one had better die than be scolded and hurried about as we are by the housekeeper he takes us all for a parcel of negers i believe pray give us a pinch of your snuff mrs besom they lean upon their brooms and take snuff   first woman between you and i betty and our two brooms the housekeeper is grown a little purseproud he thinks himself a great actor forsooth since he played the scotch fellow and the fat cook in queen mab   second woman the quality spoils him too why woman he talks to them for all the world as if he was a lord   first woman i shall certainly resign as the great folks call it in the news paper if they will not promise to give me the first dressers place that falls and make our little tommy a page what woman though we are well paid for our work we ought to make sure of something when our brooms are taken from us  it is the fashion betty   second woman right right mrs besom service is no inheritance and to be always doing dirty work and to have no prospect to rest and clean ourselves is the curse only of us poor folks   first woman you and i will drink a dish of tea together in comfort this afternoon and talk over these and other matters  but mum  here is the prompter they sing and sweep again   enter hopkins the prompter prompter come come away with your brooms and clear the stage the managers will be here directly the sweepers hurry of where are the carpenters  carpenters   a carpenter above what do you want mr hopkins   prompter what do i want come down and set the scenes for the new burletta of orpheus   carpenter we ant ready for it the beasts are now in hand  they ant finished   prompter not finished the beasts here is fine work the managers and author will be here directly and nothing ready  fie fie fie  saunders  saunders  calls out   enter saunders saunders here here  zooks what a bawling you make do keep your breath for your prompting master hopkins and not send it after me at this rate  i am not deaf   prompter but your men are and asleep too i believe i cannot get a soul of em near me it is ten oclock looking at his watch and not a scene prepared for the rehearsal it is i shall be blamed and not you   saunders blamed for what it is but a rehearsal and of one act only  would you have us to finish our work before the poet has done his dont you know that carpenters are always the last in a house and yet you want us to get out of it before the author has covered in   prompter you may be as witty as you please but the managers will do as they please and they have promised the author to rehearse the first act of his burletta of orpheus this morning as he pleases with all the proper scenes dresses machinery and music so what signifies all our prating   saunders very little as you say  but damn all these new vagaries that put us all upon our heads topsy versy  my men have sat up all night and i have finished every thing but the dancing cows   prompter bless my heart man the author depends most upon his cows   saunders his cows  how came they to be his they are my cows  these poets are pretty fellows faith they say i will have a flying devil or a dancing bear or any such conundrum why it is easily said but who is to make em fly and dance ha mr prompter why poor pill garlic  the audience applauds the author is conceited but the carpenter is never thought of   prompter these are bold truths mr saunders   saunders why then out with em i say  great men spin the brains of the little ones and take the credit of em  do you know how i was served in our dramatic romance of cymon   prompter you did your business well there particularly in the last scene   saunders and what was the consequence one fine gentleman in the boxes said  my master brought it from italy  no damn it says another taking snuff i saw the very same thing at paris when you all know here behind the scenes that the whole design came from this head and the execution from these hands  but nothing can be done by an englishman now a days and so your servant mr hopkins  going   prompter harkee saunders  the managers have ordered me to discharge the man at the lightning he was so drunk the last time he flashed that he has singed all the clouds on that side the stage pointing to the clouds   saunders yes yes i see it and harkee  he has burnt a hole in the new cascade and set fire to the shower of rain  but mum    prompter the deuce  he must be discharged directly  exit saunders   manager without where is the prompter   prompter here i am sir   enter patent patent make haste with your scenes saunders so clear the stage mr hopkins and let us go to business is the extraordinary author of this very extraordinary performance come yet   prompter not yet sir but we shall be soon ready for him  it is a very extraordinary thing indeed to rehearse only one act of a performance and with dresses and decorations as if it were really before an audience   patent it is a novelty indeed and a little expensive too but we could not withstand the solicitations tha t were made to us we shall not often repeat the same experiment   prompter i hope not sir  it is a very troublesome one and the performers murmur greatly at it   patent when do the performers not murmur mr hopkins  has any morning passed in your time without some grievance or another   prompter i have half a dozen now in my pocket for you feeling in his pockets for papers   patent o pray let us have em my old breakfast  prompter gives em  and the old story  actresses quarrelling about parts there is not one of em but thinks herself young enough for any part and not a young one but thinks herself capable of any part  but their betters quarrel about what they are not fit for so our ladies have at least great precedents for their folly   prompter the young fellow from edinburgh will not accept of the second lord he desires to have the first   patent i dont doubt it  well well if the author can make him speak english i have no objection   prompter mr rantly is indisposed and cannot play tomorrow   patent well well let his lungs rest a little they want it i am sure  what a campaign shall we make of it all our subalterns will be general officers and our generals will only fight when they please   glib without o he is upon the stage is he  i will go to him    patent here comes the author do you prepare the people for the rehearsal  desire them to be as careful as if they were to perform before an audience   prompter i will sir  pray let us know when we must begin  exit prompter   enter glib the author glib dear mr patent am not i too late do make me happy at once  i have been upon the rack this half hour  but the ladies mr patent  the ladies    patent but where are the ladies sir   author they will be here in the drinking of a cup of tea  i left em all at breakfast  lady fuz cannot stir from home without some refreshment  sir macaroni virtu was not come when i left them he generally sits up all night and if he gets up before two oclock he only walks in his sleep all the rest of the day  he is perhaps the most accomplished connoisseur in the three kingdoms yet he is never properly awake till other people go to bed  however if he should come our little performance i believe will rouse him  ha ha ha  you understand me  a pinch of cephalic only   patent i have the honor of knowing him a little  will sir macaroni be here   author why he promised but he is too polite to be punctual  you understand me  ha ha ha  however i am pretty sure we shall see him  i have a secret for you  not a soul must know it  he has composed two of the songs in my burletta  an admirable musician  but particular  he has no great opinion of me nor indeed of any body else a very tolerable one of himself  and so i believe he will come  you understand me ha ha ha   patent i do sir  but pray mr glib why did not you complete your burletta  it is very new with us to rehearse but one act only   author by a sample mr patent you may know the piece if you approve you shall never want novelty  i am a very spider at spinning my own brains ha ha ha always at it  spin spin spin  you understand me   patent extremely well  in your second act i suppose you intend to bring orpheus into hell    author o yes  i make him play the devil there  i send him for some better purpose than to fetch his wife ha ha ha  dont mistake me  while he is upon earth i make him a very good sort of a man  he keeps a mistress indeed but his wifes dead you know  and were she alive not much harm in that  for i make him a man of fashion  fashion you know is all in all  you understand me  upon a qualm of conscience he quits his mistress and sets out for hell with a resolution to fetch his wife    patent is that too like a man of fashion mr glib   author no that is the moral part of him  he is a mixed character  but as he approaches and gets into the infernal regions his principles melt away by degrees as it were by the heat of the climate  and finding that his wife eurydice is kept by pluto he immediately makes up to proserpine and is kept by her then they all four agree matters amicably  change partners as one may say make a genteel party quarree and finish the whole with a song and a chorus  and a stinger it is  the subject of the song is  the old proverb exchange is no robbery and the chorus runs thus  we care not or know in matters of love what is doing above but this this is the fashion below i believe that is true satire mr patent  strong and poignant  you understand me   patent o very well  it is chian pepper indeed  a little will go a great way   author i make orpheus see in my hell all sorts of people of all degrees and occupations  ay and of both sexes  that is not very unnatural i believe  there shall be very good company too i assure you high life below stairs as i call it ha ha ha you take me  a double edge  no boys play  rip and tear  the times require it  forte  fortissime    patent will not it be too forte  take care mr glib not to make it so much above proof that the boxes cannot taste it  take care of empty boxes   author empty boxes  i will engage that my cerberus alone shall fill the boxes for a month   patent cerberus   author be quiet a little  you know i suppose that cerberus is a dog and has three heads   patent i have heard as much   author then you shall see some sport  he shall be a comical dog too i warrant you  ha ha ha   patent what is cerberus a character in your performance   author capital capital  i have thrown all my fancy and invention into his mouth or rather mouths  there are three of em you know   patent most certainly if there are three heads   author poh that is nothing to what i have in petto for you  observe me now  when orpheus comes to the gates of hell  cerberus stops him  but how how  now for it  guess    patent upon my soul i cannot guess   author i make his three heads sing a trio   patent a trio   author a trio i knew i should hit you  a trio treble tenor and bass  and what shall they sing nothing in the world but bow wow wow  orpheus begins   o bark not cerberus nor grin  a stranger sure to pass within your goodness will allow bow wow wow  treble tenor and bass  then orpheus shall tickle his lyre and treble tenor and bass shall fall asleep by degrees and one after another fainter and fainter  bow wow wow  fast  you understand me   patent very ingenious and very new  i hope the critics will understand it   author i will make every body understand it or my name is not derry down glib  when i write the whole town shall understand me  you understand me   patent not very clearly sir  but it is no matter  here is your company   enter sir toby lady fun sir macaroni virtu and miss fuz author ladies and gentlemen you do me honor mr patent  sir toby and miss fuz and this sir macaroni

at him  and yet i am frighted out of my wits aside and looking about   sir toby now the manager is gone one may venture to say that the playhouse is no morning beauty paint and candle light are as great friends to the theaters as to the ladies they hide many wrinkles  dont they mr glib ha ha ha   author you have hit it sir toby and this is the old house too ha ha ha sir toby shows his daughter the scenes   lady fuz looking about with a glass my dear sir toby you you may be as sarcastical as you please but i protest a playhouse is a prodigious odd sort of a thing now there is nobody in it  is it not sir macaroni   sir macaroni o yes and a prodigious odd sort of a thing when it is full too  i abominate a playhouse my ingenious countrymen have no taste now for the high seasoned comedies and i am sure that i have none for the pap and loplolly of our present writers   author bravo sir micaroni  i would not give a pin for a play no more than a partridge that has not the fumet   sir macaroni not amiss faith ha ha ha   lady fuz dont let us lose time mr glib  if they are not ready for the rehearsal suppose the manager entertains us with thunder and lightning  and let us see his

galleries fell a laughing and clapping  i jogged and pulled him till my arms achd and if the boxkeeper had not luckily opened the door and sir toby fell headlong into the passage i should have died

a cordial now and then for the poor author speaking to the audience and making a sign of clapping    during the burletta glib the author goes out and comes in several times upon the stage and speaks occasionally to the performers as his fancy prompts him in order to enliven the action and give a proper comic spirit to the performance overture to the burletta of orpheus the curtain rises to soft

much to him   author this is my conception of the matter  bow your body gently turn your head semicircularly on one side and the other and smiling thus agreeably begin  all fable is figure  i your bard will maintain it and least you dont know it it is fit i explain it the lyre of our orpheus means your approbation which frees the poor poet from care and vexation should want make his mistress too keen to dispute your smiles fill his pockets  and madam is mute should his wife that is himself for they two are but one be in hell that is in debt and the money all gone your favor brings comfort at once cures the evil for scaping bum builiffs is scaping the devil nay cerberus critics their fury will drop for such barking monsters your smiles are a sop but how to explain what you most will require that cows sheep and calves should dance after the lyre without your kind favor how scanty each meal but with it comes dancing beef mutton and veal for sing it or say it this truth we all see your applause will be ever the true beaume de vie  finis
