the impertinent or a visit to the court a satyr  by an eminent hand  london printed for john wileord behind the chapter house near st pauls       the impertinent or a visit to the court a satyr well if it be my time to quit the stage adieu to all the follies of the age i die in charity with fool and knave secure of happiness beyond the grave i have had my purgatory here betimes and paid for all my satires all my rhymes the poets hell its tortures fiends and flames to this were trifles toys and empty names with foolish pride my heart was never fired nor the vain itch tadmire or be admired i hoped for no commission from his grace i bought no benefice i begged no place had no newverses or new suit to show yet went to court  the devilish would have it so but as the fool that in reforming days would go to mass in jest as story says could not but think to pay his fine was odd since twas no formed design of serving god such was my fate whom heaven adjudgd as proud as prone to ill as negligent of good as deep in debt without a thought to pay as vain as idle and as false as they who live at court for going once that way scarce was i entered when behold there came a thing which adam had been posed to name noah had refused it lodging in his ark where all the race of reptiles might embark a verier monster than on africks shore the sun ere got or slimy nilus bore or sloane or woodwards wondrous shelves contain nay all that lying travelers can feign this thing has traveled speaks each language too and knows what is fit for every state to do of whofe best phrase and courtly accent joined he forms one tongue exotic and refined talkers i have learned to bear mttx i knew henley himself i have heard nay bdgl too the doctors wormwood style the hash of tongues a pedant makes the storm of gsns lungs the whole artillry of the terms of war and all those plagues in one the bawling bar these i could bear but not a rogue so civil whose tongue can complement you to the devil a tongue that can cheat widows cancel scores make scots speak treason cozen subtlest whores with royal favorites in flattery vie and oldmixon and burnet both outlie he spies me out i whisper gracious god what sin of mine could merit such a rod that all the shot of dullness now must be from this thy blunderbuss discharged on me well met he cries and happy sure for each for i am pleased to learn and you to teach what speech esteem you most  the kings said i but the best words  o sir the dictionary you miss my aim i mean the most acute and perfect speaker  onslow past dispute but sir of writers   swift for closer style and hoy for a period of a mile why yes it is granted these indeed may pass good common linguists and so panurge was nay troth the apostles though perhaps too rough had once a pretty gift of tongues enough yet these were all poor gentlemen i dare affirm twas travel made them what they were thus others talents having nicely shown he came by soft transition to his own till i cried out you prove yourself so able pity you was not druggerman at babel for had they found a linguist half so good i make no question but the tower had stood obliging sir i love you i profess but wish you liked retreat a little less spirits like you believe me should be seen and like ulysses visit courts and men so much alone to speak plain truth between us you will die of spleen  excuse me nunquam minus  but as for courts forgive me if i say no lessons now are taught the spartan way though in his pictures lust be full displayed few are the converts aretine has made and though the court show vice exceeding clear none should by my advice learn virtue there at this entranced he lifts his hands and eyes squeaks like a highstretchd lutestring and replies oh it is the sweetest of all earthly things to gaze on princes and to talk of kings then happy man who shows the tombs said i he dwells amidst the royal family he every day from king to king can walk of all our harries all our edwards talk and get by speaking truth of monarchs dead what few can of the living ease and bread lord sir a mere mechanic strangely low and coarse of phrase  your english all are so how elegant your frenchman  mine do you mean i have but one i hope the fellows clean oh sir politely well nay let me dye your only wearing is your paduasoy not sir my only  i have better still and this you see is but my dishabille  wild to get loose his patience i provoke mistake confound object at all he spoke but as coarse iron sharpened mangles more and itch most hurts when angered to a sore so when you plague a fool it is still the curse you only make the matter worse and worse he past it over put on an easy smile at all my peevishness and changed his style he asks what news i tell him of new plays new eunuchs harlequins and operas he hears and as a still with simples in it between each drop it gives stays half a minute loath to enrich me with too quick replies by little and by little drops his lies mere household trash of birthnights balls and shows more than ten holingsheds or halls or stows when the qeen frowned or smiled he knows and what a subtle minister may make of that who sins with whom who got his pension rug or quickened a reversion by a drug whose place is quartered out three parts in four and whether to a bishop or a whore who having lost his credit pawned his rent is therefore fit to have a government who in the secret deals in stocks secure and cheats thunknowing widow and the poor who makes a trust or charity a job and gets an ac of parliament to rob why turnpikes rose and why no cit nor clown can gratis see the country or the town shortly no lad shall chuck or lady vole but some excising courtier will have toll he tells what strumpet places sells for life what squire his lands what citizen his wife and last which proves him wiser still than all what ladys face is not a whited wall as one of woodwards patients sick and sore i puke i nauseate  yet he thrusts in more shows polands interests takes the primates part and talks gazettes and postboys over by heart like a big wife at sight of loathsome meat ready to cast i yawn i sigh i sweat then as a licensed spy whom nothing can silence or hurt he libels the great man swears every place entailed for years to come in sure succession to the day of doom he names the price for every office paid and says our wars thrive ill because delayed nay hints it is by connivance of the court that spain robs on and dunkirks still a port not more amazement seized on circes guests to see themselves fall endlong into beasts than mine to find a subject staid and wise already half turned traitor by surprise i felt the infection slide from him to me as in the pox some give it to get free and quick to swallow me methought i saw one of our giant statutes open its jaw in that nice moment as another lie stood just atilt the minister came by away he flies he bows and bows again and close as umbra joins the dirty train not naoss self more impudently near when half his nose is in his patrons ear i blessed my stars but still afraid to see all the court filled with stranger things than he run out as fast as one that pays his bail and dreads more actions hurries from a jail bear me some god oh quickly bear me hence to wholesome solitude the nurse of sense here contemplation prunes her ruffled wings and the free soul looks down to pity kings here still reflection led on sober thought which fancy colored and a vision wrought a vision hermits can to hell transport and bring even me to see the damned at court not dante dreaming all the infernal state saw such a scene of envy sin and hate base fear becomes the guilty not the free suits tyrants plunderers but suits not me shall i the terror of this sinful town care if a liveryd lord or smile or frown who cannot flatter and detest who can tremble before a noble servingman o my fair mistress truth shall i quit thee for huffing braggart puffed nobility thou who since yesterday have rolled over all the busy idle blockheads of the ball have thou o sun beheld an emptier sort than such as swell this bladder of a court now pox on those who show a a famous show of the court of france in waxwork court in wax it ought to bring all courtiers on their backs such painted puppets such a varnished race of hollow gewgaws only dress and face such waxen noses stately staring things no wonder some folks bow and think them kings and now the british youth engaged no more at figs or whites with felons or a whore pay their last duty to the court and come all fresh and fragrant to the drawing room colors as gay and odours as divine as the fair fields they sold to look so fine that is velvet for a king the flattrer swears it is true for ten days hence twill be king lears our court may justly to our stage give rules that helps it both to foolscoats and to fools and why not players strut in courtiers clothes for these are actors too as well as those wants reach ll states they beg but better dres and all is splendid poverty at best painted for sight and essencd for the smell like frigates fraught with spice and cochinel sail in the ladies how each pyrate eyes so weak a vessel and so rich a prize topgallant he and she in all her trim he boarding her she striking sail to him  chere comtesse you have charms all hearts to hit and  sweet sir fopling you have so much wit such wits and beauties are not praised for naught for both the beauty and the wit are bought twoud burst even heraclitus with the spleen to see those anticks fopling and courtin the presence seems with things so richly odd the mosque of mahound or some queer pagod see them survey their limbs by durers rules of all beaukind the best proportioned fools adjust their clothes and to confession draw each idle atom or erroneous straw what terrors would distract each conscious soul convicted of that mortal sin a hole or should one pound of powder less bespread the monkeytail that wags behind his head thus finished and corrected to a hair they march to prate their hour before the fair so first to preach a whiteglovd chaplain goes with band of lily and with cheek of rose sweeter than sharon in immaculate trim neatness itself impertinent in him let but the ladies smile and they are blessed prodigious how the things protest protest peace fools or gonson will for papists seize you if once he catch you at your jesu jesu nature made every fop to plague his brother just as one beauty mortifies another but here is the captain that will plague you both whose air cries arm whofe very looks an oath what though his soul be bullet body buff damn him he is honest sir  and that is enuff he spits foreright his haughty chest before like battring rams beats open every door and with a face as red and as awry as herods hangdogs in old tapestry scarecrow to boys the breeding womans curse has yet a strange ambition to look worse confounds the civil keeps the rude in awe jests like alicensd fool commands like law frighted i quit the room but leave it so as men from jayls to execution go for hung with the room hung with tapestry now very ancient representing the seven deadly sins deadly sins i see the wall and lined with giants deadlier than em all each man an a giant famous in diverse romances ascapart of strength to toss for quoits both temple bar and charing cross scared at the grizly forms i sweat i fly and shake all over like a discovered spy courts are no match for wits so weak as mine charge them with heavens artillry bold divine from such alone the great rebukes endure whose satyrs sacred and whose rage secure it is mine to wash a few slight stains but theirs to deluge sin and drown a court in tears however what is now apocrypha my wit in time to come may pass for holy writ finish
