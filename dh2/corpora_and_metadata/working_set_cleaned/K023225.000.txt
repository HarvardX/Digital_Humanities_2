paines four letters  letters on government including both his letters to mr dundas with two letters to lord onslow and two from paris  by thomas pain author of rights of man common sense etc  to which are prefixed anecdotes of his life  london sold by c stalker stationers court ludgate street and by all booksellers        price sixpence  the patrons of liberty are informed that in a fe days will be published at a small price a pamphlet entitled  the friend of the people or a view of the english government for the instruction of plain persons  sold by all booksellers  anecdotes of the life of thomas pain the celebrated author of the rights of man has not been without his biographer in a pamphlet which extends to one hundred and sixtysix pages and which is published under the sanction of the fictitious name of oldys we have been made acquainted with many particulars of mr paines private history this pamphlet is in  degree  and abusive and the  of it had evidently dipped his pen in the bitter spirit of party opposition however the incidents which it contains seem to have been collected with care and assiduity and to rest as to their authenticity on the evidence of dates and records it should be remembered likewise that these particulars have not been contradicted either by mr pain or by any of his numerous admirers most if not all of whom appear to have had no doubt of their reality perhaps the impartial public may be pleased with beholding the following anecdotes stripped of that high coloring which prejudice and partymalice are capable of giving to truth  thomas pain was born at thetford in the county of norfolk on the   th of january       his father the son of a small but reputable farmer was a staymake by trade and a quaker by religion his mother was the daughter of an attorney at thetford and of the establishe church he was educated at his native town under the rev william knowles master of the grammar schoo at thetford and was deemed a boy of considerable abilities though without much regular application his studies were directed by his expectations to what is useful rather than to what is ornamental  to reading writing and arithmetic with this kind of instruction he left the school at the age of thirteen in order to learn his fathers business which though he did not like it he continued to work at for nearly five years  when almost twenty and in the year      the subject of these memoirs entered london the common receptacle of the silly and the wise of the poor and the opulent of the busy and the idle he worked for some time with mr morris a very noted staymaker in hanoverstreet longacre he did not however continue long in london and it seems probable that this was the period at which he made his seafaring adventure  at an early age as he himself observes raw and adventurous and heated with the false heroism of a master who had served in a manofwar he began the career of his own fortune and entered on board the terrible privateer captain death from this adventure he was happil prevented by the affectionate and moral remonstrance of good father who from his own habits of life being of the quaker profession must have begun to look upon him a lost but the impression much as it effected at the time began to wear away and he entered afterward in the king of prussia privateer and went with her to sea what the event of his expedition was whether successful or otherwise we are not informed but it is certain that in the way of life he did not continue long for in the year     we find him at dover where he worked at his trade s almost a twelvemonth  in april      he settled as a master staymaker sandwich and on the   th of september following married mary lambert a pretty girl of modest behavior and the daughter of an exciseman at sandwich however he did not continue long but on the  th of april    0 went with his wife to margate and a little time after having lost his wife again mingled with the crowds of london  the trials which our author had made of his trade as they had brought him no pleasure and little gain induced him to renounce it at this time for ever when a youth he had enquired into the duty and envied the perquisites of an exciseman his wife had doubtless spoken of the honors and emoluments of her deceased father and he was induced by these considerations in july      to seek for shelter in his fathers house that he might prosecute in quiet privacy at thetford the great object of his future course  after fourteen months of study our author was established in the excise on the  st of december      at the age of twentyfive he owed this gratification of his wishes to the friendly interference of mr cocksedge the learned recorder of thetford but in this situation he did not continue more than two or three years for it is certain that whatever was the cause he was dismissed from his office on the   th of august       in consequence of this misfortune our celebrated author was reduced to great want he is said to have been for some time almost without food and shelter on the   th of july      he was restored to his office a circumstance which seems to prove that he had not merited his dismission  mere restoration however did not bring him immediate employment at this interval he was employed to teach english at an academy in lemanstreet goodmansfields for which he received a salary of twentyfive pounds a year and afterward he lived for a short time in a similar situation at kensington  in march      he was sent to be an excise officer at jews in sussex in this place he lodged with mr ollive a tobacconist after whose death in      he opened the shop in his own name as a grocer and married elizabeth ollive the daughter of his late landlord this period is said to have been one of the happy parts of his life  in      he made his first appearance as a writer the poets of jews were called upon by one of the candidates for the honor we must not say the interest of representing in parliament the electors of new shoreham to furnish an appropriate song and mr pain obtained the laurel with three guineas for his labor  in      a design was formed by the exciseofficers throughout the kingdom to apply to parliament for some addition to their salaries our author being one of the leading men among them was requested to write their case which he produced and published after many months application this is an octavo pamphlet of twentyone pages which exclusive of the introduction is divided into two heads viz the state of the salary of the officers of the excise and thoughts of the corruption arising from the poverty of excise officers on these topics he says all that the ablest writer could have said four thousand of the case were printed at jews but notwithstanding this effort no application was made to parliament  in the month of april      misfortunes crowded fast upon him the effects of his shop were sold to pay his debts having dealt likewise as a grocer in exciseable articles he was suspected whether with reason or otherwise does not appear of unfair practices and on the  th of the same month was again dismissed from the excise after a dozen years service  on the   th of may following mr pain and his wife entered into articles of separation and these articles were in consequence of some disagreement again drawn on the  th of june some persons have not scrupled to asser that he treated his wife with cruelty and that this was the cause of their separation  toward the close of the year in consequence of a strong recommendation to dr franklin he formed the resolution of quirting his native country and in the month of september he set sail for america he arrived at philadelphia in the winter a few months as he himself relates before the battle of lexington which was fought in april       in the new world his first employment was that of shopman to mr aitkin an industrious bookseller at philadelphia with a salary of twenty pounds a year soon after he turned chemist and in november as foreign supplies of gunpowder were stopped he employed his fertile genius in making experiments for the purpose of discovering some cheap and expeditious method of furnishing congress with saltpetre  from this era he becomes more known and his conduct is entitled to particular attention on the  0th of january      he published his celebrated pamphlet entitled common sense this work was universally read and very generally applauded the first edition was quickly sold a second with a supplement of one third more was immediately prepared but let us here attend to mr pain himself speaking of the testimony which his own heart bore to his integrity he thus remarks  politics and selfinterest have been so uniformly connected that the world from being so often deceived has a right to be suspicious of public characters but with regard to myself i am perfectly easy on this head i did not at my first setting out in public life nearly seventeen years ago turn my thoughts to subjects of government from motives of interest and my conduct from that moment to this proves the fact i saw an opportunity in which i thought i could do some good and i followed extily what my heart dictated i neither read books nor studied other peoples opinions i thought for myself the case was this  during the suspension of the old governments in america both prior to and at the breaking out of hostilities  was struck with the order and decorum with which every thing was conducted and impressed with the idea that a little more than what society naturally performed was all the government that was necessary and that monarchy and aristocracy were frauds and impositions upon mankind on these principles i published the pamphlet common sense the success it met with was beyond any thing since the invention of printing i gave the copyright up to every state in the union and the demand ran to not less than one hundred thousand copies  owing to this disinterested conduct of mr pain it seems that notwithstanding the extensive sale of the pamphlet he was in debt to the printer to the amount of   l   s  d  in the course of this year      mr pain joined the army but in what capacity is not known it is certain however that he accompanied washington in his retreat from hudsons river to the delaware at this time the congress fled and all were terrified but our author was undismayed he saw that the americans were possessed of resources sufficient to authorize hope and he endeavored to inspire others with the same confidence wit this view on the   th of december he published the crisis wherein he states every topic of hope and examine every motive of apprehension this work which extended to thirteen numbers he published at different interval till the complete establishment of the revolution t last number appeared on the   th of april      the sam day that a cessation of hostilities was proclaimed  in      congress unanimously and unknown to m pain appointed him secretary in the foreign deparment and from this time he enjoyed the corresponden of franklin this appointment was agreeable to hi because it gave him the opportunity of seeing into the alities of foreign courts and their manner of doing buness but a misunderstanding arising between congress and him respecting one of their commissioners then in europe mr silas deane he resigned the office on the  th of january      and declined at the same time the pecuniary offers made him by the ministers of france and spain m gerard and don juan mirralles  soon after this he was made master of arts by the university of philadelphia and in    0 was chosen a member of the american philosophical society when it was revived by the legislature of the province of pensylvania his independence as a political writer was well known his patriotism had gained him many friends and among others it appears that general washington entertained a high sense of the importance of his services  on account of these services new york conferred on him some forfeited lands at newrochelle and pensylvania presented him with five hundred pounds  as his exertions were no longer necessary in america be set sail for france in the autumn of      and arrived at paris in the beginning of the year      carrying with him his fame as a writer and the model of a bridge which was shown to the academy of sciences from paris he came over to england on the  d of september just thirteen years after his departure for philadelphia before the end of the month he went to thetford to see his mother to whom he allowed  s aweek but owing to the bankruptcy of the american merchant who was appointed to pay it this allowance was afterward stopped  during part of the year      mr pain resided at rotheram in yorkshire where his iron bridge was cast and created chiefly at the expense of the ingenious mr walter the design however had cost our author a considerable sum and the assignees of the american merchant finding six hundred and twenty pounds charged against him caused him to be arrested on the   th of october      on this occasion two respectable merchants became his bail and on his paying down four hundred and sixty pounds which he had received from america and giving his note for the remainder he was set at liberty in november after three weeks confinement  in consequence of the publication of mr burkes reflections on the french revolution mr pain produced in the month of february      his wellknown work entitled the rights of man this pamphlet was printed for mr johnson in st pauls churchyard but the work containing some just but severe reflections on various parts of the english government mr johnson was induced by the advice of some of his friends to decline the publication of it and after a months delay it was published on the   th of march by mr jordan in fleet street  about the middle of may mr pain again went to france when the king fled from paris he observed to his friend mr christie you see the absurdity of monarchical governments here will be a whole nation disturbed by the folly of one man on the return of the king our author was in considerable danger an officer proclaimed the will of the national assembly that all should be silent and covered in a moment all hats were on mr pain however had lost his cockade the emblem of liberty and equality a cry arose aristocrat aristocrat a la lantern a la lantern he was desired by those who stood near him to put on his hat and it was not till after some time that the mob was satisfied by explanation  on the   th of july he returned to london but i was not thought prudent that he should attend the celebration of the french revolution he afterward dre up the address and declaration of the gentlemen who me at the thatchedhousetavern on the  0th of augu following  in the month of february      appeared the secon part of rights of man a publication which has conferred additional celebrity on its author and greatly increased the number of converts to the cause of liberty and just government  the sale of these justlyadmired productions has been much greater than that of perhaps any work ever published in england when the second part of rights of man appeared the number of copies to which the first part had extended including england scotland and ireland was not less than between forty and fifty thousand and when it is recollected that exclusive of the second the first part of the work has now been eight months longer on sale and that cheap editions of each have been published very many thousands of which have been sold the number purchased cannot be supposed to fall far short of if indeed it does not exceed one hundred thousand copies  thus have we presented to our readers the principal circumstances of mr paines history the changes which he has witnessed have been various and the man who can drop a tear of sorrow at the recollection of the miseries of his fellow creatures will feel regret still more poignant when contemplating the many difficulties under which that man has labored who may justly be styled the benefactor of nations but perhaps as he has well observed it is to his advantage that he has served an apprenticeship to life he now knows the value of moral instruction for he has seen the danger of the contrary  the number of converts to mr paines sentiments on civil government is rapidly increasing it is a class which comprehends the most truly independent characters throughout the nation men who belong to no party but that of truth and who acknowledge no objects of political doration but those of public liberty and public happiness the names of pittite and foxite with those other blanishments with which interest has contrived to catch the yes and seduce the attention of the unthinking and the rulgar are regarded by them as the rattles of childhood they aspire to a nobler character and instead of consigning their understandings to the custody of others are demined to take the trouble of thinking for themselves  yet we would not be uncandid we would not be unjust candor is the fair offering of ingenuous excellence and justice is the due of all many no doubt there are who oppose reformation from conviction and whose upright hearts if accompanied with enlightened understandings would strink with horror at the idea of those miseries which the villainy of kings and ministers has allotted to their equals for why must the people groan under the load of poverty and want that statesmen and kings may live in splendor  but heaven be praised for that light which is already diffused and which will assuredly dispel that mental darkness which has so long overshadowed the earth  the author of the rights of man as a reward for his publicspirited exertions is now the subject of a government prosecution of these proceedings and their advisers we shall simply say that they produce in the patrotic breast the fervor of indignation or the coolness  contempt  letters on government letter i to mr henry dundas in answer to his speech on the late excellent proclamation sir london june       as you opened the debate in the house of commons may   th on the proclamation for suppressing publications which that proclamation without naming any calls wicked and seditions and as you applied those opprobrious epithets to the works entitled rights of man i think it unnecessary to offer any other reason for addressing this letter to you  i begin then at once by declaring that i do not believe there are to be found in the writings of any author ancient or modern on the subject of government a spirit of greater benignity and a stronger inculcation of moral principles than in those which i have published they come sir from a man who by having lived in different countries and under different systems of government and who being intimate in the construction of them is a better judge of the subject than it is possible that you from the want of those opportunities can be  and besides this they come from an heart that knows not how to beguile  i will further say that when that moment arrives in which the best consolation that shall be left will be that of looking back on some past actions more virtuous more meritorious than the rest i shall then with happiness remember among other things i have written the rights of man  as to what proclamations or prosecutions or placemen or placeexpectants  those who possess or those who are gaping for office may say of them it will not alter their character either with the world or with me  having sir made this declaration i shall proceed to remark not particularly upon your own speech on that occasion but on any other speech to which your motion on that day gave rise and i shall begin with that of mr adam  this gentleman accuses me of not having done the very thing that i have done and which he says if i had done he should not have accused me  mr adam in his speech see the morning chronicle of may    says that he had well considered the subject of constitutional publications and was by no means ready to say but the contrary that books of science upon government though recommending a doctrine or system different from the form of our constitution meaning that of england were fit objects of prosecution that if he did he must condemn which he meant not to do harrington for his oceana sir thomas moore for his eutopia and hume for his idea of a perfect commonwealth but continued mr adam the publication of mr pain was very different for it reviled what was most sacred in the constitution destroyed every principle of subordination and established nothing in their room  i readily perceive that mr adam had not read the second part of rights of man and i am put under the necessity either of submitting to an erroneous charge or of justifying myself against it and i certainly shall prefer the latter  if then i shall prove to mr adam that in my reasoning upon systems of government in the second part of rights of man i have shown as clearly i think as words can convey ideas a certain system of government and that not existing in theory only but already in full and established practice and systematically and practically free from all the vices and defects of the english government and capable of producing more happiness to the people and that also with an eightieth part of the taxes which the present system of english government consumes i hope he will do me the justice when he next goes  the house to get up and confess he had been mistaken in saying that i had established nothing and that i had destroyed every principle of subordination having thus opened the case i now come to the point  in the second part of rights of man i have distincguisted government into two classes or systems the one th hereditary system the other the representative system  in the first part of rights of man i have endeavored show and i challenge any man to refute it that there does n exist a right to establish hereditary government or in other words hereditary governors because hereditary government always means a government yet to come and the case always is that the people who are to live afterward have always the same right to choose a government for themselves as the people had who lived before them  in the second part of rights of man i have not repeated those arguments because they are irrefutable but have confined myself to show the defects of what is called hereditary government or hereditary succession that it must from the nature of it throw government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of principle or unfitted for it from want of capacity  james the iid is recorded as an instance of the first of these cases and instances are to be found almost all over europe to prove the truth of the latter  to show the absurdity of the hereditary system still more strongly i will now put the following case  take any fifty men promiscuously and it will be very extraordinary if out of that number one man should be found whose principles and talents taken together for some might have principles and others have talents would render him a person truly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of national trust if then such a fitness of character could not be expected to be found in more than one person out of fifty it would happen but once in a thousand years to the eldest son of any one family admitting each on an average to hold the office twenty years mr adam talks of something in the constitution which he calls most sacred but i hope he does not mean hereditary succession a thing which appears to me a violation of every order of nature and of common sense  when i look into history and see the multitudes of men otherwise virtuous who have died and their families been ruined in defense of knaves and fools and which they would not have done had they reasoned at all upon the system i do not know a greater good that an individual can render to mankind than to endeavor to break the chains of political superstition those chains are now dissolving fast and proclamation and prosecution will serve but to hasten that dissolution  having thus spoken of the hereditary system as a had system and subject to every possible defect i now come to the representative system and this mr adam will find stated in the second part of the rights of man not only as the best but as the only theory of government under which the liberties of a people can be permanently secure  but it is needless now to talk of mere theory since there is already a government in full practice established upon that theory or in other words upon the rights of man and has been so for almost twenty years mr pit in a speech of his some short time since said that there never did and never could exist a government established upon those rights and that if it began at noon it would end at night mr pit is not yet arrived at the degree of a schoolboy in this species of knowledge his practice has been confined to the means of extorting revenue and his boast has been  how much  whereas the boast of the system of government that i am speaking of is not how much but how little  the system of government purely representative unmixed with any thing of hereditary nonsense began in america i will now compare the effects of that system of government with the system of government in england both during and since the close of the war  so powerful is the representative system first by combining and consolidating all the parts of a country together however great the extent and secondly by admitting of none but men properly qualified into the government or dismissing them if they prove to be otherwise that america was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all the schemes and projects of the hereditary government of england against her as the establishment of the revolution and independence of america is a proof of this fact it is needless to enlarge upon it  i now come to the comparative effect of the two systems since the close of the war and i request mr adam to attend to it  america had internally sustained the revenge of upwards of seven years of war which england had not england sustained only the expense of the war whereas america sustained not only the expense but the destruction of property committed by both armies not a house was built during that period and many thousands were destroyed the farms and plantations along the coast of the country for more than a thousand miles were laid waste her commerce was annihilated her ships were either taken or had rotted within her own harbors the credit of her funds had fallen upwards of ninety per cent that is an original hundred pounds would not sell for ten pounds in ine she was apparently put back an hundred years when the wa closed which was not the case with england  but such was the event that the same representative system of government though since better organized which enabled her to conquer enabled her also to recover and sh now presents a more flourishing condition and a more happ and harmonized society under that system of government that any country in the world can boast under any other he towns are rebuilt much better than before her farms an plantations are in higher improvement than ever her commerce is spread over the world and her funds have risen from less than ten pounds the hundred to upwards of one hundred and twenty mr pit and his colleagues talk of the things that have happened in his boyish administration without knowing what greater things have happened elsewhere and under other systems of government  i next come to state the expense of the two systems as they now stand in each of the countries but it may first be proper to observe that government in america is what it ought to be a matter of honor and trust and not made a trade of for the purpose of lucre  the whole amount of the net taxes in england exclusive of the expense of collection of drawbacks of seizures and condemnations of sines and penalties of fees of office of litigations and informers which are some of the blessed means of enforcing them is seventeen millions of this sum about nine millions go for the payment of the interest of the nationl debt and the remainder being about eight millions is for the current annual expenses thus much for one side of the case i now come to the other  the expense of all the several departments of the general representative government of the united states of america extending over a space of country nearly ten times larger than england is two hundred and ninetyfour thousand five hundred and fiftyeight dollars which at  s  d per dollar is       l   s sterling and is thus apportioned  expense of the executive department l s the office of the presidency at which the president receives nothing for himself      0 vice president      0 chief justice  00 0 five associate justices       0 nineteen judges of districts and attorney general         legislative department members of congress at six dollars  l  s per day their secretaries clerks chaplains messengers dootkeepers etc      0 treasury department secretary assistant comptroller auditor treasurer register and loanoffice keeper in each state together with all necessary clerks officekeepers etc       0 department of state including foreign affairs secretary clerks etc etc   0    department of war secretary clerks paymaster commissioner etc       0 commissioners for settling old accounts the whole board clerks etc         incidental and contingent expenses for firewood stationary printing etc  00     total  0       on account of the incursions of the indians on the back settlements congress is at this time obliged to keep six thousand militia in pay in addition to a regiment of foot and a battalion of artillery which it always keeps and this increases the expense of the war department to   0000 dollars which is       l sterling but when peace shall be concluded with the indians the greatest part of this expense will cease and the total amount of the expense of government including that of the army will not amount to one hundred thousand pounds sterling which as has been already stated is but an eightieth part of the expenses of the english government  i request mr adam and mr dundas and all those who are talking of constitutions and blessings and kings and lords and the lord knows what to look at this statement here is a form and system of government that is better organized and better administered than any government in the world and that for less than one hundred thousand pounds per annum and yet every member of congress receives as a compensation for his time and attendance on public business one pound seven shillings per day which is at the rate of nearly five hundred pounds a year  this is a government that has nothing to fear it needs no proclamations to deter people from writing and reading it needs no political superstition to support it it was by encouraging discussion and rendering the press free upon all subjects of government that the principles of government became upderstood in america and the people are now enjoying the present blessings under it you hear of no riots tumults and disorders in that country because there exists no cause to product them those things are never the effect of freedom but o restraint oppression and excessive taxation  in america there is not that class of poor and wretched people that are so numerously dispersed all over england and who are to be told by a proclamation that they are happy and thi is in a great measure to be accounted for not by the differenc of proclamations but by the difference of governments and tha difference of taxes between that country and this what tha laboring people of that country earn they apply to their own use and to the education of their children and do not pay  away in taxes as fast as they earn it to support court extravagance and a long enormous list of placemen and pensioners and besides this they have learned the manly doctrine of reverencing themselves and consequently of respecting each other and they laugh at those imaginary beings called kings an lords and all the fraudulent trumpery of courts  when placemen and pensioners or those who expect to  such are lavish in praise of a government it is not a sign  its being a good one the pension list alone in england see sir john sinclairs history of the revenue page   of the appendix is one hundred and seven thousand four hundred and four pounds which is more than the expenses of the whole government of america amount to and i am now more convinced than before that the offer that was made to me of a thousand pounds for the copyright of the second part of the rights of man together with the remaining copyright of the first part was to have effected by a quick suppression what is now attempted to be done by a prosecution the connection which the person who made that offer has with the kings printing office may furnish part of the means of enquiring into this affair when the ministry shall please to bring their prosecution to issue but to return to my subject   i have said in the second part of rights of man and i repent it here that the service of any man whether called king president senator legislator or any thing else cannot be worth more to any country in the regular routine of office than ten thousand pounds per annum we have a better man in america and more of a gentleman than any king i ever knew of who does not occasion even half that expense for though the salary is fixed at five thousand two hundred and sixtyfive pounds he does not accept it and it is only the incidental expenses that are paid out of it the name by which a man is called is of itself but an empty thing it is worth and character alone which can render him valuable for without these kings and lords and presidents are but jingling names  but without troubling myself about constitutions of government i have shown in the second part of rights of man that an alliance may be formed between england france and america and that the expense of government in england may be put back to one million and an half viz  civil expense of government l  00000 army  00000 navy  00000   00000  and even this sum is fifteen times greater than the expenses of government are in america and it is also greater than the hole peace establishment of england amounted to about an undred years ago so much has the weight and oppression of axes increased since the revolution and especially since the ear       to show that the sum of  00000l is sufficient to defray all e civil expenses of government i have in that work anexed the following estimate for any country of the same exnt as england  in the first place three hundred representatives fairly elected are sufficient for all the purposes to which legislation can apply and preferable to a larger number  if then an allowance at the rate of five hundred pound per ann be made to every representative deducting for non attendance the expense if the whole number attended so months each year would be l   000  the official departments could not possibly exceed the following number with the salaries annexed viz  three officers at  0000l each  0000 ten ditto at  000l each  0000 twenty ditto at  000l each  0000 forty ditto at  000l each  0000 two hundred ditto at  00l each  00000 three hundred ditto at  00l each  0000 five hundred ditto at  00l each  0000 seven hundred ditto at   l each    00 l     00  if a nation chose it might deduct   per cent from all th offices and make one of twenty thousand pounds per ann an style the person who should fill it king or majesty or madjesty or give him any other title  taking however this sum of one million and an half as a abundant supply for all the expenses of government under an form whatever there will remain a surplus of nearly six milions and a half out of the present taxes after paying the interest of the national debt and i have shown in the secon part of rights of man what appears to me the best mode  applying the surplus money for i am now speaking of experces and savings and not of systems of government  i have in the first place estimated the poorrates at t millions annually and shown that the first effectual step wou be to abolish the poorrates entirely which would be a savi of two millions to the housekeepers and to remit four million out of the surplus taxes to the poor to be paid to them in mney in proportion to the number of children in each famil and the number of aged persons  i have estimated the number of persons of both sexes  england of fifty years of age and upwards at   0000 a have taken onethird of this number viz   0000 to be po people  to save long calculations i have taken  0000 of them  be upwards of fifty years of age and under sixty and  other to be sixty years and upwards and to allow six pounds   to the former class and ten pounds per ann to the latter the expense of which will be  seventy thousand persons at  l per ann   0000 seventy thousand persons at  0l per ann  00000 l    0000  there will then remain of the four millions    0000l i have stated two different methods of appropriating this money the one is to pay it in proportion to the number of children in each family at the rate of three or four pounds per ann for each child the other is to apportion it according to the expense of living in different countries but in either of these cases it would together with the allowance to be made to the aged completely take off taxes from one third of all the families in england besides relieving all the other families from the burden of poorrates  the whole number of families in england lotting five souls to each family is one million four hundred thousand of which i take one third viz        to be poor families who now pay four millions of taxes and that the poorest pays at least four guineas a year and that the other thirteen millions are paid by the other twothirds the plan therefore as stated in the work is first to remit or repay as is already stated this sum of four millions to the poor because it is impossible to separate them from the others in the present mode of collecting taxes on articles of consumption and secondly to abolish the poorrates the house and windowlight tax and to change the commutation tax into a progressive tax on large estates the particulars of all which are set forth in the work and to which i desire mr adam to refer for particulars i shall here content myself with saying that to a town of the population of manchester it will make a difference in its favor compared with the present state of things of upwards of fifty thousand pounds annually and so in proportion to all other places throughout the nation this certainly is of more consequence than that the tame sums should be collected to be afterward pent by riotous and profligate courtiers and in nightly revels t the star and garter tavern pall mall  i will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from be second part of rights of man which mr dundas a man olling in luxury at the expense of the nation has branded with the epithet of wicked  by the operation of this plan the poor laws those instruments of civil torture will be superseded and the wasteful expense of litigation prevented the hearts of the humane will not be shocked by ragged and hungry children and persons of seventy and eighty years of age begging for brench the dying poor will not be dragged from place to place to breathe their last as a reprisal of parish upon parish widows will have a maintenance for their children and no be carted away on the death of their husbands like culpri and criminals and children will no longer be considered a increasing the distresses of their parents the haunts of the wretched will be known because it will be to their advantage and the number of petty crimes the offspring of poverty and distress will be lessened the poor as well as the rich will then be interested in the support of government and the cause and apprehension of riots and tumult will cease ye who sit in case and solace yourselves in plenty and such there are in turkey and russia as well as in england and who say to yourselves are we not wel off have ye thought of these things when ye do ye will cease to spaak and feel for yourselves alone  right of man part ii p     after this remission of four millions be made and the poor rates and house and windowlight tax be abolished and the commutation tax changed there will still remain nearly on million and an half of surplus taxes and as by an alliance between england france and america armies and navies will i a great measure be rendered unnecessary and as men who have either been brought up in or long habited to those lines o life are still citizens of a nation in common with the rest an have a right to participate in all plans of national benefit i is stated in that work rights of man part ii to apply annually  0 000l out of the surplus taxes to this purpose in the following manner  to fifteen thousand disbanded soldiers  s per week each clear of deductions during life    00 additional pay to the remaining soldiers per ann     to the officers of the disbanded corpse during life the same sum of    0 to fifteen thousand disbanded sailors  s per week during life    0 additional pay to the remaing sailors     to the officers of the disbanded part of the navy during life    0 l  0 0  the limits to which it is proper to confine this letter w not admit of my entering into further particulars i addr it to mr dundas because he took the lead in the debate a he wishes i suppose to appear conspicuous but the purp of it is to justify myself from the charge which mr adam made  this gentleman as has been observed in the beginning this letter considers the writings of harrington moore a hume as justifiable and legal publications because they reasoned by comparison though in so doing they showed plans and systems of government not only different from but preferable to that of england and he accuses me of endeavoring to confuse instead of producing a system in the room of that which i had reasoned against whereas the fact is that i have not only reasoned by comparison of the representative system against the hereditary system but i have gone further for i have produced an instance of a government established entirely on the representative system under which much greater happiness is enjoyed much fewer taxes required and much higher credit is established than under the system of government in england the funds in england have risen since the war only from   l to   l and they have been down since the proclamation to   l whereas the funds in america rose in the mean time from  0l to   0l his charge against me of destroying every principle of subordination is equally as groundless which even a single paragraph from the work will prove and which i shall here quote  formerly when divisions arose respecting governments recourse was had to the sword and a civil war ensued that savage custom is exploded by the new system and recourse is had to a national convention discussion and the general will arbitrates the question and to this private opinion yields with a good grace and order is preserved uninterrupted  rights of man part ii p     that two different charges should be brought at the same ime the one by a member of the legislative for not doing a certain thing and the other by the attorney general for doing  is a strange jumble of contradictions i have now justified myself or the work rather against the first by stating the case  this letter and the justification of the other will be undertaken in its proper place but in any case the work will go on i shall now conclude this letter with saying that the only jection i found against the plan and principles contained in e second part of rights of man when i had written the ook was that they would beneficially interest at least ninetye persons out of every hundred throughout the nation and herefore would not leave sufficient room for men to act from e direct and disinterested principle of honor but the protution now commenced has fortunately removed that objection and the approvers and protectors of that work now feel e immediate impulse of honor added to that of national erest  i am mr dundas not your obedient humble servant but the contrary thomas pain  letter ii to lord onslow sir london june   th      i have seen in the public newspapers the following advertisement to wit   to the nobility gentlemen clergy freeholders an other inhabitants of the county of surry  at the requistion and desire of several of the freeholder of the county i am in the absence of the sheriff to d the favor of your attendance at a meeting to be held  epsom on monday the   th instant at    oclock at noo to consider of an humble address to his majesty to express our grateful approbation of his majestys pattern and welltimed attention to the public welfare in his la most gracious proclamation against the enemies of o happy constitution signed onslow cranley  taking it for granted that the aforesaid advertisement equally as obscure as the proclamation to which it refers h nevertheless some meaning and is intended to affect some purpose and as a prosecution whether wisely or unwisely ju or unjustly is already commenced against a work in rights of man of which i have the honor and the happin to be the author i feel it necessary to address this letter to y and to request that it may be read publicly to the gentlemen who shall meet at epsom in consequence of that advertisement  the work now under prosecution is i conceive the s work which is intended to be suppressed by the aforesaid clamation admitting this to be the case the gentlement the county of surry are called upon by somebody to cond a work and they are at the same time forbidden by the clamation to know what that work is and they are fu called upon to give their aid and assistance to prevent  people from knowing it also it is therefore necessary  the author for his own justification as well as to preven gentlemen who shall meet from being imposed upon by  representation should give some outlines of the princ and plans which that work contains  the work sir in question contains first an investigation of general principles of government  it also distinguishes government into two classes or systems the one the hereditary system  the other the representative system and it compares those two systems with each other  it shows that what is called hereditary government cannot exist as a matter of right because hereditary government always means a government yet to come and the case always is that those who are to live afterward have always the same right to establish a government for themselves as the people had who lived before them  it also shows the defect to which hereditary government is unavoidably subject that it must from the nature of it throw government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of principle or unfitted for it from want of capacity james the iid and many others are recorded in the english history as proofs of the former of those cases and instances are to be found almost all over europe to prove the truth of the latter  it then shows that the representative system is the only true system of government that it is also the only system under which the liberties of any people can be permanently secure and further that it is the only one that can continue the same equal probability at all times of admitting none but men properly qualified both by principles and abilities into the government and of excluding such as are otherwise  the work shows also by plans and calculations nor hitherto denied nor controverted not even by the prosecution that is commenced that the taxes now existing may be reduced at least six millions that taxes may be entirely taken off from the poor who are computed at one third of the nation and that the taxes on the other twothirds may be very considerably reduced  that the aged poor may be comfortably provided for and the children of poor families properly educated  that fifteen thousand soldiers and the same number of sailors may be disbanded and allowed three shillings per week during life out of the surplus taxes and also that a proportionate allowance may be made to the officers and the pay of the remaining soldiers and sailors be increased and that it is better to apply the surplus taxes to those purposes than to consume them on lazy and profligate placemen and pensioners and that the revenue said to be twenty thousand pounds per annum raised by a tax upon coals and given to the duke of richmond is a gross imposition upon all the people of london and ought to be instantly abolished  this sir is a concise abstract of the principles and plans contained in the work that is now prosecuted and for the suppression of which the proclamation appears to be intended but as it is impossible that i can in the compass of a letter bring into view all the matters contained in the work and as it is proper that the gentlemen who may compose that meeting should know what the merits or demerits of it are before they come to any resolutions either directly or indirectly relating thereto i request the honor of presenting them with one hundred copies of the second part of rights of man and also one thousand copies of my letter to mr dundas which i have directed to be sent to epsom for that purpose and i beg the favor of the chairman to take the trouble of presenting them to the gentlemen who shall meet on that occasion with my sincere wishes for their happiness and for that of the nation in general  having now closed thus much of the subject of my letter i next come to speak of what has relation to me personally i am well aware of the delicacy that attends it but the purpose of calling the meeting appears to me so inconsistent with that justice that is always due between man and man that it is proper i should as well on account of the gentlemen who may meet as on my own account explain myself fully and heartily thereon  i have already informed the gentlemen that a prosecution is commenced against a work of which i have the honor and happiness to be the author and i have good reasons for believing that the proclamation which the gentlemen are called to consider and to present an address upon is purposely calculated to give an impression to the jury before whom that matter is to come in short that it is dictating a verdict by proclamation and i consider the instigators of the meeting to be held at epsom as aiding and abetting the same improper and in my opinion illegal purpose and that in a manner very artfully contrived as i shall now show  had a meeting been called of the freeholders of the county of middlesex the gentlemen who had composed that meeting would have rendered themselves objectionable as persons t serve on a jury before whom the judicial case was afterward to come but by calling a meeting out of the county  middlesex that matter is artfully avoided and the gentlemen of surry are summoned as if it were intended thereby to gi a tone to the sort of verdict which the instigators of the meeting no doubt wish should be brought in and to give countenance to the jury in so doing  i am sir with much respect to the gentlemen who shall meet their and your obedient humble servant thomas pain  letter iii to onslow cranley commondy called lord onslow sir london june   st      when i wrote you the letter which mr horn took did me the favor to present to you as chairman of the meeting held at epsom monday june   th it was not with much expectation that you will do me the justice of permitting or recommending it to be publicly read i am well aware that the signature of thomas pain has something in it dreadful to sinecure placemen and pensioners and when you on seeing the letter opened informed the meeting that it was signed thomas pain and added in a tone of exclamation the common enemy of us all you spoke one of the greatest truths you ever uttered if you confine the expression to men of the same description with yourself men living in indolence and luxury on the spoil and labors of the public  the letter has since appeared in the argus and probably in other papers it will justify itself but if any thing on that account had been wanting your own conduct at the meeting would have supplied the omission you there sufficiently proved that i was not mistaken in supposing that the meeting was called to give an indirect aid to the prosecution commenced against a work the reputation of which will long outlive the memory of the pensioner i am writing to  when meetings sir are called by the partisans of the court to preclude the nation the right of investigating systems and principles of government and exposing errors and defects under the pretense of prosecuting an individual  it furnishes an additional motive for maintaining sacred that violated right  the principles and arguments contained in the work in question rights of man have stood and they now stand and i believe ever will stand unrefuted they are stated in a fair and open manner to the world and they have already received the public approbation of a greater number of men of the best of characters of every denomination of religion and of every rank in life placemen and pensioners excepted than all the juries that shall meet in england for ten years to come will amount to and i have moreover good reasons for believing that the approvers of that work as well private as public are already more numerous than all the present electors throughout the nation  not less than forty pamphlets intended as answers thereto have appeared and as suddenly disappeared scarcely are the titles of any of them remembered notwithstanding their endeavors have been aided by all the daily abuse which the court and ministerial newspapers for almost a year and a half could bestow both upon the work and the author and now that every attempt to refute and every abuse has failed the invention of calling the work a libel has been hit upon and the discomfited party has pusillanimously retreated to prosecution and a jury and obscure addresses  as i well know that a long letter from me will not be agreeable to you i will relieve your uneasiness by making it as short as i conveniently can and will conclude it with taking up the subject at that part where mr horn took was interrupted from going on when at the meeting  that gentleman was stating that the situation you stood in rendered it improper for you to appear actively in a scene in which your private interest was too visible that you were a bedchamber lord at a thousand a year and a pensioner at  000l a year more  and here he was stopped by the little but noisy circle you had collected round you permit me then sir to add an explanation to his words for the benefit of your neighbors and with which with a few observations i shall close my letter  when it was reported in the english newspapers some short time since that the empress of russia had given to one of her minions a large tract of country and several thousands of peasants as property it very justly provoked indignation and abhorrence in those who heard it but if we compare the mode practiced in england with that which appears to u so abhorrent in russia it will be found to amount to very nearly the same thing  for example  as the whole of the revenue in england is drawn by taxe from the pockets of the people those things called gifts and grants of which kind are all pensions and sinecure places and paid out of that stock the difference therefore between the two modes is that in england the money is collected by the government and then given to the pensioner and in russia h is left to collect it for himself the smallest sum which the poorest family in a county so near to london as surry can b supposed to pay annually of taxes is not less than sive pounds and as your sinecure of one thousand and pension of three thousand per annum are made up of taxes paid by eight hundred of such poor families it comes to the same thing as if the eight hundred families had been given to you as in russia and you had collected money on your own account were you to say that you are not quartered particularly on the people of surry but on the nation at large objection would amount to nothing for as there are more pensioners than counties every one may be considered as quartered on that in which he lives  what honor or happiness you can derive from being the principal pauper of the neighborhood and occasioning a greater expense than the poor the aged and the infirm for ten miles round you i leave you to enjoy at the same time i can see that it is no wonder you should be strenuous in suppressing a book which strikes at the root of those abuses no wonder that you should be against reforms  against the freedom of the press and the right of investigation to you and to others of your description these are dreadful things but you should also consider that the motives which prompt you to act ought by reflection to compel you to be silent  having now returned your compliment and sufficiently tired your patience i take my leave of you with mentioning that if you had not prevented my former letter from being read at the meeting you would not have had the trouble of reading this and also with requesting that the next time you call me a common enemy you would add of us sinecure placemen and pensioners  i am sir etc etc thomas pain  letter iv to mr secretary dundas sir calais sept         i conceive it necessary to make you acquainted with the following circumstances the department of calais having elected me a member of the national convention of france i set off from london the   th inst in company with mr frost of spring gardens and mr audibert on of the municipal officers of calais who brought me the certificate of my being elected we had not arrived more i believe than five minutes at the york hotel at dover than the train of circumstances began that i am going to relate we had taken our baggage out of the carriage and put it into a room into which we went mr frost having occasion to go out was stopped in the passage by a gentleman who told him he must return into the room which he did and the gentleman came in with him and shut the door i had remained in the room mr audibert had gone to inquire when the packe was to sail the gentleman then said that he was collector of the customs and had an information against us and must examine our baggage for prohibited articles he produced his commission as collector mr frost demanded to see the information which the collector refused to show and continued to refuse on every demand that we made the collecto then called in several other officers and began first to searc our pockets he took from mr audibert who was then returned into the room every thing he found in his pockets and laid them on the table he then searched mr frost i the same manner who among other things had the key  the trunks in his pocket and then did the same by me m frost wanting to go out mentioned it and was going toward the door on which the collector placed himself against the door and said nobody should depart the room after the ke had been taken from mr frost for i had given him the ke of my trunks beforehand for the purpose of his attendi the baggage to the customs if it should be necessary  collector asked us to open the trunks presentings us the ke for that purpose this we declined to do unless he wou produce his information which he again refused the collector then opened the trunks himself and took out every paper and letter sealed or unsealed on our remonstrance with him on the bad policy as well as the illegality of customouse officers seizing papers and letters which were things that did not come under their cognizance he replied that the proclamation gave him that authority  among the letters which he took out of my trunk were two sealed letters given into my charge by the american minister at london one of which was directed to the american minister at paris the other to a private gentleman a letter from the president of the united states and a letter from the secretary of state in america both directed to me and which i had received from the american minister now in london and were private letters of friendship a letter from the electoral body of the department of calais containing the notification of my being elected to the national convention and a letter from the president of the national assembly informing me of my being also elected for the department of oise  as we found that all remonstrances with the collector on the bad policy and illegality of seizing papers and letters and detaining our persons by force under the pretense of searching for prohibited articles were vain for he justified himself on the prolamation and on the information which he refused to show we contented ourselves with assuring him that what he was then doing he would afterward have to answer for and left it to himself to do as he pleased  it appeared to us that the collector was acting under the direction of some other person or persons then in the hotel but whom he did not choose we should see or who did not choose to be seen by us for the collector went several times out of the room for a few minutes and was also called out several times  when the collector had taken what papers and letters he pleased out of the trunks he proceeded to read them the first letter he took up for this purpose was that from the president of the united states to me while he was doing this i said that it was very extraordinary that general washington could ot write a letter of private friendship to me without its being ject to be read by a customhouse officer upon this  frost laid his hand over the face of the letter and told the collector he should not read it and took it from him mr frost then casting his eye on the concluding paragraph of he letter said i will read this part to you which he did f which the following is an exact transcript  and as no one  can feel a greater interest in the appiness of mankind than  also it is the first wish of my heart that the enlightened policy of the present age may diffuse to all men those blessings to which they are entitled and lay the foundation of happiness to future generations  as all the other letters and papers lay then on the table the collector took them up and was going out of the room with them during the transactions already stated i contented myself with observing what passed but spoke but little but on seeing the collector going out of the room with the letters i told him that the papers and letters then in his hand were either belonging to me or entrusted to my charge and that as i could not permit them to be out of my sight i must insist on going with him  the collector then made a list of the letters and papers and went out of the room giving the letters and papers into the charge of one of the officers he returned in a short time and after some trifling conversation chiefly about the proclamation told us that he saw the information was illfounded and asked if we chose to put the letters and papers in the trunk ourselves which as we had not taken them out we declined doing and he did it himself and returned us the keys  in stating to you these matters i make no complaint against the personal conduct of the collector or of any of the officers their manner was as civil as such an extraordinary piece of business could admit of  my chief motive in writing to you on this subject is that you may take measures for preventing the like in future no only as it concerns private individuals but in order to preve a renewal of those unpleasant consequences that have herefore arisen between nations from circumstances equally as i significant i mention this only for myself but as the interruption extended to two other gentlemen it is probable th they as individuals will take some more effectual mode  redress  i am sir yours etc thomas pain p s among the papers seized was a copy of the attorn generals information against me for publishing the rights man and a printed proof copy of my latter to the addre which will soon be published    extract of a letter from calais sept         mr thomas pain after a passage of three hours arrived here yesterday from dover the different treatment he met with at the two seaports is such as ought to make an englishman blush for the character of his nation we must here correct our correspondents account it is true at he was insulted by the custom house officers and some persons ed as he went down to the vessel but the people were very civil done of them in particular came up to him and said that he did  want friends in dover   on the name of pain being announced the soldiery at the gates were drawn up and the officer on guard having embraced him presented him with the national cockade a very pretty woman who stood by desired she might have the honor of putting it in his hat expressing her hopes that he would continue his exertions in favor of liberty equality and france this ceremony being over he walked to deeins whose street is now called rue de legalite formerly rue de roi attended by men women and children crowding round him and calling out  vive thomas pain he was then conducted to the town hall and there presented to the municipality who with the greatest affection embraced their new representative the mayor then addressed him in  short speech which was interpreted to him by mr audiert to which pain laying his hand on his heart replied saying his life should be devoted to their service  at the inn he was waited upon by the different persons in authority and by the president of the constitutional society desiring he would attend their meeting of that night the whole town would have been there had there been room the all of the minimes was so crowded that it was with difficulty they made way for him to the side of the president over he chair he sat in was placed the bust of mirabeau and the colors of france england and america united a speaker cquainted him from the tribune of his election amidst the audits of the people the women did not spare their hands and for some minutes nothing was heard but  vive la nation vive thomas pain in voices male and female they have appointed an extra meeting in the church tomorrow in honor of their deputy to the convention the minimes being found quite suffocating from the concourse of people who attended yesterday tonight there is to be a play at which a box is to be reserved for the author of the rights of man the object of the english proclamation  every thing here has the appearance of peace and quietness the arsenals are well supplied and are able to stand two years siege  the duke of brunswick is still at verdun dumourier and kellerman have joined in his rear and he is now surrounded by near a hundred thousand men  i am etc p s mr pain has received a letter from the national assembly which he is said to be answering from hence he will not probably be at paris so soon as he thinks since he has been elected for abbeville and beavais as well as for calais and they will hardly let him pass without paying him some mark of their attention  we present this letter of mr audibert to our readers a an additional confirmation of the rising prosperity of france the defeat of the prussians at thionville and the false statement of continental affairs in the ministerial papers the public will be pleased to recollect that mr audibert wa the gentleman appointed to introduce that profound politician mr thomas pain to his foreign constituents you desire to know the state of affairs in france as the papers in the pay of government afford no certain intelligence but rather endeavor to raise the prejudices of you nation against mine i am happy to answer your question  we are now as quiet as ever we were in the most profound peace on the seat of war our friends are all busy b without confusion paris is calm calais is quiet and agreeable and many french and english families arrive here dai if you have any desire to reside here or travel through t country you may do either with the greatest safety t you may depend on the news arrived this day is very vourable to the cause of liberty the austrians attacked lille and were repulsed with great loss thionville was also attacked and the prussian army twice driven back the prussians lost   0 men among whom the prince of waldeck two other german princes were killed and many wounded the combined forces attacked general dumouriers army on three points at once and were every where repulsed with loss three hundred thousand men are now marching to annihilate the despots and their satellites and i doubt not but before the campaign is finished that desirable object will be accomplished liberty must finally triumph throughout the world  i went to london ten days ago deputed by the electoral assembly to conduct hither mr thomas pain author of the rights of man who is chosen a member of the national convention the ministerial party commissioned persons to pursue us to dover to insult us in a scandalous manner and search all our papers the customhouse officers when reprimanded for their behaving so insolently told us they were commanded by people of high authority to do so you will see this subject treated upon in the argus of the constitution and other patriotic papers i have written to mr dundas and am determined to prosecute the customhouse officer to determine publicly whether ministers or their creatures are authorized by the laws of your country to maltreat any person who conducts himself peaceably and properly at present you only possess the shadow of liberty but i hope the time is not far distant when we shall all not only be nominally but actually free  i remain with respect
