a collection of poems  vol i  a collection of poems in six volumes  by several hands    london printed by j hughs for r and j dodsley at tullyshead in pall mall  m dcc lxiii  advertisement the intent of the following volumes is to preserve to the public those poetical performances which seemed to merit a longer remembrance than what would probably be secured to them by the manner wherein they were originally published this design was first suggested to the editor as it was afterward conducted by the opinions of some gentlemen whose names it would do him the highest honor to mention he desires in this place also to make his acknowledgments to the authors of several pieces inserted in these volumes which were never before in print and which he is persuaded would be thought to add credit to the most judicious collection of this kind in our language he has nothing farther to premise but that the reader must not expect to be pleased with every particular poem which is here presented to him it is impossible to furnish out an entertainment of this nature where every part shall be relished by every guest it will be sufficient if nothing is set before him but what has been approved by those of the most acknowledged taste  on the prospect of peace a poem to the lord privy seal by mr tickel  sacerdos fronde super mitram et faelici comptus oliva virg contending kings and fields of death too long have been the subject of the british song who has not read of famed ramilias plain bavarias fall and danube choked with slain exhausted themes a gentle note i raise and sing returning peace in softer lays their fury quelled and martial rage allayed i wait our heroes in the sylvan shade disbanding hosts are imagd to my mind and warring powers in friendly leagues combined while ease and pleasure make the nations smile and heaven and anna bless britannias isle well sends our queen her mitred bristol forth for early counsels famed and longtryd worth who thirty rolling years had often withheld the suede and saxon from the dusty field completely formed to heal the christian wounds to name the kings and give each kingdom bounds the face of ravaged nature to repair by leagues to soften earth and heaven by prayer to gain by love where rage and slaughter fail and make the crosier over the sword prevail so when great moses with jehovahs wand had scattered plagues over stubborn pharaohs land now spread an host of locusts round the shore now turned niles fattning streams to putrid gore plenty and gladness marked the priest of god and sudden almonds shot from aarons rod o thou from whom these bounteous blessings flow to whom as chief the hopes of peace we owe for next to thee the man whom kings contend to style companion and to make their friend great strafford rich in every courtly grace with joyful pride accepts the second place from britains isle and isis sacred spring one hour oh listen while the muses sing though ministers of mighty monarchs wait with beating hearts to learn their masters fate one hour forbear to speak thy queens commands nor think the world thy charge neglected stands the blissful prospects in my verse displayed may lure the stubborn the deceived persuade even thou to peace shall speedier urge the way and more be hastened by this short delay the haughty gaul in ten campaigns overthrown now ceased to think the western world his own often had he mourned his boasting leaders bound and his proud bulwarks smoking on the ground in vain with powers renewed he filled the plain made timorous vows and bribed the saints in vain as often his legions did the fight decline lurked in the trench and skulkd behind the line before his eyes the fancied javelin gleams at feasts he starts and seems dethroned in dreams on glory past reflects with secret pain on mines exhausted and on millions slain to britains queen the sceptered suppliant bends to her his crowns and infant race commends who grieves her fame with christian blood to buy nor asks for glory at a price so high at her decree the war suspended stands and britains heroes hold their lifted hands their open brows no threatening frowns disguise but gentler passions sparkle in their eyes the gauls who never in their courts could find such tempered fire with manly beauty joined doubt if they are those whom dreadful to the view in forms so fierce their fearful fancies drew at whose dire names ten thousand widows pressed their helpless orphans clinging to the breast in silent rapture each his foe surveys they vow firm friendship and give mutual praise brave minds however at war are secret friends their generous discord with the battle ends in peace they wonder whence dissension rose and ask how souls so like could ever be foes methinks i hear more friendly shouts rebound and social clarions mix their sprightly sound the british flags are furled her troops disband and scattered armies seek their native land the hardy veteran proud of many a scar the manly charms and honors of the war who hoped to share his friends illustrious doom and in the battle find a soldiers tomb leans on his spear to take his farewell view and sighing bids the glorious camp adieu ye generous fair receive the brave with smiles oerpay their sleepless nights and crown their toils soft beauty is the gallant soldiers due for you they conquer and they bleed for you in vain proud gaul with boastul spain conspires when english valor english beauty fires the nations dread your eyes and kings despair of chiefs so brave till they have nymphs so fair see the fond wife in tears of transport drowned hugs her rough lord and weeps over every wound hangs on the lips that fields of blood relate and smiles and trembles at his various fate near the full bowl he draws the fancied line and marks feigned trenches in the flowing wine then sets the invested fort before her eyes and mines that whirled battalions to the skies his little listening progeny turn pale and beg again to hear the dreadful tale such dire achievements sings the bard that tells of palfreyd dames bold knights and magic spells where whole brigades one champions arms oerthrow and cleave a giant at a random blow slay panyms vile that force the fair and tame the goblins fury and the dragons flame our eager youth to distant nations run to visit fields their valiant fathers won from flandrias shore their countrys fame they trace till far germania shows her blasted face the exulting briton asks his mournful guide where his hard fate the lost bavaria tried where stepney engraved the stone to annas fame he points to blenheim once a vulgar name here fled the household there did tallard yield here malbrough turned the fortune of the field on those steep banks near danubes raging flood the gauls thrice started back and trembling stood when churchills arm perceived they stood not long but plunged amidst the waves a desperate throng crowds whelmed on crowds dashed wide the watery bed and drove the current to its distant head as when by raphaels or by knellers hands a warlike courser on the canvas stands such as on landen bleeding ormond bore or set young ammon on the granic shore if chance a generous steed the work behold he snorts he neighs he champs the foamy gold so hocstet seen tumultuous passions roll and hints of glory fire the britons soul in fancied fights he sees the troops engage and all the tempest of the battle rage charm me ye powers with scenes less nobly bright far humbler thoughts the inglorious muse delight content to see the horrors of the field by ploughshares levelled or in flowers concealed over shattered walls may creeping ivy twine and grass luxuriant cloth the harmless mine tame flocks ascend the breach without a wound or crop the bastion now a fruitful ground while shepherds sleep along the rampart laid or pipe beneath the formidable shade who was the man oblivion blast his name torn out and blotted from the list of fame who fond of lawless rule and proudly brave first sunk the filial subject to a slave his neighbors realms by frauds unkingly gained in guiltless blood the sacred ermine stained laid schemes for death to slaughter turned his heart and fitted murder to the rules of art ah cursed ambition to thy lures we owe all the great ills that mortals bear below cursed by the hind when to the spoil he yields his years whole sweat and vainlyripend fields cursed by the maid torn from her lovers side when left a widow though not yet a bride by mothers cursed when floods of tears they shed and scatter useless roses on the dead oh sacred bristol then what dangers prove the arts thou smilst on with paternal love then mixed with rubbish by the brutal foes in vain the marble breathes the canvas glows to shades obscure the glittering sword pursues the gentle poet and defenseless muse a voice like thine alone might then assuage the warriors fury and control his rage to hear thee speak might the fierce vandal stand and fling the brandished fabre from his hand far hence be driven to scythias stormy shore the drums harsh music and the cannons roar let grim bellona haunt the lawless plain where tartarclans and grisly cossacks reign let the steeled turk be deaf to matrons cries see virgins ravished with relentless eyes to death gray heads and smiling infants doom nor spare the promise of the pregnant womb over wasted kingdoms spread his wide command the savage lord of an unpeopled land her guiltless glory just britannia draws from pure religion and impartial laws to europes wounds a mothers aid she brings and holds in equal scales the rival kings her generous sons in choicest gifts abound alike in arms alike in arts renowned as when sweet venus so the fable sings awaked by nereids from the ocean springs with smiles she sees the threatening billows rise spreads smooth the surge and clears the louring skies light over the deep with fluttering cupids crowned the pearly couch and silver turtles bound her tresses shed ambrosial odours round amidst the world of waves so stands serene britannias isle the oceans stately queen in vain the nations have conspired her fall her trench the sea and fleets her floating wall defenseless barks her powerful navy near have only waves and hurricanes to fear what bold invader or what land oppressed has not her anger quelled her aid redressed say where have ever her unioncrosses sailed but much her arms her justice more prevailed her labors are to plead the almightys cause her pride to teach the untamed barbarian laws who conquers wins by brutal strength the prize but it is a godlike work to civilize have we forgot how from great russias throne the king whose power half europes regions own whose scepter waving with one shout rush forth in swarms the harnessed millions of the north through realms of ice pursued his tedious way to court our friendship and our fame survey hence the rich prize of useful arts he bore and round his empire spread the learned store to adorn old realms is more than new to raise his countrys parent is a monarchs praise his bands now march in just array to war and caspian gulphs unusual navies bear with runic lays smolenskos forests ring and wondering volga hears the muses sing did not the painted kings of india greet our queen and lay their scepters at her feet chiefs who full bowls of hostile blood had quaffd famed for the javelin and envenomed shaft whose haughty brows made savages adore nor bowed to less than stars or sun before her pitying smile accepts their suppliant claim and adds four monarchs to the christian name blessed use of power o virtuous pride in kings and like his bounty whence dominion springs which over new worlds makes heavens indulgence shine and ranges myriads under laws divine well bought with all that those sweet regions hold with groves of spices and with mines of gold fearless our merchant now pursues his gain and roams securely over the boundless main now over his head the polar bear he spies and freezing spangles of the lapland skies now swells his canvas to the sultry line with glittering spoils where indian grottoes shine where fumes of incense glad the southern seas and wafted citron scents the balmy breeze here nearer suns prepare the ripening gem to grace great annes imperial diadem and here the ore whose melted mass shall yield on faithful coins each memorable field which mixed with medals of immortal rome may clear disputes and teach the time to come in circling beams shall godlike anna glow and churchills sword hang over the prostrate foe in comely wounds shall bleeding worthies stand webbs firm platoon and lumlys faithful band bold mordaunt in iberian trophies dressed and campbells dragon on his dauntless breast great ormonds deeds on vigos spoils enrolled and guiscards knife on harleys chili gold and if the muse o bristol might decree here granville noted by the lyre should be the lyre for granville and the cross for thee such are the honors grateful britain pays so patriots merit and so monarchs praise over distant times such records shall prevail when english numbers antiquated fail a trifling song the muse can only yield and sooth her soldiers panting from the field to sweet retirements see them safe conveyed and raise their battles in the rural shade from fields of death to woodstocks peaceful glooms the poets haunt britannias hero comes  begin my muse and softly touch the string here henry loved and chaucer learned to sing hail fabled grotto hail elysian soil thou fairest spot of fair britannias isle where kings of old concealed forgot the throne and beauty was content to shine unknown where love and war by turns pavilions rear and henrys bowers near blenheims dome appear the wearied champion lull in soft alcoves the noblest boast of thy romantic groves often if the muse presage shall he be seen by rosamonda fleeting over the green in dreams be hailed by heroes mighty shades and hear old chaucer warble through the glades over the famed echoing vaults his name shall bound and hill to hill reflect the favorite sound here here at least thy love for arms give over nor one world conquered fondly wish for more vice of great souls alone o thirst of fame the muse admires it while she strives to blame thy toils be now to chase the bounding deer or view the coursers stretch in wild career this lovely scene shall sooth thy soul to rest and wear each dreadful image from thy breast with pleasure by thy conquests shall thou see thy queen triumphant and all europe free no cares henceforth shall thy repose destroy but what thou givst the world thyself enjoy sweet solitude when lifes gay hours are past however we range in thee we six at last tossed through tempestuous seas the voyage over pale we look back and bless the friendly shore our own strict judges our past life we scan and ask if glory has enlarged the span if bright the prospect we the grave defy trust future ages and contented die when strangers from fardistant climes shall come to view the pomp of this triumphant dome where reared aloft dissembled trophies stand and breathing labors of the sculptors hand where knellers art shall paint the flying gaul and bourbons woes shall fill the storyd wall heirs of thy blood shall over their bounteous board fix europes guard thy monumental sword banners that often have waved on conquered walls and trumps that drowned the groans of gasping gauls fair dames shall often with curious eye explore the costly robes that slaughtered generals wore rich trappings from the danubes whirlpools brought hesperian nuns the gorgeous broidry wrought belts stiff with gold the boian horsemans pride and gauls fair flowers in human crimson died of churchills race perhaps some lovely boy shall mark the burnished steel that hangs on high shall gaze transported on its glittering charms and reach it struggling with unequal arms by signs the drums tumultuous sound request then seek in starts the hushing mothers breast so in the painters animated frame where mars embraces the soft paphian dame the little loves in sport the faulchion wield or join their strength to heave his ponderous shield one strokes the plume in tityons gore embrud and one the spear that reeks in typhons blood anothers infant brows the helm sustain he nods his crest and frights the shrieking train thus the rude tempest of the field oerblown shall whiter rounds of smiling years roll on our victors blessed in peace forget their wars enjoy past dangers and absolve the stars but oh what sorrows shall bedew your urns ye honored shades whom widowed albion mourns if your thin forms yet discontented moan and haunt the mangled mansions once your own behold what flowers the pious muses strew and tears which in the midst of triumph flow cypress and bays your envied brows surround your names the tender matrons heart shall wound and the soft maid grow pensive at the sound accept great anne the tears their memory draws who nobly perished in their sovreigns cause for thou in pity bidst the war give over mournst thy slain heroes nor wilt venture more vast price of blood on each victorious day but europes freedom does that price repay lamented triumphs when one breath must tell that marlborough conquered and that dormer fell great queen whose name strikes haughty monarchs pale on whose just scepter hangs europas scale whose arm like mercy wounds decides like fate on whose decree the nations anxious wait from albions cliffs thy wide extended hand shall over the main to far peru command so vast a tract whose wide domain shall run its circling skies shall see no setting sun thee thee an hundred languages shall claim and savage indians swear by annas name the line and poles shall own thy rightful sway and thy commands the severed globe obey round the vast ball thy new dominions chain the watery kingdoms and control the main magellans streights to gibraltar they join across the seas a formidable line the sight of adverse gaul we fear no more but pleased see dunkirk now a guiltless shore in vain great neptune tore the narrow ground and meant his waters for britannias bound her giant genius takes a mighty stride and sets his foot beyond the incroaching tide on either bank the land its master knows and in the midst the subject ocean flows so near proud rhodes across the raging flood stupendous form the vast colossus stood while at one foot their thronging galleys ride a whole hours sail scarce reach the farther side betwixt his brazen thighs in loose array ten thousand streamers on the billows play by harleys counsels dunkirk now restored to britains empire owns her ancient lord in him transfused his godlike father reigns rich in the blood which swelled that patriots veins who boldly faithful met his sovreigns frown and scorned for gold to yield the important town his son was born the ravished prey to claim and france still trembles at an harleys name a fort so dreadful to our english shore our fleets scarce feared the sands or tempests more whose vast expenses to such sums amount that the taxed gaul scarce furnished out the account whose walls such bulwarks such vast towers restrain its weakest ramparts are the rocks and main his boast great louis yields and cheaply buys thy friendship anna with the mighty prize holland repining and in grief cast down sees the new glories of the british crown ah may they never provoke thee to the fight nor foes more dreadful than the gauls invite soon may they hold the olive soon assuage their secret murmurs nor call forth thy rage to rend their banks and pour at one command thy realm the sea over their precarious land henceforth be thine vicegerent of the skies scorned worth to raise and vice in robes chastise to dry the orphans tears and from the bar chase the bribed judge and hush the wordy war deny the cursed blasphemers tongue to rage and turn gods fury from an impious age blessed change the soldiers late destroying hand shall rear new temples in his native land mistaken zealots shall with fear behold and beg admittance in our sacred fold on her own works the pious queen shall smile and turn her cares upon her favorite isle so the keen bolt a warrior angel aims arrayed in clouds and wrapped in mantling flames he bears a tempest on his sounding wings and his red arm the forky vengeance flings at length heavens wrath appeased he quits the war to roll his orb and guide his destined star to shed kind fate and lucky hours bestow and smile propitious on the world below around thy throne shall faithful nobles wait these guard the church and those direct the state to bristol graceful in maternal tears the church her towry forehead gently rears she begs her pious son to assert her cause defend her rights and reinforce her laws with holy zeal the sacred work begin to bend the stubborn and the meek to win our oxfords earl in careful thought shall stand to raise his queen and save a sinking land the wealthiest glebe to ravenous spaniards known he marks and makes the golden world our own content with hands unsoild to guard the prize and keep the store with undesiring eyes so round the tree that bore hesperian gold the sacred watch lay curled in many a fold his eyes uprearing to the untasted prey the sleepless guardian wasted life away beneath the peaceful olives raised by you her ancient pride shall every art renew the arts with you famed harcourt shall defend and courtly bolingbroke the muses friend with piercing eye some search where nature plays and trace the wanton through her darksome maze whence health from herbs from seeds how groves begun how vital streams in circling eddies run some teach why round the sun the spheres advance in the fixed measures of their mystic dance how tides when heaved by pressing moons overflow and sunborn iris paints her flowery bow in happy chains our daring language bound shall sport no more in arbitrary sound but buskined bards henceforth shall wisely rage and grecian plans reform britannias stage till congreve bids her smile augusta stands and longs to weep when flowing row commands britains spectators shall their strength combine to mend our morals and our taste refine fight virtues cause stand up in wits defense win us from vice and laugh us into sense nor prior have thou hushed the trump in vain thy lyre shall now revive her mirthful strain new tales shall now be told if right i see the soul of chaucer is restored in thee garth in majestic numbers to the stars shall raise mockheroes and fantastic wars like the young spreading laurel pope thy name shoots up with strength and rises into fame with phillips shall the peaceful valleys ring and britain hear a second spenser sing that muchloved youth whom utrechts walls confine to bristols praises shall his straffords join he too from whom attentive oxford draws rules for just thinking and poetic laws to growing bards his learned aid shall send the strictest critic and the kindest friend even mine a bashful muse whose rude essays scarce hope for pardon not aspire to praise cherished by you in time may grow to fame and mine survive with bristols glorious name fired with the views this glittering scene displays and smit with passion for my countrys praise my artless reed attempts this lofty theme where sacred isis rolls her ancient stream in cloistered domes the great philippas pride where learning blooms while fame and worth preside where the fifth henry arts and arms was taught and edward formed his cressy yet unfought where laureled bards have struck the warbling strings the seat of sages and the nurse of kings here thy commands o lancaster inflame my eager breast to raise the british name urge on my soul with no ignoble pride to woo the muse whom addison enjoyed see that bold swan to heaven sublimely soar pursue at distance and his steps adore to the right honorable the earl of warwick etc on the death of mr addison by the same if dumb too long the drooping muse has stayed and left her debt to addison unpaid blame not her silence warwick but bemoan and judge oh judge my bosom by your own what mourner ever felt poetic fires slow comes the verse that real woe inspires grief unaffected suits but ill with art or flowing numbers with a bleeding heart can i forget the dismal night that gave my souls best part forever to the grave how silent did his old companions tread by midnight lamps the mansions of the dead through breathing statues then unheeded things through rows of warriors and through walks of kings what awe did the slow solemn knell inspire the pealing organ and the pausing choir the duties by the lawnrobd prelate paid and the last words that dust to dust conveyed while speechless over thy closing grave we bend accept these tears thou dear departed friend oh gone for ever take this long adieu and sleep in peace next thy loved montagu to strew fresh laurels let the task be mine a frequent pilgrim at thy sacred shrine mine with true sighs thy absence to bemoan and grave with faithful epitaphs thy stone if ever from me thy loved memorial part may shame afflict this alienated heart of thee forgetful if i form a song my lyre be broken and untuned my tongue my grief be doubled from thy image free and mirth a torment unchastisd by thee often let me range the gloomy isles alone sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown along the walls where speaking marbles show what worthies form the hallowed mould below proud names who once the reins of empire held in arms who triumphed or in arts excelled chiefs graced with scars and prodigal of blood stern patriots who for sacred freedom stood just men by whom impartial laws are given and saints who taught and led the way to heaven never to these chambers where the mighty rest since their foundation came a nobler guest nor ever was to the bowers of bliss conveyed a fairer spirit or more welcome shade in what new region to the just assigned what new employments please the unbodyd mind a winged virtue through the etherial sky from world to world unwearied does he fly or curious trace the long laborious maze of heavens decrees where wondering angels gaze does he delight to hear hold seraphs tell how michael battled and the dragon fell or mixed with milder cherubim to glow in hymns of love not ill essayed below or do thou warn poor mortals left behind a task well suited to thy gentle mind oh if sometimes thy spotless form descend to me thy aid thou guardian genius lend when age misguides me or when fear alarms when pain distresses or when pleasure charms in silent whisprings purer thoughts impart and turn from ill a frail and feeble heart lead through the paths thy virtue trod before till bliss shall join nor death can part us more that aweful form which so the heavens decree must still be loved and still deplored by me in nightly visions seldom fails to rise or roused by fancy meet my waking eyes if business calls or crowded courts invite the unblemished statesman seems to strike my sight if in the stage i seek to sooth my care i meet his soul which breathes in cato there if pensive to the rural shades i rove his shape oertakes me in the lonely grove twas there of just and good he reasoned strong cleared some great truth or raised some serious song there patient showed us the wise course to steer a candid censor and a friend sincere there taught us how to live and oh too high the price for knowledge taught us how to die thou hill whose brow the antique structures grace reared by bold chiefs of warwicks noble race why once so loved wheneer thy bower appears over my dim eye balls glance the sudden tears how sweet were once thy prospects fresh and fair thy sloping walks and unpolluted air how sweet the glooms beneath thy aged trees thy noontide shadow and the evening breeze his image thy forsaken bowers restore thy walks and airy prospects charm no more no more the summer in thy glooms allayed thy evening breezes and thy noonday shade from other ills however fortune frowned some refuge in the muses art i found reluctant now i touch the trembling string bereft of him who taught me how to sing and these sad accents murmured over his urn betray that absence they attempt to mourn oh must i then now fresh my bosom bleeds and craggs in death to addison succeeds the verse begun to one lost friend prolong and weep a second in the unfinished song these words divine which on his deathbed laid to thee o craggs the expiring sage conveyed great but illomend monument of fame nor he survived to give nor thou to claim swift after him thy social spirit flies and close to his how soon thy coffin lies blessed pair whose union future bards shall tell in future tongues each others boast farewell farewell whom joined in fame in friendship tried no chance could sever nor the grave divide colin and lucy by the same i of leinster famed for maidens fair bright lucy was the grace nor ever did liffys limpid stream reflect a fairer face ii till luckless love and pining care impaired her rosy hue her dainty lip her damask check and eyes of glossy blue iii ah have you seen a lily pale when beating rains descend so drooped this slowconsuming maid her life now near its end iv by lucy warned of flattering swains take heed ye easy fair of vengeance due to broken vows ye flattering swains beware v three times all in the dead of night a bell was heard to ring and at her window shrieking thrice the raven flapd his wing vi full well the lovelorn maiden knew the solemn boding sound and thus in dying words bespake the virgins weeping round vii i hear a voice you cannot hear that cries i must not stay i see a hand you cannot see that beckons me away viii of a false swain and broken heart in early youth i die am i to blame because the bride is twice as rich as i ix ah colin give not her thy vows vows due to me alone nor thou rash girl receive his kiss nor think him all thy own x tomorrow in the church to wed impatient both prepare but know false man and know fond maid poor lucy will be there xi then bear my corse ye comrades dear the bridegroom blithe to meet he in his weddingtrim so gay i in my winding sheet xii she spoke she died her corse was borne the bridegroom blithe to meet he in his wedding trim so gay she in her winding sheet xiii what then were colins dreadful thoughts how were these nuptials kept the bridemen flocked round lucy dead and all the village wept xiv compassion shame remorse despair at once his bosom

he to his lucys newmade grave conveyed by trembling swains in the same mould beneath one sod forever now remains xvii often at this place the constant hind and plighted maid are seen with garlands gay and truelove knots they deck the sacred green xviii but swain forsworn whoer thou art this hallowed ground forbear remember colins dreadful fate and fear to meet him there an imitation of the prophecy

rebellious crew i see the target cast away and checkered plad become their prey the checkered plad to make a gown for many a lass in london town in vain the hungry mountaineers come forth in all their

land and every hero worthy of thy hand have thou forgot that mighty bourbon feared he still was mortal till thy draught appeared that cosmo chose thy glowing form to place amidst her masters of the lombard race see on her titians and her guidos urns her failing arts forlorn hesperia mourns while britain wins each garland from her brow her wit and freedom first her painting now let the faint copier on old tybers shore nor mean the task each breathing bust explore line after line with painful patience trace this roman grandeur that athenian grace vain care of parts if impotent of soul the industrious workman fails to warm the whole each theft betrays the marble whence it came and a cold statue stiffen in the frame thee nature taught nor art her aid denied the kindest mistress and the surest guide to catch a likeness at one piercing fight and place the fairest in the fairest light ere yet the pencil tries her nicer toils or on the palette lie the blended oils thy careless chalk has

brave man shall quit thee with thy life alive though stained by every abject slave secure of fame and justice in the grave ah no  when once the mortal yields to fate the blast of fames sweet trumpet sounds too late too late to stay the spirit on its flight or sooth the new inhabitant of light who hears regardless while fond man distressed hangs on the absent and laments the blessed farewell then fame ill sought through fields of blood farewell unfaithful promiser of good thou music warbling to the deafend ear thou incense wasted on the funeral bier through life pursued in vain by death

knights and barons bold whose vacant seats by virtue bought ambitious emperors have sought where britains foremost names are found in peace beloved in war renowned who made the hostile nations moan or

dinted shield the dread of gauls in cressis field which in thy higharchd temple raised for four long centuries has blazed iii these seats our sires a hardy kind to the fierce sons of war consigned the flowery of chivalry who drew with sinewy arm the stubborn yew or with heaved pollaxe cleared the field or who in jousts and tourneys skilled before their ladies eyes renowned threw horse and horseman

ye fair your radiant eyes where all unlevelld the gay garden lies if generous anguish for anothers pains ere heaved your hearts or shivered through your veins look down attentive on the pleasing dale and listen to my melancholy tale that hollow space where now in living rows line above line the yews sad verdure grows was ere the planters hand its beauty gave a common pit a rude unfashiond cave the landscape now so sweet we well may praise but far far sweeter in its ancient days far sweeter was it when its peopled ground with fairy domes and dazzling towers were crowned where in the midst those verdant pillars spring rose the proud palace of the elfin king for every hedge of vegetable green in happier years a crowded street was seen nor all those leaves that now the prospect grace could match the numbers of its pigmy race what urged this mighty empire to its fate a tale of woe and wonder i relate when albion ruled the land whose lineage came from neptune mingling with a mortal dame their midnight pranks the sprightly fairies played on every hill and danced in every shade but foes to sunshine most they took delight in dells and dales concealed from human sight there hewed their houses in the arching rock or scoopd the bosom of the blasted oak or heard oershadowd by some shelving hill the distant murmurs of the falling rill they rich in pilferd spoils indulged their mirth and pitied the huge wretched sons of earth even now it is said the hinds oerheard their strain and strive to view their airy forms in vain they to their cells at mans approach repair like the shy leveret or the mother hare the whilst poor mortals startle at the sound of unseen footsteps on the haunted ground amid this garden then with woods oergrown stood the loved seat of royal oberon from every region to his palace gate came peers and princes of the fairy state who ranked in council round the sacred shade their monarchs will and great behests obeyed from thames fair banks by lofty towers adorned with loads of plunder often his chiefs returned hence in proud robes and colors bright and gay shone every knight and every lovely ay whoever on powells dazzling stage displayed has famed king pepin and his court surveyed may guess if old by modern things we trace the pomp and splendour of the fairy race by magic fenced by spell encompassed round no mortal touched this interdicted ground no mortal entered those alone who came stolen from the couch of some terrestrial dame for often of babes they robbed the matrons bed and left some sickly changeling in their stead it chanced a youth of albions royal blood was fostered here the wonder of the wood milkah for wiles above her peers renowned deepskilld in charms and many a mystic sound as through the regal dome she sought for prey observed the infant albion where he lay in mantles broiderd over with gorgeous pride and stole him from the sleeping mothers side who now but milkah triumphs in her mind ah wretched nymph to future evils blind the time shall come when thou shall dearly pay the theft hardhearted of that guilty day thou in thy turn shall like the queen repine and all her sorrows doubled shall be thine he who adorns thy house the lovely boy who now adorns it shall at length destroy two hundred moons in their pale course had seen the gayrobd fairies glimmer on the green and albion now had reached in youthful prime to nineteen years as mortals measure time flushed with resistless charms he fired to love each nymph and little dryad of the grove for skilful milkah spared not to employ her utmost art to rear the princely boy each supple limb she swaithd and tender bone and to the elsin standard kept him down she robbed dwarfelders of their fragrant fruit and fed him early with the daisys root whence through his veins the powerful juices ran and formed in beauteous miniature the man yet still two inches teller than the rest his lofty port his human birth confessed a foot in height how stately did he show how look superior on the crowd below what knight like him could toss the rushy lance who move so graceful in the mazy dance a shape so nice or features half so fair what elf could boast or such a flow of hair bright kenna saw a princess born to reign and felt the charmer burn in every vein she heiress to this empires potent lord praised like the stars and next the moon adored she whom at distance thrones and princedoms viewed to whom proud oriel and azuriel sud in her high palace languishd void of joy and pined in secret for a mortal boy he too was smitten and discreetly strove by courtly deeds to gain the virgins love for her he culled the fairest flowers that grew ere morning suns had drained their fragrant dew he chased the hornet in his midday flight and brought her glowworms in the noon of night when on ripe fruit she cast a wishing eye did ever albion think the tree too high he showed her where the pregnant goldfinch hung and the wrenmother brooding over her young to her the inscription on their eggs he read admire ye clerks the youth whom milkah bred to her he showed each herb of virtuous juice their powers distinguished and described their use all vain their powers alas to kenna prove and well sung ovid there is no herb for love as when a ghost enlarged from realms below seeks its old friend to tell some secret woe the poor shade shivering stands and must not break his painful silence till the mortal speak so fared it with the little lovesick maid forbid to utter what her eyes betrayed he saw her anguish and revealed his flame and spared the blushes of the tonguetyd dame the day would fail me should i reckon over the sighs they lavished and the oaths they swore in words so melting that compared with those the nicest courtship of terrestrial beaus would sound like compliments from countryclowns to redcheekd sweethearts in their homespun gowns all in a lawn of many a various hue a bed of flowers a fairy forest grew twas here one noon the gaudiest of the may the still the secret silent hour of day beneath a lofty tulips ample shade sat the young lover and the immortal maid they thought all fairies slept ah luckless pair hid but in vain in the suns noontide glare when albion leaning on his kennas breast thus all the softness of his soul expressed all things are hushed the suns meridian rays veil the horizon in one mighty blaze nor moon nor star in heavens blue arch is seen with kindly rays to silver over the green grateful to fairy eyes they secret take their rest and only wretched mortals wake this dead of day i fly to thee alone a world to me a multitude in one oh sweet as dewdrops on these flowery lawns when the sky opens and the evening dawns streight as the pink that tours so high in air soft as the bluebell as the daisy fair blest be the hour when first i was conveyed an infant captive to this blissful shade and blessed the hand that did my form refine and shrunk my stature to a match with thine glad i for thee renounce my royal birth and all the giantdaughters of the earth thou if thy breast with equal ardour burn renounce thy kind and love for love return so from us two combined by nuptial ties a race unknown of demigods shall rise oh speak my love my vows with vows repay and sweetly swear my rising fears away to whom the shining azure of her eyes more brightened thus the enamored maid replies by all the stars and first the glorious moon i swear and by the head of oberon a dreadful oath no prince of fairy line shall ever in wedlock plight his vows with mine whereeer my footsteps in the dance are seen may toadstools rise and mildews blast the green may the keen east wind blight my favorite flowers and snakes and spotted adders haunt my bowers confind whole ages in an hemlock shade there rather pine i a neglected maid or worse exiled from cynthias gentle rays parch in the sun a thousand summerdays than any prince a prince of fairy line in sacred wedlock plight his vows with mine she ended and with lips of rosy hue dipped five times over in ambrosial dew stifled his words when from his covert reared the frowning brow of oberon appeared a sunflowers trunk was near whence killing sight the monarch issued half an ell in height full on the pair a furious look he cast nor spoke but gave his buglehorn a blast that through the woodland echoed far and wide and drew a swarm of subjects to his side a hundred chosen knights in war renowned drive albion banished from the sacred ground and twice ten myriads guard the bright abodes where the proud king among his demigods for kennas sudden bridal bids prepare and to azuriel gives the weeping fair if fame in arms with ancient birth combined and faultless beauty and a spotless mind to love and praise can generous souls incline that love azuriel and that praise were thine blood only less than royal filled thy veins proud was thy roof and large thy fair domains where now the skies high hollandhouse invades and shortlived warwick saddend all the shades thy dwelling stood nor did in him afford a nobler owner or a lovelier lord for thee a hundred fields produced their store and by thy name ten thousand vassals swore so loved thy name that at their monarchs choice all fairy shouted with a general voice oriel alone a secret rage suppressed that from his bosom heaved the golden vest along the banks of them his empire ran wide was his range and populous his clan when cleanly servants if we trust old tales besides their wages had good fairy vails whole heaps of silver tokens nightly paid the careful wife or the neat dairymaid sunk not his stores with smiles and powerful bribes he gained the leaders of his neighbor tribes and ere the night the face of heaven had changed beneath his banners half the fairies ranged meanwhile driven back to earth a lonely way the chearless albion wandered half the day a long long journey choked with brakes and thorns illmeasurd by ten thousand barleycorns tired out at length a spreading stream he spied fed by old them a daughter of the tide twas then a spreading stream though now its fame obscured it bears the creeks inglorious name and creeps as through contracted bounds it strays a leap for boys in these degenerate days on the clear crystals verdant bank he stood and thrice looked backward on the fatal wood and thrice he groaned and thrice he beat his breast and thus in tears his kindred gods addressed if true ye watery powers my lineage came from neptune mingling with a mortal dame down to his court with coral garlands crowned through all your grottoes waft my plaintive sound and urge the god whose trident shakes the earth to grace his offspring and assert my birth he said a gentle naiad heard his prayer and touched with pity for a lovers care shoots to the sea where low beneath the tides old neptune in the unfathomed depth resides roused at the news the seas stern sultan swore revenge and scarce from present arms forbore but first the nymph his harbinger he sends and to her care his favorite boy commends as through the thames her backward course she guides driven up his current by the refluent tides along his banks the pygmy legions spread she spies and haughty oriel at their head soon with wronged albions name the host she fires and counts the oceans god among his sires the oceans god by whom shall be overthrown styx heard his oath the tyrant oberon see here beneath a toadstools deadly gloom lies albion him the fates your leader doom hear and obey it is neptunes powerful call by him azuriel and his king shall fall she said they bowed and on their shield upbore with shouts their newsaluted emperor even oriel smiled at least to smile he strove and hopes of vengeance triumphed over love see now the mourner of the lonely shade by gods protected and by hosts obeyed a slave a chief by fickle fortunes play in the short course of one revolving day what wonder if the youth so strangely blessed felt his heart flutter in his little breast his thickembatteld troops with secret pride he views extended half an acre wide more light he treads more tall he seems to rise and struts a strawbreadth nearer to the skies o for thy muse mr addison great bard whose lofty strains in battle joined the pygmies and the cranes each gandy knight had i that warmth divine each colored legion in my verse should shine but simple i and innocent of art the tale that soothed my infant years impart the tale i heard whole winter eves untird and sing the battles that my nurse inspired now the shrill cornpipes echoing loud to arms to rank and file reduce the straggling swarms thick rows of spears at once with sudden glare a grove of needles glitter in the air loose in the wind small ribbon streamers flow dipped in all colors of the heavenly bow and the gay host that now its march pursues gleams over the meadows in a thousand hues on budas plains thus formidably bright shone asias sons a pleasing dreadful sight in various robes their silken troops were seen the blue the red and prophets sacred green when blooming brunswick near the danubes flood first stained his maiden sword in turkish blood unseen and silent march the slow brigades through pathless wilds and unfrequented shades in hopes already vanquished by surprise in albions power the fairy empire lies already has he seized on kennas charms and the glad beauty trembles in his arms the march concludes and now in prospect near but fenced with arms the hostile towers appear for oberon or druids falsely sing wore his prime visir in a magic ring a subtle spright that opening plots foretold by sudden dimness on the beamy gold hence in a crescent formed his legions bright with beating bosoms waited for the fight to charge their foes they march a glittering band and in their van does bold azuriel stand what rage that hour did albions soul possess let chiefs imagine and let lovers guess forth issuing from his ranks that strove in vain to check his course athwart the dreadful plain he strides indignant and with haughty cries to single fight the fairy prince defies forbear rash youth the unequal war to try nor sprung from mortals with immortals vie no god stands ready to avert thy doom nor yet thy grandsire of the waves is come my words are vain  no words the wretch can move by beauty dazzled and betwichd by love he longs he burns to win the glorious prize and sees no danger while he sees her eyes now from each host the eager warriors start and furious albion flings his hasty dart twas feathered from the bees transparent wing and its shaft ended in a hornets sting but tossed in rage it flew without a wound high over the foe and guiltless pierced the ground not so azuriels with unerring aim too near the needlepointed javelin came drove through the sevenfold shield and silken vest and lightly rased the lovers ivory breast roused at the smart and rising to the blow with his keen sword he cleaves his fairy foe sheer from the shoulder to the waist he cleaves and of one arm the tottering trunk bereaves his useless steel brave albion wields no more but sternly smiles and thinks the combat over so had it been had aught of mortal strain or less than fairy felt the deadly pain but empyreal forms however in fight gashd and dismembered easily unite as some frail cup of chinas purest mold with azure varnished and bedropd with gold though broke if cured by some nice virgins hands in its old strength and pristine beauty stands the tumults of the boiling bohea braves and hold secure the coffees sable waves so did azuriels arm if fame say true rejoin the vital trunk whence first it grew and whilst in wonder fixed poor albion stood plunged the cursed sabre in his hearts warm blood the golden broidery tender milkah wove the breast to kenna sacred and to love lie rent and mangled and the gaping wound pours out a flood of purple on the ground the jetty luster sickens in his eyes on his cold cheeks the bloomy freshness dies oh kenna kenna thrice he tried to say kenna farewell and sighed his soul away his fall the dryads with loud shrieks deplore by sister naiads echoed from the shore thence down to neptunes secret realms conveyed through grots and glooms and many a coral shade the seas great sire with looks denouncing war the trident shakes and mounts the pearly carr with one stern frown the widespread deep deforms and works the madding ocean into storms over foaming mountains and through bursting tides now high now low the bounding chariot rides till through the thames in a loud whirlwinds roar it shoots and lands him on the destined shore now fixed on earth his towering stature stood hung over the mountains and oerlookd the wood to brumptons grove one ample stride he took the valleys trembled and the forests shook the next huge step reached the devoted shade where choked in blood was wretched albion laid where now the vanquished with the victors joined beneath the regal banners stood combined the embatteld dwarfs with rage and scorn he past and on their town his eye vindictive cast its deep foundations his strong trident cleaves and high in air the uprooted empire heaves on his broad engine the vast ruin hung which on the foe with force divine he flung aghast the legions in the approaching shade the inverted spires and rocking domes surveyed that downward tumbling on the host below crushed the whole nation at one dreadful blow towers arms nymphs warriors are together lost and a whole empire falls to sooth sad albions ghost such was the period long restrained by fate and such the downfall of the fairy state this dale a pleasing region not unblest this dale possessed they and had still possessed had not their monarch with a fathers pride rent from her lord the inviolable bride rash to dissolve the contract sealed above the solemn vows and sacred bonds of love now where his elves so brightly danced the round no violet breathes nor daisy paints the ground his towers and people fill one common grave a shapeless ruin and a barren cave beneath huge hills of smoking piles he lay stunned and confounded a whole summers day at length awaked for what can long restrain unbodyd spirits but awaked in pain and as he saw the desolated wood and the dark den where once his empire stood grief chilled his heart to his halfopend eyes in every oak a neptune seemed to rise he fled and left with all his trembling peers the long possession of a thousand years through bush through brake through groves and gloomy dales through dank and dry over streams and flowery vales direct they fled but often looked behind and stopped and started at each russling wind winged with like fear his abdicated bands disperse and wander into different lands part did beneath the peaks deep caverns lie in silent glooms impervious to the sky part on fair avons margin seek repose whose stream over britains midmost region flows where formidable neptune never came and seas and oceans are but known by fame some to dark woods and secret shades retreat and some on mountains choose their airy seat there happily by the ruddy damsel seen or shepherdboy they featly foot the green while from their steps a circling verdure springs but fly from towns and dread the courts of kings meanwhile sad kenna loath to quit the grove hung over the body of her breathless love tried every art vain arts to change his doom and vowed vain vows to join him in the tomb what could she do the fates alike deny the dead to live or fairy forms to die an herb there grows the same old odyss l  0 homer tells ulysses bore to rival circes spells its root is ebonblack but sends to light a stem that bends with flowerets milky white moly the plant which gods and fairies know but secret kept from mortal men below on his pale limbs its virtuous juice she shed and murmured mystic numbers over the dead when lo the little shape by magic power grew less and less contracted to a flower a flower that first in this sweet garden smiled to virgins sacred and the snowdrop styled the newborn plant with sweet regret she viewed warmed with her sighs and with her tears bedewed its ripened seeds from bank to bank conveyed and with her lover whitened half the shade thus won from death each spring she sees him grow and glories in the vegetable snow which now increased through wide britannias plains its parents warmth and spotless name retains first leader of the flowery race aspires and foremost catches the suns genial fires midst frosts and snows triumphant dares appear mingles the seasons and leads on the year deserted now of all the pygmy race nor man nor fairy touched this guilty place in heaps on heaps for many a rolling age it lay accursed the mark of neptunes rage till great nassau recloathd the desert shade thence sacred to britannias monarchs made twas then the greenrobd nymph fair kenna came kenna that gave the neighboring town its name proud

by my eyes have trembled to complain the bashful squire touched by a wish unknown has dared to speak with spirit not his own fird by one wish all did alike adore now beautys fled and lovers are no more as round the room i turn my weeping eyes new unaffected scenes of sorrow rise far from my sight that killing picture bear the face disfigure and the canvas tear that picture which with pride i used to show the lost resemblance but upbraids me now and thou my toilette where i often have sat while hours unheeded passed in deep debate how curls should fall or where a patch to place if blue or scarlet best became my face now on some happier nymph your aid bestow on fairer heads ye useless jewels glow no borrowed luster can my charms restore beauty is fled and dress is now no more ye meaner beauties i permit ye shine go triumph in the hearts that once were mine but midst your triumphs with confusion know tis to my ruin all your arms ye owe woud pitying heaven restore my wonted mien ye

cruel chemists what withheld your aid could no pomatums save a trembling maid how false and trifling is that art ye boast no art can give me back my beauty lost in tears surrounded by my friends i lay maskd over and trembled at the sight of day mirmillio came my fortune to deplore a goldenheaded cane well carved he bore cordials he cried my spirits must restore beauty is fled and spirit is no more galen the grave officious squirt was there with fruitless grief and unavailing care machaon too the great machaon known by his red cloak and his superior frown and why he cried this grief and this

world adieu monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway all strive to serve and glory to obey alike unpitied when deposed they grow  men mock the idol of their former vow adieu ye parks  in some obscure recess where gentle streams will weep at my distress where no false friend will in my grief take part and mourn my ruin with a joyful heart there let me live in some deserted place there hide in shades this lost inglorious face plays operas circles i no more must view my toilette patches all the world adieu the lover a ballad to mr c  by the same i at length by much importunity pressed take c  at once the inside of my breast this stupid indiffrence so often you blame is not owing to nature to fear or to shame i am not as cold as a virgin in lead nor is sundays sermon so strong in my head i know but too well how time flies along that we live but few years and yet fewer are young ii but i hate to be cheated and never will buy long years of repentance for moments of joy oh was there a man but where shall i find good sense and goodnature so equally joined would value his pleasure contribute to mine not meanly would boast nor lewdly design not over severe yet not stupidly vain for i would have the power though not give the pain iii no pedant yet learned nor rakehelly gay or laughing because he has nothing to say to all my whole sex obliging and free yet never be fond of any but me in public preserve the decorum that is just and show in his eyes he is true to his trust then rarely approach and respectfully bow but not fulsomely pert nor fopishly low iv but when the long hours of public are past and we meet with champagne and a chicken at last may every fond pleasure that moment endear be banished afar both discretion and fear forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd he may cease to be formal and i to be proud till lost in the joy we confess that we live and he may be rude and yet i may forgive v and that my delight may be solidly fixed let the friend and the lover be handsomely mixed in whose tender bosom my soul may confide whose kindness can sooth me whose counsel can guide from such a dear lover as here i describe no danger should fright me no millions should bribe but till this astonishing creature i know as i long have lived chaste i will keep myself so vi i never will share with the wanton coquet or be caught by a vain affectation of wit the toasters and songsters may try all their art but never shall enter the pass of my heart i loath the lewd rake the dressed fopling despise before such pursuers the nice virgin flies and as ovid has

every womans aim with courtship pleased of silly toasters proud found of a train and happy in a crowd on each poor fool bestowing some kind glance each conquest owing to some loose advance while vain coquets affect to be pursued and think they are virtuous if not grossly lewd let this great maxim be my virtues guide in part she is to blame that has been tried  he comes too near that comes to be denied the gentlemans answer whilst pretty fellows think a womans fame in every state and every age the same with their own folly pleased the fair they toast and where they least are happy swear they are most no difference making twixt coquet and prude and her that seems yet is not really lewd while thus they think and thus they vainly live and taste no joys but what their fancy give let this great maxim be my actions guide may i never hope though i am never denied nor think a woman won that is willing to be tried an epistle to lord b  by the same how happy you who varied joys pursue and every hour presents you something new plans schemes and models all palladios art for six long months have gained upon your heart of colonades of corridores you talk the winding staircase and the covered walk you blend the orders with vitruvian toil and raise with wondrous joy the fancied pile but the dull workmans slow performing hand but coldly executes his lords command with dirt and mortar soon you grow displeased planting succeeds and avenues are raised canals are cut and mountains level made bowers of retreat and galleries of shade the shaven turf presents a lively green the bordering flowers in mystic knots are seen with studied art on nature you refine  the spring beheld you warm in this design but scarce the cold attacks your favorite trees your inclination fails and wishes freeze you quit the grove so lately you admired with other views your eager hopes are fired post to the city you direct your way not blooming paradise could bribe your stay ambition shows your powers brightest side it is meanly poor in solitude to hide though certain pains attend the cares of state a good man owes his country to be great should act abroad the high distinguished part or show at least the purpose of his heart with thoughts like these the shining courts you seek full of new projects for almost a week you then despise the tinsel glittering snare think vile mankind below a serious care life is too short for any distant aim and cold the dull reward of future fame be happy then while yet you have to live and love is all the blessing heaven can give fired by new passion you address the fair survey the opera as a gay parterre young cloes bloom had made you certain prize but for a sidelong glance from celias eyes your beating heart acknowledges her power your eager eyes her lovely form devour you feel the poison swelling in your breast and all your soul by fond desire possessed in dying sighs a long three hours are past to some assembly with impatient haste with trembling hope and doubtful fear you move resolved to tempt your fate and own your love but there belinda meets you on the stairs easy her shape attracting all her airs a smile she gives and with a smile can wound her melting voice has music in the sound her every motion wears resistless grace wit in her mien and pleasure in her face here while you vow eternity of love cloe and celia unregarded move thus on the sands of africs burning plains however deeply made no long impress remains the lightest leaf can leave its figure there the strongest form is scattered by the air so yielding the warm temper of your mind so touched by every eye so tossed by wind oh how unlike the heaven my soul designed unseen unheard the throng around me move not wishing praise insensible of love no whispers soften nor no beauties fire careless i see the dance and coldly hear the lyre so numerous herds are driven over the rock no print is left of all the passing flock so sings the wind around the solid stone so vainly beat the waves with fruitless moan tedious the toil and great the workmans care who dare attempt to fix impressions there but should some swain more skilful than the rest engrave his

reforming schemes are none of mine to mend the worlds a vast design like theirs who tug in little boat to pull to them the ship afloat while to defeat their labored end at once both wind and stream contend success herein is seldom seen and zeal when baffled turns to spleen happy the man who innocent grieves not at ills he cannot prevent his skiff does with the current glide not puffing pulled

of art and skill to search the mine on pindus hill proud to aspire and workmen grow by genius doomed to stay below for their own digging show the town wits treasure brought by others down some wanting if they find a mine an artists judgment to refine on fame precipitately fixed the ore with baser metals mixed melt down impatient of delay and call the vicious mass a play all these engage to serve

found helpless and ready to be drowned they have preserved by kind support and brought the babymuse to court but there is a youth that you can name who needs no leading strings to fame whose quick maturity of brain the birth of pallas may explain dreaming of whose depending fate i heard melpomene debate this this is he that was foretold should emulate our greeks of old inspired by me with sacred art he sings and rules the varied heart if joves dread anger he rehearse we hear the thunder in his verse if he describes love turned to rage the furies riot in his page if he fair liberty and law by ruffian power expiring draw the keener passions then engage aright and sanctify their rage if he attempt disastrous love we hear those plaints that wound the grove within the kinder passions glow and tears distilled from pity flow from the bright vision i descend and my deserted theme attend me never did ambition seize strange fever most inflamed by ease the active lunacy of pride that courts jilt fortune for a bride this pardisetree so fair and high i view with no aspiring eye like aspine shake the restless leaves and sodomfruit our pains deceives whence frequent falls give no surprise but fits of spleen called growing wise greatness in glittering forms displayed affects weak eyes much used to shade and by its falslyenvyd scene gives selfdebasing fits of spleen we should be pleased that things are so who do for nothing see the show and middlesizd can pass between lifes hubbub safe because unseen and midst the glare of greatness trace a watery sunshine in the face and pleasures fled to to redress the sad fatigue of idleness contentment parent of delight so much a stranger to our sight say goddess in what happy place mortals behold thy blooming face thy gracious auspices impart and for thy temple choose my heart they whom thou deignest to inspire thy science learn to bound desire by happy alchymy of mind they turn to pleasure all they find they both disdain an outward mien the grave and solemn garb of spleen and meretricious arts of dress to feign a joy and hide distress unmoved when the rude tempest blows without an opiate they repose and covered by your shield defy the whizzing shafts that round them fly nor meddling with the gods affairs concern themselves with distant cares but place their bliss in mental rest and feast upon the good possessed forced by soft violence of prayer the blythsome goddess sooths my care i feel the deity inspire and thus she models my desire two hundred pounds halfyearly paid annuity securely made a farm some twenty miles from town small tight salubrious and my own two maids that never saw the town a servingman not quite a clown a boy to help to tread the mow and drive while the other holds the plough a

heaven it is all i wish for send one genial room to treat a friend where decent cupboard little plate display benevolence not state and may my humble dwelling stand upon some chosen spot of land a pond before full to the brim where cows may cool and geese may swim behind a green like velvet neat soft to the eye and to the feet where odorous plants in evening fair breathe all around ambrosial air from eurus foe to kitchenground fenced by a slope with bushes crowned fit dwelling for the feathered throng who pay their quitrents with a song with opening views of hill and dale which sense and fancy too regale where the halfcirque which vision bounds like amphitheatre surrounds and woods impervious to the breeze thick phalanx of embodied trees from hills through plains in dusk array extended far repel the day here stillness height and solemn shade invite and contemplation aid here nymphs from hollow oaks relate the dark decrees and will of fate and dreams beneath the spreading beech inspire and docile fancy teach while soft as breezy breath of wind impulses rustle through the mind here dryads scorning phoebus ray while pan melodious pipes away in measured motions frisk about till old silenus puts them out there see the clover pea and bean vie in variety of green fresh pastures speckled over with sheep brown fields their fallow sabbaths keep plump ceres golden tresses wear and poppytopknots deck her hair and silverstreams through meadows stray and naiads on the margin play and lesser nymphs on side of hills from plaything urns pour down the rills thus sheltered free from care and strife may i enjoy a calm through life see faction safe in low degree as men at land see storms at sea and laugh at miserable elves not kind so much as to themselves

slides into dreams as when asleep then fond of new discoveries grown proves a columbus of her own disdains the narrow bounds of place and through the wilds of endless space borne up on metaphysick wings chases light forms and shadowy things and in the vague excursion caught brings home some rare exotic thought the melancholy man such dreams as brightest evidence esteems fain would he see some distant scene suggested by his restless spleen and fancys telescope applies with tinctured glass to cheat his eyes such thoughts as love the gloom of night i close examine by the light for who though bribed by gain to lie dare sunbeamwritten truths deny and execute plain common sense on faiths mere hearsay evidence that superstition may not create and club its ill with those of fate i many a notion take to task made dreadful by its visormask thus scruple spasm of the mind is cured and certainty i find since optic reason shows me plain i dreaded specter of the brain and legendary fears are gone though in tenacious childhood sown thus in opinions i commence freeholder in the proper sense and neither suit nor service do nor homage to pretenders show who boast themselves by spurious roll

extreme who soon lays by the unequal theme nor runs with wisdoms sirens caught on quicksands swallwing shipwrecked thought but conscious of his distance gives mute praise and humble negatives in one no object of our sight immutable and infinite who cannot be cruel or unjust calm and resigned i fix my trust to him my past and present state i owe and must my future fate a stranger into life i am come dying may be our going home transported here by angry fate the convicts of a prior state hence i no anxious thoughts bestow on matters i can never know through lifes foul way like vagrant passed he will grant a settlement at last and with sweet ease the wearied crown by leave to lay his being down if doomed to dance the eternal round of life no sooner lost but found and dissolution soon to come like sponge wipes out lifes present sum but cannot our state of power bereave an endless series to receive then if hard dealt with here by fate we balance in another state and consciousness must go along and sign the acquittance for the wrong he for his creatures must decree more happiness than misery or be supposed to create curious to try what it is to hate and do an act which rage infers cause lameness halts or blindness errs thus thus i steer my bark and sail on even keel with gentle gale at helm i make my reason sit my crew of passions all submit if dark and blustering prove some nights philosophy puts forth her lights experience holds the cautious glass to shun the breakers as i pass and frequent throws the wary lead to see what dangers may be hid and once in seven years i am

ruin barred the realms of peace yet uncondemnd to baleful seats of woe doubtful and suppliant all the plumes of light moult from their shuddering wings and sickly fear shades every face with horror conscious guilt rolls in the livid eyeball and each breast shakes with the dread of future doom unknown it is here the wide circumference of heaven opens in two vast gates that inward turn voluminous on jasper columns hung by geometry divine they ever glow with living sculptures that arise by turns to imboss the shining leaves by turns they set to give succeeding argument their place in holy hieroglyphics on they move the gaze of journeying angels as they pass often looking back and held in deep surprise here stood the troops distinct the cherub guard unbarrd the splendid gates and in they roll harmonious for a vocal spirit sits within each hinge and as they onward drive in just divisions breaks the numerous jarr with symphony melodious such as spheres involved in tenfold wreaths are said to sound out flows a blaze of glory for on high towering advanced the moving throne of god vast and majestic on each radiant side the pointed rays slope glittering at the foot glides a full tide of day that onward pours in liquid torrents through the black abyss sparkling among reluctant shapes which thence retire confused as when vesuvio shakes with inward torments and disgorges flames over the vast mountains ridge the burning waves drive their refulgent curls and on they roll sweeping the glowing plains down to the sea the affrighted sea leaps back with hideous roar to give the fire its course thus chaos wild hissing recoils to let in floods of light above the throne the ideas heavenly bright of past of present and of coming time fixed their immovd abode and there present an endless landscape of created things to sight celestial where angelick eyes are lost in prospect for the shiny range boundless and various in its bosom bears millions of fullproportiond worlds beheld with steadfast eyes till more arise to view and farther inward scenes start up unknown myriads of seraphs in long series wait about the throne and as it moves proceed in numerous order to celestial song above the symphony of mellow flutes and harps by flying angels gently touched relieve the trumpets rage and fitly blend the solemn sounds in harmony divine such as might tune new worlds and give the laws to globes on high and the just figure guide of planets forming all their airy dance below the blazing wheels drive bounding over the starry pavement stars and hills of light double their glories where the chariot rolls with rattling sound and the empyraeum vast down to its steadfast axis groans throughout under the burning tracts till now it rests upon the gaping brink of heaven and there with open pomp fills the vast empty space silence ensues a deep and aweful pause more terrible all expectation held in horror now wrath imminent amazed with dreadful precipice to all it seems more formidable near then from the throne a vocal thunder rolled the sense of god majestically long repugnant all to princes customs here their judgments flash on guilt with words concise and sudden blaze quite otherwise the gods enlarged speech set wide the fate of things that all around might take full prospects of their coming doom servants of god and virtues great in arms we approve your faithful works and you return blessed from the dire pursuit of rebel foes resolved obdurate they have tried the force of this right hand and known almighty power transfixed with lightning down they sunk they fell into the fiery gulf and deep they plunge below the burning waves to hide their heads in shelter from my vengeance bellowing hence more fierce and scorching with more dreadful fires there let em find their doom that durst defy omnipotence and slight his proferrd grace rolling in flames and never to find a dawn of heavenly day instead the mind imbibes eternal gloom and fingd with constant flames can find no ease while fierce their boiling rage eats through the impyreal mould and glows within with endless pain not one repentant thought shall cool the breast but proud in horrid crime the soul anneals and hardens in the fire but you commissioned by commands divine have wisely filled your trust and closed em all within the fervid lake lest any roam into the dark abyss to shun their doom and in the womb immense of things unborn should seek annihilation you must rise among the shining virtues more sublime on lofty thrones preferred for lofty deeds for you ye guilty throng that lately joined in this sedition since seduced from good and caught in trains of guile by spirits malign superior in their order you accept trembling my heavenly clemency and grace when the long era once has filled its orb you shall emerge to light and humbly here again shall bow before his favoring throne if your own virtue second my decree but all must have their manes first below so stands the eternal fate but smoother yours than what lost angels feel nor can our reign without just dooms the peace of heaven secure for forms celestial new erect in glory would totter dazzled with the heights of power did not the nerves of justice fix their sight see where below in chaos wondrous deep a speck of light dawns forth and thence throughout the shades in many a wreath my forming power there swiftly turns the burning eddy round absorbing all crude matter near its brink which next with subtle motions takes the form i please to stamp the seed of infant worlds all now in embryo but ere long shall rise variously scattered in this vast expanse involved in winding orbs until the brims of outward circles brush the heavenly gates the middle point a globe of curling fire shall hold which round it sheds its genial heat wherever i kindle life the motion grows in all the endless orbs from this machine and infinite vicissitudes shall roll about the restless center for i rear in those meanders turned a dusty ball deformed all over with woods whose shaggy tops enclose eternal mists and deadly damps hover within their boughs to choke the light impervious scenes of horror till reformed to fields and grassy dales and flowery meads by your continual pains the torrid zone here fries with constant heat the swarthy world parching the plains where hideous monsters glare and dusty mountains tumbled by the winds stretch their uncertain heaps no less the frost at either end shall rage and high shall raise firm promontories vast the ruins seem of desert nature and the eternal piles load all the dreary coast and thick in ice arm either pole that yearly peeps askance on coming light but feels no gentle ray unbind the frozen chain between these lie the changeful climes alternately they burn and chill again by turns for both extremes make their incursions here and this my will unchangeable ordains your doleful seat beneath misshapen chaos and the field of fighting atoms where hot moist and dry wage an eternal war with dismal roar the dismal roar breaks smoothly on the ground sacred to horror and eternal night here silence sits whose visionary shape in folds of wreathy mantling sinks obscure and in dark fumes reclines his drowsy head an urn he holds from whence a lake proceeds wide flowing gently smooth and lethe named hither compelled each soul must drink long draughts of those forgetful streams till forms within and all the great ideas fade and die for if vast thought should play about a mind enclosed in flesh and dragging cumbrous life fluttering and beating in the mournful cage it soon would break its grates and wing away it is therefore my decree the soul return naked from off this beach and perfect blank to visit the new world and strait to feel itself in crude consistence closely shut the dreadful monument of just revenge immured by heavens own hand and placed erect on fleeting matter all imprisoned round with walls of clay the aetherial mould shall bear the chain of members deafend with an ear blinded by eyes and manacled in hands here anger vast ambition and disdain and all the haughty movements rise and fall as storms of neighboring atoms tear the soul and hope and love and all the calmer turns of easy hours in their gay gilded shapes with sudden run skim over deluded minds as matter leads the dance but one desire unsatisfied shall mar ten thousand joys the rank of beings that shall first advance drink deep of human life and long shall stay on this great scene of cares from all the rest that longer for the destined body wait less penance i expect and short abode in those pale dreary kingdoms will content each has his lamentable lot and all on different racks abide the pains of life the pensive spirit takes the lonely grove nightly he visits all the sylvan scenes where far remote a melancholy moon raising her head serene and shorn of beams throws here and there the glimmerings through the trees to make more aweful darkness starry lights hung up on high shed round em as they burn a pale sad influence and they gild the plains with doubtful rays which strike within the shades a trembling luster and uncertain light the sage shall haunt this solitary ground and view the dismal landscape limnd within in horrid shades mixed with imperfect light here judgmegt blinded by delusive sense contracted through the cranny of an eye shoots up faint languid beams to that dark seat wherein the soul bereaved of native fire sits intricate in misty clouds obscured even from itself concealed and there presides over jarring images with reasons sway which by his ordering more confounds their form and by decisions more embroils the fray the more he strives to appease the more he feels the struggling surges of the darksome void impetuous and the thick revolving thoughts encountring thoughts image on image turned a chaos of wild science where sometimes the clashing notions strike out casual light which soon must perish and be lost again in the thick darkness round it now he tries with all his might to raise some weighty thought of me of fate or of the eternal round which but recoils to crush the laboring mind high are his reasonings but the feeble clue of fleeting images he draws in vain to wondrous length for still the turning maze eludes his art its end flies far away and leaves him tracing round the toilsome path returning often on the same beaten thought for much of good he talks and life serene of happiness denied the dismal waste of wisdoms privilege and the obdurate breast stubborn in anguish idle wisdom all weak sorcery to charm a real pain distasting crowds and business thus he seeks diversion in himself but with deep thoughts he kindles doubt and while he strives to blow the ashes off revives the brand of care hence far removed a different noisy race in cities full and frequent take their seat where honors crushed and gratitude oppressed with swelling hopes of gain that raise within a tempest and driven onward by success can find no bounds for creatures of a day stretch their wide cares to ages full increase starves the penurious soul while empty sound fills the ambitious that shall ever shrink pining with endless cares whilst this shall swell to tympany enormous bright in arms here shines the hero out he fiercely leads a martial throng his instruments of rage to fill the world with death and thin mankind ambition drives and round the world he roams marking his way with blood the dreadful noise begets a fame and all the breath he leaves is spent in his false praise and vainly bloats the tyrants soul while high his kingdoms rise in fleeting pomp hovering over their gaudy wings around the servile globe that tamely bends beneath his haughty reign and all his slaves under his yoke shall groan and scarce shall groan without a crime here torturing engines roar with human voice disguised earth water fire are made dire elements of cruelty subservient to his lust and power to kill yet shall the herd endure nor dare to break united their imaginary chain while their great monarch chills with equal fears no less a slave than they each rumor shakes the haughty purple dark and cloudy cares involve the aweful throne that stands erect balanced on the wild peoples tempered rage and fortified with dangerous arts of power but death shall shift those scenes of misery then doubtful titles kindle up new wars and urge on lingering fate the ensigns blaze about the camp and drums and trumpets sound prepare a solemn way to griezly war javelins and bearded spears in ghastly ranks erect their shining heads and round the field a harvests scene of formidable death then joins the horrid shock whose bellowing burst torments the shattered air and drowns the groans of men below that roll in certain death these are the mortal sports the tragic plays by man himself embroiled the dire debate make the waste desert seem serene and mild where savage nature in one common lies by homely cots possessed all squalid wild and despicably poor they range the field and feel their share of hunger care and pain cheated by flying prey and now they tear their panting flesh and now with nails unclean they tug their shaggy beards and deeply quaff of human woe even when they rudely sip the flowing stream or chew the savory pulp of natures freshest viands fragrant fruits enjoyed with trembling and in danger sought but where the appointed limits of a law fences the general safety of the world no greater quiet reigns for wanton man in giddy frolic easily leaps over his own invented bounds hence rapine fraud revenge and lust and all the hideous train of nameless ills distort the meagre mind to endless shapes of woe here misers mourn departed gold and their defrauded heirs dire perjuries complain the blended loads of punishment and crime deform the world and give no rest to man with pangs and throes he enters on the stage prophetic tears and infant cries prelude his future woes and all is one continued scene of grief till the fad sable curtain falls in death but that last act shall in one moment close of doubt and darkness pain shall crack the strings of life decayed no less the soul convulsed trembles in anxious cares and shuddering stands afraid to leap into the opening gulf of future fate till all the banks of clay fall from beneath his feet in vain he grasps the shattered reeds that cheat his easy wish reason is now no more that narrow lamp which with its sickly fires would shoot its beams to distances unknown and stretch its rays askance my paths in deepest darkness veiled is sunk into his socket inly there it burns a dismal light the expiring flame is choked in fumes and parts in various doubt then the gay glories of the living world shall cast their empty varnish and retire out of his feeble view and rising shade sit hovering over all natures various face music shall cease and instruments of joy shall fail that sullen hour nor can the mind attend their sounds when fancies swim in death confused and crushed with cares for long shall seem the dreary road and melancholy dark that leads he knows not where here empty space gapes horrible and threatens to absorb all being yonder sooty demons glare and dolorous specter grin the shapeless rout of wild imagination dance and play before his eyes obscure till all in death shall vanish and the prisoner now enlarged regains the flaming borders of the sky he ended peals of thunder rend the heavens and chaos from the bottom turned resounds the mighty clangor all the heavenly host approve the high decree and loud they sing eternal justice while the guilty troops sad with their doom but sad without despair fall fluttering down to lethes lake and there for penance and the destined body wait chiron to achilles a poem by hildebrand jacob esquire res est severa voluptas old chiron to his pupil thus began when he beheld him ripening into man accomplished youth well worthy of my pains you now are free and guide yourself the reins yet hear achilles hear before we part a few short precepts from a faithful heart what though the gods a nestors age deny let management a longer life supply and learn at least to live before you die a little tract well tilled more profit yields than realms of wild uncultivated fields it is not from length of years our pleasures flow nor to the gods alone our bliss we owe our happiness and pain depend on us mans his own good or evil genius great ills by art we lighten or remove and art our meanest pleasures may improve much to ourselves is due though much to jove think not young prince your elevated state birth honors or the empty name of great can fix your joys they are ill secured unless you know yourself to form your happiness which in the shepherds humble hut is found while palaces with discord still resound fortune to industry is ever kind and though by the blind vulgar painted blind is still more equal than the crowd suppose who judge of happiness by outward shows she smiles on all conditions each may be a man of pleasure in his own degree yet few with art their happiness pursue though all mankind have happiness in view and every sense seems made by natures skill for giving pleasure and avoiding ill nature our common mother has been kind and for a race of joy her sons designed who long to reach the goal yet lazy lag behind or wholly blind or doubtful how to advance they leave the work of industry to chance and of those few who with more active strife pursue this great important end of life some too impatient know not how to wait or aim at things beyond their human state these last through too much delicacy fall and by refining rob themselves of all shun then achilles shun the faults of such who still propose too little or too much stretch not your hopes too far nor yet despair but above all of indolence beware attend to what you do or life will seem but a mere vision or fantastic dream passed in ideas of delight at best while real pleasures lost in doubtful rest in short learn when and how to bear in vain he pleasure seeks who is afraid of pain pleasures a serious thing and cheaply bought by labor patience management and thought but you aspiring youth by nature seem addicted to an opposite extreme impetuous and restless soon inflamed and like a generous courser hardly tamed in all things violent but o disdain brave prince to let usurping passion reign in one rash moment sacrificing more than years of sad repentance may restore as thracian winds the euxine sea molest so wrath and envy from an human breast drive halcyon peace and banish kindly rest and no security for joy is found but in a mind that is tractable and sound suppress the first emotions of your ire and smother in its birth the kindling fire ere anger yet possesses all your soul ere yet your bosom heaves and eyeballs roll think on the useful precepts i have taught and meet the rising heat with wholesome thought or seek the sacred muses with your lyre who with sweet peace to lonely shades retire gods and the sons of gods the heroes sing while hills and valleys with their praises ring these learn to imitate and those adore and sweetly to yourself yourself restore music and verse and solitude control impetuous fury and compose the soul for this i early taught you how to sing and formed your fingers to the trembling string for it is not all sweet pleasures path to show the art of consolation man should know our joys are short and broken and in vain to constant bliss would human race attain be often contented to be free from pain there is a deity ordained by fate to damp our joys immoderately great that none on earth from sorrow should be free but even our blessings taste of misery if fortune gives what rarely we obtain an equal share of pleasure and of pain our portion is oerpaid the rest you will find but fond ideas of the wanton mind which now vain scenes of godlike pleasure shows and now creates imaginary woes when sad your ills examine and compare judge of your own by what anothers are consider greater wretches and the fates of mighty heroes and of mighty states thus real evils in their proper light appear the false thus vanish out of sight nor aim at pleasures difficult to gain choose rather what you may with ease obtain who scorns to trifle is by pride abused i pity him who never can be amused but slighting pleasures moderate and small must live in rapture or not live at all great pleasures still are near allied to pain who quits the peaceful shore and ploughs the main big waves and mighty tempests must sustain let not such fond ambition to be blessed the humbler pleasures in your power molest yet cherish hope for without hope there is none taste hope but be not fed with that alone some their whole lives in expectation spend as life were not begun or never would end fondly from day to day themselves deceive not living but intending still to live while they neglect the joys they might possess for empty dreams of future happiness let nature in your pleasures be your guide nor suffer art her genuine charms to hide her beauties with unwearied eyes we see the truth of beauty is simplicity live not by imitation servile state nor on the fashion for your pleasures wait man otherwise so selfish or so proud submits his taste to the fantastic crowd and lives not for himself do you pursue your own desires and to yourself be true as bees extract their sweets from every flower so you your joys from all things in your power with industry and management produce the meanest trifles are sometimes of use yet know well what you do and when it is done nor at all hours to every pleasure run but mix with art your pleasures and your toils for pleasures have their seasons and their soils thus when the earliest dawn of eastern light proclaims the finished empire of the night haste to the field achilles nor disdain to chase the foaming monster over the plain or teach the untamed steed to feel the rein or let your car and arms your nerves prepare or for olympic games or future war then whether arts or glory fire your mind will thoughts more generous rise or more refined aurora to the muses still is kind at noon a simple short repast be made a shorter slumber in the cooling shade what is gay and light the unbended mind employs or sports or past delights or future joys but when the evningstar begins to rise when phoebus fainting steeds forsake the skies still cheerful at the wellspread board be found amidst bright friends and with fresh garlands crowned while wine and thais with her voice and lyre banish old sorrows and new joys inspire thus when from toils of empire you are free nor camp nor council claim your liberty the morn to labor and the muses give at noon with temperance and quiet live ceres and bacchus gifts at evening prove divide the night with somnus and with love thus thus pelides drive your cares away nor fear the evil till the evil day what though on simois or scamanders shore far off from home the greeks your death deplore no matter where or when it once must be and nothing can revoke the firm decree though thetis son though third from mighty jove eternal monarch of the realms above nor jove nor thetis can your days recall or for an hour defer you destined fall mean while a looser rein to pleasure give time flies in haste be you in haste to live seize on the precious minutes as they fleet your life however short will be complete if at the fatal moment you can say i have lived and made the most of every day one precept more i fain would recommend and then old chirons tedious lessons end learn generous prince what is little understood the godlike happiness of doing good how glorious to defend and to bestow from nobler springs can human pleasure flow a solid good which nothing can destroy the best prerogative the great enjoy for this remember monarchs first were made for this young prince be loved and be obeyed at once your self and mighty nations bless and make humanity your happiness but now aurora ushers in the day and fond expecting peleus chides your stay go then brave youth wherever the fates may call live with design and fearless wait thy fall whatever space of life the gods decree thy name is still immortal for i see more than another peleus rise in thee thy fame the homer prince of sacred bards shall fire thy deeds the by alexander who had homers iliad always with him proposing achilles for his example conquest of the world inspire  know your self by the late dr arbuthnot what am i how produced and for what end whence drew i being to what period tend am i the abandoned orphan of blind chance dropped by wild atoms in disordered dance or from an endless chain of causes wrought and of unthinking substance born with thought by motion which began without a cause supremely wise without design or laws am i but what i seem mere flesh and blood a branching channel with a mazy flood the purple stream that through my vessels glides dull and unconscious flows like common tides the pipes through which the circling juices stray are not that thinking i no more than they this frame compacted with transcendent skill of moving joints obedient to my will nursed from the fruitful glebe like yonder tree waxes and wastes i call it mine not me new matter still the mouldering mass sustains the mansion changed the tenant still remains and from the fleeting stream repaired by food distinct as is the swimmer from the flood what am i then sure of a nobler birth by parents right i own as mother earth but claim superior lineage by my sire who warmed the unthinking clod with heavenly fire essence divine with lifeless clay allayed by double nature double instinct swayed with look erect i dart my longing eye see winged to part and gain my native sky i strive to mount but strive alas in vain tied to this massy globe with magic chain now with swift thought i range from pole to pole view worlds around their flaming centers roll what steady powers their endless motions guide through the same trackless paths of boundless void i trace the blazing comets fiery trail and weigh the whirling planets in a scale these godlike thoughts while eager i pursue some glittering trifle offered to my view a gnat an insect of the meanest kind erase the newborn image from my mind some beastly want craving importunate vile as the grinning mastiff at my gate calls off from heavenly truth this reasoning me and tells me i am a brute as much as he if on sublimer wings of love and praise my soul above the starry vault i raise lured by some vain conceit or shameful lust i flag i drop and flutter in the dust the towering lark thus from her lofty strain stoops to an emmet or a barley grain by adverse gusts of jarring instincts tossed i rove to one now to the other coast to bliss unknown my lofty soul aspires my lot unequal to my vast desires as amongst the hinds a child of royal birth finds his high pedigree by conscious worth so man amongst his fellow brutes exposed sees he is a king but it is a king deposed pity him beasts you by no law confined are barred from devious paths by being blind whilst man through opening views of various ways confounded by the aid of knowledge strays too weak to choose yet choosing still in haste one moment gives the pleasure and distaste bilkd by past minutes while the present cloy the flattering future still must give the joy not happy but amused upon the road and like you thoughtless of his last abode whether next sun his being shall restrain to endless nothing happiness or pain around me lo the thinking thoughtless crew bewildered each their different paths pursue of them i ask the way the first replies thou art a god and sends me to the skies down on the turf the next thou twoleggd beast there fix thy lot thy bliss and endless rest between these wide extremes the length is such i find i know too little or too much almighty power by whose most wise command helpless forlorn uncertain here i stand take this faint glimmering of thyself away or break into my soul with perfect day this said expanded lay the sacred text the balm the light the guide of souls perplexed thus the benighted traveller that strays through doubtful paths enjoys the morning rays the nightly mist and thick descending dew parting unfold the fields and vaulted blue o truth divine enlightened by thy ray i grope and guess no more but see my way thou cleardst the secret of my high descent and told me what those mystic tokens meant marks of my birth which i had worn in vain too hard for worldly sages to explain zenos were vain vain epicurus schemes their systems false delusive were their dreams unskilled my twofold nature to divide one nursed my pleasure and one nursed my pride those jarring truths which human art beguile thy sacred page thus bids me reconcile offspring of god no less thy pedigree what thou once were art now and still may be thy god alone can tell alone decree faultless thou dropdst from his unerring skill with the bare power to sin since free of will yet charge not with thy guilt his bounteous love for who has power to walk has power to rove who acts by force impelled can naught deserve and wisdom short of infinite may swerve borne on thy new impd wings thou tookst thy flight left thy creator and the realms of light disdained his gentle precept to fulfill and thought to grow a god by doing ill though by foul guilt thy heavenly form defaced in nature changed from happy mansions chased thou still retainst some sparks of heavenly fire too faint to mount yet restless to aspire angel enough to seek thy bliss again and brute enough to make thy search in vain the creatures now withdraw their kindly use some fly thee some torment and some seduce repast ill suited to such different guests for what thy sense desires thy soul distastes thy lust thy curiosity thy pride curbed or deferred or balkd or gratified rage on and make thee equally unblessed in what thou want and what thou have possessed in vain thou hopst for bliss on this poor clod return and seek thy father and thy god yet think not to regain thy native sky borne on the wings of vain philosophy mysterious passage hid from human eyes soaring you

the general doom but left like egypts kings a lasting tomb the wits of charles found easier ways to fame norwishd for johnsons art or shakespeares flame themselves they studied as they felt they writ intrigue was plot obscenity was wit vice always found a sympathetick friend they pleased their age and did not aim to mend yet bards like these aspired to lasting praise and proudly hoped to pimp in future days their cause was general their supports were strong their slaves were willing and their reign was long till shame regained the post that sense betrayed and virtue called oblivion to her aid then crushed by rules and weakened as refined for years the power of tragedy declined from bard to bard the frigid caution crept till declamation roared while passion slept yet still did virtue deign the stage to tread philosophy remained though nature fled but forced at length her ancient reign to quit she saw great faustus lay the ghost of wit exulting folly hailed the joyful day and pantomime and song confirmed her sway but who the coming changes can presage and mark the future periods of the stage perhaps if skill could distant times explore new behns new durfeys yet remain in store

often i have the evening still at the fountain of a rill sat upon a flowery bed with my hand beneath my head while strayed my eyes over towys flood over mead and over wood from house to house from hill to hill till contemplation had her fill about his checkered sides i wind and leave his brooks and meads behind and groves and grottoes where i lay and vistoes shooting beams of day wide and wider spreads the vale as circles on a smooth canal the mountains round unhappy fate sooner or later all of height withdraw their summits from the skies and lessen as the others rise still the prospect wider spreads adds a thousand woods and meads still it widens widens still and sinks the newlyrisen hill now i gain the mountains brow what a landscape lies below no clouds no vapors intervene but the gay the open scene does the face of nature show in all the hues of heavens bow and swelling to embrace the light spreads around beneath the sight old castles on the cliffs arise proudly towering in the skies rushing from the woods the spires seem from hence ascending fires half his beams apollo sheds on the yellow mountainheads gilds the fleeces of the flocks and glitters on the broken rocks below me trees unnumberd rise beautiful in various dies the gloomy pine the poplar blue the yellow beech the sable yew the slender fir that taper grows the sturdy oak with broadspread boughs and beyond the purple grove haunt of phillis queen of love gaudy as the opening dawn lies a long and level lawn on which a dark hill steep and high holds and charms the wandering eye deep are his feet in towys flood his sides are clothed with waving wood and ancient towers crown his brow that cast an aweful look below whose ragged walls the ivy creeps and with her arms from falling keeps so both a safety from the wind on mutual dependence find it is now the ravens bleak abode it is now the apartment of the toad and there the fox securely feeds and there the poisonous adder breeds concealed in ruins moss and weeds while ever and anon there falls huge heaps of hoary moulderd walls yet time has seen that lifts the low and level lays the lofty brow has seen this broken pile complete big with the vanity of state but transient is the smile of fate a little rule a little sway a sun beam in a winters day is all the proud and mighty have between the cradle and the grave and see the rivers how they run through woods and meads in shade and sun sometimes swift sometimes slow wave succeeding wave they go a various journey to the deep like human life to endless sleep thus is natures vesture wrought to instruct our wandering thought thus she dresses green and gay to disperse our cares away ever charming ever new when will the landscape tire the view the fountains fall the rivers flow the woody valleys warm and low the windy summit wild and high roughly rushing on the sky the pleasant seat the ruined tower the naked rock the shady bower the town and village dome and farm each give each a double charm as pearls upon an aethiops arm see on the mountains southern side where the prospect opens wide where the evening gilds the tide how close and small the hedges lie what streaks of meadows cross the eye a step methinks may pass the stream so little distant dangers seem so we mistake the futures face eyed through hopes deluding glass as yon summits soft and fair clad in colors of the air which to those who journey near barren brown and rough appear still we tread the same coarse way the presents still a cloudy day o may i with myself agree and never covet what i see content me with an humble shade my passions tamed my wishes laid for while our wishes wildly roll we banish quiet from the soul it is thus the busy beat the air and misers gather wealth and care now even now my joys run high as on the mountainturf i lie while the wanton zephyr sings and in the vale perfumes his wings while the waters murmur deep while the shepherd charms his sheep while the birds unbounded fly and with music fill the sky now even now my joys run high be full ye courts be great who will search for peace with all your skill open wide the lofty door seek her on the marble floor in vain you search she is not there in vain ye search the domes of care grass and flowers quiet treads on the meads and mountainheads along with pleasure close allied ever by each others side and often by the

the bright talents of thy youthful state in turn shall on thy better lessons wait whence comes it that in every art we see many can rise to a supreme degree yet in this art for which all seem designed by nature scarcely one complete we find you will say perhaps we think we speak we move by the strong springs alone of selfish love yet among all the species is there one whom with more caution than ourselves we shun what is it fills a puppetshow or court go none but for the profit or the sport if so why comes each soul fatigued away and curses the dull puppets same dull play yet unconvincd is tempted still to go it is that we find at home our greatest foe and reason good why solitude we flee can wants with selfsufficiency agree yet such our inconsistency of mind we court society and hate mankind with some we quarrel for they are too sincere with others for they are close reserved and queer this is too learned too prudent or too wise and that we for his ignorance despise a voice

and check the torrent of each boiling vein yes she can still do more view passions slave with mind serene indulge him and yet save but selfconceit steps in and with strict eye scans every man and every man awry that reigning passion which through every stage of life still haunts us with unceasing rage no quality so mean but what can raise some drudging driveling candidate for praise even in

that pride has made it is not on man an useless burden laid pride has ennobled some and some disgraced it hurts not in itself but as it is placed when right its view knows none but virtues bound when wrong it scarcely looks one inch around mark with what care the fair ones critic eye scans over her dress nor let us a fault slip by each rebel hair must be reduced to place with tedious skill and tortured into grace betty must over and over the pins dispose till into modish folds the drapery flows and the whole frame is fitted to express the charms of decency and nakedness why all this art this labored ornament to captivate you will cry no doubt it is meant true but let us wait upon this fair machine from the lone closet to the social scene there view her loud affected scornful sour paining all others and herself still more what means she at one instant to disgrace the labor of ten hours her muchloved face why it is the selfsame passion gratified the work is ruined that was raised by pride yet of all tempers it requires least pain could we but rule ourselves to rule the vain the prudent is by reason only swayed with him each sentence and each word is weighed the gay and giddy can alone be caught by the quick luster of a happy thought the miser hates unless he steals your pelf the prodigal unless you rob yourself the lewd will shun you if your wife prove chaste the jealous if a smile on his be cast the steady or the whimsical will blame either because youre not or are the same the peevish sullen shrewd luxurious rash will with your virtue peace or interest clash but mark the proud mans price how very low it is but a civil speech a smile or bow ye who pushed on by noble ardour aim in social life to gain immortal fame observe the various passions of mankind general peculiar single or combined how youth from manhood differs in its views and how old age still other paths pursues how zeal in priscus nothing more than heats in codex burns and ruins all it meets how freedom now a lovely face shall wear now shock us in the likeness of a bear how jealousy in some resembles hate in others seems but love grown delicate how modesty is often pride refined and virtue but the canker of the mind how love of riches grandeur life and fame wear different shapes and yet are still the same but not our passions only disagree in taste is found as great variety sylvius is ravished when he hears a hound his lady hates to death the odious sound yet both love music though in different ways he in a kennel she at operas a florist shall perhaps not grudge some hours to view the colors in a bed of flowers yet show him titians workmanship divine he passes on and only cries it is fine a rusty coin an old wormeaten post the moldy fragment of an author lost a butterfly an equipage a star a globe a fine laced head a china jar a mistress or a fashion that is new have each their charms though felt but by a few then study each mans passion and his taste the first to soften and indulge the last not like the wretch who beats down virtues fence and deviates from the paths of common sense who daubs with fulsome flattery blind and bold the very weakness we with grief behold passions are common to the fool and wise and all would hide them under arts disguise for so avowed in others is their shame none hates them more than he who has the same but taste seems more peculiarly our own and every man is fond to make his known proud of a mark he fancies is designed by nature to advance him over his kind and where he sees that character impressed with joy he hugs the favorite to his breast but the main stress of all our cares must lie to watch ourselves with strict and constant eye to mark the working mind when passions course begins to swell and reason still has force or if she is conquered by the stronger tide observe the moments when they first subside for he who hopes a victory to win over other men must with himself begin else like a town by mutiny oppressed he is ruined by the foe within his breast and they alone who in themselves often view mans image know what method to pursue all other creatures keep in beaten ways man only moves in an eternal maze he lives and dies not tamed by cultivation the wretch of reason and the dupe of passion curious of knowing yet too proud to learn more prone to doubt than anxious to discern tired with old doctrines prejudiced at new mistaking still the pleasing for the true foe to restraints approved by general voice yet to each foolborn mode a slave by choice of rest impatient yet in love with ease when most goodnatured aiming how to teaze disdaining by the vulgar to be awed yet never pleased but when the fools applaud by turns severe indulgent humble vain a trifle serves to lose him or to gain then grant this trifle yet his vices shun not like to cato or to alcibiades clinias son this for each humor every shape could take even virtues own though not for virtues sake at athens rakish thoughtless full of fire severe at sparta as a chartreux friar in thrace a bully drunken rash and rude in asia gay effeminate and lewd while the rough roman virtues rigid friend could not to save the cause he died for bend in him twas scarce an honor to be good he more indulged a passion than subdued see how the skilful lover spreads his toils when eager in pursuit of beautys spoils behold him bending at his idols feet humble not mean disputing and yet sweet in rivalship not fierce nor yet unmoved without a rival studious to be loved for ever fearful though not always witty and never giving cause for hate or pity these are his arts such arts as must prevail when riches birth and beautys self will fail and what he does to gain a vulgar end shall we neglect to make mankind our friend good sense and learning may esteem obtain humor and wit a laugh if rightly taken fair virtue admiration may impart but it is goodnature only wins the heart it molds the body to an easy grace and brightens every feature of the face it smooths the unpolished tongue with eloquence and adds persuasion to the finest sense yet this like every disposition has fixed bounds over which it never ought to pass when stretched too far its honor dies away its merit sinks and all its charms decay among the good it meets with no applause and to its ruin the malicious draws a slave to all who force it or entice it falls by chance in virtue or in vice it is true in pity for the poor it bleeds it clothes the naked and the hungry feeds it cheers the stranger nay its foes defends but then as often it injures its best friends study with care politeness that must teach the modish forms of gesture and of speech in vain formality with matron mien and pertness apes her with familiar grin they against nature for applauses strain distort themselves and give all others pain she moves with easy though with measured pace and shows no part of study but the grace yet even by this man is but half refined unless philosophy subdues the mind it is but a varnish that is quickly tossed whenever the soul in passions sea is lost would you both please and be instructed too watch well the rage of shining to subdue hear every man upon his favorite theme and ever be more knowing than you seem the lowest genius will afford some light or give a hint that had escaped your sight doubt till he thinks you on conviction yield and with fit questions let each pause be filled and the most knowing will with pleasure grant youre rather much reserved than ignorant the rays of wit gild wheresoeer they strike but are not therefore fit for all alike they charm the lively but the grave offend and raise a foe as often as a friend like the resistless beams of blazing light that cheer the strong and pain the weakly sight if a bright fancy therefore be your share let judgment watch it with a guardians care it is like a torrent apt to overflow unless by constant government kept low and never inefficacious passes by but overturns or gladens all that is nigh or else like trees when suffered wild to shoot that put forth much but all unripend fruit it turns to affectation and grimace as like to wit as dullness is to grace how hard soever it be to bridle wit yet memory often no less requires the bit how many hurried by its force away for ever in the land of gossips stray usurp the province of the nurse to lull without her privilege for being dull tales upon tales they raise ten stories high without regard to use or symmetry so r  till his destined space is filled heaps bricks on bricks and fancies it is to build a story should to please at least seem true be a propos well told concise and new and whensoeer it deviates from these rules the wise will sleep and leave applause to fools but others more intolerable yet the waggeries that they have said or heard repeat heavy by memory made and what is the worst at secondhand as often as at first and can even patience hear without disdain the maiming register of sense once slain while the dull features big with archness strive in vain the forced halfsmile to keep alive some know no joy like what a word can raise hauld through a languages perplexing maze till on a mate that seems to agree they light like man and wise that still are opposite not lawyers at the bar play more with sense when brought to the last trope of eloquence than they on every subject great or small at clubs or councils at a church or ball then cry we rob them of their tributes due alas how can we laugh and pity too while others to extremes as wild will run and with four face anatomize a pun when the brisk glass to freedom does entice and rigid wisdom is a kind of vice but let not such grave fops your laughter spoil never frown where sense may innocently smile cramp not your language into logic rules to rostrums leave the pedantry of schools nor let your learning always be discerned but choose to seem judicious more than learned quote seldom and then let it be at least some fact that is proved or thought that is well expressed but lest disguised your eye it should escape know pedantry can put on every shape for when we deviate into terms of art unless constrained we act the pedants part or if we are ever in the selffame key no matter of what kind the subject be from laws of nations down to laws of dress for statesmen have their cant and belles no less as good hear b  y dictate on epistles or b  rm  n comment on the grecian whistles as old obesus preach upon his belly or philcunucha rant on farinelli flirtilla read a lecture on a fan or w  d set forth the praise of koulikan but above all things raillery decline nature but few does for that task design it is in the ablest hand a dangerous tool but never fails to wound the meddling fool for all must grant it needs no common art to keep men patient when we make them smart not wit alone nor humours self will do without goodnature and much prudence too to judge aright of persons place and time for taste decrees what is low and what is sublime and what might charm today or over a glass perhaps at court or next day would not pass then leave to low buffoons by custom bred and formed by nature to b kicked and fed the vulgar and unenvied task to hit all persons right or wrong with random wit our wise forefathers born in sober days resigned to fools the tart and witty phrase the motley coat gave warning for the jest excused the wound and sanctified the pest but we from high to low all strive to sneer will all be wits and not the livery wear of all the qualities that help to raise in men the universal voice of praise whether in pleasure or in use they end there is none that can with modesty contend it is a transparent veil that helps the sight and lets us look on merit with delight in others it is a kindly light that seems to gild the worst defects with borrowed beams yet it is but little that its form be caught unless its origin be first in thought else rebel nature will reveal the cheat and the whole work of art at once defeat hold forth upon yourself on no pretense unless invited or in selfdefence the praise you take although it be your due will be supected if it come from you for each man by experience taught can tell how strong a flatterer does within him dwell and if to selfcondemning you incline in sober sadness and without design for some will slyly arrogate a vice that from excess of virtue takes its rise the world cries out why does he hither come let him do penance for his sins at home no part of conduct asks for skill more nice though none more common than to give advice misers themselves in this will not be saving unless their knowledge makes it worth the having and where is the wonder when we will obtrude an useless gift it meets ingratitude shun then unasked this arduous task to try but if consulted use sincerity too sacred is the welfare of a friend to give it up for any selfish end but use one caution fifth him over and over to find if all be not resolved before if such the case in spite of all his art some word will give the soundings of his heart and why should you a bootless freedom use that serves him not and may his friendship lose yet still on truth bestow this mark of love never to commend the thing you cannot approve sincerity has such resistless charms she often the fiercest of our foes disarms no art she knows in native whiteness dressed her thoughts all pure and therefore all expressed she takes from error its deformity and without her all other virtues die bright source of goodness to my aid descend watch over my heart and all my words attend if still thou deign to set thy foot below among a race quite polished into show oh save me from the jilts dissembling part who grants to all all favors but her heart perverts the end of charming for the fame to fawn her business to deceive her aim she smiles on this man tips the wink on that gives one a squeeze another a kind pat now jogs a foot now whispers in an ear here slips a letter and there casts a leer till the kind thing the company throughout distributes all its pretty self about while all are pleased and wretched soon or late all but the wise who see and shun the bait yet if as complaisance requires to do and rigid virtue sometimes will allow you stretch the truth in favor of a friend be sure it ever aim at some good end to cherish growing virtue vice to shame and turn to noble views the love of fame and not like fawning parasites unawed by sense or truth be every passions bawd be rarely warm in censure or in praise few men deserve our passion either ways for half the world but floats twixt good and ill as chance disposes objects these the will it is but a seesaw game where virtue now mounts above vice and then sinks down as low besides the wise still hold it for a rule to trust that judgment most that seems most cool for all that rises to hyperbole proves that we err at least in the degree but if your temper to extremes should lead always upon the indulging side exceed for though to blame most lend a willing ear yet hatred ever will attend on fear and when a neighbors dwelling blazes out the world will think it is time to look about let not the curious from your bosom steal secrets where prudence ought to set her seal yet be so frank and plain that at one view in other things each man may see you through for if the mask of policy you wear the honest hate you and the cunning fear would you be well received wherever you go remember each man vanquished is a foe resist not therefore with your utmost might but let the weakest think he is sometimes right he for each triumph you shall thus decline shall give ten opportunities to shine he sees since once you owned him to excel that it is his interest you should reason well and though when roughly used he is full of choler as blustering b  y to a brother scholar yet by degrees inure him to submit he is tame and in his mouth receives the bit but chiefly against trifling contests guard it is here submission seems to man most hard nor imitate that resolute old fool ctesipho  who undertook to kick against his mule

that great lord of earth that heir of heaven savage at first inhabited the wood and scrambled with his fellowbrutes for food no social home he knew no friendships tie selfish in good in ill without ally till some in length of time of stronger nerve and greater cunning forced the rest to serve one common purpose and in natures spite brought the whole jarring species to unite but might we not with equal reason say that every single particle of clay which forms our body was at first designed to lie for ever from the rest disjoined can this be said and can it be allowed twas with its powers for no one end endowed if so we own that man at first by art was soothed to act in social life a part it is true in some the seeds of discord seem to contradict this alluniting scheme but that no more

care and only miss the end can scripture teach us or can sense persuade that man for such employments ever was made far be that thought but let us now relate a character as opposite as great in him who living gave to athens fame and by his death immortalized her shame great scourge of sophists he from heaven brought down and placed true wisdom on the usurpers throne philosopher in all things but

idiots that view him with sophists famed for fierce contest or crowned with roses at the jovial feast insulted by a peevish noisy wife or at the bar foredoomd to lose his life what moving words flow

false merit by the true we see when reason stagnates in the brain the dregs of fancy cloud its purest vein but circulation betwixt mind and mind extends its course and renders it refined when warm with youth we tread the flowery way all nature charms and every scene looks gay each object gratifies each sense in turn whilst now for rattles now for nymphs we burn enslaved by friendships or by loves soft smile we never suspect because we mean no guile till flushed with hope from views of past success we lay on some main trifle all our stress when lo the mistress or the friend betrays and the whole fancied cheat of life displays stunned with an ill that from ourselves arose for instinct ruled when reason should have chose we fly for comfort to some lonely scene victims henceforth of dirt and drink and spleen but let no obstacles that cross our views pervert our talents from their destined use for as upon lifes hill we upwards press our views will be obstructed less and less be
