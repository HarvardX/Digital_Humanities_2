rose and colin a comic opera in one act as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  london printed for g kearsly no    fleet street m dcc lxxviii  advertisement the following little piece is an imitation of the french comic operas of one act which are generally characterized either by their natural simplicity or some single striking incident and little or nothing more is designed  it is now first attempted to introduce this species of entertainment on the english theater as containing excellent situations for light airs  on the french stage notwithstanding all their merit they tire in the length of time taken for representation and were they spun out to the common length of our afterpieces it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient  the subject matter therefore being wholly preserved and the dialogue both varied and compressed they are with every deference submitted to public judgment  c dibdin  characters men gregory mr reinhold higgins mr fearon

daughter instead of the son and a young impudent dog had come when thou wast in the field or at market or in the barn    hig what telling a soft tale in her ear i warrant you  why i would tell him says i calling him by his name  says i my child is another guess sort of a child she is not for thee thou art a libertine and if thou come here again i shall be angry i shall brush thy jacket   greg well said neighbor higgins  now hear what i have got to say  last night i had been late cocking the hay and when i come home being a sort of owl light i could just see some thing crawl upon all fours

her i am glad  imitating her hig so so   greg and all this thou see that i might not find out what sort of a fourlegged animal it was  but icod i was too cunning for her  looking out of the window i found mr dog to be no other than master colin your son   hig ah ah  this is the reason he is sighing and flouting about so then  i cannot get him of late days to mind any kind of work   greg nor can i my daughter   hig what shall we do   greg why truly i dont know   hig suppose we marry them together   greg that is true  but suppose this should be only a flighty pack of nonsense that will last but

v gregory higgins rose hig an old doting fool to pretend that i dont know the price of grain   greg call that indeed clear wheat when it has been half eat up by the rats   rose dear me they seem to be quarrelling  here is the ale father will you please to drink neighbor higgins   hig not i  i will not taste a drop of his ale   greg put it down daughter  put it down  he shall not taste a drop of it

doting  not know the price of corn indeed   scene v gregory rose greg go thy ways thou old fool  and thou daughter if i ever know thee speak to his son  i am going out and if thou sufferst that young dog to come lurking about my house  see thou this oak saplin  he shall get it  however for this time the key shall answer for thee  as i go out i will double lock the door  air with neither dog nor scrip nor staff i rather by half a flock of sheep would guard then a puling wench sighing up and abed with love in her head nor would the task be half so hard all councils thrown away and lost advice is out of season nor the devil a bit no more than a post can you get her to hear reason whining pining groaning moaning it is her way each hour of the day tell her why she heaves a sigh tell her to disclose her fears her answer is a shower of tears  scene vi rose looking through the keyhole yonder he goes  what can be the matter  they were such good friends too  it is a sad thing not to be dutiful  but it is a sadder thing not to love colin  air i lost my poor mother when only a child and i feared such another so gentle and mild was not to be found but i saw my mistake for scarce was she gone but i proved i had father and mother in one and though at this minute he makes my heart ach there is not such another search all the world round ii i would reached my teens fairly as blythe as a be his care late and early being all to please me no one thing above ground was too good for his rose at wake or at fair i was dressed out so gaily lord people would stare and i say it again though he is peevish god knows there is not such another search all the world round iii but love who they tell us does many strange things makes all the world jealous and mad  even kings they say he can wound this love is the sore since colin came here this father so kind is a father severe yet still will i say though he scolds more and more there is not such another search all the world round  scene vii colin rose colin knocking at the door rose rose   rose oh dear it is him and the door is doublelocked   colin rose open the door  i have watched the old man out  what the mischief is not she at home  let us see   rose i cannot open it dear colin  my father has locked it  come again in the evening he does not hear me sure  looking through the keyhole dear me he is gone  oh how my heart beats  that i could not speak to him now  he was in a great hurry to go i think  oh the wicked rogue there he is climbing up at the window  i will hide myself and vex him a little in his turn  she hides herself under the stairs and colin opens the window colin looking in rose  rose  no there is nobody at home well i will leave her the posey i brought however he tries to throw it upon the table and tumbles it upon the ground the deuce take it i have let it fall upon the ground and ten to one if her father dont trample upon it  if i could but get in now i could put it upon the table  hang it i can get in well enough  as he gets in at the window he lets his hat fall on the outside well done i  my hats tumbled  never mind  i can pick it up when i go out  he gets down puts the nosegay upon the table and regards the cushion and bobbins with which rose has been making lace and rose now and then either shows herself or gets under the staircase as she finds occasion during the following song air here is all her geer her wheel her work these little bobbins to and fro how often lve seen her fingers jirk her pretty fingers white as snow each object to me is so dear my heart at sight on it throbbing goes twas here she sat her down  and here  she told me she was colins rose ii this posey for her when she is dressed i have brought alas how happy i could i be like these flowers caressed and like them on her bosom die the violet and pink i took and every pretty flower that blows the rose too but how mean twill look when by the side of my sweet rose  at the end of the song colin begins climbing up to get out at window which rose perceiving she throws a skein of flax at him when he turns speaking as he descends colin ah you rogue you  what you are there   rose yes dear colin  but dont come down go away directly   colin nay but dear rose   rose i will tell thee all at night  pray now go you frighten me out of my wits besides the window opens into goody fidgets garden and she is a scandalous old gossip   colin never mind her   rose hearing her father my father is at the door  i hear him   colin odds wounds i will get away then  one kiss   rose no no  make haste   colin he climbs up how happened it that the casement is got so fast now  here he comes i must even stay where i am   he rests upon the ledge of the window now and then trying to open the casement and leaving off for fear of making a noise scene viii colin rose gregory greg yes yes it is just as i feared it is in every bodys mouth  heyday what is all this  the spinningwheel in one place  the flax in another  nothing but tidling and tidling of that damned lace  twould be better for you if you would mind your spinning  ah well my comfort is that rogue colins far enough off his father has sent him away for three years rose smiles to herself but as often as her father looks at her she seems grave what you pout about it  it is cruel is it not  she shall have her colin  colin  the very name puts me in a passion i will trim him  i will  but he is gone  he is gone that is my comfort yawning come take your wheel and go to your work  i have not had my afternoons nap  i will try if i can sleep while you sing   rose do father  if you dont take your afternoons nap i am afraid you will be sick   he puts the chair on the opposite side and takes her spinningwheel greg come sing   rose what shall i sing father  that song about colin   greg always colin  nothing but colin  sing what you have a mind  if i sleep about an hour wake me do you hear   rose yes father  air there was a jolly shepherd lad and colin was his name and all unknown to her old dad he sometimes to see peggy came the object of his flame one day of his absence too secure her father thundered at the door when fearing of his frown says she dear love the chimney climb i cannot cries he there is not time besides i should tumble down ii what could they do taken unawares they thought and thought again in closets underneath the stairs to hide himself twere all in vain he would soon be found twas plain get up the chimny love you must cried she or else the door he will burst i would not for a crown young colin seeing but this shift even mounted up peg lent a lift and cried dont tumble down iii with throbbing heart now to the door poor peggy runs in haste thinking to trick her father sure but haste the proverb says makes waste which proverb here is wellplacd her father scolded her his best called names and said among the rest pray have you seen that clown she scarce had time to answer no when black all over as a crow young colin tumbled down  during the song colin makes several efforts to open the casement as softly as possible and just at the end of it as rose repeats the words tumbled down for the last time pushing it very hard his foot slips and he tumbles down upon the table carrying with him the bridle and saddle which hang in his way this jolts gregory almost out of his chair who starts up colin icod and so i have  what the deuce rose put it in your head to sing that song   greg what is that  what the devils that  is the house tumbling down  what is the matter    rose dear father  colin    greg who the devil have we got here   colin why it is i   greg oh it is you you young rascal is it  and where did you come from  through the roof of the house or down the chimney   rose you have not hurt yourself colin have you   colin no rose  you ent frightened i hope are you   greg frightened how the devil should she be otherwise coming into my house like a bomb or a cannonball  but you can set all to rights  dont be frightened rose it is i your dear colin  but tell me once for all what brought you here   colin i come  i  i  come neighbor   greg i come  i  i  come  for what   colin to bring you home    greg what   colin that   greg that  what the devils that   colin why the saddle and bridle you lent father   greg lent father  why you dog i never lent your father a saddle and bridle   colin i hope you are pretty well neighbor gregory and your daughter rose   greg oh yes yes we are mighty well and now pray get about your business   colin lord farmer gregory why are you hasty it did not use to be so  air excuse me pray ye do dear neighbor but rose you know and i have often partook one sport or labor while you have pleased stood by and since from little children playing you have kindly called me son i thought to rose i might be saying goodday and no harm done ii when you and father gravely counted one morning in the barn to how much in a day it mounted that both of us could earn since then you down the law were laying and calling me your son i thought to rose i might be saying good day and no harm done  greg here comes your father  he will tell you why so   scene last gregory colin higgins rose goody fidgit hig so farmer goody fidgit here has a fine story to tell you   greg ay why to what do we owe the sight of her   goody why you owe the sight of me to your own goings on  lord lord that parents nowa days have no more prudence  you ought to be ashamed of yourselves two men of your age  thou nicholas gregory was born the  th of january in the year    greg well well we know how old we are  go on   goody and you have no more grace than to let that forward minx your daughter chatter to that rogue colin every night out of the window   rose dear dear how can that be when i lie in the next room to my father   goody so you do and you get up again and creep down a ladder by the way of the grainery   colin lord lord   goody ah it is no secret  all the village knows it   colin i wish i could catch any body telling me of it i would have a touch at them   goody well i tell thee of it then now thou may have a touch at me if thou will   colin it is a great lie i tell you   goody it is is it  tell me then what did you knock at that door for but just now when farmer gregory was out   colin what for  why to come in to be sure   goody but you found it locked and so rather than fail you climbed up the wall and jumped into my garden   colin that is another lie goody   goody we shall see  i can show your father the fig tree you broke in getting up   rose what a wicked old woman you must be   colin i tell you it is a pack of spite and malice  you broke the fig tree yourself i suppose and now you have a mind to say i did it   goody and pray was it i too dropped this hat showing the hat she had before hid under her apron which i found under the window   greg oh ho i am no longer at a loss to know how he came into the house   colin rose   rose colin  what shall we do   hig get out of the house directly you dog and wait for me at the door   greg and do you so to your chamber this minute   colin goes slowly toward the door regarding rose who as slowly goes upstairs greg neighbor higgins   hig neighbor gregory   greg shall we try them any longer   hig they will only make fools of us if we do   greg why i believe you are in the right  come here both of you they run toward each other it is more than you deserve but we forgive you and you young dog if you dont make her a good husband    colin ah neighbor there is no fear of that   greg well we have made good the old proverb at least   vaudeville greg never talk of the care of a father vain pain and argument poor your children make happy much rather nor ever the old crabbed mentor attempt to be playing but think of the saying love in at the window will enter if you shut it out at the door  rose ii never maids should the fit of love seize you pine whine but take for a cure a kind constant youth that can please you in that will your happiness center not cupid still shunning for spite of your cunning he in at the window will enter if you shut him out at the door  colin iii this cupid sly rogue how he teazes all fall plump into his lure and he makes just whatever he pleases of those in his trammels who venture from a clown up to pliny and he was no ninny who said at the window he will enter if you shut him out at the door    the end
