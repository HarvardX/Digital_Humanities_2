shews in the example of natura how from our very birth the passions to which the human soul is incident are discoverable in us and how far the organs of sense or what is called the constitution has an effect over us page     chap ii  contains some proofs by what swift degrees the passions gain an ascendant over the mind and grow up in proportion with our reason page     chap iii  the early influence which the difference of sex excites is here exemplified in the fond but innocent affection of natura and delia page      chap iv  shews that till we arrive at a certain age the impressions made on us are easily erased and also that when those which bear the name of love are once rooted in the mind there are no lengths to which we may not be transported by that passion if great care is not taken to prevent its getting the ascendant over reason page      chap v  that to indulge any one fault brings with it the temptation of committing others is demonstrated by the behaviour of natura and the misfortunes and disgrace which an illjudged shame had like to have involved him in page      chap vi  shews the great force of natural affection and the good effects it has over a grateful mind page      book the second   chap i  the inconsideration and instability of youth when unrestrained by authority is here exemplified in an odd adventure natura embarked in with two nuns after the death of his governor page      chap ii  the pleasures of travelling described and the improvement a sensible mind may receive from it with some hints to the censorious not to be too severe on errors the circumstances of which they are ignorant of occasioned by a remarkable instance of an involuntary slip of nature page      chap iii  the uncertainty of human events displayed in many surprizing turns of fortune which befel natura on his endeavouring to settle himself in the world with some proofs of the necessity of fortitude as it may happen that actions excited by the greatest virtue may prove the source of evil both to ourselves and others page  0    chap iv  the power of fear over a mind weak either by nature or infirmities of body the danger of its leading to despair is shewn by the condition natura was reduced to by the importunities of priests of different perswasions this chapter also demonstrates the little power people have of judging what is really best for them and that what has the appearance of the severest disappointment is frequently the greatest good page       chap v  shews that there is no one human advantage to which all others should be sacrificedthe force of ambition and the folly of suffering it to gain too great an ascendant over uspublic grandeur little capable of atoning for private discontent among which jealousy whether of love or honour is the most tormenting page       book the third   chap i  shews in what manner anger and revenge operate in the mind and how ambition is capable of stifling both in a remarkable instance that private injuries how great soever may seem of no weight when public grandeur requires they should be looked over page       chap ii  shews at what age men are most liable to the passion of grief the impatience of human nature under affliction and the necessity there is of exerting reason to restrain the excesses it would otherwise occasion page       chap iii  the struggles which different passions occasion in the human breast are here exemplified and that there is no one among them so strong but may be extirpated by another excepting revenge which knows no period but by gratification page       chap iv  contains a further definition of revenge its force effects and the chasm it leaves on the mind when once it ceases the tranquility of being entirely devoid of all passions and the impossibility for the soul to remain in that state of inactivity is also shewn with some remarks on human nature in general when left to itself page   0   chap v  contains a remarkable proof that tho the passions may operate with greater velocity and vehemence in youth yet they are infinitely more strong and permanent when the person is arrived at maturity and are then scarce ever eradicated love and friendship are then and not till then truly worthy of the names they bear and that the one between those of different sexes is always the consequence of the other page  0    chap vi  how the most powerful emotions of the mind subside and grow weaker in proportion as the strength of the body decays is here exemplified and that such passions as remain after a certain age are not properly the incentives of nature but of example long habitude or ill humour page         lifes progress through the passions   introduction  i have often heard it observed by the readers of biography that the characters are generally too high painted and that the good or bad qualities of the person pretended to be faithfully represented are displayed in stronger colours than are to be found in nature to this the lovers of hyperbole reply that virtue cannot be drawn too beautiful nor vice too deformed in order to excite in us an ambition of imitating the one and a horror at the thoughts of becoming any way like the otherthe argument at first indeed seems to have some weight as there is nothing not even precept itself which so greatly contributes whether to rectify or improve the mind as the prevalence of example but then it ought to be considered that if the pattern laid down before us is so altogether angelic as to render it impossible to be copied emulation will be in danger of being swallowed up in an unprofitable admiration and on the other hand if it appears so monstrously hideous as to take away all apprehensions of ever resembling it we might be too apt to indulge ourselves in errors which would seem small in comparison with those presented to usthere never yet was any one man in whom all the virtues or all the vices were summed up for though reason and education may go a great way toward curbing the passions yet i believe experience will inform even the best of men that they will sometimes launch out beyond their due bounds in spite of all the care can be taken to restrain them nor do i think the very worst and most wicked does not feel in himself at some moments a propensity to good though it may be possible he never brings it into practice at least this was the opinion of the antients as witness the poets words    all men are born with seeds of good and ill     and each shoot forth in more or less degree   one you may cultivate with care and skill     but from the other neer be wholly free  the human mind may i think be compared to a chequerwork where light and shade appear by turns and in proportion as either of these is most conspicuous the man is alone worthy of praise or censure for none there are can boast of being wholly bright  i believe by this the reader will be convinced he must not expect to see a faultless figure in the hero of the following pages but to remove all possibility of a disappointment on that score i shall farther declare that i am an enemy to all romances novels and whatever carries the air of them tho disguised under different appellations and as it is a real not fictitious character i am about to present i think myself obliged for the reasons i have already given as well as to gratify my own inclinations to draw him such as he was not such as some sanguine imaginations might with him to have been  i flatter myself however that truth will appear not altogether void of charms and the adventures i take upon me to relate not be less pleasing for being within the reach of probability and such as might have happened to any other as well as the person they didfew there are i am pretty certain who will not find some resemblance of himself in one part or other of his life among the many various and surprizing turns of fortune which the subject of this little history experienced as also be reminded in what manner the passions operate in every stage of life and how far the constitution of the outward frame is concerned in the emotions of the internal faculties  these are things surely very necessary to be considered and when they are so will in a great measure abate that unbecoming vehemence with which people are apt to testify their admiration or abhorrence of actions which it very often happens would lose much of their eclat either way were the secret springs that give them motion seen into with the eyes of philosophy and reflection  but this will be more clearly understood by a perusal of the facts herein contained from which i will no longer detain in the attention of my reader       book the first     chap i    shews in the example of natura how from our very birth the   passions to which the human soul is incident are discoverable in   us and how far the organs of sense or what is called the   constitution has an effect over us   the origin of natura would perhaps require more time to trace than the benefit of the discovery would attone for it shall therefore suffice to say that his ancestors were neither of the highest rankthat if no extraordinary action had signalized the names of any of them so none of them had been guilty of crimes to entail infamy on their posterity and that a moderate estate in the family had descended from father to son for many generations without being either remarkably improved or embezzledhis immediate parents were in very easy circumstances and he being their first son was welcomed into the world with a joy usual on such occasionsi never heard that any prodigies preceded or accompanied his nativity or that the planets or his mothers cravings during her pregnancy had sealed him with any particular mark or badge of distinction but have been well assured he was a fine boy sucked heartily of his mothers milk and what they call a thriving child his weaning i am told was attended by some little ailments occasioned by his pining after the food to which he had been accustomed but proper means being found to make him lose the memory of the breast he soon recovered his flesh increased in strength and could go about the room at a year and some few months old without the help of a leadingstring  hitherto the passions those powerful abettors i had almost said sole authors of all human actions operated but faintly and could shew themselves only in proportion to the vigour of the animal frame yet latent as they are an observing eye may easily discover them in each of their different propensities even from the most early infancy the eyes of natura on any new and pleasing object would denote by their sparkling a sensation of joyfear was visible in him by clinging to his nurse and endeavouring to bury himself as it were in her bosom at the sound of menaces he was not capable of understandingthat sorrow has a place among the first emotions of the soul was demonstrable by the sighs which frequently would heave his little heart long before it was possible for him either to know or to imagine any motives for themthat the seeds of avarice are born with us by the eagerness with which he catched at money when presented to him his clinching it fast in his hand and the reluctance he expressed on being deprived of itthat anger and impatience of controul are inherent to our nature might be seen in his throwing down with vehemence any favourite toy rather than yield to resign it and that spite and revenge are also but too much so by his putting in practice all such tricks as his young invention could furnish to vex any of the family who had happened to cross himeven those tender inclinations which afterwards bear the name of amorous begin to peep out long before the difference of sex is thought on as natura proved by the preference he gave the girls over the boys who came to play with him and his readiness to part with any thing to them  in a word there is not one of all the various emotions which agitate the breast in maturity that may not be discerned almost from the birth hope jealousy and despair excepted which tho they bear the name in common with those other more natural dispositions of the mind i look upon rather as consequentials of the passions and arising from them than properly passions themselves but however that be it is certain that they are altogether dependant on a fixation of ideas reflection and comparison and therefore can have no entrance in the soul or at least cannot be awakened in it till some degree of knowledge is attained  thus do the dispositions of the infant indicate the future man and though we see in the behaviour of persons when grown up so vast a difference yet as all children at first act alike i think it may be reasonably supposed that were it not for some change in the constitution an equal similitude of will desires and sentiments would continue among us through maturity and old age at least i am perfectly perswaded it would do so among all those who are born in the same climate and educated in the same principles for whatever may be said of a great genius and natural endowments there is certainly no real distinction between the soul of the man of wit and the ideot and that disproportion which we are apt to behold with so much wonder is only in fact occasioned by some or other of those innumerable and hidden accidents which from our first coming into the world in a more or less degree have an effect upon the organs of sense and they being the sole canals through which the spirit shews itself according as they happen to be extended contracted or obstructed the man must infallibly appear     chap ii    contains some proofs by what swift degrees the passions gain an   ascendant over the mind and grow up in proportion with our reason   natura had no sooner quitted the nursery than he was put under the direction of the school to which at first he was every day conducted either by a man or maidservant but when thought big enough to be trusted alone would frequently play the truant for which he generally received the discipline necessary on such occasionshe took his learning notwithstanding as well as could be expectedhe had read the testament through at five years old about seven was put into latin and began the rudiments of greek before he had attained the age of nine  as his understanding increased the passions became stronger in proportion and here is to be observed the wonderful wisdom of nature or rather of the great author of nature in the formation of the human system that the passions given to us especially those of the worst sort are for the most part such opposites that the one is a sufficient check upon the otherthe pride of treating those beneath us with contempt is restrained by the fear of meeting the same usage from those above usa sordid covetousness is controlled by ostentationsloth is roused by ambition and so of the resti have been told that when natura by the enticements of his companions and his own eagerness to pursue the sports suitable to his years had been drawn in to neglect his studies he had often ran home on a sudden and denied himself both food and sleep till he had not only finished the task assigned him by his schoolmaster but also exceeded what was expected from him instigated by the ambition of praise and hope of being removed to a higher formbut at other times again his love of play has rendered him totally forgetful of every thing besides and all emulation in him absorbed in pleasurethus hurried as the different propensities prevailed from one extreme to the othernever in a medium but always doing either more or less than was required of him  in like manner was his avarice moderated by his pityan instance of which was thisone morning having won at chuckfarthing or some such game all the money a poor boy was master of and which he said had been given him to buy his breakfast natura was so much melted at his tears and complaints that he generously returned to him the whole of what he had lostgreatly is it to be wished the same sentiments of compassion would influence some of riper years and make them scorn to take the advantage chance sometimes affords of ruining their fellowcreatures but the misfortune is that when we arrive at the state of perfect manhood the worst passions are apt to get the better of the more noble as the prospect they present is more alluring to the eye of sense all men as i said before being born with the same propensities it is virtue alone or in other words a strict morality which prevents them from actuating alike in allbut to return to the young natura  he was scarce ten years old when his mother died but was not sensible of the misfortune he sustained by the loss of her though as it afterwards proved was the greatest could have happened to him the remembrance of the tenderness with which she had used him joined to the sight of all the family in tears made him at first indeed utter some bitter lamentations but the thoughts of a new suit of mourning a dress he had never yet been in soon dissipated his grief and the sight of himself before the great glass in a habit so altogether strange and therefore pleasing to him took off all anguish for the sad occasionso early do we begin to be sensible of a satisfaction in any thing that we imagine is an advantage to our persons or will make us be taken notice ofhow it grows up with us and how difficult it is to be eradicated i appeal even to those of the most sour and cynical disposition  mr dryden admirably describes this propensity in human nature in these lines    men are but children of a larger growth   our appetites as prone to change as theirs   and full as craving too and full as vain  a fondness for trifles is certainly no less conspicuous in age than youth and we daily see it among persons of the best understanding who wholly neglect every essential to real happiness in the pursuit of those very toys which children cry to be indulged in even such as a bit of ribband or the sound of a monosyllable tacked to the name without considering that those badges of distinction like bells about an ideots neck frequently serve only to render their folly more remarkable and expose them to the contempt of the lookers on who perhaps too as nature is the same in all want but the same opportunity to catch no less eagerly at the tawdry gewgaw  natura felt not the loss of his dear mother till he beheld another in her place his father entered into a second marriage before much more than half his year of widowhood was expired with a lady who though pretty near his equal in years had yet remains enough of beauty to render her extremely vain and affected and fortune enough to make her no less proudthese two qualities occasioned natura many rebuffs to which he had not been acoustomed and he felt them the more severely as the name of mother had made him expect the same proofs of tenderness from this who had the title as he had remembered to have received from her who had been really so  he endeavoured at first to insinuate himself into her favour by all those little flattering artifices which are so becoming in persons of his tender years and which never fail to make an impression on a gentle and affable disposition but finding his services not only rejected but also rejected with scorn and moroseness his spirit was too great to continue them for any long time and all the assiduity he had shewn to gain her goodwill was on a sudden converted into a behaviour altogether the reverse he was sure to turn the deaf ear to all the commands she laid upon him and so far from doing any thing to please her he seemed to take a delight in vexing her this occasioning many complaints to his father drew on him very severe chastisements both at home and abroad but though while the smart remained he made many promises of amendment in this point the hatred he had now conceived against her would not suffer him to keep them  his sister who was five years older than himself and a girl of great prudence took a good deal of pains to convince him how much it was both his interest and his duty to pay all manner of respect to a lady whom their father had thought fit to set over them but all she could say on that head was thrown away and he still replied that since he could not make her love him he should always hate her  this young lady had perhaps no less reason than her brother to be dissatisfied with the humour of their stepmother and it was only the tender affection she had for him which made her feign a contentment at the treatment both of them received in order to keep him within any manner of bounds  it may be reckoned among the misfortunes of natura that he so soon lost the benefit of these kind remonstrances his fair adviser having a considerable fortune independent on her father left her by a grandmother who had also answered for her at the font was courted by a gentleman to whom neither herself nor family having any thing to object she became a bride in a very few months and went with her husband to a seat he had at a considerable distance in the country  this poor youth was now without any one either to prevent him from doing a fault or to conceal it when committed on the contrary his motherinlaw having newmodelled all the family and retained only such servants as thought it their duty to study nothing but to humour her every little error in him was exaggerated and he was represented to his father as incorrigible perverse and all that is disagreeable in nature  i will not take upon me to determine whether or not the old gentleman had altogether so ill an opinion of his son as they endeavoured to inspire him with but it is certain that whatever his thoughts were on the matter he found himself obliged for a quiet life to use him with a good deal of severity which either because he believed it unjust or that it was disagreeable to his own disposition he grew very weary of in a short time and to put an end to it resolved to send the child to a boardingschool tho he had always declared against that sort of education and frequently said that though these great schools might improve the learning they were apt to corrupt the morals of youth  finding himself however under a kind of necessity for so doing nothing remained but the choice of a convenient place the wife proposed some part of yorkshire not only as the cheapest but also that by reason of the distance she should not have the trouble of him at home in the holidays but to this it was not in her power to prevail on his father to consent and after many disputes between them on it eton was at length pitched upon  natura heard of his intended removal with a perfect indifferenceif the thoughts of parting from his father gave him any pain it was balanced by those of being eased of the persecuting of his stepmother but when all things were prepared for his journey in which he was to be accompanied by an old relation who was to give the necessary charge with him to those into whose care he should be committed he was taken suddenly ill on the very day he had been to take leave of his kindred and other friends in town  his distemper proved to be the smallpox but being of a very favourable sort he recovered in a short time and lost nothing of his handsomeness by that somuchdreaded enemy to the face there remained however a little redness which till intirely worn off it was judged improper he should be sent where it was likely there might be many young gentlemen who having never experienced the same would take umbrage at the sight  during the time of his indisposition he had been attended by an old nurse who had served in the same quality to his mother and several others of her familythe tenderness this good creature shewed to him and the care she took to humour him in every thing not only while he continued in a condition in which it might have been dangerous to have put his spirits into the least agitation but after he was grown well enough to walk abroad had made him become extremely pettish and selfwilled which shews that an overindulgence to youth is no less prejudicial than too much austerityhappy is it for those who are brought up in a due proportion between these two extremes for as nature will be apt to fall into a dejection if pressed down with a constant and uninterrupted severity so it will infallibly become arrogant and assuming if suffered always to pursue its own dictatesnothing is more evident than that most of the irregularities we see practised in the world are owing originally to a want of the medium i have been speaking of in forming the mind while it is pliable to impression  this was not however the case of natura and though he would doubtless have been what we call a spoiled child had he been for any length of time permitted to do just what he pleased yet the nurse being discharged he fell again under the jurisdiction of his motherinlaw who had now more excuse than ever for treating him with severity  his father did not want understanding but was a good deal more indolent than befits a parenthe had always been accustomed to live at ease and his natural aversion to all kinds of trouble made him not inspect into the manners or temperament of his son with that care he ought to have done whenever any complaints were made concerning his behaviour he would chide and sometimes beat him but seldom examined how far he really merited those effects rather of others resentment than his own sometimes he would ask him questions on his progress in learning and praise or dispraise as he found occasion but he never discoursed with him on any other topics nor took any pleasure in instructing him in such things as are not to be taught in schools but which much more contribute to enlarge the mind so that had not naturas own curiosity led him to examine into the sources first causes and motives of what he was obliged to read he would have reaped no other benefit from his greek and latin authors than meerly the knowledge of their language  here i cannot help taking notice that whatever inconveniences it may occasion curiosity is one of the greatest advantages we receive from nature it is that indeed from which all our knowledge is derivedwere it not for this propensity in ourselves the sun the moon and all the darling constellations which adorn the hemisphere would roll above our heads in vain contented to behold their shine and feel their warmth but ignorant of their motion and influence on all beneath half that admiration due to the divine architect would lye dormant in usdid not curiosity excite us to examine into the nature of vegetables their amazing rise their progress their deaths and resurrections in the seasons allotted for these alternatives we should enjoy the fruits of the earth indeed but enjoy them only in common with the animals that feed upon it or perhaps with less relish than they do as it is agreed their organs of sensation have a greater share of poignancy than ourswhat is it but curiosity which renders study either pleasing or profitable to usthe facts we read of would soon slip through the memory or if they retained any place in it could be of little advantage without being acquainted with the motives which occasioned them by curiosity we examine by examining we compare and by comparing we are alone enabled to form a right judgment whether of things or persons  we are told indeed of many jealousies discontents and quarrels which have been occasioned by this passion among those who might otherwise have lived in perfect harmony and a man or woman who has the character of being too inquisitive is shunned as dangerous to societybut what commendable quality is there that may not be perverted or what virtue whose extreme does not border on a viceeven devotion itself should have its bounds or it will launch into bigotry and enthusiasmlove the most generous and gentle of all the passions when illplaced or unprescribed degenerates into the very worstjustice may be pursued till it becomes crueltyemulation indulged till it grows up to envyfrugality to the most sordid avarice and courage to a brutal rashnessand so i am ready to allow that curiosity from whence all the good in us originally arises may also be productive of the greatest mischiefs when not like every other emotion of the soul kept within its due limits and suffered to exert itself only on warrantable objects  it should therefore be the first care of every one to regulate this propensity in himself as well as of those under whose tuition he may happen to be whether parents or governorsnature and the writings of learned men who from time to time have commented on all that has happened in nature certainly afford sufficient matter to gratify the most enquiring mind without descending to such mean trifling inquisitions as can no way improve itself and may be of prejudice to others  i have dwelt the longer on this head because it seems to me that on the well or ill direction of that curiosity which is inherent to us all depends in a great measure the peace and happiness of society  natura like all children uncircumscribed by precept had not only a desire of prying into those things which it was his advantage to know but also into those which he had much better have been totally ignorant of and which the discovery of his being too well skilled in frequently occasioned him much ill will especially when he was found to have too far dived into those little secrets which will ever be among servants in large families but reason was not ripe enough in him to enable him to distinguish between what were proper subjects for the exercise of this passion and what were not so  that impediment however which had hitherto retarded his departure being removed he now set out for eton under the conduct of the abovementioned kinsman who placed him in a boardinghouse very near the school and took his leave after having given him such admonitions as he thought necessary for a person of his years when more intrusted to himself than he before had been  but natura was not yet arrived at an age wherein it could be expected he should reap much benefit from advice a settled resolution and the power of judging what is our real interest to do are the perfections of maturity and happy is it for the few who even then attain themprecept must be constantly and artfully instilled to make any impression on the mind and is rarely fixed there till experience confirms it therefore as both these were wanting to form his behaviour what could be hoped from it but such a one as was conformable to the various passions which agitate human nature and which every day grow stronger in us at least till they have attained a certain crisis after which they decay in proportion as they increased  as wrath is one of the most violent emotions of the soul so i think it is one of the first that breaks out into effects it owes its birth indeed to pride for we are never angry unless touched by a real or imaginary insult but by the offspring chiefly is the parent seen pride seldom i believe it may be said never wholly dies in us tho it may be concealed whereas wrath diminishes as our reason increases and seems intirely evaporated after the heat of youth is over when a man therefore has divested himself of the one no tokens are left to distinguish the othersometimes indeed we shall see an extreme impetuosity even to old age but then it is out of the ordinary course of nature and besides the person possessed of it must be endued with a small share of sound understanding to give any marks of such a propensity remaining in him  it is with the utmost justice that by the system of the christian religion pride is intitled the original sin not only as it was that of the fallen angels but also as it is certainly the fountainhead from which all our other vices are derivedit is by the dictates of this pernicious passion we are inflamed with wrath and wild ambitioninstigated to covetousnessto envyto revenge and in fine to stop at nothing which tends to selfgratification be our desires of what kind soever  during the school hours natura as well as the other young gentlemen was under too much awe of the master to give any loose to his temper but when these were over and they went together into the fields or any other place to divert themselves frequent quarrels among them ensued but above all between those who boarded in the same house little jealousies concerning some imaginary preference given to the one more than the other occasioned many bitter taunts and fleers which sometimes rose to blows and bloody noses so that the good people with whom they were had enough to do to keep them in any tolerable decorum  there is also another branch of pride which is visible in all youth before consideration takes place and that is treating with contempt whoever seems our inferiora boy who was allowed less money or wore plainer cloaths was sure to be the jest of all the rest natura was equally guilty of this fault with his companions but when the sarcasms became too severe and the object of them appeared any way dejected his generosity often got the better of his arrogance and he would take part with the weakest side even till he drew on himself part of those reflections he averted from the other but this never happened without his resenting it with the utmost violence for patience and forbearance were virtues not to be expected in this stage of life  he was a great lover of gaming whether of chucking tossing up for money or cards and extremely illhumoured and quarrelsome whenever luck was not on his side which shews that whatever people may pretend avarice is at the bottom and occasions all the fondness so many testify for play  as for the other ordinary diversions of youth none could pursue them with more eagerness nor was less deterred by any ill accident which befel either himself or any of his companions one of whom having been near drowning before his face as they were swimming together the sight did not hinder him from plunging into the same stream every day nor could he be prevailed upon from ringing as often as he had an opportunity though he had been thrown one day by the breaking of the bellrope a great height from the ground and in the fall dislocated his shoulder and bruised his body all overbut it is not to be wondered at that boys should remember the misfortunes their pleasures have brought on them no longer than the smart continues when men of the ripest and sometimes most advanced years are not to be warned from the gratification of their passions by the worst and most frequently repeated ills  he notwithstanding made a very good progress in those things in which he was instructed which as yet were only latin and greek and when the time of breaking up arrived and he returned to his fathers house none who examined him concerning his learning could suspect there was either any want of application in himself or care in his master  his three months of absence having rendered him a kind of stranger at home his motherinlaw used him with somewhat more civility and his father seemed highly satisfied with him all his kindred and friends caressed him and made him many little presents of such things as befitted his years but that which crowned his felicity was the company of a young girl a near relation of his stepmothers who was come to pass some time with her and see london which she had never been in before     chap iii    the early influence which the difference of sex excites is here   exemplified in the fond but innocent affection of natura and delia   natura being much of the same age with delia for so i shall call her and both equally playful spirituous and goodnatured it is hard to say which of them took the greatest delight in the society of the other natura was never well out of the presence of delia nor delia contented but when natura was with her  in walking dancing playing at cards these amiable children were always partners and it was remarkable that in the latter of these diversions natura was never uneasy at losing his money to delia nor resented any little railleries she treated him with on account of his ill luck or want of skill in the game as he had been accustomed to do whenever he received the like from any of his companionsso forcibly does the difference of sex operate even before that difference is considered  natura was yet too young by much to know wherefore he found in himself this complaisance or how it came to pass that he so much preferred a beautiful and goodhumoured girl to a boy possessed of the same qualifications but he was not ignorant that he did so and has often wondered as he afterwards confessed what it was that made him feel so much pleasure whenever in innocently romping together he happened to catch hold of her in his arms and what strange impulse it was that rendered him so reluctant to part with her out of that posture that she was obliged to struggle with all her strength to disengage herself  hence it is plain that the passion of love is part of our composition implanted in the soul for the propagation of the world and we ought not in my opinion to be too severe on the errors which meerly and abstracted from any other motive than itself it sometimes influences us to be guilty ofthe laws indeed which prohibit any amorous intercourse between the sexes unless authored by the solemnities of marriage are without all question excellently well calculated for the good of society because without such a restriction there would be no such thing as order in the world i am therefore far from thinking lightly of that truly sacred institution when i say that there are some cases in which the pair so offending merit rather our pity than that abhorrence which those of a more rigid virtue colder constitution or less under the power of temptation are apt to testify on such occasion  rarely however it happens that love is guilty of any thing capable of being condemned even by the most austere most of the faults committed under that sanction being in reality instigated by some other passion such as avarice and ambition in the one sex and a flame which is too often confounded and mistaken for a pure affection in the otheryet such is the illjudging or careless determination of the world that without making any allowances for circumstances it censures all indiscriminately alike  the time prefixed for naturas remaining with his father being but fourteen days as they grew near expired the family began to talk of his going and orders were given to bespeak a place for him in the stagecoach he had been extremely pleased with eton nor had he met with any cause of disgust either at the school or house where he was boarded yet did the thoughts of returning thither give him as much disquiet as his young heart was capable of conceivingthe parting from delia was terrible to him and the nearer the cruel moment approached the more his anxiety increasedshe seemed also grieved to lose so agreeable a companion and would often tell him she wished he was to stay as long as she did  though nothing could be more innocent than these declarations on both sides yet what she said had such an effect on natura that he resolved to delay his return to eton as long as possible and that passion which he already felt the symptoms of though equally ignorant of their nature or end being always fertile in invention put a stratagem into his head which he flattered himself would succeed for a somewhat farther continuance of his present happiness  the day before that prefixed for his going he pretended a violent pain in his head and stomach and to give the greater credit to his pretended indisposition would eat nothing and as it drew toward evening cried out he was very sick and must go to bedhis father who had the most tender affection for him could not think of sending him away in that conditionhe went in the morning to his bedside and finding him as he imagined a little feverish presently ordered a physician who did not fail to countenance the young gentlemans contrivance either that he really thought him out of order or that he had rendered himself so in good earnest through abstaining from food a thing very uncommon with him a prescription was sent to the apothecary for him and a certain regimen directed  but poor natura soon found this did not answer his purposehe was in the same house indeed with his beloved delia but had not the pleasure of her company nor even that of barely seeing her she being forbid going near his chamber on account of the apprehensions they had that his complaint might terminate in a fever and endanger her health  this however was more than he knew and resentment for her supposed indifference joined with the weariness of living in the manner he did made him resolve to grow well again and chuse to go to eton rather than suffer so much for one who seemed so little to regard him  accordingly when they brought him something had been ordered for him to take he refused it saying he had not occasion for any more physic and immediately got up and dressed himself in spite of all the servant that attended him could do to prevent itword being carried to his father of what he was doing he imagined him delirious and immediately got up and went into his room nor though he found him intirely cool could be perswaded from his first opinionthe doctor was again sent for who unwilling to lose his perquisite made a long harangue on the nature of internal fevers and very learnedly proved or seemed to prove that they might operate so far as to affect the brain without the least outward symptom  natura could not forbear laughing within himself to hear this great man so much mistaken but when they told him he must take his physic and go to bed or at least be confined to his chamber he absolutely refused both and said he was as well as ever he was in his lifeall he said however availed nothing and his father was about to make use of his authority to force him to obedience to the doctors prescription when finding no other way to avoid it he fell on his knees and with tears in his eyes confessed he had only counterfeited sickness to delay being sent to eton again begged his father to forgive him said he was sorry for having attempted to deceive him but was ready to go whenever he pleased  the father was strangely amazed at the trick had been put upon him and after some severe reprimands on the occasion asked what he had to complain of at eton that had rendered him so unwilling to return natura hesitated at this demand but could not find in his heart to forge any unjust accusation concerning his usage at that place and at last said that indeed it was only because he had a mind to stay a little longer at home with him on which he told him he was an idle boy but he must not expect that wheedle would serve his turn for since he was not sick he must go to school the next day natura renewed his intreaties for pardon and assured him he now desired nothing more than to do as he commanded  this story made a great noise in the family and the motherinlaw did not fail to represent it in its worst colours to every one that came to the house but natura having obtained forgiveness from his father did not give himself much trouble as to the restdelia seemed rejoiced to see him come down stairs again but he looked shy upon her and told her he could not have thought she would have been so unkind as not to have come to see him but on her acquainting him with the reason of her absence and protesting it was not her fault he grew as fond of her as ever and among a great many other tender expressions i wish said he i were a man and you a womanwhy returned she because cried he we would be marriedo fye answered the little coquet i should hate you if you thought of any such thing for i will never be married then turned away with an affected scornfulness and yet looked kindly enough upon him from the corner of one eyei am sure resumed he if you loved me as well as i do you you would like to be married to me for then we should be always togetherhe was going on with something farther in this innocent courtship when some one or other of the family coming into the room broke it off and whether it was resumed afterwards or not i cannot pretend to determine nor whether he had opportunity to take any particular leave of her before his departure which happened as his father had threatened the succeeding day     chap iv    shews that till we arrive at a certain age the impressions made on   us are easily erased and also that when those which bear the name   of love are once rooted in the mind there are no lengths to which   we may not be transported by that passion if great care is not   taken to prevent its getting the ascendant over reason   the change of scene did not make any change in the sentiments of our young lover delia was always in his head and none of the diversions he took with his companions could banish her from his thoughts yet did she not so wholly engross his attention as to render him remiss in his studies his ambition as i said before would not suffer him to neglect the means of acquiring praise and nothing was so insupportable to him as to find at any time another boy had merited a greater share of it by which we may perceive that this very passion unruly as it is and in spite of the mischiefs it sometimes occasions is also bestowed upon us for our emolument and when properly directed is the greatest excitement to all that is noble and generous natura seldom had the mortification of seeing any of the same standing with himself placed above him and whenever such an accident happened he was sure to retrieve it by an extraordinary assiduity  but to shew that love and business are not wholly incompatible his attachment to delia did not take him off his learning nor did his application to learning make him forgetful of delia he frequently thought of her wished to see her and longed for the next breakingup that he might reenjoy that satisfaction as he knew she intended to stay the whole winter at his fathers but now arrived the time to prove the inconstancy of human nature he became acquainted with some other little misses and by degrees found charms in them which made those he had observed in delia appear less admirable in his eyes the fondness he had felt for her being in reality instigated chiefly by being the only one of his own age he had conversed with a more general acquaintance with others not only wore off the impression she had made but also kept him from receiving too deep a one from the particular perfections of any of those he now was pleased withit is likely however that the sight of her might have revived in him some part of his former tenderness had he found her as he expected he should on his next coming to london but an elder sister she had in the country happening to die she was sent for home in order to console their mother for that loss so that he had not any trial on that account and tho he thought he should have been glad of her society during his stay in town yet her absence gave him small anxiety and the variety of company which came to the house on account of the baptism of a little son his motherinlaw had lately brought into the world very well atoned for the want of delia  nothing material happening to him during his stay in town at this time nor in any other of the many visits he made his father while he continued at eton i shall pass over those years and only say that as he grew nearer to manhood his passions gathered strength in proportion and tho he increased in knowledge yet it was not that sort of knowledge which enables us to judge of the emotions we feel within ourselves or to set curbs on those which to indulge renders us liable to inconveniences  all those propensities of which he gave such early indications and which i attempted to describe in the beginning of this book now displayed themselves with greater vigour and according as exterior objects presented or circumstances excited ruled with alternate sway sparing sometimes to niggardliness at others profusely liberalnow pleased now angrysubmissive this moment arrogant and assuming the nextseldom in a perfect calm and frequently agitated to excesshence arose contests and quarrels even with those whose company in some humours he was most delighted withinsolence to such whose way of thinking did not happen to tally with his own and as partial an attachment to those who either did or pretended to enter into his sentiments  but as it was only in trivial matters and such as were meerly boyish he yet had opportunity of exercising the passions his behaviour only served to shew what man would be when arrived at maturity if not restrained by precept  he had attained to little more than sixteen years of age when he had gone through all the learning of the school and was what they call fit for the university to which his father not intending him for the study of any particular science did not think it necessary to send him but rather to bestow on him those other accomplishments which are immediately expected from a gentleman of an estate such as fencing dancing and music and accordingly provided masters to instruct him in each as soon as he came home which was about the time of life i mentioned  as he was now past the age of being treated as a meer child and also knew better how it would become him to behave to the wife of his father his motherinlaw seemed to live with him in harmony enough and the family at least was not divided into parties as it had been and eighteen or nineteen months past over without any rub in our young gentlemans tranquility  since his childish affection for delia he had not been possessed of what could be called a strong inclination for any particular female though as many incidents in his life afterwards proved he had a no less amorous propensity than any of his sex and was equally capable of going the greatest lengths for its gratification  he was but just turned of nineteen when happening to pass by the playhouse one evening he took it into his head to go in and see the last act of a very celebrated tragedy acted that nightbut it was not the poets or the players art which so much engaged his attention as the numerous and gay assembly which filled every part of the househe was in the back bench of one of the front boxes from which he had a full prospect of all who sat belowbut in throwing his eyes around on every dazzling belle he found none so agreeable to him as a young lady who was placed in the next division of the boxher age did not seem to exceed his own and tho less splendid in garb and jewels than several who sat near her had something in her eyes and air that in his opinion at least infinitely exceeded them all  when the curtain dropt and every one was crowding out as fast they could he lost not sight of her and finding when they came out to the door that she and a companion she had with her somewhat older than herself seemed distressed for chairs which by reason of the great concourse seemed difficult to be got he took the opportunity in a very polite manner to offer himself for their protector as he perceived they had neither friend nor servant with them they accepted it with a great deal of seeming modesty and he conducted them through a passage belonging to the house which he knew was less thronged and thence put them into a hackney coach having first obtained their permission to attend them to their lodgings or wherever else they pleased to be set down  when they arrived at the place to which they gave the coachman a direction he would have taken leave of them at the door but they joined in entreating him that since he had been at the pains of bringing them safe home he would come in and refresh himself with such as their apartment could supply there required little invitation to a thing his heart so sincerely wished tho his fears of being thought too presuming would not suffer him to ask it  he went up stairs and found rooms decently furnished and a maidservant immediately spread the table with a genteel cold collation but what he looked upon as the most elegant part of the entertainment was the agreeable chitchat during the time of supper and a song the lady who had so much attracted him gave him at her friends request after the cloth was taken away  it growing late his fears of offending where he already had such an inclination to oblige made him about to take his leave but could not do it without intreating permission to wait on them the next day to receive pardon as he said for having by his long stay broke in upon the hours should have been devoted to repose tho this compliment and indeed all the others he had made were directed to both the regard his eyes paid to the youngest easily shewed the preference he secretly gave to her and as neither of these women wanted experience in such affairs knew very well how to make the most of any advantage if this lodging were mine replied the eldest briskly i should have anticipated the request you make but as i am only a guest and take part of my friends bed tonight on account of the hour will take upon me to say she ought not to refuse greater favours to so accomplished a gentleman and from whom we have received so much civility  natura did not fail to answer this gallantry in a proper manner and departed highly satisfied with his adventure tho probably could find less reasons for being so than those with whom he thought it the greatest happiness of his life to have become acquainted  wonderful are the workings of love on a young heart pleasure has the same effect as pain and permits as little rest it was not in the power of natura to close his eyes for a long time after he went to bedhe recollected every thing the dear creature had saidin what manner she looked when speaking such or such a thinghow inchanting she sang and what a genteelness accompanied all she didwhen he fell into a slumber it was only to bring her more perfectly into his mind whatever had past in the few hours he had been with her returned with additional graces on her part and her idea had in sleep all the effect her real presence could have had in waking  with what care did he dress himself the next daywhat fears was he not possessed of lest all about him should not be exactnever yet had he consulted the great glass with such assiduitynever till now examined how far he had been indebted to nature for personal endowments  his impatience would have carried him to pay a morning visit but he feared that would be too great a freedom and therefore restrained himself till after dinner though what he eat could scarce be called so the food his mind languished for being wanting the body was too complaisant to indulge itselfafter rising from table not a minute passed without looking on his watch and at the same time cursing the tedious seconds which seemed to him increased from sixty to six hundredthe hour of five at length put an end to his suspence and he took his way to the dear wellremembered mansion of his adorable  he found her at home and in a careless but most becoming dishabillee the other lady was still with her and told him she had tarried thus long with miss harriot for so she called her meerly to participate of the pleasure of his good company harriot in a gay manner accused her of envy and both having a good share of wit the conversation might have been pleasing enough to a man less prepossessed than natura  the tea equipage was set and the ceremony of that being over cards were proposed as they were three ombre was the game at which they played some hours and natura was asked to supafter what i have said i believe the reader has no occasion to be told that he complied with a pleasure which was but too visible in his eyesthe time passed insensibly on or at least seemed to do so to the friend of harriot till the watchman reminding her it was past eleven she started up and pretending a surprize that the night was so far advanced told natura that she must exact a second proof of that gallantry he had shewn the night before for she had not courage to go either in a chair or a coach alone at that late hourthis doubtless was what he would have offered had she been silent on the occasion and a coach being ordered to the door he took leave of miss harriot though not till he had obtained leave to testify his respects in some future visits  had natura appeared to have more experience of the town the lady he gallanted home would certainly not have entertained him with the discourse she did but his extreme youth and the modest manner of his behaviour on the first sight of him convinced them he was a person such as they wished to have in their power and to that end had concerted measures between themselves to perfect the conquest which it was easy to perceive one of them had begun to make over him  harriot being the person with whom they found he was enamoured it was the business of the other to do for her what it may be supposed she would have done for her on the like occasionnatura was no sooner in the coach with her than she began to magnify the charms of her fair friend but above all extolled her virtue her prudence and good humourthen as if only to give a proof of her patience and fortitude that her parents dying when she was an infant had left her with a vast fortune in the hands of a guardian who attempting to defraud her of the greatest part she was now at law with him and is obliged to live till the affair is decided said this artful woman in the narrow manner you seewithout a coachwithout any equipage and yet she bears it all with chearfulnessshe has a multiplicity of admirers added she but she assures all of them that she will never marry till she knows what present she shall be able to give with herself to the man she shall make choice of  till now natura had never asked himself the question how far his passion for harriot extended or with what view he should address her but when he heard she was a woman of condition and would have a fortune answerable to her birth he began to think it would be happy for him if he could obtain her love on the most honourable terms  it would be too tedious to relate all the particulars of his courtship so i shall only say that humble and timid as the first emotions of a sincere passion are he was emboldened by the extraordinary complaisance of harriot to declare it to her in a few daysthe art with which she managed on this occasion might have deceived the most knowing in the sex it is not therefore surprizing that he should be caught in a snare which though ruinous as it had like to have been had in it allurements scarce possible to be withstood at his time of life  it was by such degrees as the most modest virgin need not blush to own that she confessed herself sensible of an equal tenderness for him and nothing is more strange than that in the transport he was in at the condescensions she made him that he did not immediately press for the consummation of his happiness by marriage but tho he wished for nothing so much yet he was withheld by the fears of his father who he thought would not approve of such a step as the fortune he imagined she had a right to was yet undetermined and himself tho an elder son and the undoubted heir of a very good estate at present wholly dependant on himhe communicated his sentiments to harriot on this head with the utmost sincerity protesting at the same time that he should never enjoy a moments tranquility till he could call her his own  she seemed to approve of the caution he testifiedsaid it was such as she had always resolved religiously to observe herself tho i know not cried she looking on him with the most passionate air how far i might have been tempted to break thro all for your sake but it is well one of us is wise enough to foresee and tremble at the consequences of a marriage between two persons whose fortunes are unestablishedthen finding he made her no other answer than some kisses accompanied with a strenuous embrace she went on there is a way resumed she to secure us to each other without danger of disobliging any body and that is by a contract i never can be easy while i think there is a possibility of your transferring your affection to some other and if you love me with half that degree of tenderness you pretend you cannot but feel the same anxiety  natura was charmed with this proposition and it was agreed between them that her lawyer should draw up double contracts in form which should be signed and delivered interchangeably by both parties accordingly the very next day the fatal papers were prepared and he subscribed his name to that which was to remain in her custody as she did hers to that given to him each being witnessed by the woman with whom he first became acquainted with her and another person called into the room for that purpose  natura now considering her as his wife thought himself intitled to take greater liberties than he had ever presumed to do before and she had also a kind of a pretence for permitting them till at last there remained nothing more for him to ask or her to grant  enjoyment made no abatement in his passion his fondness was rather increased by it and he never thought himself happy but when with her he went to her almost every night and sometimes passed all night with her having made an interest with one of the servants who let him in at whatever hour he cameso totally did she engross his mind that he seemed to have not the least attention for any thing beside nor was the time he wasted with her all the prejudice she did himall the allowance made him by his father for cloaths and other expences he dissipated in treats and presents to her running in debt for every thing he had occasion for  but this was insufficient for her expectations she wanted a sum of money and pretending that her lawsuit required a hundred guineas immediately and that some remittances she was to have from the country would come too late told him he must raise it for her some way or other  this demand was a kind of thunderstroke to natura not but he doated on her enough to have sacrificed infinitely more to her desires if in his power but what she asked seemed so wholly out of reach that he knew not any way by which there was the least probability of attaining it the embarrassment that appeared in his countenance made her see it was not so easy for him to grant as it was for her to ask i should have wanted courage said she to have made you this request had i not considered that what is mine must one day be yours and it will be your own unhappiness as well as mine should my cause miscarry for want of means to carry it onsevere necessity added she letting fall some tears that reduces me to intreat favours where i could wish only to bestow them  these words destroyed all the remains of prudence his love had left in him he embraced her kissed away her tears and assured her that though as he was under age and had but a small allowance from his father it was not at this time very easy for him to comply with her demand yet she might depend upon him for the money the next day let it cost what it would or whatever should be the consequence  he left her that night much sooner than was his custom in order to consult within himself on the means of fulfilling his promise to her which to have failed in would have been more terrible to him than death     chap v    that to indulge any one fault brings with it the temptation of   committing others is demonstrated by the behaviour of natura and   the misfortunes and disgrace which an illjudged shame had like to   have involved him in   never had natura experienced so cruel a night a thousand stratagems came into his head but for some reason or other all seemed alike impracticable and the morning found him in no more easy a situationhe put on his cloaths hastily and resolved to go to all the acquaintance he had in the world and try the friendship of each by borrowing what sums he thought they might be able to spare but first going into his fathers closet as was his custom every morning to pay his duty to him he found a person with him who was paying him a large sum of money the sight of what he so much wanted filled him with inexpressible agitationshe would have given almost a limb to have had in his possession so much of that shining ore as harriot expected from him and wished that some sudden accident even to the falling of the house would happen that in the confusion he might seize on some part of the treasure he saw before him  the person after the affair which brought him there was over took leave of the father of natura who having thrown the money into his bureau to a large heap was there before waited on him down stairs without staying to lock the drawer  often had natura been present when his father received larger sums than this and doubtless had the same opportunity as now to make himself master of some part or all of it but never till this unhappy exigence had the least temptation to do soit came into his head that the accident was perfectly providential and that he ought not to neglect the only means by which he could perform his promisethat his father could very well spare the sum he wanted and that it was only taking before the time what by inheritance must be his own hereafterin this imagination he opened the drawer and was about to pursue his intention when he recollected that the money would certainly be missed and either the fault be laid upon some innocent person who might suffer for his crime or he himself would be suspected of a thing which in this second thought he found so mean and wicked that he was shocked almost to death for having been capable of even a wish to be guilty of ithe shut the drawer againturned himself away and was in the utmost confusion of mind when his father returned into the room which shews that there is a native honesty in the human nature which nothing but a long practice of base actions can wholly eradicate and i dare believe that even those we see most hardened in vice have felt severe struggles within themselves at first and have often looked back upon the paths of virtue wishing tho fruitlesly to return  natura however did not give over his pursuit of the means of performing his promise on the contrary he thought himself obliged by all the ties of love honour and even selfinterest to do it but difficult as he believed the task would be he found it much more so than he could even have imagined his intimacy being only with such as being much of his own age and like him were at an allowance from their parents or guardians it was not in the power of any of them to contribute a large sum toward making up that he wanted the most he got from any one being no more than five guineas and all he raised among the whole amounted to no more than twenty and some odd pounds  distracted with his ill fortune he ventured to go to an uncle he had by the mothers side and after many complaints of his fathers parsimony told him that having been drawn into some expences which though not extravagant were more than his little purse could supply he had broke into some money given him to pay his taylor whom he feared would demand it of his father and he knew not how far the illwill of his motherinlaw might exaggerate the matter concluding with an humble petition for twenty guineas which he told him he would faithfully return by degrees  as natura had the character of a sober youth the good old gentleman was moved by the distress he saw him in and readily granted his request tho not without some admonitions to confine for the future his expences to his allowance be it ever so small  thus natura having with all his diligence not been able to raise quite half of the sum in question was quite distracted what to do and as he afterwards owned more than once repented him of those scruples which had prevented him from serving himself at once out of his fathers purse tho had the same opportunity again presented itself it is scarce possible to believe by the rest of his behaviour that he would have made use of it or if he had that he could have survived the shame and remorse it would have caused in him  in his desperation he ran at last to the house of a noted moneyscrivener a great acquaintance of the family and in his whose hands his father frequently reposed his ready cash to this man he communicates his distress and easily prevails with him to let him have fifty pounds on giving him a note to pay him an hundred for it when he should come of age his father having said he would then make a settlement on him  this however was still somewhat short of what harriot had demanded but he left his watch at a pawnbrokers for the rest and having compleated the sum went transported with joy and threw it into the lap of that idol of his soul after which he was for some days perfectly at ease indulging himself with all he at present wished for and losing no time in thought of what might happen to interrupt his happiness  but while he battened in the sunshine of his pleasures storms of vexation were gathering over his head which when he least expected such a shock poured all their force upon him  the first time his uncle happened to see his father he fell on the topic of the necessity there was for young gentlemen born to estates and educated in a liberal manner to be enabled to keep his equals company adding that if the parsimony of a parent denied them an allowance agreeable to their rank it might either drive them to ill courses or force them to associate themselves only with mean lowbred people among whom they might lose all the politeness had been inculcated into them the father of natura well knowing he had nothing to answer for on this account never suspected this discourse was directed to him in particular and joined in his brotherinlaws opinion heartily blaming those parents who by being too sparing to their children destroyed all natural affection in them and gave them some sort of an excuse for wishing for their deathhe thanked god he was not of that disposition and then told him what he allowed per quarter to natura with which added he i believe he is intirely satisfied the other replying that indeed he thought it more than sufficient the conversation dropped but what sentiments he now began to conceive of his nephew it is easy to conceive the father however thought no farther of this till soon after the scrivener came to wait on himhe was a perfect honest man and had lent natura the money meerly to prevent his applying to some other person who possibly might have taken advantage of his thoughtlessness so far as even to have brought on his utter ruin too many such examples daily happening in the world to deter him also from going on in this course he demanded that exorbitant interest for his money abovementioned which notwithstanding as he assured his father in relating to him the whole transaction he was far from any intention to make him pay  never was astonishment greater than that in which the father of natura was now involvedthe discourse of his brotherinlaw now came fresh into his mind and he recollected some words which tho he did not observe at the time they were spoken now convinced him had a meaning which he could not have imagined there was any room forhe had no sooner parted from the scrivener than he flew to that gentleman and having related to him what had passed between him and the scrivener conjured him if he could give him any farther lights into the affair not to keep him in ignorance on which the other thought it his duty to conceal nothing either of the complaints or request had been made him by his nephewafter some exclamations on the extravagance and thoughtlessness of youth the afflicted father went in search of more discoveries which he found it but too easy to make among the tradesmen all of whom he found had been unpaid for some time  it would be needless to go about to make any description of the confusion of mind he was inhe shut himself in his closet uncertain for some time how he should proceed at last as he considered there was not a possibility of reclaiming his son from whatever vice had led him thus all at once into such extravagancies without first knowing what kind of vice it was he resolved to talk to him and penetrate if possible into the source of this evil  accordingly the next morning he went into the chamber where natura was yet in bed and began to entertain him in the manner he had proposed to himselffirst he let him know that he was not unacquainted with every step he had taken for raising a sum which he could not conceive he had any occasion for as well as his having withheld the money he had given him to discharge his tradesmens billsthen proceeded to set before his eyes the folly and danger of having hid at his years any secrets from a parent concluding with telling him he had yet a heart capable or forgiving what was past provided he would behave in a different manner for the future  what natura felt at finding so much of what he had done revealed to his father was greatly alleviated by perceiving that the main thing his engagement with harriot was a secret to himhe did not fail to make large promises of being a better oeconomist nor to express the most dutiful gratitude for the pardon the good old gentleman so readily offered but this he told him was not sufficient to deserve a reestablishment in his favour he must also give him a faithful account by what company and for what purposes he had been induced to such ill husbandry for added he without a sincere confession of the motives of our past transactions there can be little assurances of future amendment  natura to this only answered that it was impossible to recount the particulars of his expences and made so many evasions on his fathers still continuing to press his being more explicit that he easily perceived there would be no coming at the truth by gentle means and therefore throwing off at once a tenderness so ineffectual he assumed all the authority of an offended parent and told the trembling natura that since he knew not how to behave as a son he should cease to be a father in every thing but in his authoritybe assured said be i shall take sure measures to prevent you from bringing either ruin or disgrace upon a family of which you are the first profligatethis chamber must be your prison till i have considered in what fashion i shall dispose of you  with these words he flung out of the room locking the door after him so that when natura rose as he immediately did he found himself indeed under confinement which seemed so shameful a thing to him that he was ready to tear himself in piecesit was not the grief of having offended so good a father but the disgrace of the punishment inflicted on him which gave him the most poignant anguish and far from feeling any true contrition he was all rage and madness which having no means to vent in words discovered itself in sullennesswhen the servant to whom he intrusted the key came in to bring him food he refused to eat and could scarce restrain himself from throwing in the mans face what he had brought  it is certain that while under this circumstance he was agitated at once by every different unruly passionpride anger spleen thinking himself a man at finding the treatment of a boy made him almost hate the person from whom he received itthe apprehensions what farther meaning might be couched in the menace with which his father left him threw him sometimes into a terror little different from convulsivebut above all his impatience for seeing his dear harriot and the surprize the grief and perhaps the resentment he imagined she must feel on his absenting himself drove him into a kind of despair  in fine unable to sustain the violence of his agitations on the third night regardless of what consequences might ensue from giving this additional cause of displeasure to his father he found means to push back the lock of his chamber and flew down stairs and out at the streetdoor with so much speed that it would have been impossible to have stopped him had any one heard him which none happened to do it being midnight and all the family in a sound sleep  that he went directly to the lodgings of harriot i believe my reader will make no doubt but perhaps her character does not yet enough appear to give any suspicion of the reception he found there  in effect she was no other than one of those common creatures who procure a miserable subsistance by the prostitution of their charms and as nature had not been sparing to her on that score and she was yet young though less so than she appeared thro art she wanted not a number of gallants who all contributed more or less to her living in the manner she did several of these had happened to come when natura was with her but she having had the precaution to acquaint them with her design of drawing in this young spark for a husband they took the cue she gave them each passing before him either for a cousin or one of the lawyers employed in her pretended suit  it was with one of these equally happy tho less deluded rivals of natura that finding he did not come she had agreed to pass this night and her maid as the servants of such women for the most part imitate their mistresses happened to be at the door either about to introduce or let out a lover of her ownthe sight of a man at that time of night with one who belonged to his beloved immediately fired natura with jealousyhe seized the fellow by the collar and in a voice hoarse with rage asked him what business he had there to which the other replied only with a blow on the face the wench shrieked out but natura was either stronger or more nimble than his competitor he presently tripped up his heels and ran up stairsharriot and her lover hearing somewhat of a scuffle the latter started out of bed and opened the chamberdoor in order to listen what had occasioned it just as natura had reached the staircaseif his soul was inflamed before what must it now have been to see a man in his shirt and just risen from the arms of harriot who still lay trembling in bedhe flew upon him like an incensed lion but the other being more robust soon disengaged himself and snatching his sword which lay on a table near the door was going to put an end to the life of his disturber when harriot cried out hold holdfor heavens sakeit is my husbandnatura having no weapon wherewith he might defend himself or hurt his adversary revenge gave way to selfpreservation and only saying husband noi will die rather than be the husband of so vile a woman run down with the same precipitation he had come up  impossible it is to describe the condition of his mind when got into the streethis once violent affection was now converted into the extremest hatred and contempthe detested not only harriot and the whole sex but even himself for having been made the dupe of so unworthy a creature and could have tore out his own heart for having joined with her in deceiving himhaving wandered about some time giving a loose to his fury the considerations of what he should do at last took their turnhome he could not go the servant who used to admit him knew nothing of his being out and he durst not alarm the family by knocking at the door having passed by several times and found all fast  in this perplexity as he went through a street he had not been used to frequent he saw a door open and a great light in a kind of hall with servants attendinghe asked one of them to whom it belonged and was told it was a gaminghouse on which he went in not with any desire of playing but to pass away some time finding a great deal of company there he notwithstanding engaged himself at one of the tables and tho he was not in a humour which would permit him to exert much skill he won considerably  the company did not break up till five in the morning and he then growing drowsy and yet unable to find any excuse to make to his father he could not think of seeing his face so went to a bagnio to take that repose he had sufficient need of the fatigues of his mind having never suffered him to enjoy any sound sleep since his fathers discovery of the extravagance he had been guilty of  on his awaking the transaction of the preceding night returned to his remembrance with all its galling circumstances and the more he reflected on his disobedience to his father the less he could endure the thoughts of coming into his presencein fine that shame which so often prevents people from doing amiss was now the motive which restrained him from doing what he ought to have donehad he immediately gone home thrown himself at his fathers feet and confessed the truth his youthful errors had doubtless merited forgiveness but this though he knew it was both his duty and his interest he could not prevail on himself to do and to avoid the rebukes he was sensible were due to his transgressions he resolved to hide himself as long as he could from the faces of all those who had a right to make them  in fine he led the life of a perfect vagabond sculking from one place to another and keeping company with none but gamesters rakes and sharpers falling into all manner of dissolution and whenever his reason remonstrated any thing to him on these vicious courses he would then to banish remorse for one fault fly to others yet worse and more destructive  it is true he often looked back upon his former behaviour and was struck with horror at comparing it with the presentthe reflection too how much his motherinlaw might take advantage of the just displeasure of his father against him to prejudice him in his future fortune even to cause him to be disinherited sometimes most cruelly alarmed him yet not all this nor the wants he was plunged in on an ill run at play which was the sole means by which he subsisted were sufficient to bring him to do that which he now even wished to do tired with the conversation of those profligates and secretly shocked at the scenes of libertinism he was a daily witness of  his thoughts thus divided and perplexed he at length fell into a kind of despair and not caring what became of himself he resolved to enter on board some ship and never see england again unless fortune should do more than he had reason to hope for in his favour     chap vi    shews the great force of natural affection and the good effects it   has over a grateful mind   if children could be sensible of parental tenderness or knew what racking cares attend every misdoing of an offending offspring the heart of natura would have been so much touched with what his father endured on his account as to have enabled him to have got the better of that guilty shame which alone hindered him from submitting to him but conscious of deferring only the severest reproofs he could not flatter himself there was a hope of ever being reinstated in that affection he had once possessed and was too proud to content himself with less  that afflicted parent being informed of his sons flight spared no cost or pains to find out the place of his retreat but all his enquiries were in vain and he was wholly in the dark till it came into his head to search a little escritore which stood in his chamber and of which he had taken away the key on breaking it open he found the counterpart of his contract with harriot and by that discovery was no longer at a loss for the motives which had obliged his son to raise money not doubting but the woman was either extremely indigent or a jilt but to think the heir of his estate had been so weak as to enter into so solemn and irretrievable an engagement with a person of either of these characters gave him an inexpressible disquiet all his endeavours were now bent on finding her out not in the least questioning but his son was with her the task was pretty difficult the contract discovering no more of her than her name and the parish in which she lived yet did the emissaries he employed at last surmount it they brought him word not only of the exact place where she lodged but also of her character as they learned it from the neighbours they heard also that a young gentleman whose description answered that of natura had been often seen with her and that she had given out she was married to him  the father having received this information consulted with his brotherinlaw what course was to be taken and both being of opinion that should any enquiry be made concerning natura it would only oblige them to quit their lodgings and fly to some place where perhaps it would be more difficult to trace them it was agreed to get a lord chief justices warrant and search her lodgings without giving any previous alarm  this was no sooner resolved than put in execution the father and uncle attended by proper officers burst into the house and examined carefully every part of it but not finding him they sought and perfectly perswaded harriot could give intelligence of him they threatened her severely and here she displayed herself in her proper coloursnothing ever behaved with greater impudenceshe told them that she knew nothing of the fool they wanted but if she could find him would make him know what the obligations between them exacted from him in fine it was easy for them to perceive there was nothing satisfactory to be obtained from her and they departed with akeing hearts but left not the street without securing to their interest a person in the neighbourhood who promised to keep a continual eye upon her door and if they ever saw the young gentleman go in to send them immediate notice  it is needless to acquaint the reader how fruitless this precaution was natura was far from any inclination ever more to enter that detested house and in that desponding humour already mentioned had certainly left the kingdom and compleated his utter undoing if providence had not averted his design by the most unexpected means  he was at wapping in the company of some persons who used the sea in order to get into some ship he cared not in what station when a young man clerk to an eminent merchant of his fathers acquaintance happened to come in to enquire after the master of a vessel by whom some goods belonging to his master were to be shipped he had often seen natura and though much altered by his late way of living knew him to be the person whom he had heard so great a search had been made after he took no notice of him however as he found the other bent earnestly in discourse did not observe him but privately informed himself of all he could relating to his business there and as soon as he came home acquainted his master with the discovery he had made who did not fail to let his father know it directly  it is hard to say whether joy at hearing of his son or grief at hearing he was in so miserable a condition was most predominant in him but the first emotions of both being a little moderated the consideration of what was to be done took placethe clerk having found out that he was lodged in an obscure house at that place in order to get on board the first ship that sailed the father would needs go himself and the merchant offering to accompany him in their little journey a plan of proceeding was formed between them which was executed in the following manner  they went together into a tavern and sent to the house the clerk had directed under pretence that hearing a young man was there who had an inclination for the sea a master of a ship would be glad to treat with him on that affairnatura happily for him not having yet an opportunity of engaging himself obeyed the summons and followed the messengerhis father withdrew into another room but so near as to hear what passed and there was only the merchant to receive him but the sight of one he so little expected in that place and whom he knew was so intimate in their family threw him into a most terrible consternation he started back and had certainly quitted the house if the merchant aware of his intention had not catched hold of him and getting between him and the door compelled him to sit down while he talked to him  he began with asking what had induced him to think of leaving england in the manner he was going to doreminded him of the estate to which he was born the family from which he was descended and the education which he had received and then set before his eyes the tenderness with which his father had used him the grief to which he had exposed him and above all the madness of his present intentionsnatura knew all this as well as he that remonstrated to him but as he had not been capable of listening to his own reflections on that head all that was said had not the least effect upon him and the merchant could get no other answer from him than that as things had happened he had no other course to take  the truth was that as he could not imagine by what means the merchant was apprized of his design he thought his father was also not ignorant of it and as he did not vouchsafe either to come in person or send any message to him from himself and perhaps was even ignorant that the merchant had any intention of reclaiming him he looked upon it as a confirmation of his having intirely thrown off all care of him and in this supposition he became more resolute than ever in his mind to go where he never might be heard of more  what though said the merchant you have been guilty of some youthful extravagancies i am perfectly assured there requires no more than your submitting to intreat forgiveness to receive come continued he i will undertake to be your mediator and dare answer i shall prevailno sir replied natura i am conscious of having offended beyond all possibility of a pardonnor can i ever bear to see my father again  the merchant laboured all he could to overcome this mingled pride and shame which he perceived was the only obstacle to his return to duty but to no purpose natura continued obstinate and inflexible till his father having no longer patience to keep himself concealed rushed into the room and looking on his son with a countenance which in spite of all the severity he had endeavoured to assume betrayed only tenderness and griefso young man said he you think it then my place to seek a reconciliation and are perhaps too stubborn to accept forgiveness even though i should condescend to offer it  natura was so thunderstruck at the appearance of his father and the manner in which he accosted him that he was far from being able to speak one word but threw himself at his feet with a look which testified nothing but confusion that action however denoting that he had not altogether forgot himself melted the fathers heart he raised him and forcing him to sit down in a chair close by him well natura said he you have been disobedient to an excess i wish it were possible for your distresses to have given you a remorse in proportioni am still a father if you can be a sonhe would have proceeded but was not ablethe meagre aspect dejected air and wretched appearance of a son so dear to him threw him into a condition which destroyed all the power of maintaining that reserve which he thought necessary to his character  natura on the other hand was so overcome with the unhopedfor gentleness of his behaviour that he burst into a flood of tearsfilial gratitude and love joined with the thoughts of what he had done to deserve a far different treatment so overwhelmed his heart that he could express himself no other way than by falling on his knees a second time and embracing the legs of his father with a transport i know not whether to say of grief or joy continued in that posture for a considerable time overwhelmed at once with shame with gratitude and loveat length gaining the power of utteranceo sir cried he how unworthy am i of your goodnessbut then recollecting as it were somewhat more yet sure pursued he it is not possible you can forgive me alli have been guilty of worse than perhaps you yet have been informed ofi am a wretch who have devoted myself to infamy and destruction and you cannot nay ought not to forgive me  the father was indeed very much alarmed at this expression as fearing it imported his distresses had drove him to be guilty of some crime of which the law takes cognizancei hope said he your having signed a contract with an abandoned prostitute is the worst action of your life  it is impossible to describe the pleasure with which natura found his father was apprized of this affair without being obliged to relate it himself as he was now determined to have doneall his obduracy being now intirely vanquished and converted into the most tender affectionate and dutiful submission  can there be a worse replied he renewing his embraces and can you know it and yet vouchsafe to look on me as your sonif your penitence be sincere said the good old gentleman i neither can nor ought refuse to pardon allbut rise continued he and freely give this worthy friend and myself the satisfaction we requirea full confession of all your misbehaviour is the only attonement you can make and that i can expect from youremember i have signed your pardon for all that is past but shall not include in it any future acts of disobedience among which dissimulation evasion or concealment in what i demand to be laid open i shall look upon as of the worst and most incorrigible kind  he needed not have laid so strong an injunction on the now truly contrite naturahe disguised nothing of what he had done even to the mean arts of gaming to which he had been obliged to have recourse after his voluntary banishment from all his friends and then painted the horrors he conceived at the things he daily saw and the despair which had induced him to leave england in such lively colours that not only his father but the merchant were affected by it even to the letting fall some tears  but not to be too tedious in this part of my narration never was there a more perfect reconciliationthe father till now knew not how much he loved his son nor the son before felt half that dutiful affection and esteem for his father  it now remained to conclude how the forgiven youth was to be disposedthere were two reasons which rendered it imprudent for him to go home first on the score of his motherinlaw who being better informed than her husband could have wished of the errors of his son he feared would have behaved to him in a fashion which he easily foresaw would be attended with many inconveniences even perhaps to the driving him back into his late vicious courses and secondly on that of the contract which it would be more difficult to get harriot to relinquish if natura were known to be reestablished in his fathers favour than if concealed and supposed still in disgrace with himthe generous merchant made an offer of an apartment in his house but natura who had not seen his sister of a long time proposed a visit to her as thinking the society of that dear and prudent relation would not only console but establish him in virtue  the father listened to both and after some little deliberation told his son that he approved of his going to his sister for a month or two or three at his own option but said he it is not fit a young man like you should bury yourself for any long time in the countryyou are now of a right age to travel and i would have you enlarge your understanding by the sight of foreign manners and customsi would therefore have you make a short visit to my daughter after which accept of my friends invitation and in the mean time i shall prepare things proper for your making the tour of europe under a governor who may keep you in due limits  had natura never offended his father the utmost he could have wished from his indulgence was a proposal of this kindhe was in a perfect extasy and knew not how sufficiently to express his gratitude and satisfaction on talking however more particularly on the affair it was agreed he should go first to the merchants in order to be new cloathed and recover some part of those good looks his late dissolute way of life had so much impaired  every thing being settled so much to the advantage of natura even a few hours made some alteration in his countenance so greatly does the ease of the mind contribute to the welfare of the bodyhe parted not till night from this indulgent parent when he went home with the merchant and had the next day tradesmen of all kinds sent for who had orders to provide in their several ways every thing necessary for a young gentleman born to the estate he wasas youth is little regardless of futurity he forgot for a time what consequences might possibly attend his contract with harriot and was as perfectly at ease as if no such thing had ever happened when fully equipped he went down into that country where his sister lived and if the least thought of his former transactions remained in him they were now intirely dissipated by the kind reception he there met with and the entertainments made for him by the neighbouring gentry  but his heart being bent on his travels and receiving a letter from his father wherein he acquainted him that all things were ready for his departure he took leave of the country after a stay of about nine weeks and returned to the merchants where his father soon came to see him and told him he had provided a governor for him who had served several of the sons of the nobility in that capacity and was perfectly acquainted with the languages and manners of the countries through which they were to pass  this tender parent moreover acquainted him that having consulted the lawyers on the score of that unhappy obligation he had laid himself under to harriot and finding they had given it as their assured opinion that it was drawn up in the most binding and authentic manner he had offered that creature a hundred guineas to give up her claim but she had obstinately rejected his proposal and seemed determined to compel him to the performance of his contract or in case he married any other woman to prosecute him for the moiety of whatever portion he should receive with her  the mention of this woman who had given natura so much disquiet and who indeed had been the primary cause of all his follies and misfortunes together with the thoughts of what future inconveniencies she might involve him in both on the account of his fortune and reputation made him relapse into his former agitations and afterwards rendered him extremely pensive and he could not forbear crying out that he would chuse rather to abandon england for ever and pass the whole remainder of his days in foreign climates than yield to become the prey any way of so wicked so infamous a wretch whom said he i shall never think on without hating myself for having ever loved  the goodnatured merchant as well as his father perceiving these reflections began to take too much root in him joined in endeavouring to alleviate the asperity of them by telling him that it was their opinion as indeed it seemed highly probable that when he was once gone she would be more easily prevailed upon especially as the reconciliation between him and his father was to be kept an inviolable secret the old gentleman also added in order to make him easy that how exorbitant soever she might be in her demands and whatever it should cost though it were the half of his estate he would rid him of the contract which second proof of paternal affection renewed in natura as well it might fresh sentiments of love joy and duty and the same promise being again and again reiterated he soon resumed his former chearfulness and thought of nothing but the new scenes he was going to pass through  in fine not many days elapsed before he departed with his governor and one footman who had been an antient servant in the familyas their first route was to france they went in the dover stage and thence embarked for calais without any thing material happening except it were that on sight of the ocean natura was fired with a devout rhapsody at the thoughts of finding himself upon it in a manner so vastly different from that in which but a few months since his despair had led him to project and the resolution he made within himself never to be guilty of any thing hereafter which should occasion a blush on his own face or incur the displeasure of a father to whom he looked upon himself as much more indebted for the forgiveness he had received than for being the author of his existence  so great an effect has mercy and benevolence over a heart not hardened by a long practice of vice how far natura persevered in these good intentions we shall hereafter see but the very ability of forming them shews that there is a native gratitude and generosity in the human mind which in spite of the prevalence of unruly passions will at sometimes shine forth even in the most thoughtless and inconsiderate       book the second     chap i    the inconsideration and instability of youth when unrestrained by   authority is here exemplified in an odd adventure natura embarked   in with two nuns after the death of his governor   novelty has charms for persons of all ages but more especially in youth when manhood is unripened by maturity when all the passions are afloat and reason not sufficiently established in her throne by experience and reflection the mind is fluctuating easily carried down the stream of every different inclination that invites and seldom or never has a constant bent  from seventeen or eighteen to one or two and twenty i look upon to be that season of life in which all the errors we commit will admit of most excuse because we are then at an age to think ourselves men without the power of acting as becomes reasonable men it was in the midst of this dangerous time that natura set out in order to make the tour of europe and his governor dying soon after their arrival in paris our young traveller was left to himself and at liberty to pursue whatever he had a fancy for  the death of this gentleman was in effect a very great misfortune to natura but as at his time of life we are all too apt to be impatient under any restraint tho never so mild and reasonable he did not consider it in that light and therefore less lamented his loss than his good nature would have made him do had he been the companion of his travels in any other station than that of governor the very name of which implied a right of direction over his behaviour and a power delegated by his father of circumscribing every thing he did i believe whoever looks back upon himself at that age will be convinced by the retrospect that there was nothing wonderful in naturas imagining he had now discretion enough to regulate his conduct without being under the controul of any person whatever and could not for that reason be much afflicted at being eased of a subordination not at all agreeable to his humour and which he thought he had not the least occasion for  the baron d eyrac had often invited him to pass some days with him at a fine villa he had about some ten leagues from paris but his governor not having approved that visit he had hitherto declined ithe now however took it into his head to go and as the distance was so short went on horseback attended by his footman with a portmanteau containing some linnen and cloaths his intention being to remain there while the baron stayed which as he was informed would be three weeks or a monthit being then the season for hunting and that part of the country well suited for the diversion  he had been on a party of pleasure a considerable way on this road before so thought he had no occasion for a guide and that he should easily be directed to the house but it so happened that being got about twenty miles from paris he missed his route and took one the direct contrary and which at last brought him to the entrance of a very thick woodthere was not the least appearance of any human creature nor the habitation of one and he was beginning to consult with his servant whether to go back or proceed till they should arrive at some town or village for refreshment when all at once there fell the most terrible shower of hail and rain accompanied with thunder that ever was heardthis determined them to go into the wood for shelterthe storm continued till night and it was then so dark that they could distinguish nothingthey wandered however leading their horses in their hands for it was impossible to ride hoping to find some path by which they might extricate themselves out of that horrid labyrinth  some hours were passed in this perplexed situation and natura expected no better than to remain there till morning when he heard a voice at a little distance cry who goes there never had any music been half so pleasing to the ears of natura friends replied he and travellers that have lost their way on this the person who had spoke drew nearer and asked whither they were bent natura told him to the villa of the baron d eyrac the baron d eyrac said the other he lives twelve miles on the other side the wood and that is five miles overhe then asked if there were no town near to which he could direct themno replied the other but there is a little village where is one inn and that is above half a league offyou will never find your way to it but if you will pay me i will guide you natura wished no more and having agreed with him for his hire followed where he led  nothing that was ever called an inn had so much the shew of wretchedness nor could it be expected otherwise for being far from any great road it was frequented only by shepherds and others the meanest sort of peasants who worked in the adjacent grounds or tended the cattle  in this miserable place was natura obliged to take up his lodginghe lay down indeed on the ragged dirty mattress but durst not take off his cloaths so noisome was every thing about himfatigued as he was he could not close his eyes till towards day but had not slept above two hours before the peasant who had served him as a guide and had also stayed at the inn came into his room and waked him abruptly telling him the lady abbess desired to speak with himnatura was much vexed at this disturbance and not sufficiently awaked to recollect himself only cried peevishly what have i to do with abbesses and then turned to sleep again  on his second waking his footman acquainted him that a priest waited to see himnatura then remembered what the peasant had said but could not conceive what business these holy people had with him he went down however immediately and was saluted by a reverend gentleman who told him that the lady abbess of a neighbouring monastery whose almoner he was hearing from one of her shepherds the distress he had been in had sent to intreat he would come and refresh himself with what her convent afforded  natura was now ashamed of having been so rough with the peasant but well atoned for it by the handsome apology he now made after which he told the almoner that he would receive the abbesss commands as soon as he was in a condition to be seen by herthis was what good manners exacted from him tho in truth he had no inclination for a visit in which he proposed so little satisfaction  he then made his servant open the portmanteau and give him such things as were proper to equip him for this visit and while he was dressing was informed by his host that this abbess was a woman of quality very rich and owned the village they were in and several others which brought her in more rent  if the vanity so natural to a young heart made natura on this information pleased and proud of the consideration such a lady had for him while unknown how much more cause had he to be so when being shewn by the same peasant into the monastery he was brought into a parlour magnificently furnished and no sooner had sat down than a very beautiful woman whom he soon found was the lady abbess appeared behind the grate and welcomed him with the most elegant compliments  he had never been in a monastery before and had a notion that all the nuns especially the abbesses were illnatured old women he was therefore so much surprized at the sight of this lady that he had scarce power to return the politeness she treated him withher age exceeded not twentyfour she was fair to an excess had fineturned features and an air which her ecclesiastic habit could not deprive of its freedom but the enchanting manner of her conversation her wit and the gaiety that accompanied all she said so much astonished and transported him that he cried out without knowing that he did so good godis it possible a monastery can contain such charmsshe affected to treat the admiration he expressed as no other than meer bagatelle but how serious a satisfaction she took in it a very little time discovered  a monastery said she is not so frightful a solitude as you being a stranger to the manners of this country have perhaps painted to yourselfi have companions in whom i believe you will find some agreementsshe then rung a bell and ordered an attending nun or what they call a laysister to call some of the sisterhood whose names she mentioned and presently came two nuns with a third lady in a different habit the least handsome of these might have passed for a beauty but she that was the most so i shall call elgidia she was sister to the abbess but wanted a good many of her years and being intended for a monastic life by their parents had been sent there as a pensioner till she should be prevailed upon to take the veil  the abbess having learned from natura that he was from england told them in a few words what she knew of him and the motive of the invitation she had made him then desired they would entertain him till her return having some affair which called her thence for a small time  as elgidia appeared by her dress to be more a woman of this world than her companions he directed his discourse chiefly to her but whether it were that she had less gaiety in her temper or that she was that moment taken up with some very serious thought natura could not be certain but he found her much less communicative than either of those whose profession seemed to exact greater reserve  as natura spoke french perfectly well and delivered all he said with a great deal of ease they were very much pleased with his conversation and yet more so when at the return of the abbess that wit and spirit they before found in him seemed to have gained an additional vigour  the truth is the first sight of this beautiful abbess had very much struck him and a certain prepossession in her favour had rendered him not so quicksighted as he might otherwise have been to the charms of her sisternot that he was absolutely in love with her nor entertained the least wish in prejudice to the sanctity of her order it was rather an admiration he was possessed with on her account which the surprize at finding her person and manner so widely different from what he had expected contributed very much to excite in him  the breakfast which consisted of chocolate tea coffee rich cakes and sweetmeats was served upon the turnabout but the abbess told him that their monastery had greater privileges than any other in france for they were not restrained from entertaining their kindred and friends tho of a different sex within the grate as you shall experience said she with the most obliging air if you will favour us with your company at dinner  nothing could be more pleasing to natura than this invitation and it cannot therefore be supposed he hesitated much to comply with it however as the hour of their devotion drew nigh and forms must be observed he was desired to take a tour round about the village till twelve at which time they told him dinner would be on the table  he was still in so much amazement at what he had seen and heard that he was not sorry at having an opportunity of being alone to reflect on all had passed but the deeper he entered into thought the more strange it still seemed to him till happening accidentally to fall into some discourse with a gentleman in the village he was told by him that the nunnery they were in sight of was called le convent de riche dames that none but women of condition entered themselves into it and that they enjoyed liberties little different from those that live in the worldit is true said this person the gay manner in which they behave has drawn many reflections on their order yet i know not but they may be equally innocent with those of the most rigid  this was enough to shew natura that the civilities he received were only such as any stranger who appeared of some rank might be treated with as well as himself and served to abate that little vanity which without this information might have gained ground in his heart at least it did so for the present what reasons he founds afterwards for the indulging it the reader will anon be enabled to judge  he was not however without a good deal of impatience for the hour appointed for his return which being arrived the portress admitted him into a fine room behind the grate where he found the abbess elgidia the two nuns he had seen in the morning and another which it seems were all the abbess thought proper should be present  the table was elegantly served and the richness of the wines helped very much to exhilerate the spirits of the companyelgidia alone spoke little tho what she said was greatly to the purpose and discovered that it was not for want either of sentiment or words she retained so great a taciturnitynatura saying somewhat that shewed he took notice how singular she was in this point the abbess replied that her sister did not like a convent that the comedy the opera and ball had more charms for her than devotion on which natura made some feint attempts to justify a goûte for those public diversions but was silenced by the abbess who maintained the only true felicities of life were religion and friendship what then do you make of love madam cried he briskly love the first command of heaven and the support of this great universelove which gives a relish to every other joy andhe was going on but the abbess interrupted him holdhold said she this is not a discourse fit for these sacred precinctsbut these words were uttered in a sound and accompanied with a look which wholly took away their austerity and it was easy for natura to perceive by the manner in which they were spoke as well as by a sigh which escaped elgidia at the same time that neither of these ladies were in reality enemies to the passion he was defending  some little time after dinner was over natura was about to take his leave but the abbess told him that she had formed a design to punish him for pretending to espouse the cause of love and that is said she by detaining you in a place where you must never speak nor hear a word in favour of itwe have continued she a little apartment adjoining to the monastery tho not in it which serves to accommodate such friends as visit us and are too far from home to return the same dayyou must not refuse to pass at least one night in it and i dare promise you that you will not find yourself worse lodged than the preceding oneyour servant may also lie in the same house and i will send your horses to a neighbouring farmer who will take care of them  the manner in which this request was urged had somewhat in it too obliging for natura to have denied in good manners even if his inclinations had been opposite but indeed he was too much charmed with the conversation of the lovely abbess and her fair associates to be desirous of quitting ithe not only stayed that night but also on their continuing to ask it many succeeding oneshe lay in the apartment abovementioned breakfasted dined and supped in the convent as if a pensioner in the place always in the same company and ambitious of no other  the gallantries with which he treated the abbess were as tender as innocence would permit nor did he presume to harbour any views of being happier with her than he was at present  but see the strange caprice of love it was not through a coldness of constitution nor any confederations of her quality and function which rendered him so content with enjoying no more of her than her conversation nor that hindered him from taking advantage of many advances she made him whenever they were alone of becoming more particular but it was the progress elgidia every day made in his esteemthe more he saw that beautiful young lady the more he thought her charming and every time she spoke discovered to him a new fund of wit and sweetness of dispositionit was not in her power to erase the first impression her sister had made on him but it was to stop the admiration he had for her from growing up into a passionwhenever he saw either of them alone he thought her most amiable he was with and when they were together he was divided between both  for upwards of a month did he continue in the same place and in the same situation of mind but then either the abbesss own good sense or the advice of some friend remonstrating to her that so long a stay of a young gentleman who was known to be not of her kindred might occasion discourses to her disreputation and that of the monastery in general she took the opportunity one day when he was making an offer of going as he frequently did to speak to him in this manner  i know not how said she to part with you and i flatter myself you think of going rather because you imagine your tarrying here for any length of time might be inconvenient for us than because you are tired of the reception you have found here  ah madam cried he be assured i could live for ever hereand that i only grieve that such a hope is impossibleif what you now say is sincere answered she you may at least prolong the happiness we at present enjoybut i shall put you to the proof continued she looking on him with eyes in which the most eager passion was visibly paintedto hush the tongue of censure you shall remove to a town about seven miles distant where there are many good houses in one of which you may lodge under pretence of liking the air of this country and visit us as other of our friends do as frequently as you please without endangering any remarks even though you should stay with us three or four nights at a time  natura was so ravished at this proposal and the kind almost fond manner in which it was made that he catched hold of her hand and kissed it with a vehemence not conformable to a platonic affectionshe seemed however far from being offended at his boldness which had perhaps proceeded to greater lengths had not elgidia at that instant come into the roomthe abbess was a little disconcerted but to conceal it as well as she could sister said she i have made our guest the proposal i mentioned to you this morning and leave you to second it with these words she withdrew  elgidia appeared in little less confusion than her sister had done but natura was in infinitely more than either of themthe sudden sight of her who possessed at least half of his affections just in the moment he was in a kind of rapture with another struck him like the ghost of a departed mistress and tho he had never made any declaration of love either to the one or the other yet his heart reproached him with a secret perfidy and he durst scarce lift his eyes to her face when with a timid voice he at last said madam may i hope you take any interest in what your sister has been speaking ofyou may be sure i do replied she in all that concerns the abbess as to my farther sentiments on your staying or going they can be of no consequence to youhow madam resumed he by this time a little reassured of no consequence you know nothing of my heart if you know it not incapable of forming the least wish but to please you  he said many other tender and gallant things to her in order to engage her to add her commands to those of the abbess but either the belief that he was wholly devoted to that lady or the natural reserve of her temper would suffer her to let him draw no more from her than that she should share in the happiness her sister proposed to herself in his continuing so near them  but tho elgidia could command her words she could not have so much power over her eyes as to keep them from betraying a tenderness not inferior to that of her sister and natura had the satisfaction of finding he was beloved by both these amiable women without thinking himself so far attached to either as not to be able to break off whenever he pleased  but to what end tended all this gallantry to what purpose was all this waste of time in an amour which either had no aim in view or if it had must be such a one as must turn to the confusion of the persons concerned in itthese indeed are questions any one might naturally ask but could not have been resolved by natura who took a pleasure in prosecuting the adventure and neither examined what he proposed by it himself or considered what consequences might ensue and herein he but acted as most others do of his age who rarely give themselves the pains of consulting what may or will be when pleased with what is  he went to the place the abbess had directed but imagined he should be very much at a loss for amusement being wholly a stranger to every body he would doubtless have been so had his retreat been in any other country than france but as it is the peculiar characteristic of that nation to entertain at first sight with the same freedom and communicativeness of a long acquaintance he soon found himself neither without company nor diversionwhether he had an inclination to hunt or dance or play he always met with persons ready to join in the party so that the intervals he passed there between his visits to the monastery seemed not at all tedious to him  the ladies however were far from being forgotten by him ten days had not elapsed before he returned to renew or rather to improve the impression he had both given and receivedthe abbess appeared all life and spirit at his return but elgidia was more melancholly than when he left her but it was a melancholly which had in it somewhat of a soft languor which was very engaging to natura especially as he had reason to believe by several looks and expressions which in some unguarded moments fell from her that he had the greatest interest in it  the oftener he saw her the more he was confirmed in this conjecture but as he could not be assured of it never treated her in a manner which should give her room to guess what his thoughts were for fear of meeting with a rebuff which would have been too mortifying to his vanitybut as the belief of being beloved by her rendered her insensibly more dear to him the regards he paid her and the sighs which frequently issued from his breast when he approached her did not escape the notice of the quicksighted abbess and disdaining a competitorship in a heart she thought she had wholly engrossed resolved to be more plain than hitherto she had been in order to bring him to declare himself  with this view she led him one day into the garden and being seated in a close arbour where there was no danger of being overheardnatura said she i doubt not but you may perceive by the civilities i have treated you with that you are not indifferent to me but as you cannot be sensible to how great a degree my regard for you extends it remains that i confess to you there is but one thing wanting to compleat the intire conquest of my heart and that is continued she fixing her eyes intently on his face that you will cease for the future to pay those extraordinary assiduities to elgidia you have lately done  how much soever natura was transported at the beginning of this discourse the closure of it gave him an inexpressible shock insomuch that he was wholly unable to make any reply to testify the sense he had of the obligation she conferred on him i see said she the too great influence my sister has over you leaves me no room to hope any thing from youi did not think the sacrifice i exacted from you so great that the purchase of my heart would not have atoned for it but since i find it is otherwise i repent i put you to the trial  in speaking these words she rose up and flew out of the arbour the confusion natura was in prevented him from endeavouring to detain her and before he could resolve with himself how to behave in so critical a conjuncture she was out of sightwhatever tenderness he had for the other he could not bear the thoughts of having offended this lady the confession she had just made him seemed to deserve all his gratitude and tho the price she demanded for her heart was too excessive for him to comply with yet he resolved to make his peace with her the first time he found her alone on the best terms he could  this was an opportunity however not so easily attained as he had imaginedthe abbess conceived so much spite at the little inclination he had testified to comply with her demand that she kept one or other of the nuns with her the whole remainder of that day and he could only tell her by his eyes how desirous he was of coming to an eclaircisement  but as if this was a day destined to produce nothing but extraordinary events perceiving the abbess industriously avoided speaking to him he had retired into the parlour to ruminate on the affair when elgidia came in to him and with somewhat more gaiety than she was accustomed to cried what alone natura but i suppose you attend my sister and i will not be any interruption and then turned to go out of the room all the discontent he was in for the displeasure he found he had given the abbess could not keep him from getting between her and the doori have no other way to convince you of the injustice of your suspicion said he than to detain you here tho perhaps added he looking on her with an unfeigned tenderness while i am clearing myself in one article it may not be in my power to prevent betraying my guilt in another which it may be you will find yet less worthy of forgiveness  i know not replied she with a smile too enchanting to be resisted that i ever gave you any tokens of a rigid disposition and besides i am inclined to have so good an opinion of you that i look on your giving me any cause of offence as one of the things out of your power  emboldened by these words suppose madam returned he i should confess to you that i was indulging the most passionate tenderness for the beautiful elgidiathat her sweet idea is always present with me and that i sometimes am presuming enough to cherish the hopes of not being hated by hertell me continued he what punishment does this criminal deserve  to be treated in the same manner answered she blushing if he is sincere and to be made know that he cannot have formed any designs upon the heart of elgidia which elgidia has not equally harboured upon that of naturaa declaration so unexpected might very well transport a young man even beyond himself and all considerations whateverforgetful of the respect due to her quality and virtue and regardless of the place they were in he seized her in his arms and almost smothered her with kisses before she could disengage herself at length breaking from him it is not by such testimonies as these said she that i expected you should repay the acknowledgment i have made but by a full laying open your bosom as to what passes in it in regard to my sisteri know very well she loves you and am apt to believe she has not been more discreet than myself in concealing it from you but am altogether at a loss as to the returns you may have made her passion  natura now really loving her hesitated not to do as she desired neither making any secret of the admiration which the abbess had raised in him at first sight nor the discourse she had lately entertained him with and the injunction she had laid upon him elgidia took this as so great a proof of his affection that she made no scruple to ratify the confession she had made him by all the endearments that innocence would permitafter which they consulted together how he should behave to the abbess whose temper being violent it was not proper to drive to extremes and it was therefore agreed between them that he should continue to treat her with a shew of tenderness elgidia even proposed that he should renounce her in case the other continue to insist upon it but natura could not consent his insincerity should go so far  they parted mutually content with each other and natura himself believed his inclinations were now fixed by the assurance elgidia had given him of the most true and perfect passion that ever was but how little do we know of our own hearts at his years the next time he saw the abbess alone he relapsed into the same fluctuating state as before and found too much charms in the kindness she expressed for him to be able to withdraw himself intirely from her  that lady who loved to an excess could not be any long time without affording him the means of reconciliation and the next morning as soon as breakfast was over descended alone into the garden giving him a look at the same time which commanded him to followhe did so and perceiving she took her way to the same arbour they had been in before he went in soon after her affecting rather than feeling a timidity in approaching her well natura said she have you yet examined your heart sufficiently to know whether the full possession of mine can atone for your breaking with my sisterto which he replied that as he had no engagements with elgidia nor had ever any other thoughts of her than such as were excited by that respect due to her sex and rank he was wholly ignorant in what manner it was exacted from him to behavebut added he if vowing that from the first moment i beheld your charms i became absolutely devoted to you may deserve any part of that affection you are pleased to flatter me with i am ready to give you all the assurances in the power of words  this asseveration could not be called altogether false because he had really a latent inclination in him towards her which all the tenderness he had for elgidia could not eradicate and this it was that gave all he said such an air of sincerity as won upon the abbess to believe her jealousy had misinterpreted the looks she had sometimes seen him give her sister and at length made her desist from reproaching him on that score  the tranquility of her mind being restored she gave a loose to the violence of her passion in such caresses as might well make the person who received them forgetful of all other obligationsin these transporting moments the lovely abbess had his whole soulhe now unasked abjured not only elgidia but all the sex beside and even wondered at himself for having ever entertained a wish beyond the happiness he enjoyed at present  the abbess was too well versed in the affairs of love not to be highly satisfied with the proofs he gave of his than which it is certain nothing for the time could be more sincere or ardent death was it to them both to put an end to this inchanting scene but as they were seen to go into the garden soon after one another and too long a stay together might occasion a suspicion of the cause they were obliged to separate though not without a promise of meeting in the same place at night after the nuns were all retired to their respective chambers  the abbess passed through a backway into the chapel it being near the time of prayers and natura returned by the great walk into the outward cloister where elgidia seeing him at a distance and alone waited his coming to know of him how he had proceeded with her sisternatura yet full of the abbess and the favours he had received from her would have gladly dispenced with this interview but she was too near before he perceived her for him to draw back with decency  far from suspecting any change in him and judging of his integrity by her own i was impatient said she to hear the event of your conversation with the abbess tell me therefore in a few words for the bell rings to chapel whether you have succeeded so far as to stifle all jealousies of me yes madam replied he recovering himself as well as he could from his confusion we may be easy for the future as to that particulari long for the particulars of your discourse resumed she but cannot now stay to be informed meet me in the garden after the sisterhood are in bed this continued she putting a key into his hand will admit you by the gate that leads to the roaddo not fail to be there at ninethe haste she was in to be gone would not have permitted him time to make any answer if he had been provided with one and he could only just kiss her hand as she turned from him  but what was the dilemma he was now involved in the hour and place she appointed were the very same in which he was to meet the abbess impossible was it for him to gratify both and not very easy to deceive eitherhe went back into the garden ruminating what course he should take in so intricate an affair at first he thought of writing a little billet and slipping it into elgidias hand acquainting her that the abbess had commanded him to attend her in the garden at the time she mentioned and telling her that he thought it necessary to obey to prevent all future suspicionbut he rejected this design not only as that young lady might possibly have the curiosity to conceal herself behind the arbour and would then be a witness of things it was no way proper she should be informed of but also because his heart reproached him for having already done more than he could answer and forbad him to deceive her any farther in fine that he might be guilty of perfidy to neither he resolved to quit both at least for that night but knew not yet on what he should determine for the future  divine service being over he repaired to the parlour where after they were sat down to dinner he said addressing himself to the abbess that having sent his servant that morning to his lodgings he had received letters of the utmost importance which required immediate answers and that he must be obliged for that reason to take his leave though with what regret added he it is easy to perceive by the long stay i always make here  the abbess insisted upon it that he should not gotold him he might write what he pleased there without interruption and that his man might carry his dispatches to the post but all she urged could not prevail and both that lady and her sister had the mortification to hear him give orders that his own horse should be got ready with all expedition as for his servant he was left behind for a few hours on the account of packing up some things he had brought him in the design of staying a longer time  in fine he went away with a promise of returning in a short time the abbess was inwardly fretted at the disappointment but imagined it was only occasioned by the motive he pretended till a young nun who was her confidante in all things and had happened to cross the cloyster when natura and elgidia were talking together before prayers and had seen him kiss her hand informed her of this passage and added of her own conjecture that the abrupt departure of natura was owing to somewhat that lady had said to himthere needed no more to inflame the passionate and jealous abbess she doubted not of being betrayed and flew directly to her sisters chamber accused her of being guilty of the most criminal intercourse with a stranger and threatened if she did not confess the whole truth to her and swear never to see him more she would send an account of her behaviour to their parents who would not fail to thrust her into a less commodious convent and compel her to take the veil directly  the mild and timid disposition of elgidia could not sustain this shock she immediately fainted away and help being called to bring her to herself in opening her bosom a paper fell out of it which the abbess snatching up ran to her chamber to examine and found it contained these words    to prevent my dear angel from being surprized at my sudden   departure know that it is to avoid the abbess who obliged me to   give her a promise of meeting her this night in the gardenat my   next visit you shall be informed at full of all that passed   between us in the morning adieu                                                               natura  as natura had no opportunity to make an excuse to elgidia he had slipt this billet into her hand on taking leave and though no more was meant by it than to make her easy till his return there was sufficient in the expression not only to convince the abbess that her sister was indeed her rival but also to make her think herself had been the dupe to their amourimpossible would it be to describe the force of those passions which in this dreadful instant overwhelmed her soul so i shall only say it was as great as woman could sustain and which the impatience of venting on their proper object put it into her head to go to him in a disguise and upbraid his perfidy as she seldom listened to any dictates but those of her passion this design was no sooner formed than preparations were made for the execution nor could all her confidante urged on the danger and scandal of the attempt deter her from it  there was a fellow who was frequently employed about the monastery in whom she could confidehim she sent to a farmer with orders to hire three horses one for herself another for her confidante who in spite of all her apprehensions on that account she would needs make accompany her and the third for the man who was to attend them as a valet the little road they had to travel this fellow was directed to bring the horses about ten oclock at night at which time it would be dark to the corner of a wall at the farther end of the garden when she and her companion were to mount and away on this wild expedition  but while the abbess was busy on her project elgidia had also another though of somewhat a less desperate kind her sisters temper gave her but too much reason to believe she would revenge herself on her by all the ways in her power and trembling at the thoughts of being exposed to her parents and the censure of the world as the other had threatened which she knew no way to avoid but by natura making up this quarrel and tho she knew it could only be done by his renouncing all pretensions to herself yet she rather chose to lose the man she loved than her reputation as she knew not whether the abbess would delay the gratification of her malice any longer than the next morning she resolved to send for natura that same night in order to engage him to a second reconciliation with her sister let the terms be never so cruel to herself  she had no sooner laid this plot than she ran to see if the servant he had left behind was yet gone and finding he was not bad him wait a little that she might send a letter by him to his master the contents of her epistle were as follow    something has happened which lays me under a necessity of   speaking to you this nightthe only consolation i have under the   severest of all afflictions is that i did not take back the key   i gave you in the morning i beg you will make use of it and let   me find you in the close arbour as soon as the darkness will   permit your entrance unobservedfail not if you have any regard   for the honour the peace and even the life of the unfortunate                                                              elgidia  natura had no sooner received this billet from the hands of his servant than all his tenderness for the fair authoress of it revived in him which joined to his impatient curiosity for the knowledge of the accident she mentioned easily determined him to do as she desired  he set out at the close of day but the moon rising immediately after shone so extremely bright as proved her no less than the sun an enemy to the design he was at present engaged in he was therefore obliged to wait till that planet had withdrawn her light before he durst approach the convent  the abbess and her companion having dressed themselves in riding habits went at the abovementioned hour to the gate where they expected the man and horses were attending their coming but there was not the least appearance of anythe abbess emboldened by her impatience and despair would needs venture out some paces beyond the gate to listen if she could hear any sound of what she wanted but had not long continued in that posture before she discovered by the twinkling light of the stars two men on horseback galloping directly to the place where she stoodimpossible was it for her to discern what sort of persons they were but easy to know as there were two men and no more than two horses that they were not those she looked for on which she ran with all the haste she could back into the garden and clapping the gate after her in her fright stopped not till she was almost at the entrance of the cloysterboth she and her companion were out of breath but when they had a little recovered it the latter took the liberty of railying her on the terror she had been in at the sight of two persons who were doubtless only pursuing their own affairs without any thought or notice of themthe abbess acknowledged the pleasantry was just and returned again to the gate which having opened they found two horses tied to a tree at a little distance from it without any person to look after them she imagined they belonged to the farmer but could not guess wherefore there was not a third or how it happened that the man was not with themthe two ladyadventurers waited in hopes of seeing their attendant with another horse till the abbess fearing the night would be too far spent for the execution of her design and grown quite wild with rage and vexation resolved to go without a guide and accordingly she and the young nun that was with her mounted the horses they found there and rode away  little did this distracted woman imagine to whom she was indebted for the means of conveying herself where she wished to be for in effect these horses were naturas and it was no other than himself attended by his man who had put her into that fright which occasioned her running so far back into the garden as gave him time to enter without being either seen or heard by herhe was no sooner within the gate than his servant tied the horses to a tree as has been related and retired to a more convenient place either to lye down to sleep or on some other occasionthus did an accident which had like to have broken all elgidias measures turn wholly to the advantage of them and she found as much satisfaction as a person in her situation could possibly take in finding natura so punctual to the summons she had sent  it was with a flood of tears she related to him all that had passed between the furious abbess and herself after his departure and concluded her discourse with beseeching him to see her in the morning and omit nothing that might pacify her even said she to forswear ever speaking to me more  natura was touched to the very soul at the grief he saw her in and equally with the tender consideration she had for him and now more devoted to her than ever would have done any thing to prove the sincerity of his passion but that which she demanded of himit was in vain she urged the impossibility of keeping a correspondence together under the same roof with a rival who had all the power in her own hands or that she represented how much better it would be for both to break off so dangerous an intercourse of themselves before the rage of the abbess should put her upon doing it in a manner which might involve them all in destructionall the arguments she made use of only served to render him more amorous and consequently less able to part with herthe difference he found between these two sisters the outrageous temper of the one compared with the prudence sweetness and gentleness of the other rendered the comparison almost odious to him and as he could not but acknowledge the impractibility of maintaining a conversation with the latter without the participation of the former nor though he should even consent to divide himself between them would either of them be content he told elgidia that the only way to solve these difficulties was for her to fly from the monastery and be the partner of his fortune as she was the mistress of his heart  such a proposition made her startto abandon all her friends and put herself wholly in the power of a stranger of whose fortune family or fidelity she could not be assured gave her very just alarms but whatever was her reluctance at the first mention of such an enterprize the extreme passion she had for him rendered all her apprehensions by degrees less formidablehe told her he had no other wishes than such as were dictated by honourthat he would marry her as soon as they should arrive at a place where the ceremony could be performed with safetythat he was heir to a considerable estate after his fathers death that on his return to england he should have a handsome settlement out of it and that his present allowance was sufficient to keep them above wantpeople easily believe what they wish especially from the mouth of a beloved personnatura indeed had uttered no untruths as to his circumstances but as to the main point his marrying her it is impossible to judge whether in that he was sincere because he knew not himself whether he was so tho in the vehemence of his present inclinations he might imagine he did so and at that time really meant as he said  be that as it may elgidia suffered herself to be won by his perswasions and being so the present opportunity was not to be losthe had horses at the gate could conduct her he said where she might be concealed till they got quite out of the reach of her kindred and failed not to remonstrate that if she delayed but even till the next morning not only the jealousy of the abbess but a thousand other accidents might separate them for ever  as the lovers past their time in this manner the distracted abbess was prosecuting her journey in quest of him she had left behind as the way she had to go was so short there was no great danger of any mischief attending it neither did any happen but how great was her confusion when arriving at the house where natura lodged she was told he went out in the evening on the receipt of a billet brought him by his servantthis disappointment destroyed all the remains of temperance had been left in her she presently guessed the billet came from no other than elgidia doubted not but they were together and figured in her mind a scene of tenderness between them so cruel to her imagination that frenzy itself scarce exceeded what she enduredshe rode back with even more precipitation than she had set out and being alighted at the gate thro the great walk supposing elgidia had brought him into her chamber where if she found them thought of nothing but sacrificing one or both of them to her resentment  in this situation of mind it cannot be imagined she had any thought about the horses but her companion having more the power of reflection and judging them to be the farmers thought it best to tye them to a tree within the garden that so they might be secured and sent to him in the morning which having done and shut the gate she was going to follow the abbess when she met her coming backi have considered said she that my perfidious sister would rather chuse the close arbour for her rendezvous than her own chamber where there would be more danger of being overheard by the nuns who lie near hergo you therefore continued she and wait me in my apartment while i search the garden  the nun obeyed glad to be eased of this nocturnal attendance and the abbess drew near as softly as she could to the arbour and standing behind the covert of the greens of which it was composed heard the consent elgidia gave to accompany natura and saw her quit him with a promise of returning as soon as she had put on a habit somewhat more proper for travelling  had she followed the first dictates of her passion in this stabbing circumstance she had either pursued her sister and inflicted on her all that vindictive malice could suggest or run into the arbour and discharged some part of her fury on naturaeach alike shared her resentment but divided between both lost its effects on eithera revenge more pleasing and less unbecoming of a female mind at length got the better of those furious resolvesshe thought that as every thing favoured such a design and she was equipped for the purpose to take the place of her sister would afford her an exquisite triumph over the disappointment she should occasion them accordingly after staying long enough to encourage the deception she came round the arbour and entered at the passage by which elgidia had gone outnatura not doubting but it was his beloved took her in his arms saying how transporting is the expedition you have made in your return and indeed we had need of it for the night is far exhausted and it is necessary you should be out of this part of the country before daybreak  the abbess answered not to what he said but gave him her hand on which he led her towards the gate entertaining her with the most endearing expressions as they walked to all which she was still dumb natura was not surprized at it as imagining she was too much engrossed by the thoughts of what she was about to do to be able to speakbut how great was his mortification when having opened the gate he found his servant who having missed the horses was just come back from a fruitless search of themhe drew his sword and had not the fellow stept nimbly aside had certainly killed himwhile he was venting his passion in the severest terms the abbess shut the gate upon him and locked it with her own key which leaving in the lock the one he had made use of could now be of no servicea caprice he had so little reason to expect in elgidia might very well surprize him especially at a time when both had so much cause to be more gravehe called to her he complained he even reproached the unkindness and illmanners of this treatment while the abbess indulged on the other side the most spiteful pleasure in his vexation  she left him railing at fate and womankind without convincing him of his error when as she was going to the monastery she met elgidia just coming out and directing her steps towards the arbourthey were in the same path and facing each otherelgidia full of the fears which usually attend actions of the nature she was about to do no sooner perceived the form of a woman and habited in the same manner as herself than she took it for a spirit and terrified almost to death cried out a ghost a ghost and ran shrieking with all her force to the cloyster resolved as much as it then was in her power to resolve on any thing to desist from her enterpriseshe made no stop till she got into her chamber where she threw herself on the bed in a condition not to be described  the abbess was so well satisfied with the success of this last stratagem that it greatly abated the thoughts of taking any further revengeshe went laughing to her confidante and told her the whole story who congratulated her upon it and said that in her opinion she might take it as a peculiar providence of heaven that had disappointed her first design which could only have increased her confusion and probably brought a lasting scandal on the order the abbess wanted not reason when her passion would permit her to exert it and could not help confessing the truth of what the other remonstratedshe now easily saw they were naturas horses they had made use of but how it came to pass that those she had bespoke or the man she had ordered to bring them happened to fail remained a point yet to be discussedthe morning however cleared it upthe fellow acquainted her that the farmer had no horses at home and that as he was coming to let her know it he saw two men at the gate one of whom entered so that he imagined she had provided herself elsewhereshe then bad him turn out naturas horses which the nun having said how she had disposed of them not thinking herself obliged to take any care of what belonged to a man who had treated her with so much ingratitude  natura was all this time in the utmost perplexity not only at the usage he imagined had been given him by elgidia but also for the loss of his horses and at being told when he came home that two women in riding habits well mounted but without any attendants had been to enquire for himall these things the meaning of any one of which he was not able to fathom so filled his head that he could not take any reposepretty early in the morning a letter was brought him from elgidia which he hastily opened but found nothing in it but what served to heighten his amazement and discontent  she told him that she could not dispense with letting him know the occasion of her breach of promise that intending nothing more than to perform it she was hastening to the arbour when in the middle of the garden she was met by an apparition which as near as she could discern had the resemblance of herselfthat the terror she was in had obliged her to retire and that as she could look on what she had seen as no other than a warning from heaven she had determined to use her utmost endeavours for extinguishing a passion obnoxious to its will to which end she desired he would make no farther attempts to engage her to an act so contrary to her duty or even ever to see her more  natura had so little notion of spirits and ghosts that at first he took this story only as a pretence to cover a levity he had not suspected her to be guilty of but when he reflected on the silence of the person he had taken for her and the description of those who had been to enquire for him he began to imagine as he had not the least thought of the abbess that something supernatural had indeed walked the garden that night and had also been at his own lodgings in order to perplex him morea thousand little tales he had been told in his infancy concerning the tricks played on mortals by those shadowy beings now came fresh into his mind and as the belief of what elgidia had wrote gained ground in him was not far from being of her opinion that it was a warning from providence and to repent of having attempted to snatch from the altar a woman devoted to it  it is doubtless accidents such as this that have given rise to so many stories of apparitions as have been propagated in the world and had not natura been afterwards informed of the whole truth it is likely he would have been as great a defender of these ideas as any who are accounted superstitiousbut however that might have been it wrought so strongly on his mind at present that joined with the considerations of those perpetual perplexities which must infallibly attend an ecclesiastical intrigue besides those which the abbess would involve him in made him resolve to obey elgidias commands and pursue the matter no farther but go directly to the baron d eyracs who he heard was still at his countryhouse  the loss of his horses however very much vexed him he bought them because he preferred that way of travelling to a postchaise they had cost him forty louis dores in paris and knew not whether the country he was in would afford him any so fit for his purposehe was just sending his man to enquire where others were to be had when his own were at the door without the least damage done either to themselves or saddlesthe farmer who had the care of them while he was at the monastery found them wandering in the field and easily knowing to whom they belonged brought them home  this was some consolation to him for the loss of his mistresses and he began to resolve seriously on his departure but thinking it would be the highest ungenerosity to quit the convent without acknowledging the favours he had received there he wrote a letter to the abbess full of gratitude and civility telling her that tho the necessity of his affairs required he should take an eternal leave of that place he should always preserve the memory of those honours he had received in itto elgidia he wrote in much the same strain she had done to him and concluded with desiring her to believe it was to heaven alone he could resign her those letters he sent by his man and ordered him to leave them with the portress to avoid any answers which might have drawn him into a longer correspondence than he desired or perhaps even have occasioned a revival of those inclinations in him which he was now convinced of the folly and danger of  this was the first proof he gave of a firmness of resolution and was indeed as great a one as could have been expected from a man of the age he wasit must be owned that at that time love is the strongest passion of the soul and as neither elgidia nor the abbess wanted charms to inspire it and he had been but too sensible of the force of both to be able i say to tear himself away in the manner he now did was a piece of heroism which i with every one in the like circumstance may have power to imitate  he hired another horse and guide that he might not lose his way a second time and departed the same day for the barons where he was received by that young nobleman with the utmost kindness as well as politeness and found so much in his conversation and those who came to visit him and the continual amusements of that place as made him soon forget all he had partook in the monasteryhe remained there while the baron stayed and then came with him to paris  on his return he frequented the same company and pursued the same pleasures he had done before but as nothing extraordinary befel him i shall not enter into particulars my design being only to relate such adventures as gave an opportunity for the passions to exert themselves in influencing the conduct of his life     chap ii    the pleasures of travelling described and the improvement a   sensible mind may receive from it with some hints to the   censorious not to be too severe on errors the circumstances of   which they are ignorant of occasioned by a remarkable instance of   an involuntary slip of nature   of all the countries natura intended to see italy was that of which he had entertained the most favourable ideahis curiosity led him to convince himself whether it really deserved to be intitled the garden of the world and therefore it was thither he resolved to make his next progressbeing told that in so long a journey he would find an excessive expence as well as incommodity in travelling on horseback by reason he must be obliged to hire a guide from one place to another he sold his horses and after having hired a postchaise took leave of his acquaintance and of a place where he had enjoyed all the pleasures agreeable to a youthful taste  he went by the way of burgundy and passing through dijon proceeded to lyons where the sight of the ruins of some roman palaces yet remaining there the fine churches and beautiful prospect that city affords being situated at the confluence of the rivers rhone and soane tempted him to stay some dayshe was one evening sitting with his landlord in the innyard when a postchaise came in out of which alighted a gentleman and a lady just by the place where they werethe man got up with all the obsequiousness of persons of his calling to bid them welcome and shew them into a roomthe lady in passing looked earnestly at natura and his eyes were no less attached on her he thought he saw in her face features he was perfectly acquainted with but could not at that instant recollect where he had been so not so with her she easily remembered him and in less than half an hour he received an invitation by his name from these new guests to sup with them which he accepted of with great politeness but said at the same time he could not imagine to whom he was obliged for that honouron his coming into the room difference of habit said the lady smiling joined with the little probability there was of meeting me in this place may well disguise me from your knowledge but these impediments to remembrance are not on your account monsieur natura is the same in person at lyons as at the convent of riche dames though perhaps added she somewhat changed in mind there needed no more to make him know she was one of the two nuns who always dined when he was there with the abbess and was her particular confidanteby what miracle madam are you here cried he by such another answered she as might have brought elgidia here had not an unlucky spirit put other thoughts into her head  she then proceeded to inform him that loving and being equally beloved by the gentleman who was with her she had made her escape with him from the monastery and was going with him into one of the protestant cantons of switzerland of which he was a native and where they were certain of being safe from any prosecutions either from her kindred or the church  natura after having made his compliments to the gentleman on the occasion enquired of her concerning the abbess and elgidia on which she informed him of all the particulars related in the preceding chapter adding that after the receipt of the two letters he had sent the sisters came to a mutual understanding each confessed her foible to the other and the cause of their quarrel being for ever removed a sincere reconciliation between them ensued  as gratitude is natural to the soul and never is erased but by the worst passions that can obtrude upon the human mind natura had enough for these ladies to make him extremely glad no worse consequences had attended their acquaintance with him but was extremely merry as they were all indeed at the story of the supposed spiritthey passed the best part of the night together in very entertaining discourses and the next day the two lovers proceeded on their journey to switzerland as natura the following one did his to avignon  here again he halted for some time to feast his eyes and give subject for future contemplation on the magnificent buildings fine gardens churches and other curiosities which he was told of gave him a sample tho infinitely short of what he would find in romethe grandeur in which the nobility lived the elegance and politeness in the houses of even the lowest rank of gentry and the masquerades balls and other public diversions which every night afforded made him already see that neither the pleasures nor the delicacies of life were confined to paris  the desire of novelty is inherent to a youthful heart and nothing so much gratifies that passion as travellingvariety succeeds varietywhether you climb the craggy mountains or traverse the flowery valewhether thick woods set limits to the light or the wide common yields unbounded prospectwhether the ocean rolls in solemn state before you or gentle streams run purling by your side nature in all her different shapes delights each progressive day brings with it fresh matter to admire and every stage you come to presents at night customs and manners new and unknown before  the stupendous mountains of the alps after the plains and soft embowered recesses of avignon gave perhaps a no less grateful sensation to the mind of natura he wanted indeed such a companion as death had deprived him of in his good governor to instruct him how to improve contemplation and to moralize on the amazing and different objects he beheld yet as his thoughts were now wholly at liberty and his reason unclouded by any passions of what kind soever he did not fail to make reflections suitable to the different occasions  whoever has seen rome will acknowledge he must find sufficient there to exercise all his faculties but though the architecture and the paintings which ornament that august city might have engrossed his whole attention the many venerable reliques which were shewn him of old rome appeared yet more lovely in his eyes which shews the charms antiquity has for persons even of the most gay dispositions but this according to my opinion is greatly owing to the prejudice of education which forces us as it were to an admiration of the antients meerly because they are so and not that they are in any essential respect always deserving that vast preference given them over the modernsthis may be easily proved by the exorbitant prices some of our virtuosos give for pieces of old copper which are reckoned the most valuable as the inscriptions or figures on them are least legible  natura however was not so absorbed in his admiration of the ruined corner of a bath or the halfdemolished portico of an amphitheatre as to neglect those entertainments which more affect the senses and consequently give the most natural delightthe exquisite music performed at the churches carried him there much oftener than devotion would have done and rarely did he fail the opera at night  as the romans are allowed to be the best bred people upon earth especially to strangers be they of what country or perswasion soever neither the being an englishman or a protestant hindered him from making very good acquaintance and receiving the greatest civilities from them but the person to whom he was most obliged and who indeed had taken a particular fancy to him was the younger son of the family of caranna this nobleman knowing his taste for music would frequently take him with him to his box at the operahouse most persons of condition having little closets or boxes to themselves of which every one keeps his own key and none can be admitted but by itnothing can be more indulging as there are curtains to draw before them and the seats are made in such a manner that the person may lie down at his ease  the signior of caranna being otherwise engaged one night when a celebrated piece was to be performed he lent his key to natura unknowing that his wife who had also one had made a compliment of hers to a young lady of her acquaintance  natura by some accident being delayed from going till after the opera began on entering was surprized to find a very beautiful young person there stretched on the sophaas he had been told the box would be intirely empty he knew not whether he ought to retire or go forward and seat himself by herthis consideration kept him some minutes in the posture he was in and perceiving she was too much taken up with the music either to have heard him open the door or see him after he came in he had the opportunity of feasting his eyes with gazing on the thousand charms she was mistress of all which were displayed to a great advantage by the shadowy light which gleamed from the stage thro a thin crimson taffety curtain which she had drawn before her to the end she might neither be seen by others nor see any thing herself which might take off her attention from the music  in fine he drew near and had placed himself close by her before she observed him but no sooner did so than she started and appeared in some confusion he made a handsome apology for the intrusion which he assured her with a great deal of truth was wholly owing to chance and said he would withdraw if his presence would be any interruption to the pleasure she proposedshe seemed obliged to him for the offer but told him she would not abuse the proof he gave of his complaisance by accepting it on which he bowed and continued in his place  both the music and the words seemed intended to lull the soul into a forgetfulness of all beside and fill it only with soft ideasit had at least this effect upon the lady who had closed her eyes and was in reality lost to every other sense than that of hearingnatura either was or pretended to be equally transported and sunk insensibly upon her bosom without any opposition on her partshe had possibly even forgot she was not alone and when an air full of the most inchanting tenderness was singing was so much dissolved in extasy that crying out o god tis insupportable she threw her arms over naturas neck who was still in the same posture i just mentionedhe spoke not a word but was not so absorbed in the gratification of one faculty as to let slip the gratification of the othershe seized the lucky momenthe pressed her close and in this trance of thought this total absence of mind stole himself as it were into the possession of a bliss which the assiduity of whole years would perhaps never have been able to obtain  reason and thought at last returned she opened her eyes she knew to what the rapture she had been in had exposed her and was struck with the most poignant shame and horrorshe broke with all her force from that strict embrace in which he had continued to hold her and being withdrawn to the farther corner of the closetwhat have i done cried she what have i donethese words she repeated several times and accompanied them with tears wringing her hands and every testimony of remorseit was in vain for him to attempt to pacify her much less to prevail on her to suffer any second proofs of his tendernessshe would not even give him leave to touch her hand and on his offering it pushed him back saying no stranger you have taken the advantage of my insensibility but shall never triumph over my reason which enables me to hate youto fly from you for ever as from a serpent  natura said every thing that love and wit could inspire to reconcile her to what had past but she remained inflexible and only condescended to request him to leave the place before the opera was ended that they might not be seen coming out together and that he would tell signior carrana that having unexpectedly found a lady in the box he had withdrawn without enteringhe then begged she would entertain a more favourable opinion of an action which her beauty the bewitching softness of the entertainment and the place they were in had all concurred to make him guilty of but she would listen to nothing on that head insisted on his never taking the least notice of her wherever they might chance to meet and only told him that tho she was unalterably fixed in this resolution yet he might depend upon it she hated him less than she did herself  finding she was not to be moved he obeyed her commands and straight went out of the box more amazed at the oddness of the adventure than can be well expressed and yet more so when he afterwards heard she was the wife of a person of great condition was in the first month of her marriage with him and had the reputation of a woman of strict virtue  as this false step was meerly accidental wholly unpremeditated on either side and by what can be judged by the character of the lady and her behaviour afterwards was no more on her part than a surprize on the senses in which the mind was not consulted and had not the least share i know not whether it may not more justly be called a slip of unguarded nature than a real crime in her and as for natura though certainly the most guilty of the two whoever considers his youth his constitution and above all the greatness of the temptation which presented itself before him will allow that he must either have been more or less than man to have behaved otherwise than he did  let the most severely virtuous who happily have never fallen into the same error but figure to themselves the circumstances of this transgressing pair and well consider in what manner nature must operate when thus powerfully excited and if they are not rendered totally incapable of any soft sensations by an uncommon frigidity of constitution they will cease either to wonder at or too cruelly condemn the effects of so irresistible an impulse  were it not for the precepts of religion and morality the fears of scandal and shame of offending against law and custom man would undoubtedly think himself intitled to the same privileges which the brute creation in this point enjoy above him and it is not therefore strange that whenever reason nods as it sometimes will do even in those who are most careful to preserve themselves under its subjection that the senses ever craving ever impatient for gratification should readily snatch the opportunity of indulging themselves and which it is observable they ordinarily do to the greater excess by so much the longer and the more strictly they have been kept under restraint     chap iii    the uncertainty of human events displayed in many surprizing turns   of fortune which befel natura on his endeavouring to settle   himself in the world with some proofs of the necessity of   fortitude as it may happen that actions excited by the greatest   virtue may prove the source of evil both to ourselves and others   natura stayed but six months in rome and then passed on to florence where having seen all the curiosities that place afforded he only waited to receive some remittances from his father after which he intended to cross the appenines to bolognio then proceed to venice and so through the tirolose to vienna and flattered himself with having time enough to visit all the different courts which compose the mighty empire of germany  these remittances were delayed much longer than he had expected and when they arrived were accompanied by a positive command from his father to put an end to his travels and return to england with all the expedition he couldhis surprize at so unlooked for an order would have been equal to the mortification it gave him if he had not received a letter from his sister at the same time which informed him that his being so suddenly recalled was wholly owing to the misfortunes in which their family was at present involvedthat soon after his departure their father had discovered an intercourse between his wife and a person who pretended to be a relation no way to the honour of either of themthat frequent quarrels had at length separated themthat he was engaged in a lawsuit with her and also in several others with people to whom she in revenge as it was supposed had given bonds dated before marriage for very great sums of money pretended to have been borrowed of them by herthat tho the imposition was too gross not to be easily seen through yet the forms of the courts of judicature could not be dispensed with and the continual demands made upon him had laid him under such inconveniencies as obliged him even to lessen the number of his servants and retrench his tableshe added that he spoke of his dear natura with the utmost tenderness and was under a very great concern that the necessity of his affairs would not permit to send him any more such supplies as were requisite for the prosecution of his travels  natura at first felt a very great shock at this account but it is the peculiar blessing of youth not to be for any length of time affected with misfortunes his melancholly soon dissipated and he thought of nothing more than compliance with the command he had received and also to perform it in the cheapest manner he couldon speaking of his intentions of returning home he was advised to go to leghorn which being a very great port it would be no difficulty to find a ship bound for holland or england in which he might take his passage at an easy rate he had certainly taken this method but meeting with an english gentleman who was on his travels and had not yet been at rome was perswaded by him to go back on his offering to bear the whole expences of that route for the pleasure of his companyafter a stay of two or three months there they pursued their journey to paris where natura renewed all the former acquaintance he had therethe baron d eyrac with whom he had contracted an intimate friendship and from whom he concealed nothing of his affairs was extremely concerned to hear the occasion of his being recalled so much sooner than he had expected and made him an offer which suited very well with naturas inclination to accept it was this  that an old officer in the army having obtained leave to dispose of his commission natura should become the purchaser and to enable him to do so the baron would advance a sum of money to be returned at several easy payments as he received the profits arising from his troop  love and gallantry had already had their turns with natura ambition and the pride of being in an independent state began now to work in himas france was in alliance with england there was neither shame nor danger in entering into her servicebesides he considered that as his father was no longer in a condition to supply him with money abroad he could not expect any settlement to be made on him at home that would be answerable to his former expectationsand that by a captains pay joined to some assistance he might hope to receive sometimes from england he should be enabled to make a very good figure in the world till the misfortunes of his family should be retrieved and if they never were so he should at least have a provision for life in a country he was not weary of  he therefore made no hesitation of accepting this proof of the barons friendship who immediately went about making good his promise and what with his money and the great interest he had both with the court and army natura was dispensed with for not having been in the service before and in a very few days saw himself at the head of a troop of horse  his father to whom he wrote an account of the step he had taken with his motives for it was far from being offended at it tho he told him it added to his trouble to think his eldest son should be compelled by his having entered into a second marriage to have recourse to any avocation whatever for bread but concluded with telling him that in the severe necessity of their present circumstances he could not have pitched on any thing more agreeable to his inclinations or more honourable in itself  this letter served to compose all the disquiets natura had of disobliging a parent for whom he retained the most tender as well as dutiful regard ever since the kind forgiveness be received from him at wapping which shews the great effect of lenity over a mind where gratitude and generosity are not wholly extinguished which as i before observed they never are but by a long habitude of vice  he was now as happy as he had any need to wish to be enjoying all the pleasures of life in a reasonable way and rarely transgressing the bounds of moderation and when at any time through the prevalence of example or the force of his own passions he was hurried to some little excesses they were never such as could incur the censure of dishonourable or mean he was punctual to his payments with the baron and had the satisfaction of seeing himself intirely out of debt at three years end which manner of behaviour so endeared him to that gentleman that few friendships are to be found more sincere than that which subsisted between them  but as good sometimes arises out of evil so what is in itself a real happiness is not always without consequences altogether the reverse as it proved to natura who from the most contented situation all owing to the barons friendship was on a sudden by that very friendship thrown into one of the greatest trouble and danger  one morning as he was dressing the baron entered his chamber with a countenance which before he spoke denoted he had somewhat of importance to communicatenatura easily perceived it and to put him out of pain ordered his valet to leave the room on which the other immediately told him he was come to desire a proof of that sincere goodwill he had professed for himi should replied he be the most unworthy of mankind if i had not in reality much more than is in the power of words to express and not look on an opportunity given by you of testifying it equal to any favour you have bestowed on me  the baron was at present in too much agitation of spirit to answer this compliment as he would have done at another time and made haste to inform him that the countess d ermand who on some misunderstanding with her husband had been confined in a monastery for several months without any hopes of obtaining her release had found means to convey a letter to him earnestly requesting he would assist her in her escapeshe has acquainted me continued he with the plot she has laidthere is nothing impracticable in it but i cannot do what she desires without the help of some trusty friend and it is you alone i dare rely upon in a business which if not carefully concealed as well as resolutely acted may be of very ill consequence  natura did not greatly relish this piece of knighterrantry but as he thought he ought to refuse nothing to the baron hesitated not to assure him of the most ready compliance on which the other told him he must get two or three of his soldiers who disguised like peasants but well mounted and their swords concealed under their cloaths must attend the expedition and be at hand in case they should meet with any resistance which however he said he did not apprehend it being but ten small miles to the monastery the road but little frequented and the time agreed upon for the execution of the project twelve at night so there was no great danger of any interruption unless some unfortunate accident should happenthe lady continued he informs me she has observed the place where the portress constantly hangs up the key of the outer gate every night and when the nuns are gone into the chapel to their midnight devotions can easily slip outwe have only therefore to be there exactly at the time and be ready to receive her and as for the rest i have already provided a place where she may remain undiscovered till something can be done for her  the baron added many things concerning the ill treatment she had received but natura did not give himself any trouble to examine into the merits of the cause it was sufficient for him to do what he requested of him and that night being the same had been appointed by the lady for the business to be done he went immediately about preparing for it  accordingly he selected from out of his troop three who seemed most proper to be employed in such an enterprize and after having sworn them to secrecy in whatever they saw or should happen though without acquainting them with the main of the affair or mentioning the baron d eyrac told them in what manner they were to disguise themselves and ordered they should attend him at the fauxbourg a little after ten oclock the same night  rejoiced at an opportunity of obliging their officer especially as they doubted not of being well gratified each gave a thousand oaths instead of the one required of him to be both punctual and faithful in the discharge of the trust reposed in him  in fine all was conducted with a care and caution becoming of the gratitude and esteem natura had for the baron and as if he had himself approved of this undertaking which as i before observed he could not do in his heart  the two gentlemen muffled up in their cloaks and vizarded repaired to the fauxbourg at the appointed time where they found the soldiers on the post allotted for them by their officer on which they all rode off together and arrived before the walls of the monastery some few minutes before twelve at which hour precisely the gate was opened and a woman appeared at itto prevent the loss of time it had been concluded that the baron should not dismount but natura perform the office of an equerry in placing her behind him just as he had alighted and taken her in his arms in order to perform that office a great noise was heard and in an instant our adventurers found themselves surrounded by more than a dozen armed men who rushed upon them from the covert of a woodthe lady shrieked and ran back into the convent on naturas letting her go in order to draw his sword against these antagonists who seemed resolute either to kill or take him and his associates prisonersthe fight was obstinate on both sides tho the baron finding his design defeated had not entered into it at first but trusted to the goodness of his horse for his escape if his consideration for natura who being on foot must have been immediately seized had not prevented himat length however having received two or three wounds and convinced of the impossibility of maintaining their ground against such an inequality of numbers selfpreservation prevailed he broke thro those that encompassed him and setting spurs to his horse had the good fortune to avoid the mischief which he knew must inevitably befal those he left behind  the three troopers gallantly defended their captain for some time nor was he idle in making those who approached him too near feel the sharpness of his sword but not being able to get on horseback all his courage or that of his men could not prevent him and them from being made prisoners several of the conquering party being officers of justice they conducted them to paris where the soldiers were disposed of in the common goal but natura who was known was committed to the care of an exempt who treated him with the good manners his station demanded he had received a pretty deep wound in the shoulder and a surgeon was presently sent for but no artery nor sinew being touched no ill consequence was like to attend it  it may be imagined he passed the remainder of this night in a good deal of disquiet as having lived long enough in france to know that an attempt of the nature he had been engaged in would find little mercy from the lawa good part of the next day was passed before they carried him to the magistrate whose office it was to examine into such causes his adversaries not having prepared their accusation the heads of which were that he had attempted a rape upon a married woman of quality that he had contrived with other persons to take her out of the monastery and had come with an armed force for that purpose these articles having been deposed upon oath the magistrate told him his crime was of a double nature that he had violated both the civil and ecclesiastic laws but as his office extended no farther than the former he had only to demand of him what defence he had to make for himself in that part  natura had no other remedy than to deny all that was laid to his chargehe protested as he might truly do that he was so far from entertaining any criminal designs on any lady in that monastery that he did not so much as know the face of any one of them and pretended that being only riding out for the benefit of the air he found himself attacked by persons unknown with whom he confessed he had fought in his own defence  but this availed not at all to his justificationhis own soldiers who had been examined before himself had confessed that they were commanded by their officer to attend him on a certain enterprize in which they were to behave with secresy and resolution but said they did not know of what sort it was till they saw a woman come to the gate of the monastery whom their captain presently took in his arms but with what intent they could not pretend to say  a letter also was produced which madame d ermand had dropt and which had occasioned this discovery of the intrigue as it contained the whole method by which she was to be taken away and tho there was no name subscribed appearances were strong against natura as the author and tho he offered to bring many witnesses to prove it was a hand very different from what he wrote yet it served at least to prove that it was sent by some one person in the company and that if he were not the principal in this conspiracy yet being the agent and abettor as it was plain he was by his bringing his own soldiers he could not be judged less guilty  after a long examination he was remanded to the exempts house till the sitting of the judges which they told him would be in eight days in which interval he was allowed to prepare what defence he had to make and for that purpose advocates were allowed to come to him but no other person whatever not even his own servant and he received attendance from those belonging to the exempt who also fetched from his lodgings change of apparel and all such necessaries as he had occasion for care being taken to search every thing before it came to his hands in order to prevent any letters being conveyed to him that way  in this melancholly situation did he pass his time but that was little in regard to his apprehensions of the futureas his case stood there was little expectation of any thing less than a shameful death perhaps ushered in by tortures worse than even thathis advocates however and it is likely his accusers too were of opinion that he had been in reality no more than an agent in this business and therefore gave him to understand that if he laid open the whole truth and declared the name of the person chiefly concerned it would greatly mitigate the severity of the laws in such cases but this he would by no means be prevailed upon to do resolving rather to suffer every thing they could inflict upon him than be guilty of so mean and dishonourable an action as breach of trust even to a person indifferent but to a friend villainous in the most superlative degree alike unmoved by arguments as inflexible to menaces or perswasions he persisted in answering that he was ignorant of what they aimed atthat he knew nothing of madame d ermand himself was an intire stranger to her and equally so to the ill designs on her they mentioned either on his own account of that of any other person  he was neither so weak nor vain as to flatter himself his positiveness in denying what could be proved by so many witnesses would be of any service at his trial but as it was expected he should say something in his defence and could say nothing else without giving up his friend he was determined not to depart from what he had alledged at first  the count d ermand who possibly had a suspicion of the truth as it seems he long had entertained some jealous thoughts of the baron d eyrac who had taken all opportunities of testifying an uncommon gallantry to his wife would have given almost a limb to satiate his revenge against that gentlemanthe soldiers had been reexamined several times concerning that other person who was with them at the monastery and had made his escape but as they had neither seen his face nor heard his name it was impossible for them to make any discoveriesthese poor wretches were afterwards put to the torture but that had nor indeed could have any other effect than to make them curse their officer who had been the cause of their sufferings  in fine monsieur d ermand and the kindred of his wife joined with the instigations of the clergy who thought they had an equal right for revenge in this point prevailed so far upon the civil magistrates as to procure an order that natura should himself undergo the same tortures his soldiers had done thereby to extort that confession from him they could no otherwise procurethis notwithstanding they had the lenity to inform him of the day before that which was prefixed for the execution thinking perhaps that the menace of what he was condemned to endure would be sufficient but tho human nature could not but shrink under such apprehensions yet did his fortitude remain unshaken and he thought of nothing but how to arm himself so as to bear all should be inflicted on him with courage  but there were no more than a few hours in which he had to meditate on what he had to do when his affairs took a very different turn and by the most unthoughtof means imaginable it was towards the close of day when the wife of the exempt came into his chamber and having locked the door i am come captain said she to offer you life liberty and what is yet more to put it in your power to avoid those dreadful tortures which are preparing for youwhat would you do to gratify your preserverthe surprize natura was in did not hinder him from replying that there was nothing with which he would not purchase such a deliverance provided the terms were not inconsistent with his honourno resumed she i know by your behaviour since in custody and the resolution with which you have withstood all the temptations laid before you for the unravelling an affair you have it is the opinion of every one been led into only by your friendship to some person that you regard nothing so much as honour what i have to propose will be no breach of itbut continued she time is precious and opportunities of speaking to you are scarce therefore know in a few words that i am weary of my husbands ill usage desire nothing so much as to go where i may never see him more and if you will make me the companion of your flight and swear to take care of me till i shall otherwise dispose of myself i have disguises for both of us prepared and this night you shall be free  natura had little need to hesitate if he should accept this proposalhe saw there was at least a chance for escaping the dangers to which he was exposed and should the womans plot miscarry and he detected of being an accomplice in it his condition could not even then be worse than it was at present he therefore embraced her with a fervor which she seemed very well pleased with and assured her in the most solemn manner he would return all the obligations she conferred on him by such ways as should be most agreeable to her she then told him she had not slept for some time in the same bed with her husband and therefore might easily come to him again as soon as the family were gone to their respective apartments and having said this went out of the room hastily tho not without returning his salute and telling him he was worthy of greater risques than those she was about to run  he was no sooner left alone than he began to reflect on the capriciousness of his destiny which to preserve him from suffering for a crime he was innocent of was about to make him in reality guilty of one of the very same nature it is likely however he was not troubled with many scruples on this head or if any arose in his mind they were soon dissipated in the consideration of what he owed to his own safety which he yet could not greatly flatter himself with the hope of as he was not ignorant how difficult it was for a delinquent to elude the diligence of those sent in search of him the chance of such a thing notwithstanding was not to be neglected and he waited with an impatience adequate to the occasion for the hour in which he expected his deliverance  it was little more than eleven oclock when she came into the chamber in the habit of a country fellow which so intirely disguised her that till she spoke he took her for one of those who attend the prisoners in the circumstances he then was and imagined some accident had prevented the execution of her plot but he was soon convinced of his error by her speaking and at the same time presenting him with a coat wig and every thing proper to make him pass for such as she appeared herselfthe reader may suppose he wasted not much time in equipping himself or in making any idle compliments it was scarce midnight when they both got safely out of the house the door of which she shut softly after her  she then proposed to him to go to the fauxbourg whence they might without any suspicion as passing for poor countrymen get into the open road before daybreak but he would needs stop at the baron d eyracs judging with good reason that they might be more securely concealed in his house till the search should be over than to pretend to travel in any shape whatever she who knew not what obligations the baron had to be faithful to him in this point at first opposed it but he at length prevailed and they went boldly to the door the family not being all in bed it was immediately opened but in the dress they were found some difficulty to be admitted to the baron who the servant told them was asleep but natura with an admirable presence of mind replied that he had brought a letter from a friend in the country of the utmost importance and must be delivered into the barons own hands directly on which he was at last won to let them come into the hall while he sent to let his lord know  whether the baron had any suspicion of the truth or not is uncertain but he ordered the men should be brought up natura however thought it most proper to speak to him alone therefore left his companion belownever was surprize greater than that of this nobleman when the other discovered himself to him and the means by which he had been set free after the first demonstrations of joy and gratitude for the integrity he had shewn in resolving to endure every thing rather than betray the trust reposed in him it was judged necessary to send for his deliverer to whom on her coming up the baron made many compliments  on discoursing on what method was best for them to take in order to prevent discovery the baron would by no means suffer them to pursue that of endeavouring to quit france till the search would be made should be entirely over he told them he had a place where he could answer with his life for their concealment which indeed was that he had provided for the countess d ermand in case they had not been disappointed in their designsthere said he you may remain and be furnished with all things necessaryi can come frequently to you and inform you what passes and when you may depart with safety after we have contrived the means  the exempts wife as well as natura highly approved of this offer and the baron knowing any stay in his house might be dangerous both to himself and them presently dressed himself and went with them to the house he mentioned where having seen them safe lodged took his leave for that night but seldom let a day pass without seeing them  this was doubtless the only asylum which could have protected them from the strict search was made the next day the house of every person with whom either natura or the woman had the least acquaintance was carefully examined but this scrutiny was soon over in that part they supposed them to have left the city and officers were sent in pursuit of them every road they could be imagined to take so that had they fled they must unavoidably have been taken but not to be too tedious it was five weeks before the baron could think it safe for them to leave paris and then hearing their enemies had lost all hope of finding them and that the general opinion was that they were quite got off he told natura that he believed they now might venture to go taking proper precautions on taking leave he compelled natura to accept of bills to the value of his commission which as he said being lost meerly on his account it was his duty to reimbursenothing could be more tender than the parting of these two faithful friendsnecessity however must be obeyedthey separated after having settled every thing between them and mutually promised to keep a correspondence by letters  it was judged best and safest for them to keep still in the same disguise till they should be entirely out of the french dominions which happily at length they were without the least ill accident befalling them none suspecting them for other than they appeared though the search after them was very strict and a great reward offered for apprehending themas soon as they arrived at dover both threw off their borrowed shapes natura was again the fine gentleman and his companion a very agreeable woman who was so well satisfied with what she had done and the behaviour of natura towards her that she had lost nothing of her good looks by the fatigue of her journey  here they waited some time for the arrival of his servant who knew nothing what was become of his master since he had made his escape from the exempt till he was entirely out of the kingdom but had all this while been kept in good heart by the baron who still had told him he was safe and well and that he should soon hear news of him to his satisfaction this faithful domestic whom they had no pretensions to detain now came with all his baggage and natura returned to london in an equipage not at all inferior to that in which he had left it  the first thing he did was to place the exempts wife in a handsome lodging and then went to wait upon his father who had been much alarmed at not having received any letter from him for a much longer time than he had been accustomed to be silent the old gentleman was rejoiced to see him after an absence of near six years but sorry for the occasion as his affairs were greatly perplexed on account of the lawsuits before mentioned which being most of them in chancery were like to be spun out to a tedious length but natura soon informed him that he was in a condition which at present did not stand in need of any assistance from him and that he was determined to enter into some business for his future support  but in the midst of these determinations the remembrance of his unhappy contract with harriot came into his mind he thought he had reason to fear some interruption in his designs from the malice and wickedness of that woman but being loth to renew the memory of his former follies he forbore making any mention of it to his father till that tender parent not doubting but it would be a great satisfaction to him to know himself entirely freed from all claims of the nature she had pretended to have on him acquainted him that after he was sent away the first step he had taken was to get the contract out of her hands  the transported natura no sooner heard he had done so than he cried out by what means dear sir was she prevailed upon to relinquish a title by which she certainly hoped to make one day a very great advantage  indeed said the father i know not whether all the efforts i made for that purpose would have been effectual if fortune had not seconded my designshe withstood all the temptations i laid in her way rejected the sum i offered and only laughed at the menaces i made when i found she was not to be won by gentle means and i began to despair of success so much as to give over all attempts that way when i was told she was in custody of an officer of the compter on account of some debts she had contractedon this your uncle put it into my head to charge her with several actions in fictitious names so that being incapable of procuring bail and going to be carried to prison when i sent a person to her with an offer to discharge her from all her present incumbrances on condition she gave up the contract which i assured her at the same time she would not be the better for it being my intention you should settle abroad for life  this continued he in the exigence she then was she thought it best to accept of and i got clear of the matter with much less expence than i had expected her real debts not amounting to above half what i had once proposed to give her  natura was charmed to find himself delivered from all the scandal and other vexations with which he might otherwise have been persecuted his whole life long both by herself and the emissaries she had always at hand might have employed against him nor was he much less delighted to hear that she had also received some part of the punishment her crimes deserved in the disappointment of all her impudent and highraised expectations  having nothing now to disturb him in the prosecution of his purpose he set about it with the utmost diligence and as he had a considerable quantity of ready money by him to offer either by way of præmium or purchase there was not indeed any great danger of his continuing long without employment nor that so qualified he might not also be able to chuse out of many one which should be most agreeable to his inclinations  accordingly he in a little time hearing of a genteel post under the government that was to be disposed on he laid out part of his money in the purchase of it and with the remainder set up the exempts wife in a milliners shop in which being a woman of a gay polite behaviour she soon acquired great business especially as she pretended to have left france on the score of religion and went constantly every day to prayers after having formally renounced the errors of the church of rome natura visited her very often out of gratitude and perhaps some sparks of a more warm passion and they had many happy hours together which the talk of their past adventures contributed to heighten as afflictions once overcome serve to enhance present happiness  several matches were now proposed to natura but he rejected them all whether it were that he had not seen the face capable of fixing his heart or whether he was willing to wait the determination of his fathers affairs in order to marry to greater advantage it is hard to say tho probably the latter was the true reason for ambition now began to display itself in his bosom and by much got the better of those fond emotions which a few years past had engrossed him he now began to think that grandeur had charms beyond beauty though far from being insensible of that too he was not without other amours than that he still continued with the french woman the raising his fortune was however his principal view and for that purpose he neglected nothing tending to promote it he made his court to those of the great men who he knew could be serviceable to him with so much success that he had many promises of their interest for a better post as soon as opportunity presented  fortune for a while seemed inclined to favour him in a lavish manner his motherinlaw died and with her many of the vexatious suits dropped and others were compromised at an easy rate so that his father was soon in a condition to make a settlement upon him sufficient to qualify him for a seat in parliament which on the first vacancy thro favour he got into though at that time the house was not crowded with placemen as it since has been in fine he was beloved and caressed by persons of the highest rank and every one looked upon him as a man who in time would make a very considerable figure in the world  his friends remonstrating that as he was twentynine it was time for him to think of marriage and a proposal being made on that account with a young lady of an ancient and honourable family who besides a large fortune in her own hands had the reputation of every other requisite to render that state agreeable he hesitated not to embrace ithe made his addresses to her she accepted of them and in as short a time as could be expected consented to give him her handthe kindred on both sides were very well pleased and tho her family had some advantages in point of birth over his yet as he seemed in a fair way of doing honour to it there was not the least objection made but articles were drawn and a day appointed for the wedding  but how little dependance is to be placed on fortune how precarious are the smiles of that uncertain goddess when most secure of her promised favours and just upon the point as we imagine of receiving all we have to wish from her she often snatches away the expected good and showers upon us the worst of mischiefs treasured in her storehousesome few days before that which was to crown his hopes he happened in company to be discoursing of his travels and mentioning some things he had seen in france a gentleman who imagined he spoke too favourably of the chevalier st george and pretended he had also been there took upon him to contradict almost all he said concerning that place and person natura knowing himself in the right and being a little heated with wine maintained the truth of what he alledged with more impetuosity than policy perhaps would have suffered him to have done at another time and the other no less warmly opposing passion grew high on both sidesthe lie was given and returnedeach was no less quick with his sword than his repartee several passes were made but the company parted them and though they stayed together neither of them was reconciled nor in good humour for what was past  in going home natura and one gentleman kept together as their way happened to be the same when see the wild effects of partyrage all on a sudden the person who had been his antagonist and it seems had followed came up to them with his sword drawn and told natura he was a scoundrel and a fool for what he had said his words and the sight of his weapon made him put himself immediately in a posture of defence which indeed he had need of for had he been less nimble he had received the sword of the other in his body before the gentleman who was with him could do any thing to separate them nor were his efforts for that purpose sufficient to prevent them from engaging with a vehemence which permitted neither of making use of much skill it was however the chance of natura to give his adversary a wound which made him fall as he imagined dead on which the disinterested person made the best of his way as being afraid of being taken up by the watch who were then just coming bynatura did the same and thinking it improper to go home went to the house of a friend in whom he could confide and who on enquiry the next day brought him an account that the person with whom he had fought was dead but had lived long enough to acquaint those who took him up by whom he had received his hurt and that warrants were already out for apprehending the murderer as he was now called  what now was to be done natura found himself under the necessity of going directly out of the way and by that means endanger the loss of his employment and also of his intended bride or by staying expose himself to a shameful trial at the old bailey which he had reason to fear would not end in his favour the deceased having many friends and relations at the bar and the very person who had been witness of their combat somewhat akin to himit was therefore his own inclination as well as the advice of his friends that prevailed on him to make his escape into some foreign part while they were looking for him at home which he accordingly did that same hour taking post for harwich where through the goodness of his horse he arrived that night and immediately embarked in a fishingsmack which carried him into holland  he had leisure now to reflect on his late adventure which afforded the most melancholly retrospect the happy situation he had been in and the almost assured hopes of being continued in for life made his present one appear yet worse than in reality it was he now looked on himself as doomed to be a vagrant all his days driven from his native country for ever and the society of all his friends and torn beyond even a possibility of recovering from a lady to whom he was so near being united for ever whom he loved and whose fortune and kindred had given him just expectation of advancement in the world  these gloomy thoughts took him wholly up for some days but he was not yet arrived at those years in which misfortunes sink too deeply on the soul these vexatious accidents by degrees lost much of their ferocity and he began to consider how much beneath a man of courage it was to give way to despair at any event whatever and that he ought to look forward and endeavour to retrieve not lament the mischief that was past he wrote to his father an exact account of every thing and intreated his advice he sent also a letter to the young lady full of the most tender expressions and pressures for the continuance of her affection though this latter was more for the sake of form than any hope he had of being granted what he asked or as he was circumstanced any benefit he could have received from it if obtained  the answer his father sent gave him both pain and pleasure it informed him that the wounds he had given the person with whom he fought were not mortal that it was only the vast effusion of blood which had thrown him into a fainting which occasioned the report of his death and that he was now in a fair way of recovery so that he natura might return as soon as he pleased there being no danger on account of the rencounter but that the occasion of that quarrel being a partyaffair and represented in its worst colours by some private enemies it had reached the ears of the ministry who looking on him as a disaffected person had already disposed of his employment he also informed him that he must not flatter himself with being able ever hereafter to be thought qualified to hold any place or office under the governmenthe also added that the friends of his intended bride were so incensed against him that they protested they would sooner see her in her coffin than in the arms of a man who had incurred the odious appellation of a jacobite and that she herself expressed her detestation of the principles he was now accused of with no less virulence and contempthad torn the letter he had sent to her in a thousand pieces and to shew how much she was in earnest had accepted the addresses of a gentleman who had been long his rival and to whom it was expected she would soon be married  if natura rejoiced to find himself cleared of having been the death of a fellowcreature he was equally mortified at having rendered himself obnoxious to those who alone were capable of gratifying his ambition as for the change in the ladys sentiments concerning him he was under much less concern he thought the affection she professed for him must have been very small when a difference of opinion in stateaffairs and that too but supposed could all at once erace it and rather despised than lamented the bigotry of partyzeal which had occasioned ithis good sense made him know that to deny all the good qualities of a person meerly because those good qualities were not ornamented with the favours of fortune was both unjust and mean and the proof she gave of her weakness and ungenerosity in this point intirely destroyed all the passion he once had for her and consequently all regret for the loss of her  he could not however think of returning to england yet a while his fathers letter had given some hints as if there was a design on foot and he was confirmed soon after of the truth of it for expelling him the house and he thought it was best to spare his enemies that labour and quit it of his own accord and in this he found himself intirely right when on writing to some persons of condition with whom he had been most intimate he found by their answers that it was now known he had been in the french service which both himself and his father had kept a secret even from their nearest kindred not there was any thing in it which could be construed into a crime as the nations were then in alliance but because as he could not possibly enjoy a commission there without conforming to the ceremonies of the romish church it must infallibly be a hindrance to his advancement in a protestant country it is certain natura was of a temper to make good the proverb that when one is at rome one must do as they do at romeand though he had gone to hear mass because it was his interest and the necessity of his affairs obliging him in a manner to seek his bread at that time yet was he far from approving the superstitions of that church all that he could write however or his friends urge for him on this head was ineffectual he passed for a papist and jacobite with every body pursuant therefore to his resolution of continuing abroad till these discourses should be a little worn out he wrote again to his father and settled his affairs so as to receive remittances of money at the several places to which he intended to go     chap iv    the power of fear over a mind weak either by nature or infirmities   of body the danger of its leading to despair is shewn by the   condition natura was reduced to by the importunities of priests of   different perswasions this chapter also demonstrates the little   power people have of judging what is really best for them and that   what has the appearance of the severest disappointment is   frequently the greatest good   as to lose the memory of his disgrace or at least all those gloomy reflections it had occasioned was the chief motive which had made natura resolve to travel a second time it was a matter of indifference to him which way he went he first took care to make himself master of all that was worth observation in holland where he found little to admire except the stadthouse and the magnificence with which king william after his accession to the crown of these kingdoms had ornamented his palace at loo but the rough unpolite behaviour of the people disgusted him so much that he stayed no longer among them than was necessary to see what the place afforded and then passed on to brussels antwerp and in fine left no great city either in dutch or french flanders unvisited thence went into germany where his first route was to hanover having it seems a curiosity of seeing a prince whose brows were one day to be incircled with the crown of england but this country was at that time in so low and wretched a condition that whether he looked on the buildings the lands or the appearance of the inhabitants all equally presented a scene of poverty to his eyes he therefore made what haste he could out of it having found nothing except the elector himself that gave him the least satisfaction he was also at several other petty courts all which served to inspire in him not the most favourable idea of germany  at length he arrived at vienna a city pompous enough to those who had never seen rome and paris but however it may yield to them in elegance of buildings gardening and other delicacies of life it was yet more inferior in the manners of the peoplehe perceived among the persons of quality an affectation of grandeur a state without greatness and in the lower rank of gentry a certain stiffness even to the meanest and an insufferable pride which came pretty near ferocitythe costly but illcontrived parades frequently made discovered less their riches than their bad taste and appeared the more ridiculous to natura as they were extolled for their magnificence and elegance but even here as indeed all over germany the courts of berlin and dresden excepted you see rather an aim of attracting admiration and respect than the power of it these however were the sentiments of natura others perhaps may judge differently  but whatever may be the deficiencies of germany in matters of genius wit judgment and manners there is none in good eating and good wine and though their fashion of cookery is not altogether so polite nor so agreeable to the palates of others as their own yet it must be confessed that in their way they are very great epicures but though they generally eat voraciously they drink yet more and so nimbly do they send the glass about that a stranger finds it no small difficulty to maintain his sobriety among them  naturas too great compliance with their intreaties in this point had like to have proved fatal to himthe strength of the wines and drinking them in a much larger quantity than he had been accustomed to so inflamed his blood that he soon fell into a violent fever which for some days gave those that attended him little hopes of his recovery but by the skill of his physician joined to his youth and the goodness of his constitution the force of the distemper at last abated yet could not be so intirely eradicated as not to leave a certain pressure and debility upon the nerves by some called a fever on the spirits which seemed to threaten either an atrophy or consumption his complexion grew pale and livid and his strength and flesh visibly wasted and what was yet worse the vigour of his mind decayed in proportion with that of his external frame insomuch that falling into a deep melancholy he considered himself as on the brink of the grave and expected nothing but dissolution every hour  while he continued in this languishing condition he was frequently visited by the priests who in some parts of germany particularly at vienna are infinitely more inveterate against protestantism than at paris or even at rome though the papal seat as indeed any one may judge who has heard of the many and cruel persecutions practised upon the poor protestants by the emperors in spite of the repeated obligations they have had to those powers who profess the doctrines of calvin and luther but gratitude is no part of the characteristic of a german  these venerable distracters of the human mind were perpetually ringing hell and damnation in his ears in case he abjured not before his death the errors in which he had been educated and continued in so many years and by acts of penance and devotion reconcile himself to the mother church they pleaded the antiquity of their faith brought all the fathers they could muster up to prove that alone was truly orthodox and that all dissenting from it was a sin not to be forgiven  on the other hand the english ambassadors chaplain who knew well enough what they were about omitted nothing that might confirm him in the principles of the reformation and convince him that the church of england as by law established had departed only from the errors which had crept into the primitive church not from the church itself and that all the superstitious doctrines now preached up by the romish priests were only so many impositions of their own calculated to inrich themselves and keep weak minds in awe  natura who had till now contented himself with understanding moral duties and had never examined into matters of controversy between the two religions now found both had so much to say in defence of their different modes of worship that he became very much divided in his sentiments and each remonstrating to him by turns the danger of dying in a wrong belief wrought so far upon the present weakness of his intellects as to bring him into a fluctation of ideas which might in time either have driven him into despair or made him question the very fundamentals of a religion the merits of which its professors seemed to place so much in things of meer form and ceremony  by this may be seen how greatly christianity suffers by the unhappy divisions among the professors of itmuch it is to be wished though little to be hoped that both sides would be prevailed upon to recede a little from their present stiffness in opinion or be at least less virulent in maintaining it since each by endeavouring to expose and confute what they look upon as an absurdity in the other join in contributing to render the truth of the whole suspected and not only give a handle to the avowed enemies of depreciating and ridiculing all the sacred mysteries of religion but also stagger the faith of a great many wellmeaning people and afford but a too plausible pretence for that sceptism which goes by the name of freethinking and is of late so much the fashion  in another situation perhaps natura would have been little affected with any thing could have been said on this score but health and sickness make a wide difference in our way of thinkingwhen surrounded by the gay pleasures of life and in the full vigour and capacity of enjoying them we either do not reflect at all or but cursorily on the evil day but when cold imbecility steals upon us either through age or accidents and death and eternity stare us in the face we have quite other sentiments other wisheswhoever firmly believes that in leaving this life we but step into another either of happiness or misery and that which ever it proves will be without end or possibility of change and that the whole of future welfare depends on the road we take in going out of this world will be very fearful lest he should chuse the wrong and it is not therefore strange that while with equal force the papist pulled one way and the protestant another the poor penitent should be involved in the most terrible uncertainty  happy therefore was it both for the recovery of his mind and body that his physicians finding all their recipes had little effect advised him to seek relief from the waters of the spa and as it was their opinion they would be of more efficacy when drank upon the spot he accordingly took his journey thither but by reason of his weakness was obliged to be carried the whole way in a litter  it is very probable that being eased of the perplexities the incessant admonitions of the priests of different opinions had given him contributed as much as the waters to his amendment but to which ever of these causes it may be imputed it is certain that he every day became better and as his strength of body returned so did that of his mind in proportion with his apprehensions of death his disquiets about matters of religion subsided also and whenever any thing of that kind came cross his thoughts it was but by starts and was soon dissipated with other ideas which many objects at this place presented him with  but that to which he was chiefly indebted for the recovery of his former gaiety of temper was meeting with an english family with whom he had been extremely intimate the lady had come thither for the same purpose he had done her husband being very tender of her would needs accompany her and they brought with them their only daughter a young lady of great beauty and not above eighteen in hopes as they said of alleviating a certain melancholly to which she was addicted without any cause at least any that was visible for it  natura had often seen the amiable maria for so she was called but had never felt for her any of those pleasing and equally painful emotions which a nearer conversation with her now inspired him withhe had always thought her very handsome but she now appeared perfectly adorable in his eyesthe manner of her behaviour that modest sweetness which appeared through her whole deportment and seemed as it were a part of her soul had for him irresistible charms and as he very well knew the circumstances of her family such as his friends could make no reasonable objections against nor his own such as could be thought contemptible by those of her kindred he attempted not to repel the satisfaction which he felt in the hopes of being one day able to make an equal impression on her heart  the very first use he made of his intire recovery from his late indisposition was an endeavour to convince her how much her presence had contributed to it and that the supremest wish his soul could form was to enjoy it with her in the nearest and most tender union as long as life continuedshe received the declarations he made her of his passion with great reserve and yet more coldness and affected to take them only for the effects of a gallantry which she told him was far from being agreeable to a person of her humour but he imputing her behaviour only to an excess of that extreme modesty which accompanied all her words and actions was so far from being rebuffed at it that he acquainted her parents with his inclination and at the same time intreated their permission for prosecuting his addresses to her  both of them heard his proposals with a joy which it was impossible for either especially the mother of that lady to concealeach cried out almost at the same time that the sentiments he expressed for their daughter was an honour they hoped she had too much good sense not to accept with the utmost satisfaction and added that they would immediately lay their commands upon her to receive him in the manner she ought to do  as their families and fortunes were pretty equivalent and maria besides her being an heiress had beauty enough to expect to marry even above her rank natura could not keep himself from being a little astonished at the extravagance of pleasure they testified at the offer he had made parents generally take some time to consider before they give their assent to a proposal of this sort and as he knew they were very well acquainted with the occasion of his leaving england this second time and were of a party the most opposite that could be to that he was suspected to have favoured their extreme readiness to dispose of their only daughter and with her their whole estate to him seemed the more strange as he had been ever since he conceived a passion for maria in the most terrible apprehension of meeting with a different reception from them meerly on the account of his supposed principles  the transport however that so unexpected a condescension gave him prevented him from examining too deeply what might be the motives that induced them to it and he gave himself wholly up to love gratitude and the delightful thoughts of being in a short time possessed of all he at present wished or imagined he ever should ask of heaven  but how were all these rapturous expectations dashed when soon after going to visit maria he found her lovely eyes half drowned in tears and her whole frame in the utmost disorderwhat madam cried he with a voice which denoted both grief and surprize can have happened to give you any cause of the disquiet i see in youyou replied she snatching away her hand which he had taken you alone are the causewhat encouragement did i ever give you continued she that should make you imagine the offers you have made my parents would be agreeable to medid i ever authorize you to ask a consent from them which i was determined never to grant myself and which i will suffer a thousand deaths rather than ratify  the confusion natura was in at these words was so great that it prevented him from making any answer but he looked on her in such a manner as made her ashamed of what she had said and perhaps too of the passion that had so far transported her and perceiving he still continued silent i own myself obliged for the affection you express for me resumed she with more mildness though it is at present the greatest misfortune could have happened to me could i have thought you would have declared yourself in the manner you have done to my father and mother i would have convinced you how impossible it would be for you to reap any advantage from it and that by so doing you would only make me the most wretched creature in the world but all is now too late and i foresee the cruel consequencehere her tears interrupted the passage of her words and natura having recollected himself began to complain of the severity of his destiny which compelled him to love with the most violent passion a person who could only return it with an equal degree of hatelove replied she with a deep sigh is not in our powerlet me therefore conjure you by all that which you pretend to have for me to proceed no farther in this business nor endeavour to prevail on my parents to force an inclination which no obligations to them services from you or length of time can ever influence in your favour for be assured that if you do you will only see the hand should be given you at the altar employed in cutting my own throat or plunging a dagger in my breast  with these words and an air that had somewhat of wildness in it she flung out of the room leaving him in a consternation impossible to describe almost to conceive her mother came in immediately after and judging by his countenance how her daughter had behaved told him he must not regard the coyness of a young girl that she doubted not but maria would soon be convinced what was her true happiness and that a little perseverance and assiduity on his side and authority on theirs would remove all the scruples bashfulness alone had created in her no madam answered he with some impatience there is somewhat more than all this you have mentioned against methere is a rooted detestation to me in the very soul of maria which as i cannot but despair of being ever able to remove common reason bids me attempt no farther  the mother of maria appeared very much perplexed and said a great deal to perswade him that his apprehensions were without foundation but the young lady had expressed herself in terms too strong for him not to be perfectly assured she was in earnest and being willing to ruminate a little on the affair he took leave though not without the other extorting a promise from him of coming again the next day  natura had not given himself much time to reflect before he conceived great part of the truthhe could not think either his person or qualifications so contemptible as to inspire a heart unprepossessed by some other object with an aversion such as maria had expressed he therefore concluded she had disposed of her affections before she knew of his it also seemed plain to him that her parents were not ignorant of her attachment and being such as they could not approve of it was that which had rendered them both so ready to snatch at his proposal without any mention of those considerations they would otherwise naturally have had of jointure settlements and all those things previous to marriage between persons of condition  he was the more confirmed in this belief when the father came to his lodgings the next morning and without seeming to know any thing of what had passed between him either with his wife or maria asked in a gay manner how the latter had received his addresses to which natura answered in the same manner as he had done to her mother adding only that he could not avoid believing her heart was already engaged to some more worthy man and was sorry his own unhappy passion had occasioned any interruption the father left nothing unsaid that might dissipate such a conjecture and affected to railly him on a jealousy which he said was common to lovers and then told him a long story how himself had formerly suffered much by the same vain imagination but all this was so far from making natura doubt the truth of his conjectures that seeing through the artifice he was the more convinced they were intirely right  he went notwithstanding in the afternoon either because he had promised to do so or because he could not all at once resolve to banish himself from a person he took so much pleasure in beholding though now without hopes of ever being able to obtainbeing left alone with maria both of them remained in a kind of sullen silence for some minutes till at last the force of his passion in spite of himself made him utter some complaints on the cruelty of fortune and his own insensibility which had denied him the opportunity of discovering the thousand charms he now found in her till too late to have his adoration of them acceptable to her i have not less reason said she to accuse the chance which at this time brought us together than you can possibly have since the love you profess for me and which i once more assure you i can never return has laid me under the severest displeasure of my parentsbut i had hopes continued she after the declaration i made you yesterday that you would have renounced all pretensions to me and had generosity enough in your nature not to have taken the advantage of my father and mothers power over me to force me into a compliance which must be fatal to one or both of us  no madam answered he much surprized i am far from even a wish of becoming guilty of what you accuse me withdear as i prize your person i would not attempt to purchase it at the expence of your peace of mind nor could i be truly blessed in the enjoyment of the one without the otherit is only to maria herself i would have been obliged not to the authority of her parents  will you then quit me cried she hastily and let the act appear wholly your owni will replied he after a pause difficult as it is to do so and irresolute and inconstant as it will make me seem that said she will be an action truly deserving my esteem and in return know i am much more your friend in refusing your addresses than either my parents in encouraging or your own mistaken wishes in offering thembut pursued she i beg you will enquire no farther but leave me and break off with my parents in the best manner you can  fain would he have obtained a farther explanation of words which seemed to him to contain some mystery as indeed they did but she was no less inflexible to his intreaties on that score than she had been to those of his love and perceiving his presence gave her only pain he went out of the house with an aking and agitated heart but resolved to do as she desired and he had promised whatever pangs it cost him  he had not gone above an hundred paces on his way home before he was accosted by a man who seemed like an upperservant in a gentlemans family and who with a low bow delivered him a letter which on seeing directed to himself he hastily opened and found contained these lines    sir    if you have any thing in you of the gallantry generosity or   gratitude for which your country is famed come where the bearer   will conduct you to a woman who has suffered much on your   account and can be extricated from an unhappy affair only by your   advice  natura was little in a humour to pursue an adventure of the kind this seemed to be but curiosity got the better of his spleen and he bad the fellow lead the way and he would follow which he accordingly did till they were out of the town and from the sight of all the houses  being come into a field which was a kind of an inclosure and a theatre proper enough for the tragedy intended to be acted on it the fellow turned back and drew a pistol which he instantly discharged at the head of natura crying at the same time maria sends you thisheaven so directed the bullets that the one passed by his ear and the other only grazed upon his shoulder without doing any farther damage than taking away a small piece of his sleeve it is easy to judge of his surprize yet was it not so great as to disable him from drawing his sword in order to revenge himself on the assassin but the wretch in case his firearms should miscarry had provided a falchion concealed under his coat with which the same instant he ran furiously on natura and had certainly cleft him down tho perhaps in doing so he might have received his own deaths wound at the same time from the sword of his antagonist but both these events were happily prevented by the peculiar interposition of divine providence some reapers who had lain asleep under an adjacent hedge being roused with the noise of the pistol ran to the combatants and with their hooks beat down both their weapons while at the same fortunate crisis two gentlemen attended by three servants who happening to cross a road which had a full prospect over the field had seen at a distance all that had passed and came galloping up to the assistance of natura who was then beginning to interrogate the villain on the occasion of this attempt but he refused to give any satisfactory answer to what he said so was dragged by the countrymen and others who by this time were gathered together back into the town and carried immediately before a magistrate who on his obstinately refusing to make any confession committed him to prison  natura who imagined nothing more certain than that maria had set this fellow on to murder him as the surest way to get rid of his addresses went directly to the house where she lodged full of a resentment equal to the detestable crime of which he thought her guiltyhe found her in the room with her father and mother of whom he took little notice but stepped forwards to the place where she was sitting and seeing her a little surprized which indeed was occasioned only by his sudden return and the abrupt manner in which he enteredyou find madam said he with a voice broke with rage your plot has miscarriednatura still lives though it must be owned your emissary did all could be expected to obey your commands for my destruction  it is hard to say whether maria or her parents were in the greatest consternation at these words but he soon unravelled the mystery by relating the whole story not omitting what the assassin said in presenting the pistol and then as a confirmation throwed the letter he had received into marias lap and at the same time shewed the passage one of the bullets had made through the sleeve of his coatthe young lady no sooner cast her eyes upon the letter than she gave a great shriek and crying out o humphry humphry every way my ruin immediately fell fainting on the floor her father without regarding the condition she was in snatched up the paper the handwriting of which he presently recollected as having it seems intercepted several wrote by the same personabandoned infamous creature cried heshame of thy sex and family added the mother striking her breast in the utmost agonyin fine never was such a scene of distraction and despairnatura injured as he had been could not behold it without compassionhe ran by turns to maria endeavouring to raise herthen to her parents beseeching them to moderate their passionthen to her againyou are too generous said the father let her die happy had it been if she had perished in the cradlejust as he spoke these words she revived and lifting up her eyes o i am no murdress cried she guilty as i am in this heaven knows my innocenceit is false it is false said the father but were it true canst thou deny thou most abandoned wretch that thou wert also ignorant that the villain who wrote this letter had followed us to spaw and bring a second shame upon usshe answered to this only with her tears which assuring him she had no defence to make on this article his rage grew more inflamed he loaded her with curses and could not keep himself from spurning her with his feet as she still lay groveling on the ground and might perhaps have proceeded to greater violences had not natura by main force withheld him while her mother tho little less incensed against her dragged her in a manner out of the room more dead than alive  the unhappy object removed from his sight the provoked father grew somewhat more calm and turning to natura you see now sir said he how unworthy this wretched girl is of that affection with which you once honoured her but how shall i obtain your pardon for what the too great tenderness for an only child has made me guilty of to youall i can say is that i hoped she had been reclaimed and so far from even a wish to repeat her crimes that she had only an utter detestation for the villain that had seduced her  natura knew very well how he ought to judge of this affair but as he had an aversion to dissimulation and was unwilling to add any thing to the affliction he was witness to he said little in answer to the others apology but that he was extremely sorry for maria and the misfortunes she had brought on the family and then took his leave as soon as decency would permit but with a firm resolution to hold no farther conversation wherever they should hereafter happen to meet with persons who had all of them in their several capacities used him so ill  the assassin was soon after brought to a public trial where tortures making him confess the truth he acknowledged that having been a servant in the family the beauty of maria had inspired him with desires unbefitting the disparity between themthat emboldened by an extraordinary goodness she shewed to him he had declared his passion and met with all the returns he wishedthat she became pregnant by him and had made a vow to keep herself single till the death of her father should leave her at liberty to marry him but that an unlucky accident having discovered their amour he was turned out of the house and the grief maria conceived at it occasioned an abortion but that after her recovery she contrived means to meet him privately and to support him with money that he might not be obliged to go to service any more that she had acquainted him with their coming to the spa and not only knew of his following them in disguise to that place but contrived a rendezvous where they saw each other often and he learned from her the addresses of natura and the positive commands laid on her by her parents of marrying him in order to retrieve her honour and reputation that as besides the extreme love he had for her his own interest obliged him to hinder the match if by any means he could and finding no other than the death of his rival he had attempted it by the way already mentioned but cleared maria however of all guilt on this score who he assured the court knew nothing of his intentions of murder  the sentence passed on him was to be hanged in chains which was accordingly executed in a few days though natura pitying his case in consideration of the greatness of the temptation laboured for a mitigation of his doomhe never saw the unfortunate maria afterwards but heard she was in a condition little different from madness which making her parents think it improper she should return to england they conveyed her to liege where they placed her as a pensioner in the convent of english nuns there to remain till time and reflection should make a change in her fit to appear again in the world which proceeding in them shewed that whatever aversion some people have to this or that form of religion they can countenance nay pretend to approve it when it happens to prove for their convenience to do so  natura was now intirely cured of his passion but could not avoid feeling a very tender commiseration for her who had been the unhappy object of it he found also on meditating on every passage of this adventure that she was infinitely less to blame in regard to him than her parents had been and that what he had accused as cruel in her was much more kind than the favour they had pretended for himwhen he reflected on the gulph of misery he had so narrowly escaped he was filled with the most grateful sentiments to that providence which had protected him and also made sensible that what we often pray for as the greatest of blessings would if obtained prove the severest cursea reflection highly necessary for all who desire any thing with too much ardency     chap v    shews that there is no one human advantage to which all others   should be sacrificedthe force of ambition and the folly of   suffering it to gain too great an ascendant over uspublic   grandeur little capable of atoning for private discontent among   which jealousy whether of love or honour is the most tormenting   the desire of being well settled in the world is both natural and laudable but then great care ought to be taken to moderate this passion in order to prevent it from engrossing the mind too much for it is the nature of ambition not only to stop at nothing that tends to its gratification but also to be ever craving new acquisitions ever unsatisfied with the formerone favourite point is no sooner gained than another appears in view and is pursued with the same eagernesswhat we once thought the summum bonum of our happiness seems nothing when we have attained to the possession of it while that which is unaccomplished fires us with impatience and robs us of every enjoyment we might take in life  natura having now been absent two years thought the idle rumours concerning him as to his principles in partymatters would be pretty much silenced so began to think of returning to england he was the more encouraged to do so as he found by his letters that those in the ministry who had appeared with most virulence against him had been removed themselves and that a considerable change in public affairs had happened accordingly he set forward with all the expedition he could feeling not the least regret for leaving a country he had never liked nor where he had ever enjoyed any real satisfaction and had been so near being plunged into the worst of misfortunes that of an unhappy marriageno ill accident intervening he arrived in england and proceeded directly to london where he was received with an infinity of joy by his father and sister who happened at that time to come to town with her spouse in order to place a young son they had at westminster school  the better genius of natura now took its turn and prevailed over his ill one the person whose turbulent zeal had occasioned his late misfortune had since being detected in some mal practice in other affairs been cashiered from an office he held under the government and was in the utmost disgrace himself every body was now assured that natura had done no more than what became any man of spirit and honour and those who before had condemned now applauded his behaviour in fine every thing happened according to his wishes and to crown his happiness he married about ten months after his arrival a young beautiful lady of his fathers recommendation and who had indeed all the qualifications that can render the conjugal state desirable  the promotion of a member of parliament to the house of peers for that county in which their estate lay happening soon after he stood for the vacant seat and easily obtained itnothing now seemed wanting to compleat his perfect happiness yet so restless is the heart of man that gaining much it yet craves for more natura had always a great passion for the court meerly because it was a court and gave an air of dignity to all belonging to it he longed to make one among the shining throng he was continually solliciting it with an anxiety which deprived him of any true enjoyment of the blessings of his life nor could all the arguments his father used to convince him of the vanity of his desires nor the soft society of a most endearing and accomplished wife render him easy under the many disappointments he received in the prosecution of this favourite aim  the death of his father soon after however filled his bosom with emotions which he had never felt before in any painful degree he was for some time scarce able to support the thoughts of having lost so tender and affectionate a parent but as nothing is so soon forgot as death especially when alleviated by the enjoyment of a greater affluence of fortune his grief wore off by pretty swift degrees and he was beginning to renew his pursuits after preferment with the same assiduity and ardency as ever when his wife died in bringing into the world a son this second subject of sorrow struck indeed much more to his heart than the former had done as he now wanted that comforter he had found in herall the consolation he had was in that little pledge of their mutual affection she had left behind and it was for the sake of that dear boy at least he imagined it so that his ambition of making a great figure in the world again revived in him if possible with greater energy than ever  as he was now in possession of a very fine estate had an agreeable person rendered yet more so by all the advantages of education and travel and not quite sixandthirty when he became a widower his year of mourning was scarce expired before all his friends and acquaintance began to talk to him of another wife and few days past without proposals of that nature being made but either the memory of the former amiable partner of his bed or the experience he had in his own family of the ill effects that second marriages sometimes produce made him deaf for a long time to any discourses on that head though urged by those who in other matters had the greatest ascendant over him  though he was far from being arrived at those years which render a man insensible of beauty yet he was past those which had made him look on the enjoyment of it as the supremest blissthe fond desires that once engrossed him had for some time given way to the more potent ardors of ambitionhe now made not love his business but amusement the amours he had were only transient and merely to fill the vacancy of an idle hour his thoughts were so wholly taken up with advancing himself and becoming a man of consequence in the world that it may be reasonably supposed by his behaviour and the manner in which he rejected all the offers made to him that had he met with a woman in whom all the perfections of the sex were centered she would not have been able either to engage him to a serious attachment or to have quitted those more darling pursuits which the desire of greatness fired him with  thus fortified by his present inclinations against all the charms of youth of wit of beauty there was but one temptation he had not the power of withstanding and that one his ill fate at length presented to him a certain great person who at that time was at the head of public affairs had a neice who for many private reasons he found it necessary to dispose of in marriage natura was the man he happened to pitch upon as one who seemed to him a very proper person and accordingly made him the offer accompanied with a promise of getting him into a great post which he knew he had been for a long time and was still solliciting though without any prospect of success without his assistance  the young lady was not ugly yet far from being mistress of charms capable of captivating a heart which had been filled with so many images of different beauties but as i have already said love was not now the reigning passion of naturas soul and had she been much less amiable the dowery she was to bring sufficiently compensated for all other deficiencies according to his present way of judging  he hesitated not a moment to accept the ministers proposal and a long courtship as things were ordered between them being needless he became again a husband in a very few days after the first mention had been made of it and at the same time was put in possession of what was much more welcome to him than his bride even tho she had been endowed with every virtue every grace  all for a time went smoothly onhe saw himself in a rank and precedence his birth could never have expectedhis wifes uncle loaded him with favours he procured a commission of lieutenant in the guards for his younger brother by his motherinlaw whom in spite of the ill usage with which both himself and his father had been treated by her he had a very great affection forhe also got employments for several others of his kindredhis house was the rendezvous of the gay and titled worldhis friendship was courted by all his acquaintance and his interest at court created him so many dependants that his levee was little inferior to that of the minister himself  this full attainment of all he wished and even more than he had ever dared to indulge the hope of might well render him extremely contentedhe was indeed pleased to excess but the gladness of his heart was so far a virtue in him as it prevented him at first from shewing any tokens of that pride which a sudden variation of fortune frequently excites  it is certain his behaviour was such as gained him an equal share of love and respect and he had this addition to his other blessings of not having his advancement envied a thing pretty rare about a court where there are so many gaping after every office that falls  they say ambition is a lust that is never quenched and that the enjoyment of much brings with it only an impatience for more that fresh objects and new acquisitions still presenting themselves the mind is ever restless ever anxious in the endless pursuitit is very likely this maxim might indeed have been verified in the mind of natura after the hurry of transport for what he had already obtained had been a little worn off and made way for other aims but he had scarce given over congratulating himself on his success before a strange alteration and such as he had least dreaded of happened in his humour and rendered him wholly incapable of retaining the least relish for all the blessings he possessed and in which he so lately placed the ultimate of his wishes  the compliments paid to him on his promotion and marriage the giving and receiving visits from all his kindred and friends together with the duties of his post so much engrossed him for the first two or three months that he had not time to give any attention to his domestic affairs and happy would it have been for his peace if he had always continued in a total negligence in this point as the fatal inspection plunged him into such distractions as required many long years to compose  in fine he now discovered such dispositions to gallantry in his wife as inflamed him with jealousy to such a degree as it would be impossible to describenot that he had ever been possessed of any extraordinary love or fondness on her account but the injury which he imagined was offered to his honour by the freedoms with which she entertained several of those young courtiers which frequented his house made him in a short time become the most discontented man alive  utterly impossible was it for him to conceal his disquiets though the fears he had of displeasing the minister made him attempt it as much as possible and conscious of his ill dissimulation that way the little notice she took of a chagrin he knew she could not but observe very much added to it as it seemed a certain proof of her indifference for him a behaviour so widely different from the amiable tenderness of his former wife dissipated all the little affection he had for her and it was not long before she became even hateful to him his jealousy however abated not with his love her dishonour was his own her person was his property by marriage and the thoughts of any encroachment on his right were insupportable to him  whether she was in fact as yet guilty of those violations of her duty which his imagination incessantly suggested to him she was neither himself nor the world were ever able to prove but it is certain her conduct was such in every shape towards him as gave but too much room for suspicion in the least censorious and which growing every day more disagreeable to him he at length had not the power of feigning an inattention to ithe remonstrated to her the value every woman especially those in high life ought to set on her reputationtold her plainly that the severest censures had been past upon her and without seeming to believe them just himself intreated her to act with more reserve for the future  all this though delivered in the most gentle terms he could invent had no other effect than to set her into an immoderate laughter nothing could be more provoking than the contempt with which she treated his advice and on his insisting at last in terms which she might think were somewhat too strong on her being less frequently seen with some persons he mentioned to her she answered in the most disdainful tone that when she came to his years she might perhaps look on the pleasures of life with the same eyes he did but while youth and good humour lasted she should deny herself no innocent indulgencies and was resolved let him and the world say what they would not to anticipate old age and wrinkles  as natura was not yet forty in perfect health and consequently not past the prime of manhood this reflection cast upon his years could not but add to his disgust of her that made it and he replied with a spite which was very visible in his countenance that whatever disparity there was between their ages it would soon diminish by the course of life she followed and which if she persisted in would in a very little time make her become an object below the voice of censure  they must know little of the sex that do not know no affront can be so stinging as one offered to their beauty even tho conscious of having no great share of it but the wife of natura had heard too many flatteries not to inspire her with the highest idea of her charms which the little respect he now testified to have for them did not at all abate and only served to make her despise his stupidity as she termed it  no measures after this were kept between them she seemed to take a pleasure in every thing that gave him pain she coquetted before his face with every handsome man that came in her way and in fine gave herself such airs as the most patient husband could not have permitted her long to persist in making use of the authority the laws had given him he in a manner forced her into the country upwards of an hundred miles from london though it was then in the depth of winter and placed persons about her with orders to prevent her from all means of returning till he should judge it proper for her so to do  on this she wrote to her uncle complaining of the hard treatment she received and beseeching him to take some measures to oblige her husband to restore her liberty the minister who had at that time much greater concerns upon his hands on his own account did not care to give himself any trouble about private family affairs he only just mentioned to natura the letter she had sent to him and the purport of it and on his relating to him the reasons that had compelled him to put this restraint on her behaviour told him he should not interfere between them so that natura found he had nothing to apprehend for what he had done  finding this step had produced nothing for her purpose she at last condescended to submit to her justly offended husband and on her solemn and repeated promises of regulating her conduct for the future in such a manner as he should approve he was prevailed upon by her seeming contrition to consent to make trial how far her heart corresponded with her professionsit was agreed to prevent the town from inspecting too deeply on what had passed that she should pretend her absence from town had been the effect of her own choice and for giving the better colour he went down himself and brought her upthey lived together after this much better than they had done for some months before their quarrel and were now in appearance perfectly reconciled i say in appearance for all was outward shew neither of them had in their hearts the least true affection nor could forgive the other for what had passed between them  the excessive constraint which both put upon themselves in order to conceal the real sentiments of their hearts from each other as well as from the world could not but be extremely painfulnatura suffered her as little as possible out of his sight though he could have wished a possibility of avoiding her for ever and was obliged to do all he could to make that pass for a fondness of her presence which was indeed only the effect of his jealousy of her behaviour in absenceshe affected to think herself happy in his company for no other reason than to win him to an assurance of her reformation as might render him less observant than he had been of what she did even at the time as was afterwards discovered when she seemed most sorry and angry with herself for having given him any cause of suspicion since their marriage  both in fine endured all that could make marriage dreadful especially natura who having with his former wife experienced all the felicity of that state was the more wretched by the sad alternative and as he could not sometimes forbear comparing the present with the past fell frequently into perfect convulsions of grief and remorse for having plunged himself into it  a perpetual dissimulation is what human nature finds among the things which are impossible to performand i am pretty certain that the most artful person that ever breathed could not at all times and in all circumstances restrain so far his real inclinations as to give no indications of them to an observing eye and it is scarce probable but that the very attempt in natura and his wife gave rise to as many reflections on their conduct in this point as there was too much room to make on others  it was indeed a kind of farce acted by this unhappy pair in which both played their parts so aukwardly that the real character would frequently peep out and though each dissembled yet neither was deceived but as i said before this could not last for ever and the ice being once broke in some unguarded humour either on the one or the other side i cannot pretend to affirm on which the torrent of their mutual disgust burst out with the greater force for having been so long pent up it is hard to tell which testified the most virulence or expressed themselves in the most bitter termsall that can be determined is that those of natura shewed most of rage and those his wife made use of most of hatred  after having fully vented all that was in their souls against each other both became more calm and agreed in this as the only resource for ease in their present unhappy situation to banish for the future all deceit between them and never more pretend the least kindness or goodwill to each other when in private to lie in separate beds and to be as seldom as possible alone together but for the sake of both their reputations to continue in the same house and before company to behave with reciprocal politeness  these terms rid natura of a great part of that insupportable constraint he had been under but gave not the least satisfaction as to his jealousy of honour he doubted not but she would be guilty of many things injurious in the highest degree to their public character and which yet it would not so well become him to exert his authority in opposing and these reflections gave him the most terrible inquietude which shews that though jealousy is called the child of love it is very possible to feel all the tortures of the one without being sensible of any of the douceurs of the other passion  how dearly now did natura pay for the gratification of his ambitionwhat availed his grandeur the respect paid him by his equals and the homage of the inferior worldwhat the pride of having it in his power to confer favours when he had himself a heart torn with the most fierce convulsions and less capable of enjoying the goods of fortune than the most abject of those indigent creatures who petitioned for relief from himby day by night alone or in company he was haunted with ideas the most distracting to his peacea smile on the face of his wife seemed to him to proceed from the joy of having made some new conquest a grave or melancholly look from a disappointment on the account of a favourite gallant yet as her person was the least thing he was tenacious of the behaviour of others gave him greater pain than any thing she could do herselfwhoever spoke handsomely of her he imagined insulted him and those who mentioned her not at all he thought were sensible of her levity and his misfortuneevery thing he saw or heard seemed to him a sad memento of his dishonour and though he could not assure himself she had in fact been guilty of a breach of her virtue he was very certain she had been so of that reserve and modesty which is the most distinguishable characteristic of it and took from him the power of vindicating her innocence or his own honour even though he had believed them safe as becomes a husband whose wife is more cautious of her conduct in this point  too delicate of the censure of the world it gave him the utmost anxiety how to carry himself so as not to afford any room to have it said he was either a jealous or a too credulous husband yet in spite of all his care he incurred both these charactersthose who had heard of his sending her into the country without being acquainted with the motives for his so doing looked on him as the former and those who saw her manner of behaviour and the seeming politeness of his treatment of her imagined him the latterso difficult is it for any one who only sees the outside of things to judge what they are in reality yet the vanity of having it believed they are let into secrets makes a great many people invent circumstances and then relate for matters of fact what are indeed no more than the suggestions of imagination or what is yet worse the coinage of their own brain without believing themselves what they take upon them to report to others  this undoubtedly happened on the score of natura and his wife and occasioned not only many idle stories at teatable conversation but also many oblique hints to be sometimes given to himself which perhaps there was not the least grounds for but which greatly added to his disquiets as when we think we have reason to believe part we are ready to give credit to all we hear especially in cases of this nature it being the peculiar property of jealousy to force the mind to grasp with eagerness at every thing that tends to render it more afflicted and perplexed       book the third     chap i    shews in what manner anger and revenge operate on the mind and how   ambition is capable of stifling both in a remarkable instance that   private injuries how great soever may seem of no weight when   public grandeur requires they should be looked over   nothing is so violent as anger in its first emotions it takes the faculties by surprize and rushes upon the soul like an impetuous torrent bearing down all before it its strength however is owing to its suddenness for being raised by some new and unexpected accident or provocation reason has no warning of its approach and consequently is off her guard and without any immediate power of acting the sweetest and most gentle disposition is not always a sufficient defence for the mind against the attacks of this furious passion and may be hurried by it to deeds the most opposite to its own nature but then as it is fierce it is transient also should its force continue it would lose its name and be no longer anger but revenge which though the worst and most fiendlike propensity of a vicious inclination is sometimes excited by circumstances that seem in a great measure to alleviate the blackness of itrepeated and unprovoked insults friendship and love abused injuries in our person our fortune or reputation will sour the softest temper and are apt to make us imagine it is an injustice to our selves not to retaliate in kind the ill treatment we receive religion indeed forbids us to take our own parts thus far and philosophy teaches that it is nobler to forgive than punish wrongs but every one is not so happy as to have either of these helps and i do not find but those who boast both of them in the most superlative degree stand in need of something more to enable them to restrain this prevailing impulse and that it is not so much to the precepts they receive from others as to some dictates from within that many people are indebted for the reputation of patience and forbearance  it is the peculiar providence of heaven as i took notice in the beginning of this work that the more ignoble passions of human nature are generally speaking opposites and by that means serve as a curb to bridle the inordinancy of each other so that though one alone would be pernicious to society and render the person possessed of it obnoxious to the world many will prevent the hurt and make the man himself tolerable  the adventure i am now going to relate will prove that natura had the greatest excitements and the greatest justification both for wrath and revenge that could possibly be offered to any one man yet did another passion not more excusable than either of these suppress all the turbulent emotions of both and quench the boiling flames within his soul insomuch as to make him appear all calmness and contentedness  but though i made use of the word passion to express the now prevailing propensity of naturas soul i do not think that ambition strictly speaking can come under that denominationto me it rather seems the effect of an assemblage of other passions than a passion simple of itself and natural to the mind of man and i believe whoever examines it to the fountain head will find it takes its origin from pride and envy and is nourished by selflove nor ever appears in any great degree where these do not aboundwere it born with us there would doubtless be some indications of it in childhood but it is observable that not till man arrives at maturity and even not then unless the sight of objects above himself excites it he discovers the least sensation of any such emotionin fine it is an inclination rarely known in youth ordinarily declines in age and never exerts itself with vigour as in the middle stage of life which i reckon to be from about fiveandtwenty to fifty or somewhat more according to the strength of the natural stamina or constitutionbut to go on with my history  since natura had been in what they call a settled state in the world it had always been his custom to distinguish the anniversary of that day which gave him birth by providing a polite entertainment for his friends and kindred he had now attained to his fortieth year and though it had been that in which he had known more poignant disquiets than in any one of his whole life before yet thinking that to neglect the observation of it now would give occasion for remarks on his reasons for so doing he resolved to treat it with the usual ceremony  it was in that delightful season of the year when nature adorned with all her charms invites the senses to taste that regale in the open air which the most elegant and best concerted entertainments within doors cannot atone for the want of after dinner was over the whole company which was pretty numerous adjourned from the table to the garden a small but well ordered spot of ground at the lower end of which was a greenhouse furnished with many curious exotic plants while natura was shewing this collection to those of his guests who had a taste that way others were diverting themselves with walking in the alleys or set down in arbors according as their different fancies inclined as it is common for people to divide themselves into little parties when there are too many for all to share in a general conversation  as they were thus employed the minister who though he had not thought it beneath the dignity of his character to do honour to the birthday of the husband of his neice yet had his mind taken up with other things than the amusements of the place took natura aside on a sudden and asked him if he had not a paper in his custody which he had some time before put into his hands to which the other answering in the affirmative there are some things in it i do not well remember said the great man and a thought just now occurs to me in which they may be of usenatura then offered to fetch it no replied the other i will go with you and we will examine it together  there was no need of making any apology to the company they being as i have already said dispersed in several parts of the garden but had they not been so the statesman was absolute master wherever he came and no one would have taken umbrage at naturas following him  they went hastily up stairs together and the door of a room thro which they were to pass to naturas study being shut he gave a push against it with his foot and it being but slightly fastened immediately flew open and discovered a sight no less unexpected than shocking to boththe wife and own brother of natura on a couch and in a posture which could leave no room to doubt of the motive which had induced them to take the opportunity of the company separating themselves to retire without being missed which but for this accident they probably would not have been  it is easy to conceive what a husband must feel in so alarming a circumstance nor will any one wonder that natura behaved in the manner he did in the first emotions of a rage which might very well be justified by the cause that excited itnot having a sword on he flew to the chimney on each side of which hung a pistol he snatched one off the hook and was going to revenge the injury he had received on one or both the guilty persons when the minister stepping between beat down that arm which held the instrument of death crying at the same time what are you a madmanwould you to punish them expose yourselfthe passion with which natura was overwhelmed was too mighty for his breast it stopped the passage of his words and all he could bring out was villainwhorewhile those he called so made their escape from his fury by running out of the room in attempting to follow them he was still withheld and the minister having with much ado got the pistol from him began to expostulate with him in order to disarm his mind from pursuing any future revenge as he had done his hand from executing the present  consider said the statesman that these are but slips of nature that there are in this town a thousand husbands in the same situationindeed the affair happening with your own brother very much enhances the crime and the provocation but as the thing is done and there is no remedy it will but add to your disgrace to make it public  little would it have been in the power of all the arguments in the world if made use of by any other person to have given a check to that just indignation natura was inflamed with but as patience and moderation were prescribed him by one to whom he was indebted for all the grandeur he enjoyed and by whose favour alone he could hope for the continuance of it he submitted to the task difficult as it was and consented to make no noise of the affair the minister assured him he would oblige his brother to exchange the commission he was at present possessed of for one in a regiment that was going to gibraltar which said he will be a sufficient punishment for his crime and at the same time rid you of the sight of a person who cannot but be now detestable to youas to your wife i expect you will permit her to continue in your house in consideration of her relation to me but shall not interfere with the manner of your living togetherthat shall be at your own discretion  as neither of them imagined the lady after what had happened would have courage enough to go down to the company it was agreed between them to make her excuse by saying a sudden disorder in her head had obliged her to absent herself  natura cleared up his brow as much as it was possible for him to do in such a circumstance and returned with the minister to his guests among whom as he supposed he found neither his wife nor brother as for the latter much notice was not taken of his absence but the ladies by this time were full of enquiries after her on which he immediately made the pretence abovementioned but unluckily one of the company having been bred to physic urged permission to see her in order to prescribe some recipe for her ailmentnatura was now extremely at a loss what to do till the minister who never wanted an expedient relieved him by telling the doctor that his neice had been accustomed to these kind of fits from her infancy that it was only silence and repose which recovered her which being now gone to take any interruption would be of more prejudice than benefit  this passed very well and no farther mention was made of her but the accident occasioned the company to take leave much sooner than otherwise they would have done very much to the ease of natura who had been in the most intolerable constraint to behave so as to conceal the truth and longed to be alone to give a loose to the distracting passions of his soul  the more he ruminated on the wrongs he had sustained the more difficult he found it to preserve that moderation the minister had enjoined and he had promised he had long but too much reason to believe his wife was false but the thought that she had entered into a criminal conversation with his own brother rendered the guilt doubly odious in them bothhad not his own eyes convinced him of the horrid truth he could have given credit to no other testimony that a brother whom he had always treated with the utmost affection and whose fortune it had been his care to promote should have dared to harbour even the most distant wish of dishonouring his wife he seemed in his eyes the most culpable of the two and thought the banishment intended for him much too small a punishment for so atrocious a crime it is certain that this young gentleman had not only broke through the bands of duty honour gratitude and every social obligation but had also sinned against nature itself by adding incest to adulterynatura could not indeed consider him as any thing but a monster and that as such he ought to be cut off from the face of the earth and neither reason nor humanity could alledge any thing against the dictates of a revenge which by the most unconcerned and disinterested person could not be called unjuststrongly did its emotions work within his soul and he was more than once on the point of going in search of him in order to satiate its most impatient thirst but was as often restrained by reflecting on the consequencessuppose said he to himself i should escape that death the law inflicts for murder in consideration of the provocation i cannot hope to preserve my employmentsi must retire from the world live an obscure life the whole remainder of my days and the whole shameful adventure being divulged will render me the common topic of table conversation and entail dishonour and contempt upon my son  thus did ambition get the better of resentmentthus did the love of grandeur extirpate all regard of true honour and the shame of private contempt from the world lie stifled in the pride of public homage  the minister in the mean time kept his word he let the offending brother know it was his pleasure he should dispose of his commission in the guards and purchase one in a regiment he named to him which was very speedily to embark for gibraltar the young gentleman obeyed the injunction and doubtless was not sorry to quit a place where some accident or other in spite of all the care he had resolved to take might possibly bring him to the sight of a brother he had so greatly injured the thoughts of whose just reproaches were more terrible to him than any thing else that could befal him  the wife of natura being also privately admonished by her uncle how to behave kept her chamber for some days not only to give the better colour to the pretence had been made of her indisposition but also to avoid the presence of her husband till the first emotions of his fury should be a little abatedhe on the other hand profited by this absence to bring himself to a resolution how to behave when the shock of seeing her should arriveas her crime was past recal reproaches and remonstrances would be in vain to retrieve her honour or his peace and if they even should work her into penitence what would it avail unless to soften him into a pity which would only serve to render him more uneasy as there was now no possibility of living with her as a wifehaving therefore well weighed and considered all these things it seemed best to him to say nothing to her of what had happened and indeed to avoid speaking to her at all except in public  what she thought of a behaviour she had so little reason to expect and what effect it produced on her future conduct shall hereafter be related i shall only say at present that natura gave himself no pain to consider what might be her sentiments on the occasion as long as he found her uncle was perfectly satisfied with his manner of acting in this point which he had no reason to doubt of not only by the assurances he gave him in words of his being so but by a more convincing and substantial proof which was this an envoy extraordinary being about to be sent to a foreign court on a very important negociation he had the honour of being recommended as a gentleman every way qualified for the duties of that postthe ministers choice of him was approved by the king and council and he set out on his embassy with an equipage and state which joined to the attention he gave to what he was employed in greatly dissipated the chagrin of his private affairs and he seemed to have forgot for a time not only the injuries he had received but also even the persons from whom he had received them     chap ii    shews at what age men are most liable to the passion of grief the   impatience of human nature under affliction and the necessity there   is of exerting reason to restrain the excesses it would otherwise   occasion   there are certain periods of time in which the passions take the deepest root within us what at one age makes but a slight impression and is easily dissipated by different ideas at another engrosses all the faculties and becomes so much a part of the soul as to require the utmost exertion of reason and all the aids of philosophy and religion to eradicategrief for example is one of those passions which in extreme youth we know little of and even when we grow nearer to maturity has rarely any great dominion let the cause which excites it be never so interesting or justifiable it may indeed be poignant for a time and drive us to all the excesses imputed to that passion but then it is of short continuance it dwells not on the mind and the least appearance of a new object of satisfaction banishes it entirely we dry our tears and remember no more what so lately we lamented perhaps with the most noisy exclamationsbut it is not so when riper years give a solidity and firmness to the judgmentthen as we are less apt to grieve without a cause so we are less able to refrain from grieving when we have a real causegrief may therefore be called a reasonable passion tho it becomes not a reasonable man to give way to itthis at first sight may seem a paradox to many people but may easily be solved in my opinion on a very little considerationas thusbecause to be sensible of our loss in the value of the thing for which we mourn is a proof of our judgment as to refrain that mourning for what is past retrieving within the bounds of moderation is the greatest proof we can give of our reasona dull insensibility is not a testimony either of wisdom or virtue we are not to bear afflictions like statues but like men that is we are allowed to feel but not to repine or be impatient under themfew there are however who have the power of preserving this happy medium as i before observed tho they are such as have the assistance both of precept and experience  in a word all that can be expected from the best of men when pressed with any heavy calamity is to struggle with all his might to bear up beneath the weight with decency and resignation and as grief never seizes strongly on the mind till a sufficient number of years gives reason strength to combat with it that consideration furnishes matter for praise and adoration of the allwise and allbeneficent author of our being who has bestowed on us a certain comfort for all ills if we neglect not to make use of it so that no man can be unhappy unless he will be so  motives for grief which happen on a sudden merit excuse for the extravagancies they sometimes occasion because they surprize us unawares reason is off her guard and it cannot be expected we should be armed against what we had no apprehensions ofpresence of mind is an excellent but rare quality and we shall see very few even among the wisest men who are such examples of it as to behave in the first shock of some unforeseen misfortune with the same moderation and calmness of temper as they would have done had they had previous warning of what was to befal them  much however are the effects of this as of all other passions owing to constitutionthe robust and sanguine nature soon kindles and is soon extinguished whereas the phlegmatic is slow to be moved and when so not easily settled into a calm and tho the difference of age makes a wide difference in our way of thinking yet as there are old men at twenty and boys at threescore that rule is not without some exceptions but to take nature in the general and allowing for the different habits of body and complexion we may be truly said to be most prone to particular passions at particular agesas in youth love hope and joyin maturity ambition pride and its attendant ostentationwhen more advanced in years grief fear and despairand in old age avarice and a kind of very churlish dislike of every thing presented to us  but to return to natura from whose adventures i have digressed but i hope forgiveness for it as it was not only the history of the man i took upon me to relate but also to point out in his example the various progress of the passions in a human mind  he acquitted himself of the important trust had been reposed in him with all the diligence and discretion could be expected from him and returned honoured with many rich presents from the prince to whom he had been sent as a testimony of the sense he had of his abilities  but scarce had he time to receive the felicitations of his friends on this score before an accident happened to him which demanded a much more than equal share of condolance from themhis son his only son the darling of his heart was seized with a distemper in his head which in a very few days baffled the art of medicine and snatched him from the worldwhat now availed his honours his wealth his every requisite for grandeur or for pleasurehe for whose sake chiefly he had laboured to acquire them was no moreno second self remained to enjoy what he must one day leave behind himall of him was now collected in his own being and with that being must endmelancholly reflectionyet not the worst that this unhappy incident inflictedhis estate all at least that had descended to him by inheritance with the vast improvements he had made on it must now devolve on a brother he had so much cause to hate and whose very name but mentioned struck horror to his heart  the motives for his grief were great it must be allowed and such as demanded the utmost fortitude to sustainhe certainly exerted all he was master of on this occasion but in spite of his efforts nature got the upper hand and rendered him inconsolablehe burst not into any violent exclamations but the silent sorrow preyed on his vitals and reduced him in a short time almost to the shadow of what he had been  one of the most dangerous effects of melancholy is the gloomy pleasure it gives to every thing that serves to indulge itdarkness and solitude are its delight and nourishment and the person possessed of it naturally shuns and hates whatever might alleviate itthe sight of his best friends now became irksome to himhe not only loathed but grew incapable of all businesshe shut himself in his closet shunned conversation was scarce prevailed on to take the necessary supports of nature and seemed as if his soul was buried in the tomb of his son and only a kind of vegetative life remained within him  his sister who loved him very affectionately and for whom he had always preserved the tenderest amity being informed of his disconsolate condition came to town flattering herself with being able to dissipate at least some part of his chagrin to this end she brought with her all her children some of whom he had never seen and had frequently expressed by letter the desire he had of embracing them and the regret he had that the great affairs he was always constantly engaged in would not permit him time to take a journey into the country where she lived  but how greatly did she deceive herselfhe was too far sunk in the lethargy of grief to be roused out of it by all her kind endeavourson the contrary the sight of those near and dear relatives she presented to him only added to his affliction by reminding him in a more lively manner of his own loss and the sad effect she found their presence had on him obliged her to remove them immediately from his eyes  she could not however think of quitting him in a state so truly deplorable and so unbecoming of his circumstances and charactershe remained in his house would pursue him wherever he retired and as she was a woman of excellent sense as well as goodnature invented a thousand little stratagems to divert his thoughts from the melancholly theme which had too much engrossed them but had not the satisfaction to perceive that any thing she could say or do occasioned the least movement of that fixed sullenness which by a long habit appeared like a second nature in him  this poor lady found also other matters of surprize and discontent on her staying in town besides the sad situation of her brothers healthas she had never been informed of the disunion between him and his wife much less of the occasion of it the behaviour of that lady filled her with the utmost astonishmentto perceive she took no pains to alleviate his sorrows never came into the room where he was or even sent her woman with those common compliments which he received from all who had the least acquaintance with him would have afforded sufficient occasion for the speculation of a sister yet was this manifest disregard this failure in all the duties of a wife a friend a neighbour little worthy of consideration when put in comparison with her conduct in other points  after the adventure of her detection finding the minister was resolved to support her and that her husband durst not come to any open breach with her she immediately began to throw aside all regard for decorumshe seemed utterly to despise all sense of shame and even to glory in a life of continual dissolutionthe company she kept of both sexes were for the most part persons of abandoned characters whether she indulged herself in a plurality of amours is uncertain though it was said she did so but there was one man to whom she was most particularly attachedthis was a person who had formerly enjoyed a post under the government but was turned out on the score of misbehaviour and had now no other support than what he received from herwith him she frequently passed whole nights and took so little care in concealing the place of their meeting that the sister of natura easily found it out  on relating the discovery she had made to some of their relations they advised her to tell her brother imagining this glaring insult on his honour would effectually rouse him out of the stupidity he languished undershe was of the same opinion and took the first opportunity of letting natura into the whole infamous affair not without some apprehensions that an excess of rage on hearing it might hurry him into a contrary extreme but her terrors on this head were presently dissipated when having repeated many circumstances to corroborate the truth of what she said there appeared not the least emotion in his countenance and on her urging him to take some measures to do himself justice or at least to put a stop to this licentiousness of a person whose dishonour was his own all she could get from him was that he had neither regard enough for her to take any pains for the reclaiming her nor for the censure of the world on himself and desired she would not trouble him any farther on this point  this strange insensibility afforded cause to fear his faculties were all too deeply absorbed in melancholy for him ever to become a man of the world again and as she truly loved him gave both her and all his other friends an infinite concern     chap iii    the struggles which different passions occasion in the human breast   are here exemplified and that there is no one among them so strong   but may be extirpated by another excepting revenge which knows   no period but by gratification   though it must be acknowledged that the passions generally speaking operate according to the constitution and seem in a manner wholly directed by it yet there is one above all which actuates alike in all and when once entertained is scarce ever extinguishedit may indeed lie dormant for a time but then it easily revives on the least occasion and blazes out with greater violence than ever i believe every one will understand i mean revenge since there is no other emotion of the soul but has its antedote grief and joy alternately succeed each otherhope has its period in possessionfear ceases either by the cause being removed or by a fatal certainty of some dreaded evilambition dies within us on a just sense of the folly of pursuing ithate is often vanquished by good officeseven greedy avarice may be glutted and love is for the most part fluctuating and may be terminated by a thousand accidentsrevenge alone is implacable and eternal not to be banished by any other passion whatsoeverthe effects of it are the same invariable in every constitution and whether the man be phlegmatic or sanguine there will be no difference in his way of thinking in this point the principles of religion and morality indeed may and frequently do hinder a man from putting into action what this cruel passion suggests but neither of them can restrain him who has revenge in his heart from wishing it were lawful for him to indulge it  this being so fixed a passion it hardly ever gains entrance on the mind till a sufficient number of years have given a solidity to the thoughts and made us know for what we wish and why we wishevery one however does not experience its force and happy may those be accounted who are free from it since it is not only the most unjustifiable and dangerous but also the most restless and selftormenting emotion of the soul  there are notwithstanding some kind of provocations which it is scarce possible nor indeed consistent with the justice we owe to ourselves to bury wholly in oblivion and likewise there are some kinds of revenge which may deserve to be excused of these that which natura put in practice as shall presently be shewn may be reckoned of the number  i doubt not but my readers as well as all those who were acquainted with him at that time will believe that in the situation i have described he was for ever lost to the sense of any other passion than that which so powerfully engrossed him and from which all the endeavours hitherto made use of had been ineffectual to rouse him but it often happens that what we least expect comes most suddenly upon us and proves that all human efforts are in vain without the interposition of some supernatural power  i have already said that the bad conduct of his wife had been repeated over and over to him without his discovering the least emotion at it yet would not his sister cease urging him to resent it as became a man sensible of his dishonour that is to rid himself by such ways as the law puts it in the power of a husband so injured to get rid of her and imagining that an ocular demonstration of her crime would make a greater impression on him than any report could do she set about contriving some way to bring him where his own eyes might convince him of the truth of what he had been so often toldbut how to prevail on him to go out of his house which he had not now seen the outside of for some months was a difficulty not easily surmountedthe obstinacy of grief disappointed all the little plots they laid for their purpose and they were beginning to give over all thoughts of any future attempts when chance accomplished the somuch desired work  he had ordered a monument to be erected over the grave of his beloved son which being finished and he told that it was so i will see said he if it be done according to my directions two or three of his kindred were present when he took this resolution and one of them immediately recollecting how they might make it of advantage to their design said many things in praise of the structure but added that the scaffolding and rubbish the workmen had left not being yet removed he would have him defer seeing it till it was cleaned to this he having readily agreed spies were placed to observe the time and place where the lady and her favourite lover had the next rendezvous as neither of them had any great caution in their amour a full account was soon brought to the sister of natura who with several of their relations came into his chamber and told him that the tomb was now fit to be seen in all its beauty  on this he presently suffered himself to be dressed and went with them but they managed so well that under pretence of calling on another friend who they said had desired to be of their company in this melancholly entertainment they led him to the house where his wife and enamorato were yet in bed the sister of natura having by a large bribe secured the woman of the house to her interest they were all conducted to the very scene of guilt and this much injured husband had a second testimony of the perfidy of his wife but alas the first had made too deep an impression on him to leave room for any great surprize he only cooly turned away and said to those who had brought him there that they needed not have taken all this pains to make him a witness of what he was convinced of long before  his wife however was frighted if not ashamed and hid herself under the bedcloaths while her gallant jumped naked as he was out of the window but though natura discovered very little emotion at all this yet whether it was owing to the arguments of his friends or that the air after having been so long shut up from it had an effect on him they could not determine but had the satisfaction to find that he consented an action in his name should be awarded against the lover and proper means used for obtaining a bill of divorce from his wife  the real motive of this change in him none of them however could penetrategrief had for a while obliterated the thoughts of the injustice and ingratitude of his brother but what he had now beheld reminding him of that shocking scene related in the first chapter of this book all his long stifled wishes for revenge returned with greater force than ever and thinking he could no way so fully gratify them as by disappointing him of the estate he must enjoy at his decease in case he died without issue a divorce therefore would give him liberty to marry again and as he was no more than threeandforty years of age had no reason to despair of having an heir to cut entirely off the claim of so wicked a brother having once began to stir in the affair it was soon brought to a conclusionthe fact was incontestable and proved by witnesses whose credit left no room for cavil a bill of divorce was granted on very easy terms and the gallant fined in so large a penalty that he was obliged to quit the kingdom to avoid imprisonment for life  thus did revenge produce an effect which neither the precepts of religion philosophy or morality joined with the most tender and pressing remonstrances of his nearest and dearest friends could ever have brought aboutand this instance in my judgment proves to a demonstration that it is so ordered by the allwise creator that all the pernicious passions are at continual enmity and like counterpoisons destroy the force of each other and tho it is certain a man may be possessed of many passions at once and those also may be of different natures and tend to different aims yet will there be a struggle as it were between them in the breast and which ever happens to get predominance will drive out the others in time and reign alone sole master of the mind     chap iv    contains a further definition of revenge its force effects and   the chasm it leaves on the mind when once it ceases the tranquility   of being entirely devoid of all passions and the impossibility for   the soul to remain in that state of inactivity is also shewn with   some remarks on human nature in general when left to itself   i have already shewn in the example of natura how not only resentment for injuries but even the extremest and most justifiable rage may be subjected to ambition and afterwards how that ambition may be quelled and totally extinguished by grief and also that grief itself how violent soever it appears may subside at the emotions of revengethis last and worst passion alone finds nothing capable of overcoming it while the object remains in being it is true that we frequently in the hurry of resentment threaten and sometimes act every thing in our power against the person who has offended us yet on his submission and appearing sorry for what he has done we not only forgive but also forget all has past and no longer bear him the least ill will but then this passion by which we have been actuated is not properly revenge but anger of which i have already sufficiently spoke and i flatter myself proved how wide the difference is between these two emotions  natura had no sooner taken it into his head to revenge himself in the manner above related on his transgressing brother than he resumed great part of his former chearfulness conversed again in the world as he had been accustomed nor though he perceived his interest with the minister fall off ever since he had been divorced from his neice and easily foresaw that he would from his friend become in time his greatest enemy yet it gave him little or no concern so wholly were his thoughts and desires taken up with accomplishing what he had resolved  he was however for some time deliberating within himself to whom he should direct his addresses on this score the general acquaintance he had in the world brought many ladies into his mind who seemed suitable matches for him but then as they were of equal birth and fortunes with himself he reflected that a long formal courtship would be expected and he was now grown too indolent to take that trouble as he was not excited by inclination to any of them and had determined to enter a third time into the bonds of matrimony meerly through the hope of depriving his brother of the estate  besides the accidents which had lately happened to him had very much altered his way of thinking and though he had shaken off great part of the chagrin they had occasioned yet there still remained a certain languor and inactivity of mind which destroyed all the relish he formerly had of the noisy pleasures of lifehe began now to despise that farce of grandeur he once testified so high a value for and to look on things as they really deservedhe found his interest with those at the helm of public affairs was very much sunk and he was so far from taking any steps to retrieve it that he seldom went even to pay that court to them which his station demanded from himhe grew so weary of the post which he had with the utmost eagerness sought after and thought himself happy in enjoying that he never rested till he had disposed of it which he did for a much less consideration than it was really worth meerly because he would be in a state of perfect independency and at full liberty to speak and act according to the dictates of his conscience or his inclination  he was no sooner eased of his attendance at court by this means than he retired to his country seat in which he now thought he found more satisfaction than the town with all its hurrying pleasures could afford there he intended to pass the greatest part of the remainder of his days with some woman of prudence and good nature which were the two chief requisites he now wished to find in a wifethere were several welljointured widows in the county where he resided and also young ladies of family and fortune but he never made the least overtures to any of them and behaved with that indifference to the sex that it was the opinion of all who conversed with him that he never designed to marry again when at the same time he thought of nothing more than to find a partner in that state such as promised to prove what he desired  to this end he watched attentively the behaviour of all those he came in company with and as he was master of a good deal of penetration and also no small experience in the sex and besides was not suspected to have any views that way it is certain he had a good chance not to be deceived  it was not among the fine ladies the celebrated beauties nor the great fortunes he sought himself a wife but among those of a middling rank he only wished to have one who might bring him children and be addicted to no vice or caprice that should either scandalize him abroad or render him uneasy at home and in all his inspection he found none who seemed so likely to answer his desires in every respect as a young maid called lætitia she was the daughter of a neighbouring yeoman not disagreeable in her person or behaviour yet possessed of no accomplishments but those which nature had bestowed her father was an honest plain man he had four sons and two daughters who had been married some time and had several children lætitia was his youngest and promised to be no less fruitful than her sisters and this last was the chief inducement which made natura fix his choice upon her  having resolved to seek no farther he frequently went to the old mans house pretending he took delight in country affairs would walk with him about his grounds and into his barns and see the men who were at work in them one day he took an opportunity of going when he knew he was abroad designing to break his mind to the young lætitia who being her fathers housekeeper he did not doubt finding at home accordingly she was so and after some previous discourse a little boy of one of her sisters being playing about the room this it a fine child said he when do you design to marry pretty mrs lætitiashould you not like to be a mother of such diverting little pratlersit is time enough sir replied she modestly for me to think of any such thingif you get a good husband resumed he it cannot be too soonnor if a bad one too late cried she as there are great odds on that sidethat is true said he but i believe there are many ill husbands who owe their being such to the ill conduct of their wivesnow i fancy continued he whoever is so happy as to have you will have no such excuse for i firmly believe you have in you all the requisites to make the marriage state agreeable to this she only made a curtesy and thanked him for his good opinion i do assure you resumed he it is so sincere that i should be glad to prove it by making you my wife what say you pursued he could you be willing to accept of my addresses on that score with these words he took hold of her hand and pressing it with a great deal of warmth occasioned her to blush excessivelythe inability she was in of speaking through the shame this question had excited in her gave him an opportunity of prosecuting what he had begun and saying many tender things to convince her he was in earnest but when at last she gave him an answer it was only such as made him see she gave little credit to his professionssome people coming in on business to her father and saying they would wait till he came home obliged natura to take his leave for that time well satisfied in his mind that he had declared himself and not much doubting but that in spite of this first shyness she would easily be prevailed upon to correspond with his desires when his perseverance in them should have assured her of their sincerity  he was notwithstanding a good deal surprized when going several times after to the house he could scarce see her and never be able to exchange a word with her in private so industriously did she avoid coming into his presencesuch a behaviour he thought could proceed only from one of these two motives either thro an extraordinary dislike to his person or through the fears of giving any indulgence to an inclination which the disparity between them might make her mistake for a dishonourable one sometimes he was tempted to think the one sometimes the other but not being of a humour to endure suspense he resolved to take effectual measures for coming at the certainty  he went one day about noon and told the yeoman he was come to take a dinner with him on which the other replied that he did him a great deal of honour but should have been glad to have been previously acquainted with it in order to have been prepared to receive a gentleman of his conditionno said natura i chose to come upon you unawares not only to prevent you from giving yourself any superfluous trouble on my account but also because i would use a freedom which should authorize you to treat me with the samewe are neighbours continued he and neighbours should be friends and love one another  some other little chat on trivial affairs passed away the short time between the coming of natura and dinner being brought in on which the yeoman intreated him to sit down and partake of such homely food as he found therethat i shall gladly do answered natura but i waited for your fair daughter i hope we shall have her company i do not know said the yeoman i think they told me she was not very well had got the headach or some such ailmentgo however pursued he to a servant and see if lætitia can come downbut sir cried he perceiving his guest discovered no inclination to place himself at the table do not let us wait for her  natura on this sat down and they both began to eat when the person who had been sent to call lætitia returned and said she begged to be excused being very much indisposed and unfit to be seenthe old man seemed to take no notice but pressed natura to eat and somewhat embarrassed him with the many apologies he made for the coarseness of his entertainment to all which he gave but short answers till the cloth was taken away and they were alonethen i could not wish to dine more to my satisfaction said he if the sweetness of your meat had not been imbittered by your daughters absenceto be plain continued he i fear i am the disease which occasions her retirementyou sir cried the father affecting a surprize which he was not so well skilled in the art of dissimulation to make appear so natural but that natura easily saw into the feint and told him with a smile that he found the country had its arts as well as the courtbut let us deal sincerely with each other pursued he i am very certain it is from no other motive than my being here that your daughter refused to come to table and i also faithfully believe you are no stranger to that motivebe therefore free with me and to encourage you to be so i shall acquaint you that i have made some overtures to mrs lætitiathat i like her and that my frequent visits to you have been entirely on her accountnow be as sincere with me and let me know whether the offers i made her will be approved  the yeoman was a little dashed on naturas speaking in this manner and was some moments before he could recollect himself sufficiently to make any reply and when at last he had all he could bring out was sir my girl is honest and i hope will always continue so  i am far from doubting her virtue in the least answered natura hastily but i think i cannot give a greater testimony of the good opinion i have of her than by offering to make her my wifeah sir cried the yeoman interrupting him you must excuse me if i cannot flatter myself you have any thoughts of doing us that honouri am a mean man of no parentage and it is well known have brought up a large family by the sweat of my browlætitia is a poor country maidit is true the girl is well enough but has nothingnothing at all alas in her to balance for that vast disparity of birth and fortune between you  talk no more of that said natura taking him by the hand such as she is i like her and i once more assure you that i never had any dishonourable intentions on her but am ready to prove the contrary by marrying her as soon as she approves of me and you agree to it  the old man looked very earnestly on him all the while he was speaking and knew not well whether he ought to give credit to what he said or notnatura perceiving his diffidence continued by sparing neither arguments nor the most solemn imprecations to remove it till he was at last assured of a good fortune which as he said he had thought too extraordinary to happen in his family he then told natura he would acquaint his daughter with the happiness he intended for her and dispose her to receive it with that respect and gratitude that became her on which natura took his leave till the next day when he found lætitia did not make any excuse to avoid his presence as she had lately donehe addressed himself to her not in the same manner he would have done to a woman of condition but yet in very tender and affectionate termsher behaviour to him was humble modest and obliging and though she was not mistress of the politest expressions yet what she said discovered she wanted not a fund of good sense and understanding which if cultivated by education would have appeared very bright he easily perceived she took a great deal of pains to disguise the joy she conceived at this prospect of raising her fortune but was too little accustomed to dissimulation to do it effectually and both the one and the other gave him much satisfaction  circumstances being in the manner i related it is not natural to suppose any long sollicitation was requiredlætitia affected not an indifference she was free from and natura pressing for the speedy consummation of his wishes a day was appointed for the celebration of the nuptials and both the intended bride and bridegroom set themselves about making the necessary preparations usual in such cases  but see how capable are our finest resolutions of being shaken by accidentsthe most assured of men may be compared to the leaf of a tree which veers with every blast of wind and is never long in one positionhad any one told natura he had taken all this pains for nothing and that he would be more anxious to get off his promise of marrying lætitia than ever he had been to engage one from her for that purpose he would have thought himself highly injured and that the person who said this of him was utterly a stranger to his sentiments or character yet so it happened and the poor letitia found all her hopes of grandeur vanish into air when they seemed just on the point of being accomplishedthe occasion of this strange and sudden transition was as follows  two days before that prefixed for his marriage natura received a packet from gibralter which brought him an account of the death of his brotherthat unfortunate young gentleman being convinced by his sufferings and perhaps too by his own remorse and stings of conscience of the foulness of the crime he had been guilty of fell into a languishing disorder soon after his arrival in that country which left those about him no expectations of his ever getting the better offinding his dissolution near he wrote a letter to natura full of contrition and intreaties for forgiveness this epistle accompanied that which related his death and both together plunged natura into very melancholly thoughtsthe offence his brother had been guilty of was indeed great but when he remembered that he had repented and was now no more all resentment all revenge against him ceased with his existence and a tender pity supplied their placewhat while living he never would have forgave when dead lost great part of its atrocity and he bewailed the fate of the transgressor with unfeigned tears and lamentations  this event putting an end to the motive which had induced natura to think of marriage put an end also to his desires that wayhe was sorry he had gone so far with lætitia was loth to appear a deceiver in her eyes or in those of her father but thought it would be the extremest madness in him to prosecute his intent as his beloved sister had a son who would now be his heir and only had desired to be the father of one himself to hinder him from being so whose crimes had rendered him unworthy of it  the emotions of this revenge having entirely subsided he now had leisure to consider how oddly the world would think and talk of him if he perpetrated a marriage with a girl such as lætitiahe almost wondered at himself that the just displeasure he had conceived against his brother should have transported him so far as to make him forgetful of what was owing to his own character and when he reflected on the miseries vexations and infamy his last marriage had involved him in he trembled to think how near he had been to entering into a state which tho he had a very good opinion of lætitias virtue might yet possibly some way or other have given him many uneasinesses  he was however very much embarrassed how to break with her handsomely and it must be confessed that after what had passed this was no very easy matter to accomplishmake what pretence he would he could not expect to escape the censure of an unstable fluctuating manthis is indeed a character which all men are willing nay industrious to avoid yet what there are few men but some time or other in their lives give just reason to incurnatura very well knew that to court a woman for marriage and afterwards break his engagements with her was a thing pretty common in the world but then it was thing he had always condemned in his own mind and looked upon as most ungenerous and basebesides though he had made his addresses to lætitia meerly because he imagined she would prove a virtuous obedient and fruitful wife and was not inflamed with any of those sentiments for her which are called love yet designing to marry her he had set himself as much as possible to love her and had really excited in his heart a kind of a tenderness which made him unable to resolve on giving her the mortification of being forsaken without feeling great part of the pain he was about to inflict on her  all he now wished was that she might be possessed of as little warmth of inclination for him as he had known for her and that the disparity of years between them might have made her consent to the proposed marriage intirely on the motive of interest without any mixture of love in order that the disappointment she was going to receive might seem the less severe as the regard he had for her made him earnestly wish this might be the case he carefully recollected all the passages of her behaviour her looks her words nay the very accents of her voice were reexamined in hope to find some tokens of that happy indifference which alone could make him easy in this affair but all this retrospect afforded him no more than uncertain conjectures and imaginations which frequently contradicted each other and indeed served only to increase his doubts and add to his disquiets  the mourning for his brother was however a very plausible pretence for delaying the marriage and as he was willing the disappointment should come on by degrees thinking by that means to soften the asperity of it he contrived to let both father and daughter have room to guess the event before handhe seldom went to their house and when he did made very short visits talked as if the necessity of his affairs would oblige him to leave the country and settle again entirely in townrather avoided than sought any opportunity of speaking to lætitia in private and in all his words and actions discovered a coldness which could not but be very surprizing to them both though they took not the least notice that they were so before him but behaved towards him in the same manner as when he appeared the most full of affection  this was a piece of prudence natura had not expected from persons of their low education and way of lifehe had imagined that either the one or the other of them would have upbraided this change in him and by avowing a suspicion that he had repented him of his promises given him an opportunity either of seeming to resent it or by some other method of breaking off but this way of proceeding frustrated his measures in that point and he found himself under a necessity of speaking first on a subject no less disagreeable to himself than he knew it would be to those to whom his discourse should be directed  however as there was no remedy and he considered that the longer to keep them in suspense would only be adding to the cruelty of the disappointment he sent one morning for the yeoman to come to his house and after ushering in what he was about to say with some reflections on the instability of human affairs told him that some accidents had happened which rendered it highly inconvenient for him to think of marryingthat he had the utmost respect and good will for lætitia and that if there were not indissoluble impediments to hinder him from taking a wife she should be still his choice above any woman he knew in the worldthat he wished her happy with any other man and to contribute to making her so as also by way of atonement for his enforced leaving her he would give her five hundred pounds as an addition to her fortune  this was the substance of what he said but though he delivered it in the softest terms he could possibly make use of he could find it was not well received by the old man his countenance however a little cleared up at the closure of itthe five hundred pounds was somewhat of a sweetener to the bitter pill and after expatiating according to his way on the ungenerosity of engaging a young maids affection and afterwards forsaking her he threw in some shrewd hints that as accidents had happened to change his mind as to marriage others might also happen which would have the same effect in relation to the present he now seemed to intend for her  to prevent that cried natura hastily you shall take it home with you and with these words turned to a cabinet and took out the sum he had mentioned after counting it over he put it into a bag and delivered it to the yeoman saying at the same time that though it might not be so proper to come to his house yet if he would send to him in any exigence he should find him ready to assist him for you may depend added he that though i cannot be your son i shall always be your friend  these words and the money together rendered the yeoman more content than natura had expected he would be and by that he hoped he knew his daughter had not imbibed any passion for him which she would find much difficulty in getting rid of and that this augmentation to her portion would very well compensate for the loss of a husband of more than twice her years  a small time evinced that natura had not been altogether mistaken in his conjectureslætitia became the bride of a young wealthy grazier in a neighbouring town with whom she removed soon after her marriage and this event so much desired by natura destroyed all the remains of disquiet his nicety of honour and love of justice had occasioned in him  being now wholly extricated from an adventure which had given him much pain and no less free from the emotions of any turbulent passion he passed his days and nights in a most perfect and undisturbed tranquility a situation of mind to which for a long series of years he had been an utter stranger  to desire or pursue any thing with too much eagerness is undoubtedly the greatest cruelty we can practise on ourselves yet how impossible is it to avoid doing so while the passions have any kind of dominion over usto acquire and to preserve make the sole business of our lives and leave no leisure to enjoy the goods of fortunestill tost on the billows of passion hurried from care to care the whole time of our existence here is one continued scene of restlessness and variated disquietstrange propensity in maneven nature in us seems contradictory to herselfwe wish long life yet shorten it by our own anxietiesnothing is so dreadful as death yet we hasten his approach by our intemperance and irregularity and what is more we know all this yet still run on in the same heady course  natura had now however an interval a happy chasm between the extremes of pleasure and of paincontented with his lot and neither aiming at more than he possessed nor fearful of being deprived of what he had he for a time seemed in a condition such as all wise men would wish to attain tho so few take proper methods for that purpose that those who we see in it may be said to owe their felicity rather to chance than to any right endeavours of their own     chap v    contains a remarkable proof that tho the passions may operate with   greater velocity and vehemence in youth yet they are infinitely   more strong and permanent when the person is arrived at maturity   and are then scarce ever eradicated love and friendship are then   and not till then truly worthy of the names they bear and that the   one between those of different sexes is always the consequence of   the other   the inclination we have and the pleasure it gives us to think well of our abilities leads us frequently into the most gross mistakes concerning the springs of action in our breasts we are apt to ascribe to the strength of our reason what is in reality the effect of one or other of the passions sometimes even those of the worst kind and which a sound judgment would most condemn and endeavour to extirpateman is a stranger to nothing more than to himselfthe recesses of his own heart are no less impenetrable to him than the worlds beyond the moonhe is blinded by vanity and agitated by desires he knows not he is possessed of  it was not reason but revenge which dissipated the immoderate grief of natura on the death of his sonit was not reason but pride which made him see the inconveniences of marrying with lætitiaand yet doubtless he gave the praise of these events to the strength of his prudence to that too he also ascribed the resolution he now took of living single during the remainder of his life whereas it was in truth only owing to his being at present acquainted with no object capable of inspiring him with the tender passion  as he was now entirely free from all business or avocation of any kind whatsoever it came into his head to go and pass some part of the summer season with his sisterhe accordingly crossed the country to her seat and was received with all imaginable demonstrations of joy both by herself and husband  he found their family increased by the addition of a lady who preferring a country to a town life had desired to board with them which was readily granted by the sister of natura not only as she was a relation of her husband but also for the sake of having a companion so perfectly agreeable as this lady was in every respect  charlotte for so she was called had been left a widow within three months after her marriage and had never entertained any thoughts of entering into a second engagement though her person jointure and accomplishments had attracted many sollicitations on that score she was about thirty years of age when natura found her at his sisters and through the chearfulness of her temper and the goodness of her constitution had preserved in her countenance all the bloom of fifteenthe charms of her person however made no impression on natura at his first acquaintance with her he thought her a fine woman as every one did who saw her but her charms reached not his heart nor gave him any emotions either of pain or pleasure  but it was not for any longtime he remained in this state of insensibilitycharlotte had graces which could not fail of conquest sooner or laterwhere those of her eyes wanted the power to move her tongue came in to their assistance and was sure of gaining the daythere was something so resistless in her wit and manner of conversation that none but those by nature or want of proper education were too dull and stupid to understand but must have felt an infinity of satisfaction in it  besides all this there was a sympathy of humour between this lady and natura which greatly contributed to make them pleased with each otherboth were virtuous by nature by disposition gay and chearfulboth were equally lovers of reading had a smattering of philosophy were perfectly acquainted with the world and knew what in it was truly worthy of being praised or contemned and what rendered them still more conformable was the aversion which each testified to marriagenaturas treatment from his wife had made him speak with some bitterness against a state which had involved him in so many perplexities and charlotte though so short a time a wife having been married against her inclination and to a man who it seems knew not her real value had found in it the beginning of disquiets which prognosticated worse mischiefs had not his death relieved her from them and made her too thankful for the deliverance to endure the thoughts of venturing a second time to give up her freedom  this parity of sentiments inclinations and dispositions it was which by degrees endeared them to each other without knowing they were so  natura became at last impatient out of the company of charlotte and charlotte found a restlessness in herself whenever natura was absent but this indeed happened but seldomthe mutual desire they had of being together made each of them industriously avoid all those parties of pleasure in which both could not have a sharenatura excused himself from accompanying his brotherinlaw in any of those diversions where women were not admitted and charlotte always had some pretence for staying at home when the sister of natura made her visits to the ladies of the countryyet was this managed on both sides with such great decency and precaution that neither the one nor the other perceived the motive which occasioned their being so rarely separated much less had the family any notion of it  it is certain that never any two persons were possessed of a more true and delicate passion for each otherthe flame which warmed their breasts was meerly spiritual and platonicthe difference of sex was never considerednatura adored charlotte not because she was a lovely woman but because he imagined somewhat angelic in her mind and charlotte loved natura not because he had an agreeable person but because she thought she discovered more charms in his soul than in that of any other man or woman  the acquaintance between them soon grew into an intimacy and that intimacy by degrees ripened into a friendship which is the height and very essence of love though neither of them would allow themselves to think it so they made no scruple however of assuring each other of their mutual esteem and promised all the good offices in the power of either with a freedom which they would not have done especially charlotte who was naturally very reserved had they been sensible to what lengths their present attachment might in time proceed  winter now drew on but natura was too much rivetted to think of departing and would doubtless have made some pretext for living altogether with his sister had not an accident happened which made his going a greater proof of the regard he had for charlotte than his staying could have done and perhaps made him know the real sentiments he was possessed of on her account much sooner than he should without it  that lady had some lawaffairs which required either herself or some very faithful and diligent friend to attend term was approaching and the brotherinlaw of natura had promised to take a journey to london for that purpose but he unfortunately had been thrown from his horse in a hunting match and broke his leg and charlotte seemed in a good deal of anxiety who she should write to in order to entrust with the care of her business which she justly feared would suffer much if left wholly to the lawyers own management  natura on this offered his service and told her if she would favour him with her confidence in this point he would go directly to london where she might depend on his diligence and fidelity in the forwarding her businessas she had not the least doubt of either she accepted this testimony of his friendship with no other reluctance than what the being long deprived of his conversation occasionedher good sense notwithstanding got the better of that consideration which she looked upon only at an indulgence to herself and committed to his care all the papers necessary to be produced in case he succeeded so well for her as to bring the suit to a trial  the manner of their taking leave was only such as might be expected between two persons who professed a friendly regard for each other but natura had no sooner set out on his journey than he felt a heaviness at his heart for having left the adorable charlotte which nothing but the consideration that he was employed on her business and going to serve her could have asswaged  this was indeed a sweet consolation to him and on his arrival in town set himself to enquire into the causes of that delay she had complained of with so much assiduity that he easily found out she had not been well treated by her lawyers and that one of them had even gone so far as to take fees from her adversaryhe therefore put the affair into other hands and ordered matters so that the trial could not by any means be put off till another time  yet in spite of all this diligence it was the opinion of the council that there was an absolute necessity for the lady to appear herselfit is hard to say whether natura was more vexed or pleased at this intelligence he was sorry that he could not of himself accomplish what he came about and spare her the trouble of a journey he had found was very disagreeable to her not only on account of her aversion to the town and the ill season of the year for travelling but also because the person she contended with was a near relation and she was very sensible would engage many of their kindred to disswade her from doing herself that justice she was resolute to persist in her attempts for procuringthe thoughts of the perplexity this would give her it was that filled him with a good deal of trouble but then the reflection that he should have the happiness of seeing her again on this account much sooner than he could otherwise have done gave him at least an equal share of satisfaction  the gentlemen of the long robe employed in her cause and whose veracity and judgment he was well assured of insisting she must come put an end to his suspense and he wrote to her for that purpose the next post brought him an answer which to his great surprize expressed not the least uneasiness on the score of this journey only acquainted him that she had taken a place in the stage should set out next morning and in three days be in london against which time she begged he would be so good to provide her a commodious lodging she being determined to go to none of her kindred for the reason abovementioned  being animated with exactly the same sentiments natura was that inclination which led him to wish her coming influenced her also to be pleased with it and rendered the fatigue of the journey and those others she expected to find on her arrival of no consequence when balanced against the happiness she proposed in reenjoying the conversation of her aimable and worthy friend  but all this natura was ignorant of nor did his vanity suggest to him the least part of what passed in his favour in the bosom of his lovely charlotte but he needed no more than the knowledge she was coming to a place where he should have her company with less interruption than he had hitherto the opportunity of to make him the most transported man alive as he had no house of his own in town to accommodate her with he provided lodgings and every thing necessary for her reception with an alacrity worthy of his love and the confidence she reposed in him and went in his own coach to take her from the stage some miles on the road she testified her gratitude for the care he took of her affairs in the most obliging and polite acknowledgments and he returned the thanks she gave him with the sincerest assurances that the thoughts of having it in his power to do her any little service afforded him the most elevated pleasure he had ever known in his whole life  what they said to each other however on this score was taken by each more as the effects of gallantry and good breeding than the real motives from which the expressions they both made use of had their sourceequal was their tenderness equal also was their diffidence it being the peculiar property of a true and perfect love always to fear and never to hope too much  natura had taken care to chuse her an apartment very near the place where he lodged himself which luckily happened to be in an extreme airy and genteel part of the town so that he had the pleasure of seeing her not only every day but almost every hour in the day on one pretext or other which his industrious passion dictated and this almost continual being together and for the most part without any other company very much increased the freedom between them though that freedom never went farther even in a wish on either side for a long time at least than that of a brother and sister  though all imaginable diligence was used to bring the lawsuit to an issue those with whom charlotte contested found means to put it off for yet one more term she was obliged to stay that time but neither felt in herself nor pretended to do so any repugnance at itnatura had enough to do to conceal his joy on this occasion and when he affected a concern for her being detained in a place she had so often declared an aversion for he did it so awkwardly that had she not been too much taken up with endeavouring to disguise her own sentiments on this account she could not but have seen into his  as neither of them seemed now to take any delight in balls plays operas masquerades cards or any of the town diversions they passed all their evenings together and for the most part alone as i before observedtheir conversation was chiefly on serious topics and such as might have been improving to the hearers had any been permitted and when they fell on matters which required a more gay and sprightly turn their good humour never went beyond an innocent chearfulness nor in the least transgressed the bounds of the strictest morality and modesty  how long this platonic intercourse would have continued is uncertain but the second term was near elapsed the suit determined in favour of charlotte and her stay in town necessary but a very days before either of them entertained any other ideas than such as i have mentioned natura then began to regret the diminution of the happiness he now enjoyed and indeed of the total loss of it for though he knew it would not be wondered at that his complaisance should induce him to attend charlotte in her journey to his sisters yet he was at a loss for a pretence to remain there for any long timecharlotte on the other hand considered on the separation which in all appearance must shortly be between them with a great deal of anxiety and was even sorry the completion of her business had left her no excuse for staying in town since she could not expect it either suited with his inclinations or situation of affairs to live always in the country  these cogitations rendered both very uneasy in their minds yet neither of them took any steps to remedy a misfortune equally terrible to each and the event had doubtless proved as they imagined had not the latent fires which glowed in both their breasts been kindled into a flame by foreign means and not the least owing to themselves  one of those gentlemen who had been council for charlotte and had behaved with extraordinary zeal in her behalf had been instigated thereto more by the charms of her person than the fees he received from herin fine he was in love with her but his passion was not of that delicate nature which fills the mind with a thousand timid apprehensions and chuses rather to endure the pains of a long smothered flame than run the hazard of offending the adored object by disclosing it  he had enquired into her family and fortune and finding there was nothing of disparity between them he declared his passion to her and declared it in terms which seemed not to savour of any great fears of being rejectedhe was in his prime of life had an agreeable person and a good estate the consciousness of which together with his being accustomed to plead with success at the bar made him not much doubt but his eloquence and assurance would have the same effect on his mistress as it frequently had on the judges but the good opinion he had of himself greatly deceived him in this point he met with a rebuff from charlotte which might have deterred some men from prosecuting a courtship she seemed determined never to encourage but though he was a little alarmed at it he could not bring himself to think she was enough in earnest to make him desist in every visit he paid her he interlarded his discourse on business with professions of love which at length so much teized her that she told him plainly she would sooner suffer her cause to be lost than suffer herself to be continually persecuted with sollicitations which she had ever avoided since her widowhood and ever should do so  natura came in one day just as the counsellor was going out of her apartment he observed a great confusion in his face and some emotions in hers which shewed her mind a little ruffled from that happy composure he was accustomed to find it in on his testifying the notice he took of this change in her countenance it is strange thing said she that people will believe nothing in their own disfavouri have told this man twenty times that if i were disposed to think of a second marriage which i do not believe i ever shall the present sentiments i am possessed of would never be reversed by any offer he could make me yet will he still persist in his impertinent declarations  there needed no more to convince natura he had a rival nor as he knew charlotte had nothing of coquetry in her humour to make him also know she was not pleased with having attracted the affections of this new admirer this gave him an inexpressible satisfaction for tho as yet he had never once thought of making any addresses to her on the score of love death was not half so terrible to him as the idea of her encouraging them from any other man  then madam cried he looking on her in a manner she had never seen him do before the councellor has declared a passion for you and you have rejected himis it possiblepossible interrupted she can you believe it possible i should not do so knowing as you do the fixed aversion i have to entering into any second engagementbut were it less so continued she after a pause his sollicitations would be never the more agreeable to me  natura asked pardon for testifying any surprize which he assured her was totally owing either to this proof of the effect of her charms which said he are capable of far greater conquests or to your refusal of the councellors offer after the declarations you have made against a second marriage but was excited in me meerly by the novelty of the thing having heard nothing of it before  this had not been among the number of the few things i conceal from you answered she if i had thought the repetition worthy of taking up any part of that time which i always pass with you on subjects more agreeablebesides continued she it was always my opinion that those women who talk of the addresses made to them are secretly pleased with them in their hearts and like the love tho they may even despise the lover for my part i can feel no manner of satisfaction in relating to others what i had rather be totally ignorant of myself  natura had here a very good opportunity of complimenting her on the excellency of her understanding which set her above the vanities of the generality of her sex and indeed he expressed himself with so much warmth on this occasion that it even shocked her modesty and she was obliged to desire him to change the conversation and speak no more of a behaviour which was not to be imputed to her good sense but to her disposition  never had natura found it more difficult to obey her than nowhe could have expatiated for ever on the many and peculiar perfections both of her mind and person but he perceived that to indulge the darling theme would be displeasing to her and therefore forced himself to put a stop to the utterance of those dictates with which his heart was now charged even to an overflowing  such was the effect of this incident on both natura who till now had thought he loved only the soul of his mistress found how dear her lovely person was also to him by the knowledge that another was endeavouring to get possession of it and charlotte by the secret satisfaction she felt on those indications natura in spite of his efforts to the contrary had given of a more than ordinary admiration of her discovered for the first time that he was indeed the only man whose love would not be displeasing to her  after natura came home and had leisure to meditate on this affair he began with thinking how terrible it would be to him to see charlotte in the arms of a husband and when he reflected that such a thing might be possible even though he doubted not the sincerity of her present aversion the idea was scarce to be bornefrom this he naturally fell on figuring to himself how great a blessing that man would enjoy who should always have the sweet society of so amiable a companionand this made him cry out why then what hinders me from endeavouring to become that happy manif i resolved against any future marriage it was when i knew not the adorable charlotte nor believed there was so excellent a woman in the worldin this rapturous imagination did he continue for a moment but then the improbability of succeeding in any such attempt struck him with an adequate despairthough the uncommon merit of the woman i adore said he compels me to change the resolution i had taken there is not the same reason to prevail on her to recede from herspast the bloom of life and already twice a husband can i flatter myself with the fond hope she will not reject the proposals i should make with the same scorn she did those of the councillor  charlotte on the other hand was engrossed by reflections vastly different from those she was accustomed to entertainnever woman was more free from vanity or thought less of the power of her charms yet she could not hinder herself from thinking there was somewhat in the behaviour of natura in his last visit that denoted a regard beyond an ordinary friendship for herthis apprehension at first a little startled her or at least she imagined it did so and she said to herself if he should really harbour any inclinations for me of that sort how unhappy should i be in being obliged to break off my acquaintance with a person so every way agreeable to me and to continue it would be to countenance a passion i have determined never to give the least attention toyet wherefore did i determine pursued she with a sigh but because i found the generality of men mere wandering vague inconstant creatureswere guided only by fancynever consulted their judgment whether the object they pretended to admire had any real merit or not and often too treated those worst who had the best claim to their esteembesides one seldom finds a man whose person and qualifications are every way suited to ones likingnatura is certainly such as i should wish a husband to be if i were inclined to marry againi have not taken a vow of celibacy and have nobody to controul my actionsthen said she again what foolish imaginations comes into my head perhaps he has not the least thought of me in the way i am dreaming ofno no he has suffered too much by the imprudence of one woman to put it in the power of another to treat him in the same mannerbe trembles at marriagei have heard him declare it and i am deviating into a vanity i never before was guilty of  she was debating in this fashion within herself when natura came to pay his morning visit she blushed at his approach conscious of the meditations she had been in on his accounthe full of the sentiments i have described saluted her with an air more grave and timid than he had been accustomed and which all who are judges of the tender passion know to be the surest symptom of itthey sat down and on his beginning to renew some discourse concerning the counsellors pretensions she desired him to forbear so disagreeable a topic telling him at the same time he could say nothing else she would not listen to with satisfactionhow madam cried he are you sure of thatalas you little know what passes in my heart or you would not permit me this toleration this might have been sufficient to make some women convinced of the truth but charlotte either fearful of being deceived by her own vanity or willing he should be more explicit answered i have too high an opinion of your good sense and too flattering an idea of your friendship to me to imagine your heart will ever suggest any thing which would be offensive to me from your tongue  suppose madam said he it should not be in my power to restrain my wishes in those bounds prescribed by you to all who have the happiness of conversing with you and that i were encroaching enough not to be content with the marks of friendship you are pleased to honour mein fine continued he suppose i were guilty of the very same presumption you have so severely censured in the councellor  that is impossible replied she since you are a foe professed to marriage as well as myselfshe was about to add something more but was prevented by emotions which she attempted but in vain to conceal and natura saw enough to keep him from despairing he had forfeited her esteem by aiming at her love  having thus made a beginning it was easy for him to prosecute a suit which he soon discovered he had a friend in her bosom to plead in favour ofin a word he left her not till he had obtained her permission to entertain her on the same theme and to use his endeavours to prevail on her to exchange the friendship she confessed for him into a warmer passion  it would be altogether needless to make any repetition of the particulars of this courtship the reader will easily believe that both parties being animated with the same sentiments i have described it could not be very tediouslove had already done his work in their hearts and required little the labour of the tongue charlotte had entirely compleated every thing appertaining to her lawsuit yet she seemed not in a hurry to quit the town a business of a more tender nature now detained hershe had resolved or rather she could not help resolving to give herself to natura and the shame of doing what she had so often and so strenuously declared against rendered the thoughts of returning into the country in a different state from that with which she had left it insupportable to her  after having agreed to the sollicitations of her importunate lover she expressed her sentiments to him on this head on which it was concluded that their nuptials should be solemnized as privately as possible in london and that they should set out immediately after for his country seat where charlotte being utterly a stranger would not be subjected to any of those little railleries she must have expected in a place where every one knew of the aversion she had testified for a second marriage  no cross accident intervening what they designed was in a short time carried into executionnever were any pair united by more indelible bonds those of friendship sublimed into the most pure and virtuous tenderness and a parity of principles humours and inclinations  thus does passion triumph over the most seemingly fixed and determined resolution and though it must be confessed that in this instance both had reason from the real merits of the beloved object to justify their choice yet nature would certainly have had the same force and worked the same effect if excited only by meer fancy and imaginary perfections  a platonic and spiritual love therefore between persons of different sexes can never continue for any length of time whatever ideas the mind may conceive they will at last conform to the craving of the senses and the soul though never so elevated find itself incapable of enjoying a perfect satisfaction without the participation of the bodyas inclination then is not always guided by a right judgment nor circumstances always concur to render the indulging an amorous propensity either convenient or lawful how careful ought every one be not to be deceived by a romantic imagination so far as to engage in an affection which sooner or later will bring them to the same point that natura and charlotte experienced     chap vi    how the most powerful emotions of the mind subside and grow weaker   in proportion as the strength of the body decays is here   exemplified and that such passions as remain after a certain age   are not properly the incentives of nature but of example long   habitude or ill humour   the bride and bridegroom were received by all the friends tenants and dependants of natura with the greatest demonstrations of joy and the behaviour of the amiable charlotte was such as made every one cease to wonder that he had ventured again on marriage after the disquiets he had experienced in that state  the kindred on neither side had nothing to condemn in the choice which each had made of the other and though perhaps a motive of selfinterest might make those nearest in blood and consequently to the estates they should leave at their decease wish such an union had not happened yet none took the liberty to complain or betray by any part of their behaviour the least dissatisfaction at itthe sister and brotherinlaw of natura it must be allowed had the most cause as they had a large family of children who had a claim equally to the effects of both in case they had died without issue yet did not even they express any discontent though charlotte within the first year of her marriage brought two sons into the world and a third in the next ensuing one all which seemed likely to live and enjoy their parents patrimony  what now was wanting to compleat the happiness of this worthy pair equally loving and beloved by each other respected by all who knew them in need of no favours from any one and blessed with the power of conferring them on as many as they found wanted or merited their assistancecharlotte lost no part of her beauty nor vivacity by becoming a mother nor did natura find any decrease in the strength or vigour either of his mind or body till he was past fiftysix years of agethe same happy constitution had doubtless continued a much longer time in him as nature had not been worn out by any excesses or intemperance if by unthinkingly drinking some cold water when he was extremely hot he had not thrown himself into a surfeit which surfeit afterward terminated in an ague and fever which remained on him a long time and so greatly impaired all his faculties as well as person that he was scarce to be known either by behaviour or looks for the man who before that accident had been infinitely regarded and esteemed for the politeness of the one and the agreeableness of the other  his limbs grew feeble his body thin and his face pale and wan his temper sour and sullen seldom caring to speak and when he did it was with peevishness and illnatureevery thing was to him an object of disquiet nothing of delight and he seemed in all respects like one who was weary of the world and knew he was to leave it in a short time  it is so natural to feel repugnance at the thoughts of being what they call no more that is no more as to the knowledge and affections of this world that even those persons who labour under the severest afflictions wish rather to continue in them than be eased by deaththey are pleased at any flattering hopes given of a prolongation of their present misery and are struck with horror at the least mention of their life and pains being drawing to a periodmore irksome doubtless it must still be to those who having every thing they could wish for here find they must soon be torn from all the blessings they enjoythis is indeed a weakness but it is a weakness of nature and which neither religion nor philosophy are sufficient to arm us against and the very endeavours we make to banish or at least to conceal our disquiets on this score occasion a certain peevishness in the sweetest temper and make us behave with a kind of churlishness even to those most dear to us  few indeed care to confess this truth tho there are scarce any who do not shew it in their behaviour even at the very time they are forcing themselves to an affectation of indifference for life and a resignation to the will of heaven  the great skill of his physicians however and the yet greater care his tender consort took to see their prescriptions obeyed with the utmost exactitude at length recovered natura from the brink of the gravehe was out of danger from the disease which had so long afflicted him but though it had entirely left him the attack had been too severe for a person at the age to which he was now arrived to regain altogether the former manhe had in his sickness contracted habits which he was unable to throw off in health and he could no more behave than look as he had done before  the mind would certainly be unalterable and retain the same vigour it ever had in youth even to extreme old age could the constitution preserve itself entireit is that perishable part of us which every little accident impairs and wears away preparing as it were by degrees for a total dissolution which hinders the nobler moiety of the human species from actuating in a proper mannerthose organs which are the vehicles through which its meanings shoot forth into action being either shrivelled abraded by long use or clogged up with humours shew the soul but in an imperfect manner often disguise it wholly and it is for want of a due consideration only that we are so apt to condemn the mind for what in reality is nothing but the incumbrances laid on it by the infirmities of the body  it is true that as we grow older the passions naturally subside yet that they do so is not owing to themselves as i think may be easily proved by this argument  every one will acknowledge because he knows it by experience that while he is possessed of passions his reason alone has the power of keeping them within the bounds of moderation if then we have less of the passions in old age or rather if they seem wholly extinguished in us we ought to have a greater share of reason than before whereas on the contrary reason itself becomes languid in the length of years as well as the passions it is supposed to have subdued it is therefore meerly the imbecility of the organical faculties and from no other cause that we see the aged and infirm dead in appearance to those sensations by which their youth was so strongly influenced  avarice is indeed frequently distinguishable in old men but this i do not look upon as a passion but a propensity arising from illnature and selflovegain and the sordid pleasure of counting over money and reckoning up rents and revenues is the only lust of age and since we cannot be so handsome so vigorous cannot indulge our appetites like those who are younger we take all manner of ways to be richer and pride ourselves in the length of our bags and the number of our tenants  i know it may be objected that this vice is not confined to age that youth is frequently very avaritious and grasps at money with a very unbecoming eagernessthis i grant is true but if we look into the conduct of such men in other respects i believe we shall generally find their avarice proceeds from their prodigalitythey are lavish in the purchase of pleasures and must therefore be parsimonious in acts of generosity and justicethey are guilty of meanness in some things only for the sake of making a great figure in others and are not ashamed to be accounted niggards where they ought to be liberal in order to acquire the reputation of openhandedness where it would better become them to be sparing  natura however had never discovered any tendency to this vice either in youth or age yet did that peevishness which the infirmities of his body had occasioned make him behave sometimes as if he were tainted with it  charlotte observed this alteration in her husbands temper with an infinite concern yet bore it with an equal patiencemaking it her whole study to divert and sooth his ill humourhe was not so lost to love and gratitude and even reason too as not to acknowledge the tender proofs he continually received of her unshaken affections and would sometimes confess the errors he was guilty of in point of behaviour towards her and intreat her pardon but then the least trifle would render him again forgetful of all he had said and make him relapse into his former frowardness  it is certain notwithstanding that his love for her was the same as ever though he could not shew it in the same manner and to what can this be imputed but to the effect which the ailments of his external frame had on his internal faculties  though as well as those about him he found a decay within himself which made him think he had not long to live yet could he not be prevailed upon for a great while to settle his affairs after his decease by making any will and whenever it was mentioned to him discovered a dissatisfaction which at last made every one desist from urging any thing on that score  it was in vain that they had remonstrated to him that the estate being to descend entire to his eldest son the two youngest would be left without any provision and consequently must be dependants on their brother by his dying intestatein vain they pleaded that taking so necessary a precaution for preserving the future peace of his family would no way hasten his death but on the contrary render the fatal hour whenever it should arrive less dreadful he had only either answered not at all or replied in such a fashion as could give them no room to hope for his compliance  in this unhappy disposition did he continue between two and three years but as his latter days came on he grew much more calm and resigned reason began to recover its former dominion over him and when every one had left off all importunities on the account of his making a will he of himself mentioned the necessity of it and ordered a lawyer to be sent for to that end  having settled all his affairs relating to this world in the most prudent manner he began to prepare for another with a zeal which shewed that whatever notions people may have in health concerning futurity they become more convinced in proportion as they grow nearer their dissolution  he finished his course in the sixtythird or what is called the grand climacteric year of lifehad the blessing to retain the use of all his senses to the last and as death had long before assailed though not totally vanquished him he was too much decayed by continual wastings to feel any of those pangs which persons who die in their full vigour must unavoidably go through when the vital springs burst at once  he took leave of his dear wife and children with great serenity and composure of mind and afterwards turned himself from them and passed into eternity as if falling into a gentle slumber  thus have i attempted to trace nature in all her mazy windings and shew lifes progress thro the passions from the cradle to the gravethe various adventures which happened to natura i thought afforded a more ample field than those of any one man i ever heard or read of and flatter myself that the reader will find many instances that may contribute to rectify his own conduct by pointing out those things which ought to be avoided or at least most carefully guarded against and those which are worthy to be improved and imitated    finis
