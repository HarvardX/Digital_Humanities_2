the prodigal a dramatic piece as performed at the theater royal in the haymarket december    to wake the soul by tender strokes of art to raise the genius and to mend the heart to make mankind in conscious virtue bold live over each scene and be what they behold for this the tragic muse first trod the stage commanding tears to stream through every age popes prologue to addisons cato london printed for t arrowsmith middlerow holborn and sold by b crosby stationers court        price one shilling  advertisement the dinnerhour of persons of fashion having almost jostled the supperhour of our ancestors out of its place the first act of a play is either very thinly attended or considerably interrupted by the clattering of boxdoors and seats while the house is filling for which reason it has been thought necessary of late years at the haymarket theater to perform a short piece previous to that which is meant as the principal attraction those already upon the acting list having been some time in use mr colman then junior desired me to point out such as might occur suitable to the purpose i mentioned the fatal extravagance written by joseph mitchell  vide biographia dramatica      v ii p     which on looking over it he was pleased to approve of excepting that he thought the catastrophe too tragic for a petitepiece i therefore made such alterations in it as he conceived to be wanting in doing which i availed myself of his very judicious advice and adopted several energetick expressions dropped during the rehearsals from his mouth  pen  the concluding lines hence may the gamester learn ere yet too late etc are entirely mr colmans  i wish i could particularize every word suggested by him for though i have not as ben jonson to our loss tooscrupulously did as it is supposed by shakspeare rather chosen to put weaker and no doubt less pleasing of mine own yet would i not defraud so happy a genius of his right by my lothed usurpation see jonsons address to the readers prefixed to the  to edit of his sejanus   0   the piece as altered and called the prodigal has been excellently performed twelve times at mr colmans theater with distinguished approbation some of the passages now printed were omitted in the reprefentation but what would have been thought tedious and heavy on the stage it is hoped will not be found so in the closet  october        f g

scene a saloon enter louisa and courtney louisa twas kind this speed of your return  but tell me what success had you was my father moved methinks i read your news in your sad visage and my heart trembles with prophetic fears  courtney twas as i judged t would be  his own wants press him he sinks beneath your husbands wasteful life those boundless dicings and voluptuous riots which have at once dissolved a wealth so vast that pity scarce vouchsafes to heed his sufferings  louisa but his late conduct proves my bellmour changed misfortunes have instructed him to think and thought has captived every madding passion  courtney yet early vice by custom long indulged leaves such impression of habitual ill as finds no cure but from severe remorse and times slow working  louisa nay name not bellmours vice  he has no vice  his every power is lost even had he taste for follies  poor and despised the slaves for whose cursed sakes he stands reproached now shun his converse villains who betrayed start when they meet him poverty like his spreads a contagion round it and mankind fly frighted from him what will become of us did you lay open our incumbent ruin urged you my father strongly wants cold hand creeps over us and it is now no time for counsel  courtney i told him all and moved his utmost pity still as he set to view your husbands failings i urged his virtues and bore down the balance i praised his wit his courage his humanity his fine frank spirit and his generous nature he answered and i firmly think with truth what he has done already weighs him down his struggling will to save you has undone him and bellmours self would there beg aid in vain  louisa o he was never born to be a beggar heaven is too kind to goodness to forsake him he whom soft pity melts at others misery deserves himself to live exempt from woe bellmour could never behold a stranger wretched but he partook his pain till he could ease it how then will he support the weeping anguish of three poor children all undone by him  courtney his good and ill so chequer out his nature that which excels is doubtful nobly willed his pitying heart flows out in generous purposes but wanting power to stem the tide of pleasure irresolute he drives and floats to ruin men must be rigid and severe in virtue serious and noble aims distinguish reason to live for luxury is not to live the man of pleasure dreams away his days and dies to be forgotten bellmours soul had contemplation bent it to a bias had given a point to fames proud pinnacle and purpled over his name with deathless glory now it lies lost in dust  contemned despised  louisa oh i shall tremble to behold his face  his ruined family hangs on his heart his helpless childrens future fate distracts him for the oncelively bellmour smiles no more silent he walks or stands with folded arms and still looks down as if his soul were earth if ever by chance his lifted eyes meet mine the starting tears glare dreadfully upon me and quivering struggle to flow loose in sorrow then sighs suppressed by force strive hard for vent and heave and swell like earthquakes in his bosom groaning at length he breaks in whirlwind from me torn by ten thousand pangs raves reddens starts and frights me with a dreadful burst of passions  courtney poor suffering innocent i would twere mine to screen you from the storm that is gathering round but i unblessed with power can only wish and hope some chance will save you from destruction  louisa o uncle what remains for hope to snatch at of all the wide estate that late was ours but this poor house is left us  this too totters soon ruin with his palsied hand will seize this ancient pile and shake it into dust not thrice the worth of all that now is ours will save poor woodly from that fatal bond he signed to save my bellmour  all our hope was in your friendly journey to my father woodly must sink and bellmour cannot bear it bellmour will never live to sink a

bellmour i pray forgive me imprisoned in thought i could not look about me and my soul missed thy comfort  i was confidering   louisa what sad reflection held you  bellmour which of my boys some few years hence when i am dissolved in death will act the beggar best  run barefoot fastest and with most dexterous shrug play tricks for charity  louisa o for heavens sake forbear by starts like this to image horrors nature shrinks at thought of  bellmour why my louisa it is a wretchs duty to learn to bear his misery  to know it to use ourselves to scorn it is the way to make it easy to us  yet i am to blame thou had no share in any guilt of mine i ought alone to suffer  twas too cruel twas even unmanly to afflict thy innocence  courtney oh sir you sooth the grief you should resist mean spirits only buckle under woe it is the great mans pride to combat fortune and rise against oppression  bellmour sir it is true  and i remember you have often advised it while i had power to try my virtues proof a man may die unhelpd but must not hope to conquer without arms  talking of help will your good brother aid me  speaking silence how could i hope it from him  courtney yet despair not a time may come when even your woes shall prove to suffer wells the noblest way to conquest on a smooth sea the sailor shows no skill but he displays it all in hurricanes  bellmour he would not sure neglect to save his daughter had he the power still left him yet friends sometimes are more than fathers  i had a friend in woodly once he was happy  what he shall be hereafter he owes to thriftless bellmour perish the name to what a stinging death is he reserved who leaves a good man wretched whom he made so sir it would ease me of a galling pain would you dispel this unavailing hope i cherished late relying on my father from woodlys breast  twere sin to nourish it since it is unstable  he must know it soon let it be told by any tongue but bellmours  courtney i will visit him this instant  do you meanwhile to louisa calmly seek comfort from a firm belief that heaven befriends your virtues and will save you exit bellmour louisa with violent emotion louisa alas what mean you to distract me thus with your wild startings  bellmour nay but mark me well  wants the damnation of a living sinner what have i lived for if i die a beggar how excellent art thou not to have scorned me good heaven that reason should give madness way till man finds music in a rattling dicebox and has contracted thrice three thousand acres to the cursed compass of a narrow table with what a thoughtless rapture have i shook em hung over the throw and hurled out my posterity slaves thieves or beggars  tear me limb from limb some pitying torturer to die at once were comfort even in agony  but i shall be whole ages after death in dying  villains dull pityless insulting purseproud villains will point at some poor ragged child of mine and say  there is pride and name there is bellmours honor   there is the blessed remnant of a boasted family  curse the keen thought it pours all hell upon me  louisa still will thou thus snatch at despairs wild shadows i have heard the manly soul can smile at anguish womans weak mind may bend beneath adversity but bellmours brow methinks should wear a majesty and make affliction awful  bellmour away with counsel i cannot hear thee thy moving air thy wisdom that lovely softness which bewitches round thee each charm which has a thousand times appeased me now makes me mad like oil poured out on flame i tower in blaze and burn with tenfold fierceness thy every word is death each look thou givst me shoots poisoned arrows through my bleeding conscience think thou i am so mean so lost a wretch that my own misery stings me cruel woman what earthly ill can bellmour stoop to fear which hurts but bellmour it is true indeed thy fate i have not learned to bear  there grief unmans me thine and thy helpless infants woes rise to me  oh i have wronged thee  louisa it is wronging me to say it  reenter courtney bellmour returned so soon  louisa why look you pale good uncle  courtney to bring unwelcome tidings to the wretched gives the sad teller half the hearers woe  bellmour friendly preparative what follows next can be but woodlys ruin  courtney he is undone   louisa unhappy bellmour  courtney near your house i met him hemmed by a swarthy guard of licensed villains the laws grim bloodhounds with rapacious talons who dragged him on in merciless serenity to shut him from his hopes in joyless prison  bellmour oh  courtney at short distance near the sycamore that marks the turning to that nowfalln house of this poor gentleman i saw his wife wild with a storm of grief her babes amazed struggling with weeping servants to break free fain would she follow him to share his prison with straining eyes she kept him long in view and when a gushing flood obscured her sight still more to lengthen out a last sad look she wiped away the tears and gazed again  louisa dreadful description  close it here good uncle it cuts too deep and wounds my bellmours soul  courtney yet more remains to tell his spacious house is filled with ruffians his rich goods torn down his frantic wife and children roam unshelterd without a home to succor them  louisa o guide them hither let me with open arms fly to receive them  and strive if possible to give them comfort  bellmour louisa  as thou would preserve my life bring not their grief too near me  to see it would distract me  said he nothing  courtney marking me as i turned my face aside he called and counseled you to save yourself by sudden flight since other russians brought by bargrave your malicious creditor will presently be here on the same purpose as for my fate said he bid him not mourn it to fall for bellmour would have given me joy had bellmours self not fallen  bellmour he falls indeed  courtney now as i entered bargrave just arrived with his infernal crew besets your gates  louisa now bellmour thou art lost  immediate ruin will swallow thee and me and our dear children all all must sink together  teach us good uncle which way to fly what measures to pursue  courtney the doors fast barred are guarded by your servants and you may through the grove escape unseen  bellmour no let him enter this bargrave taught me vice and counseled each excess that has undone me he wrongs the devil who makes himself the punisher of ills which he excited justice acts wisely oh she is not blind  she chooses a fit moment and throws him on my vengeance let him enter perdition seize me if he scape my hand  louisa as thou love me bellmour be not rash should thou add murder   courtney persuade him rather sooth him to pity would he free your friend and grant some weeks of liberty for trial what succor may be found you have many friends   bellmour no courtney friendship rises but with fortune and sets when men go downward yet i thank you rage had obscured my reason say to bargrave i have an offer for his private ear i will instruct my swelling indignation to cool and settle like a courtiers passions what cannot interest teach us  courtney though i loath as the dark adder this detested wretch i will try to speak him fair exit bellmour leave me louisa i would not have thee wound thy innocent eyes with fight of such a monster  nor brook i well that thou who have been taught to love sincerity should hear me flatter infamy  louisa do but think it is for their sakes whom most you wish to succor and you will find it easy farewell he comes my bellmour as thou love me oh be careful exit enter bargrave bargrave so sir i find you make your house your garrison bold sourfaced sentinels admit with caution whom you vouchsafe your pass to  it is great indeed girt sovereignlike within your palace walls the laws must beg admission but the pride with which your state oerlookd me will instruct me till i find means to reach you   bellmour i sent not for you thus to revive old hatred twas my meaning to set before your eyes the spreading misery from which a weeks short respite may perhaps free woodly and myself nor do you wrong  bargrave oh sir  no doubt it is likely that seven days will pay a bond which twice seven months and more have drawn no interest for  woodly may claim some little pity  he is a suffering tool who fasts to feed your riots but for you no plea bears influence what a mass of wealth loaded your youth the toil of careful ancestors and how it is consumed let thousands tell whose lifted eyes and hands proclaim their wonder i dare not whisper it  men would think me mad and laugh to hear that the onceliberal bellmour is grown a niggard now and like a miser whines for a day of grace  and cries twill ruin him to pay his creditors  bellmour insulting wretch it grates my inmost soul to suffer this but my friends fate depends on it aside you seemed to speak as if you pitied woodly  give him liberty and let me fill the place to which you have sent him i ask no more  for my own miseries perhaps they merit not  i am sure they scorn what pity thou can give them  bargrave pity to thee who not content to ruin thus thyself have beggared all whom blood or foolish friendship attracted to thy vortex of destruction so ends our talk  i will hear no more sir  bellmour nay then off mean hypocrisy i will make thee hear me in words which match thy malice  think low traitor from whom i learned that guilt with which but now thy tongue reproached me who but the villain bargrave  bargrave ha villain said you   offering to draw bellmour yes the villain bargrave  touch not thy sword  should thou unsheath it here thy guardian devil too weak to save his minister should rise in vain between us  bargrave i will hear thee out   bellmour who but thyself spread all those snares about me which first entangled then oerthrew my virtue who stained the native whiteness of my soul and spotted it with follies  think how the bond most fraudulently and by shameful arts was from my clouded reason won when fumes of maddening wine had warmed my yielding fancy fit for a knaves impression  have thou humanity and do not feel a ruin thou have caused have thou reflection  and can thou sleep unstung or have the siends that haunt thy gloomy bosom encased thy heart with steel seared up thy conscience and left all devil within thee   bargrave now take breath and hear me tell the effect of this fine preaching i find myself with all these black endowments your master and your scourge  but that i scorn thee i could be angry  mark this silent witness look on this bond and curse the woeful hour that gave thy friend and thee to my disposal while i seek vengeance not from words but action  attempts to go out bellmour by action did thou say i thank thee bargrave thou have instructed me  that fatal bond shall never rise in judgment against woodly drawing his sword and putting himself before the door  bargrave hastily putting up the bond to defend himself drops it unperceived just heaven that hates oppression points a way to ease my wretchedness of half it is load by cutting through that chain that binds my friend now if thou dare defend thy villainies unsheathe thy sword and to this guarded door force thy wished passage through the breast of bellmour  they fight and bargrave falls enter courtney and louisa courtney what have you done i feared this rash effect of rage but half suppressed  louisa was this my bellmour speak was this the way to ease our wretchedness  oh this black chance sinks us still deeper cuts us off from comfort and we can never now be happy more  bellmour courtney  twere vain to wish this act undone takes up the bond secret and sudden like his guardian angel let me entreat thee to convey this parchment into my woodlys hand  say how it happened tell him whatever fate may do with me i am blessed to give him freedom  courtny collect yourself  guard the doors well  there is danger near i will not leave you long   exit louisa hence bellmour fly one hours delay prevents escape for ever  bllmour what would thou have me do  louisa let me disguise thee  then through the grove haste and in some poor cottage entreat a short concealment there i will find thee and well consult relief from all our woes  bllmour fixed as my fate i stand unmoved to expect it seek thy own safety i will not stir by heaven  louisa think how my peace of mind my hope my misery depend on thine  thus on my knees i urge it thou being free may find a thousand ways to succor us but if thou fallst a family  a lost a friendless family falls with thee oh if i ever were beloved by bellmour if all my prayers my vows my tears can move him let him but grant me this  let him but leave me rain then a world of woes upon my head let want reproach contempt and all lifes agonies in ceaseless bitterness of soul afflict me while thou art safe if i but heave one sigh one breath of discontent escape my lips curse me thyself and make me lost indeed  bellmour excellent woman  rise  to see thee thus is torture beyond bearing  louisa i will not leave thee  here at thy feet thus humbled as that dust which i shall shortly be when i have lost thee here will i grow for ever till thou grantst this only prayer i make thee  bellmour thou bidst me fly what would thou i should fly from  louisa danger and misery  bellmour with whom then must i leave that misery must not thyself and those three friendless wretches whose being i was cause of and who expect aid and protection from a parents hand while i escape must you not all be left hell glows in that hot thought be left exposed to all the miseries which thou would have me fly like a coward from and leave for innocents who owe em to my baseness no louisa  louisa rising lost lost for ever  bellmour no there is a judge on high who sees thy goodness and will sure preserve thee come what fate lists to me  but loved louisa give now my sorrows way a solitary thought will teach me to resolve for life or wished for death  exit louisa angels assist inspire thy silent reasonings and from this labyrinth of woes conduct thee dreadful our prospect  yet all may be well heaven cannot err  often guides us in the dark  and when we least expect affords relief  exit end of act the first act ii scene a gallery enter bellmour pensive bellmour why should i pause nothing can be a crime which puts a stop to evil a thousand men may have been poor as i  and yet lived happy miseries we make ourselves are borne with ease but he who beggars his posterity begets a race to curse him  every scorn which wrings the soul of any future bellmour whom want shall pinch the bones of ages hence will mark with shame my unforgotten grave and reach my guilty soul where ever it wanders if to give misery to those to whom we once gave life is an inhuman crime how can it be a sin to take life back and put an end to undeserved woe oh  did i feel no misery but my own how easy were it for this sword to free me from all that anguish which embitters life but when the grave has given my sorrows rest where shall my wife and tender babes find comfort not all the virtues of louisas mind nor even my pretty prattlers innocence will shield them from unpitying wants bleak storm better a thousand times to lead them with me unto the peaceful mansion of cold dea it shall be done  but how that asks some thought  from those dear destined breasts the pointed steel must draw no blood to stain my blushing hand lest my soul start and that seem cruelty which i would fain think pity  loud knocking without  hark time presses what if i use the unwounding aid of poison i have at hand a sovereign remedy for all diseases want and woe can plague with twill blunt the edge of death and in sweet slumber swim soft and shadowy over the misty eyeball  enter louisa louisa will you forgive me if officious love that anxious pain i feel till you are safe obtrude my zeal perhaps a few short moments before you would have wished to be disturbed yon villains grow impatient for admission and scarce your servants guard the gates against them storms of bold oaths and horrid imprecations mixed with loud thunderings and the threats of law make my heart tremble and have forced me hither forced me to urge you by all ties of love of interest honor hope and future bliss to fly this dangerous roof and save us all  bellmour i thank thy gentle care  it is resolved aside i have bethought me of the means to evade the malice of my fortune  twill be a journey a little longer than thy love could wish it yet not so far but we shall meet again  louisa oh be the distance wide as pole from pole let me but follow thee and i am blessed  bellmour it shall be so louisa  louisa a thousand angels spread their wings over thee and protect thy steps now thou art kind  but the dear little ones shall they go too  bellmour all all shall go  lousia haste then let us begone my bounding heart leaps joyful and i shall smile again  but ah me bellmour they are so young so tender is it possible that they should travel with us  bellmour moving innocence my strong heart bleeds within me at her accents aside a few short steps will lodge us in a place to her of rest and safety  we shall have leisure there to weigh our future hopes and seek fit means to our wished end  courtney will soon return said he not so  louisa he did and well inform him of our new purpose and begin our flight i will make provision such as best befits our haste and our distresses   going bellmour stay louisa those precious cordials i so lately purchased gave i to thee or no  louisa you spoke of such but still forgot to give them to me now they are not worth memory  bellmour nay now most useful their virtue is reported sovereign against the bodys toil or minds disturbance  louisa i would my uncle were returned to counsel us what can so long detain him sure he is safe  bellmour seek him my love whilst i the cordials find now king of terrors to prepare thy banquet aside  exit louisa oh what a world of ruin has one vice detested gaming brought upon us all bellmour so honest tender mild by nature has that propensity made almost wicked stripped of the means to satisfy just claims his harrowd heart starts not at homicide and may destroy himself his babes and me allgracious heaven how will these misries end i dare not hope but thou art allsufficient if more of evil yet oerhang this roof o for my childrens sake just god avert it  exit reenter bellmour bellmour my baleful hand has mixed the deadly draught to give it as a cordial  give it whom start from thy burning orb thou conscious sun and chill thyself to ice at my black purpose am i a parent a protector lover or has this devil that heaves about my heart transformed me to a fiend  he has he has chain him some angel millions of fathoms down heap him with mountains lest he rise again and in a husbands and a fathers breast brew horrid murders  i am myself once more  now let cool reasons undistracted search answer my bleeding soul which dreadful ill may best be borne by nature to leave our friends to grinding sorrow poverty and scorn with sense of his not feeling any pain who gave them all  or to quit life together and wanting power to bless make it some merit not to leave curses to surviving innocence i am mad again reason herself betrays me and whispers that this last is tenderest and murder grows a mercy   reenter louisa louisa found you the cordial your little wanderers are ready dressed to act the pilgrim with us perhaps twill aid their fainting spirits yet untried in hardships haste love and let us be gone  bellmour oh if one moment one short thought longer she oppress me thus with melting innocent talk i shall grow soft yield her to want and live to be a beggar  louisa still you are doubtful   bellmour no i am fixed  oh nature aside i left my closet open  on a table in that gold cup which was thy fathers present on the last birthday of our eldest boy thou wilt find the cordial  i have tried em all and what seemed fittest for the boys and thee waits in that cup thy tasting  louisa courtney stays long  all things are ready and i wish him here now for this boasted cordial   exit bellmour be firm my heart stop thy big beat thaw thaw this curdling blood that through my icy veins creeps cold as death and freezes in its passage  where is louisa but a few moments and she is no more now now the unsuspecting innocent lifts that last cup  now now she tastes a draught that snatches her for ever from my sight and robs me of all comfort never more shall her sweet voice enchant me never more shall her soft eyes look fondly into mine and shine with swimming languor open engulph me and conceal my shame befriending earth  or from thy yawning depth stream up a petrifying blast to blot out memory congeal my blood and fix me here a statue  louisa without my life my bellmour  bellmour ha it is her voice that calls me it sounded not reproachful  louisa without look my bellmour these little strugglers will not quit the cordial but sip it to the bottom  bellmour torturing horror  enter louisa with an empty cup louisa why did not come my bellmour and partake when twice i called you twould have been a scene of pleasure to observe with how much eagerness the little wranglers quarreled for the cup which having drunk of first i brought to them i bid them taste it only and told the prattlers it was their fathers present but that word transported them to lift their pretty hands in love and duty and to drain each drop  bellmour furies tear me   louisa have i done aught amiss did you not give permission they should taste it ere they began the journey  bellmour alas louisa a long long journey is indeed begun but endless as eternity  thyself and those dear infants are  poisoned by that cordial  louisa poisoned by thee thou say it but to try me if twere thy wish that i should die thy love at least thy pity would have given some warning death is a dreadful journey and requires much length of preparation  bellmour by those charms which i no more must gaze on and be blessed thou can not live an hour  a last long sleep will steal in cold advances over thy beauties and those two beamy suns whose rays dart through me shall set in endless night  even while we talk the eternal shade will rise at once between us and sever us for ever  louisa dreadful contraction of that short span which at its longest stretch was much too narrow to allow me scope to speak or look or think my love for thee what shall i say a thousand tender thoughts struggle at once for vent  i cannot speak  death is too hasty  i have yet undone unspoke unthought a thousand weighty things o heaven my little ones  let me fly to them have i so short a time to gaze upon them yet never must see them more i cannot leave thee what shall i do  o bring my children hither fly with them to my arms  dear dying innocents o bellmour bellmour why has this been done  bllmour that we might baffle woe here die together and leave no beggars of our race behind us see my louisa i have a saithful guide draws a dagger that will not let me lose thee attempts to stab himself enter courtney courtney hold thy rash hand wresting the dagger from him nor to thy other crimes add suicide he thou thought slain by thy revengeful arm accursed bargrave is borne hence alive but slightly wounded though awhile he seemed through craft or cowardice bereft of life  bellmour has that dire villain scapd and shall my wife and tender innocents o god be made a sacrifice for all my load of guilt  courtney nor are your wife and childen sacrificed the hand of heaven however from mortal eyes obscured in clouds it seems severe is merciful not thy three children and thy wife are fallen nor shall even thou whose meditated crimes deserve a signal vengeance now be punished  louisa what mean you sir  bellmour thou little know alas the certain means i used for their destruction  courtney then trembling mark the mazy paths of providence fearing from late events some dire mishap i traced your footsteps as you sadly ranged the lonely gallery spied a latefilld cup of deadly poison known by the vessel left which had contained it mingled with a rich draught for present use i took it secret thence refilld the cup with cordials that remained without the baneful mixture stood concealed to view what then might hap louisa came and snatched it thence i followed her unmarked oerjoyd to have been the means to intercept her and her childrens death  louisa merciful heaven  louisa and bellmour kneel in adoration of and gratitude to heaven then embrace their uncle and each other bellmour angels surround thee with unceasing vigilance to courtney and for this friendship ward off every evil oh i have erred but henceforth i am changed  courtney now hear the rest and heaven pronounce thee worthy often by a young kinsman landed from a ship that left her consort scarce a day behind woodly has heard though mournful happy news your absent brother many years thought dead returning rich from the remotest east died but in sight of land and has bequeathed his whole heaped wealth to thee  bellmour allgracious providence most humbly i adore thee and will trust implicitly to thy unerring wisdom thou best can clear thy mystic dispensations and make confusion end in beauteous order hence may the gamester learn ere yet too late to shun that vice which endless ills await wild as the sea his maddening passions flow  himself wife children beggared at a throw oh should a father or a husband come whom dice have lured from happiness and home to listen to our tale our hope is here to check one gamester in his mad career  the end
