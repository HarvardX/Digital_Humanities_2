d foes answer to the quakers catechism or a dark lanthorn for a friend of the light  to the reader a quaker with his dark lanthorn light is here exposed to your sight stripped offs nice vizard and fair paint wherein he used to ape a saint so false fires may delude our eyes and seem like stars to guild the skies till reason proves they owe their birth to stinking vapors of the earth this hypocrite we here essay ins proper colors to display whose yea and nay in mischief goes beyond the hectors damning oaths a playhouse beau is not so gay as now a days the yea and nay whose wigg in curles with powder dressed makes him as wicked as the rest and seems to act so very oddly you would swear he is fallen from the godly for when he looks the most precise he tells you damned confounded lies d foe etc    london printed in the year   0   d foes answer to the quakers catechism etc a quaker is a hogshead of phanaticisme drawn off to the lees a commonshore of heresy into which most extravagant opinions at last disembogue themselves and center the fagend of reformation marked with a sullen meagrelook and this characteristick thou a fox in a lambskin coat that retains his subtlety though not his color a doughbaked piece of formality that decries superstition yet idolizes garbs and phrases you may know him by his diminitiveband that looks like the folornehope of his shirt crawling out at his collar for his purity consists only in his dress and his religion is not to speak like his neighbors his orignal is as obscure as the head of nile some refer it to behmen the caning philosophaster of germany others run his pedigree higher and say he was hatched when the degraded seraphm first took on him to counterfeit an angel of light he is a mere composition of contradiction and clownishnessana with a sew odd scruples of hypocrisy to give it a tincture should the parliament make a law for eating he would starve rather then be guilty of obeying it and if you would have him do a thing you need only forbid it on pain of death he thinks that to be religious one is obliged to be uncivil and flings his wits over board to make room for inspirations his dreams he intitles visions and each crapicio of his fancy must pass for a divine revelation to which he blasphemously puts a probatum est the mouth of the lord has spoken it the first article of this creed is to keep his hat on which he observes so religiously as if he thought vailing bonnet to be the sin against the holy ghost titles of honor he takes for infallible marks of the beast and believes the master of the ceremonies to be antichrist he would have done rarely in the old chaos before nature had anked ihings in their places being a professed enemy to all order that thinks there is no pure walking unless it be with the heels upwards he bears a grudge against paul for saying most noble festus and hates the memory of sarah because she called her husband lord his discourses are nothing but a rhapsody of often repeated nonsense and when he has darkened your understanding with a cloud of infignificant babble he crys ah friends mind the light he usually begins with raving like mahomet in his fallingfit or the devil of delphoses priests that never delivered their lying oracles but with extravagant gestures and odd distortions of body swear not at all is his motto but lies he holds in many cases venial and in to meritorious when they make for the interest of the beloved seed or reflect scandal on the government he cheats worse then a longlane broaker by pretending to deal at a word and the hook whereby he draws in his customers is a farfetcht sigh and plainly i tell thee friend  this troublesome insect for all his demure looks is deservedly suspected to be part of the vermin dropped from the beast a puppet of religion contrived to amuse the rabble that receives it is motion from his holynesses invisible hand behind the curtain for though the jesuit and he seem enemies at long run like east and west they prove the same equivocations being as common with them both as curses to a gamester ask our trembling saint if he believe the resurrection of the dead he shall answer yea but tell you another time he meant only an arising from sin by heaven and hell he intends no more but several scenes transacted within us and abuses holy scripture into a mystical romance each of them averrs perfection attainable in this life but herein they differ the papist acknowledges but one pope in the world the quaker sets up a pope in every individual breast to whom all scripture and reason must truckle so that refusing the polestar of gods word and the churches compass he will needs steer by the wandering motion of a treacherous ignus fatuus within subject to be blown any way and often extinguished by the hurricanes of passion  he makes self the center whereunto the lines of all his actions tend and like a hedgehog wrapped up in his own warm down turn out brisles to all the world besides you can come on no side of him but he pricks and bites and all his craggy and inhospitable he that deals with him has need of more eyes then poets bestow on argus for he outvies a genoes for subtlety and a jew may come to be an apprentice with him he loves the exchange though he hates the church and admires no preaching so much as foxes  for all his peaceable sheepish countenance he delights in contention and when he is thouing a court of justice thinks himself in his proper element he bawls like an oysterwife at other folks pride and evidences his own humility only in defying the pedlars pack lace ribbons etc whilst he sawcily contemns his superiors and prefers the crotchets of his own giddy brain before the decrees of a general council he hates no whore so much as her of babylon and ever and anon greatifies the old man with a kind greenaprond friend whom he picks up at a conventicle by a teacherous touch of the hand under pretense of a pure salutation and finding by her rampant pulse and tempting turning up the whites which she pretends to do in devotion that her desires are at flood they retire together for mutual edification he is often drunk but not like his neighbors temporally for sleep cannot cure him but the fumes of his spiritual pride having intoxicated his head makes his very soul reel and but his body into a fit of shivering ye will he not privately in the company of friends refuse the refreshing bottle provided it be not known in gath nor published amongst the wicked of askalon for he confesses the use of the creature especially when it comes on freecost to be exceeding lawful he is very curious to be in all things contrary to the common mode that he may be taken notice of for a singular man and having screwed his face into a religious frame and turned his voice to a puling sanctimonious key he uses it as a lowbell to catch larks or rather such owls as will be bubbled out of their money merely on the repute of his conscientions dealing he abominates our churches and says very well that god must be worshipped every where in spirit yet will rather be knocked of the head theu forsake bull and mouth here it is that he glories in tribulations  in brief a quaker is a cynick in religion one that would have illnature translated grace as if the holy spirit that pure sweet gentle dove did inspire men with sullen humors and waspish disposition he hates both magistracy and ministry and never speaks well of authority or obedience but when he is going to lash his maid or his apprentices for though himself have shaken off all subjection to superious yet to his domestics he is worse then an egyptian taskmaster and speaks to his servants in a tone as imperious as the grand seigniour to his mutes he cannot endure ceremonies or complements especially where his belly is concerned and therefore falls to all meat as gallants do to a wench or oysters without saying grace he is very diligent in his generationwork and may therefore have many children but no heirs for his issue comes into the world outlawed and can no more boast to be born in lawful wedlock then the kinchencove of a gypsy got under a hedge by a strauling tinker he bannes the banes and i this respect only refuses license consummating his marriage before it is solemnized for so soon as the spirit begins to yield to the rebellion of the flesh and his bowels yearn to be multiplying he and his willing doxy never wait the parsons leisure but take each others word and so to bed  the devil that furnishes others with his tare but by retail deals with the quaker by whole sale so many heresies club to his generation that it is impossible to say which he resembles most sure satan had a fancy to present the world with an oglio and therefore here has rendevouzed all his hell bred errors in epitomie and set down a catalogue of them in shorthand  by his obstinate zeal to keep his noddle covered you may guess him a mahumetan that resents nothing so dishonorable as a bare head and indeed he has no more christinaity in him than a turk his good friday looks speak him a superstitious anchorite his subtlety and equivocations would become a jesuit he names his children with as little ceremony as other folks do their whelps and so far kees pace with the anabaptist but of a sudden he outstrips them and falls in with the seekers to deny all ordinances from socinus he steals arguments against the blessed trinity and learns to disown all government from john of leyden at first he was much against the carnalweapon but now begins to be reconciled to fighting and if you anger him will rather venture a rubbers at fity cuffs then turn the other cheek to the smiter he has of ate so far fallen from his first pretense of humillity that he out strips handsome fielding or any playhouse bully for wig and vanity  it is a prudent maxim in the art military never o think too contemptibly of an enemy our grandfathers saw that scotchmist presbytery rising to bigger then a mans hand and yet how dismally did it in few years overspread our whole horison  consider but this quaking gang in it is true dimensions and the arts they have to promote their designs and they will appear more formidable then most of the other eactions  for first they are a people generally subtle frugal industrious and wary in their dealing by which and their large pretensions to a punctual honesty they have engrossed a grand part of the nations trade  secondly whereas other persuasions are divided into distinct congregations and so have several particular teachers who frequently broaching different whimseys mince them into subdivisions whilst some dare not hear such an one and others scruple to communicate with such a one though all of a party  the quakers on the contrary though o two of them scarce agree in all things do yet generally throughout england keep themselves up n one entire body glewed together with a strict unity as to affection and correspondence as is vident by their weekly collections in every couny continually sent up to london where their common stock cannot but in so many years as they have maintained it be very vast to which add the exact account and registry they every where keep of all their births and burials which are likewise duly transmitted up so that in an instant they are able to give a near estimate of their number and strength in all the three nations these and some other importants being duly weighed render this shivering sect not so in considerable as the common rabble deluded with their specious pretenses are apt to think them it is a good caution of a minor poet  as white powder discharges without noise so may saintseeming hypocrites destroys trust not too far the soft hand sometimes smites and larks are birds of prey as well as kites to conclude a quaker is a canting thing that cozens the world by the purity of his clothes a few closestool faces and whineing expressions his life is only a real lie his doctrine contrary to all sober religon and withal so troublesome that i am grown quite weary of drawing his character and cannot but wish him and all his tribe fairly embarked for terra incognita of the late found isle of pines under the conduct of penn their high admiral  finis
